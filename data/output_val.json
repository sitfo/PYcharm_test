Since\nit is always fought in the open air, the combatants are nearly sure\nto catch cold. M. Paul de Cassagnac, the most inveterate of the French\nduelists, had suffered so often in this way that he is at last a\nconfirmed invalid; and the best physician in Paris has expressed\nthe opinion that if he goes on dueling for fifteen or twenty years\nmore--unless he forms the habit of fighting in a comfortable room where\ndamps and draughts cannot intrude--he will eventually endanger his life.\nThis ought to moderate the talk of those people who are so stubborn\nin maintaining that the French duel is the most health-giving of\nrecreations because of the open-air exercise it affords. And it\nought also to moderate that foolish talk about French duelists and\nsocialist-hated monarchs being the only people who are immoral.\n\nBut it is time to get at my subject. As soon as I heard of the late\nfiery outbreak between M. Gambetta and M. Fourtou in the French\nAssembly, I knew that trouble must follow. I knew it because a long\npersonal friendship with M. Gambetta revealed to me the desperate and\nimplacable nature of the man. Vast as are his physical proportions,\nI knew that the thirst for revenge would penetrate to the remotest\nfrontiers of his person.\n\nI did not wait for him to call on me, but went at once to him. As I had\nexpected, I found the brave fellow steeped in a profound French calm.\nI say French calm, because French calmness and English calmness have\npoints of difference.\n\n\n\nHe was moving swiftly back and forth among the debris of his furniture,\nnow and then staving chance fragments of it across the room with his\nfoot; grinding a constant grist of curses through his set teeth; and\nhalting every little while to deposit another handful of his hair on the\npile which he had been building of it on the table.\n\nHe threw his arms around my neck, bent me over his stomach to his\nbreast, kissed me on both cheeks, hugged me four or five times, and\nthen placed me in his own arm-chair. As soon as I had got well again, we\nbegan business at once.\n\nI said I supposed he would wish me to act as his second, and he said,\n\"Of course.\" I said I must be allowed to act under a French name, so\nthat I might be shielded from obloquy in my country, in case of fatal\nresults. He winced here, probably at the suggestion that dueling was not\nregarded with respect in America. However, he agreed to my requirement.\nThis accounts for the fact that in all the newspaper reports M.\nGambetta's second was apparently a Frenchman.\n\n\n\nFirst, we drew up my principal's will. I insisted upon this, and stuck\nto my point. I said I had never heard of a man in his right mind going\nout to fight a duel without first making his will. He said he had never\nheard of a man in his right mind doing anything of the kind. When he had\nfinished the will, he wished to proceed to a choice of his \"last words.\"\nHe wanted to know how the following words, as a dying exclamation,\nstruck me:\n\n\"I die for my God, for my country, for freedom of speech, for progress,\nand the universal brotherhood of man!\"\n\nI objected that this would require too lingering a death; it was a good\nspeech for a consumptive, but not suited to the exigencies of the field\nof honor. We wrangled over a good many ante-mortem outbursts, but I\nfinally got him to cut his obituary down to this, which he copied into\nhis memorandum-book, purposing to get it by heart:\n\n\"I DIE THAT FRANCE MIGHT LIVE.\"\n\nI said that this remark seemed to lack relevancy; but he said relevancy\nwas a matter of no consequence in last words, what you wanted was\nthrill.\n\nThe next thing in order was the choice of weapons. My principal said he\nwas not feeling well, and would leave that and the other details of the\nproposed meeting to me. Therefore I wrote the following note and carried\nit to M. Fourtou's friend:\n\nSir: M. Gambetta accepts M. Fourtou's challenge, and authorizes me to\npropose Plessis-Piquet as the place of meeting; tomorrow morning at\ndaybreak as the time; and axes as the weapons.\n\nI am, sir, with great respect,\n\nMark Twain.\n\nM. Fourtou's friend read this note, and shuddered. Then he turned to me,\nand said, with a suggestion of severity in his tone:\n\n\"Have you considered, sir, what would be the inevitable result of such a\nmeeting as this?\"\n\n\"Well, for instance, what WOULD it be?\"\n\n\"Bloodshed!\"\n\n\"That's about the size of it,\" I said. \"Now, if it is a fair question,\nwhat was your side proposing to shed?\"\n\nI had him there. He saw he had made a blunder, so he hastened to explain\nit away. He said he had spoken jestingly. Then he added that he and his\nprincipal would enjoy axes, and indeed prefer them, but such weapons\nwere barred by the French code, and so I must change my proposal.\n\nI walked the floor, turning the thing over in my mind, and finally it\noccurred to me that Gatling-guns at fifteen paces would be a likely way\nto get a verdict on the field of honor. So I framed this idea into a\nproposition.\n\nBut it was not accepted. The code was in the way again. I proposed\nrifles; then double-barreled shotguns; then Colt's navy revolvers. These\nbeing all rejected, I reflected awhile, and sarcastically suggested\nbrickbats at three-quarters of a mile. I always hate to fool away a\nhumorous thing on a person who has no perception of humor; and it filled\nme with bitterness when this man went soberly away to submit the last\nproposition to his principal.\n\nHe came back presently and said his principal was charmed with the idea\nof brickbats at three-quarters of a mile, but must decline on account of\nthe danger to disinterested parties passing between them. Then I said:\n\n\"Well, I am at the end of my string, now. Perhaps YOU would be good\nenough to suggest a weapon? Perhaps you have even had one in your mind\nall the time?\"\n\nHis countenance brightened, and he said with alacrity:\n\n\"Oh, without doubt, monsieur!\"\n\n\n\nSo he fell to hunting in his pockets--pocket after pocket, and he had\nplenty of them--muttering all the while, \"Now, what could I have done\nwith them?\"\n\nAt last he was successful. He fished out of his vest pocket a couple\nof little things which I carried to the light and ascertained to be\npistols. They were single-barreled and silver-mounted, and very dainty\nand pretty. I was not able to speak for emotion. I silently hung one of\nthem on my watch-chain, and returned the other. My companion in crime\nnow unrolled a postage-stamp containing several cartridges, and gave me\none of them. I asked if he meant to signify by this that our men were\nto be allowed but one shot apiece. He replied that the French code\npermitted no more. I then begged him to go and suggest a distance, for\nmy mind was growing weak and confused under the strain which had been\nput upon it. He named sixty-five yards. I nearly lost my patience. I\nsaid:\n\n\"Sixty-five yards, with these instruments? Squirt-guns would be deadlier\nat fifty. Consider, my friend, you and I are banded together to destroy\nlife, not make it eternal.\"\n\nBut with all my persuasions, all my arguments, I was only able to\nget him to reduce the distance to thirty-five yards; and even this\nconcession he made with reluctance, and said with a sigh, \"I wash my\nhands of this slaughter; on your head be it.\"\n\nThere was nothing for me but to go home to my old lion-heart and tell my\nhumiliating story. When I entered, M. Gambetta was laying his last lock\nof hair upon the altar. He sprang toward me, exclaiming:\n\n\"You have made the fatal arrangements--I see it in your eye!\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\nHis face paled a trifle, and he leaned upon the table for support. He\nbreathed thick and heavily for a moment or two, so tumultuous were his\nfeelings; then he hoarsely whispered:\n\n\"The weapon, the weapon! Quick! what is the weapon?\"\n\n\"This!\" and I displayed that silver-mounted thing. He cast but one\nglance at it, then swooned ponderously to the floor.\n\n\n\nWhen he came to, he said mournfully:\n\n\"The unnatural calm to which I have subjected myself has told upon my\nnerves. But away with weakness! I will confront my fate like a man and a\nFrenchman.\"\n\nHe rose to his feet, and assumed an attitude which for sublimity has\nnever been approached by man, and has seldom been surpassed by statues.\nThen he said, in his deep bass tones:\n\n\"Behold, I am calm, I am ready; reveal to me the distance.\"\n\n\"Thirty-five yards.\" ...\n\n\n\nI could not lift him up, of course; but I rolled him over, and poured\nwater down his back. He presently came to, and said:\n\n\"Thirty-five yards--without a rest? But why ask? Since murder was that\nman's intention, why should he palter with small details? But mark you\none thing: in my fall the world shall see how the chivalry of France\nmeets death.\"\n\nAfter a long silence he asked:\n\n\"Was nothing said about that man's family standing up with him, as\nan offset to my bulk? But no matter; I would not stoop to make such\na suggestion; if he is not noble enough to suggest it himself, he is\nwelcome to this advantage, which no honorable man would take.\"\n\nHe now sank into a sort of stupor of reflection, which lasted some\nminutes; after which he broke silence with:\n\n\"The hour--what is the hour fixed for the collision?\"\n\n\"Dawn, tomorrow.\"\n\nHe seemed greatly surprised, and immediately said:\n\n\"Insanity! I never heard of such a thing. Nobody is abroad at such an\nhour.\"\n\n\"That is the reason I named it. Do you mean to say you want an\naudience?\"\n\n\"It is no time to bandy words. I am astonished that M. Fourtou should\never have agreed to so strange an innovation. Go at once and require a\nlater hour.\"\n\nI ran downstairs, threw open the front door, and almost plunged into the\narms of M. Fourtou's second. He said:\n\n\"I have the honor to say that my principal strenuously objects to the\nhour chosen, and begs you will consent to change it to half past nine.\"\n\n\"Any courtesy, sir, which it is in our power to extend is at the service\nof your excellent principal. We agree to the proposed change of time.\"\n\n\"I beg you to accept the thanks of my client.\" Then he turned to a\nperson behind him, and said, \"You hear, M. Noir, the hour is altered to\nhalf past nine.\" Whereupon M. Noir bowed, expressed his thanks, and went\naway. My accomplice continued:\n\n\"If agreeable to you, your chief surgeons and ours shall proceed to the\nfield in the same carriage as is customary.\"\n\n\"It is entirely agreeable to me, and I am obliged to you for mentioning\nthe surgeons, for I am afraid I should not have thought of them. How\nmany shall I want? I supposed two or three will be enough?\"\n\n\"Two is the customary number for each party. I refer to 'chief'\nsurgeons; but considering the exalted positions occupied by our clients,\nit will be well and decorous that each of us appoint several consulting\nsurgeons, from among the highest in the profession. These will come in\ntheir own private carriages. Have you engaged a hearse?\"\n\n\n\n\"Bless my stupidity, I never thought of it! I will attend to it right\naway. I must seem very ignorant to you; but you must try to overlook\nthat, because I have never had any experience of such a swell duel as\nthis before. I have had a good deal to do with duels on the Pacific\ncoast, but I see now that they were crude affairs. A hearse--sho! we\nused to leave the elected lying around loose, and let anybody cord\nthem up and cart them off that wanted to. Have you anything further to\nsuggest?\"\n\n\"Nothing, except that the head undertakers shall ride together, as is\nusual. The subordinates and mutes will go on foot, as is also usual. I\nwill see you at eight o'clock in the morning, and we will then arrange\nthe order of the procession. I have the honor to bid you a good day.\"\n\nI returned to my client, who said, \"Very well; at what hour is the\nengagement to begin?\"\n\n\"Half past nine.\"\n\n\"Very good indeed. Have you sent the fact to the newspapers?\"\n\n\"SIR! If after our long and intimate friendship you can for a moment\ndeem me capable of so base a treachery--\"\n\n\"Tut, tut! What words are these, my dear friend? Have I wounded you? Ah,\nforgive me; I am overloading you with labor. Therefore go on with the\nother details, and drop this one from your list. The bloody-minded\nFourtou will be sure to attend to it. Or I myself--yes, to make certain,\nI will drop a note to my journalistic friend, M. Noir--\"\n\n\"Oh, come to think of it, you may save yourself the trouble; that other\nsecond has informed M. Noir.\"\n\n\"H'm! I might have known it. It is just like that Fourtou, who always\nwants to make a display.\"\n\n\n\nAt half past nine in the morning the procession approached the field of\nPlessis-Piquet in the following order: first came our carriage--nobody\nin it but M. Gambetta and myself; then a carriage containing M. Fourtou\nand his second; then a carriage containing two poet-orators who did not\nbelieve in God, and these had MS. funeral orations projecting from their\nbreast pockets; then a carriage containing the head surgeons and their\ncases of instruments; then eight private carriages containing consulting\nsurgeons; then a hack containing a coroner; then the two hearses; then a\ncarriage containing the head undertakers; then a train of assistants\nand mutes on foot; and after these came plodding through the fog a long\nprocession of camp followers, police, and citizens generally. It was a\nnoble turnout, and would have made a fine display if we had had thinner\nweather.\n\nThere was no conversation. I spoke several times to my principal, but\nI judge he was not aware of it, for he always referred to his note-book\nand muttered absently, \"I die that France might live.\"\n\nArrived on the field, my fellow-second and I paced off the thirty-five\nyards, and then drew lots for choice of position. This latter was but\nan ornamental ceremony, for all the choices were alike in such weather.\nThese preliminaries being ended, I went to my principal and asked him\nif he was ready. He spread himself out to his full width, and said in a\nstern voice, \"Ready! Let the batteries be charged.\"\n\nThe loading process was done in the presence of duly constituted\nwitnesses. We considered it best to perform this delicate service with\nthe assistance of a lantern, on account of the state of the weather. We\nnow placed our men.\n\nAt this point the police noticed that the public had massed themselves\ntogether on the right and left of the field; they therefore begged a\ndelay, while they should put these poor people in a place of safety.\n\nThe request was granted.\n\nThe police having ordered the two multitudes to take positions behind\nthe duelists, we were once more ready. The weather growing still more\nopaque, it was agreed between myself and the other second that before\ngiving the fatal signal we should each deliver a loud whoop to enable\nthe combatants to ascertain each other's whereabouts.\n\nI now returned to my principal, and was distressed to observe that he\nhad lost a good deal of his spirit. I tried my best to hearten him. I\nsaid, \"Indeed, sir, things are not as bad as they seem. Considering\nthe character of the weapons, the limited number of shots allowed, the\ngenerous distance, the impenetrable solidity of the fog, and the added\nfact that one of the combatants is one-eyed and the other cross-eyed and\nnear-sighted, it seems to me that this conflict need not necessarily be\nfatal. There are chances that both of you may survive. Therefore, cheer\nup; do not be downhearted.\"\n\nThis speech had so good an effect that my principal immediately\nstretched forth his hand and said, \"I am myself again; give me the\nweapon.\"\n\nI laid it, all lonely and forlorn, in the center of the vast solitude\nof his palm. He gazed at it and shuddered. And still mournfully\ncontemplating it, he murmured in a broken voice:\n\n\"Alas, it is not death I dread, but mutilation.\"\n\nI heartened him once more, and with such success that he presently\nsaid, \"Let the tragedy begin. Stand at my back; do not desert me in this\nsolemn hour, my friend.\"\n\nI gave him my promise. I now assisted him to point his pistol toward the\nspot where I judged his adversary to be standing, and cautioned him to\nlisten well and further guide himself by my fellow-second's whoop.\nThen I propped myself against M. Gambetta's back, and raised a rousing\n\"Whoop-ee!\" This was answered from out the far distances of the fog, and\nI immediately shouted:\n\n\"One--two--three--FIRE!\"\n\nTwo little sounds like SPIT! SPIT! broke upon my ear, and in the same\ninstant I was crushed to the earth under a mountain of flesh. Bruised\nas I was, I was still able to catch a faint accent from above, to this\neffect:\n\n\n\n\"I die for... for ... perdition take it, what IS it I die for? ... oh,\nyes--FRANCE! I die that France may live!\"\n\nThe surgeons swarmed around with their probes in their hands, and\napplied their microscopes to the whole area of M. Gambetta's person,\nwith the happy result of finding nothing in the nature of a wound. Then\na scene ensued which was in every way gratifying and inspiriting.\n\nThe two gladiators fell upon each other's neck, with floods of proud and\nhappy tears; that other second embraced me; the surgeons, the\norators, the undertakers, the police, everybody embraced, everybody\ncongratulated, everybody cried, and the whole atmosphere was filled with\npraise and with joy unspeakable.\n\nIt seems to me then that I would rather be a hero of a French duel than\na crowned and sceptered monarch.\n\n\n\nWhen the commotion had somewhat subsided, the body of surgeons held a\nconsultation, and after a good deal of debate decided that with proper\ncare and nursing there was reason to believe that I would survive my\ninjuries. My internal hurts were deemed the most serious, since it was\napparent that a broken rib had penetrated my left lung, and that many of\nmy organs had been pressed out so far to one side or the other of where\nthey belonged, that it was doubtful if they would ever learn to perform\ntheir functions in such remote and unaccustomed localities. They then\nset my left arm in two places, pulled my right hip into its socket\nagain, and re-elevated my nose. I was an object of great interest,\nand even admiration; and many sincere and warm-hearted persons had\nthemselves introduced to me, and said they were proud to know the only\nman who had been hurt in a French duel in forty years.\n\nI was placed in an ambulance at the very head of the procession;\nand thus with gratifying 'ECLAT I was marched into Paris, the most\nconspicuous figure in that great spectacle, and deposited at the\nhospital.\n\n\n\nThe cross of the Legion of Honor has been conferred upon me. However,\nfew escape that distinction.\n\nSuch is the true version of the most memorable private conflict of the\nage.\n\nI have no complaints to make against any one. I acted for myself, and I\ncan stand the consequences.\n\nWithout boasting, I think I may say I am not afraid to stand before a\nmodern French duelist, but as long as I keep in my right mind I will\nnever consent to stand behind one again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n[What the Beautiful Maiden Said]\n\n\nOne day we took the train and went down to Mannheim to see \"King Lear\"\nplayed in German. It was a mistake. We sat in our seats three whole\nhours and never understood anything but the thunder and lightning; and\neven that was reversed to suit German ideas, for the thunder came first\nand the lightning followed after.\n\nThe behavior of the audience was perfect. There were no rustlings, or\nwhisperings, or other little disturbances; each act was listened to in\nsilence, and the applauding was done after the curtain was down. The\ndoors opened at half past four, the play began promptly at half past\nfive, and within two minutes afterward all who were coming were in their\nseats, and quiet reigned. A German gentleman in the train had said that\na Shakespearian play was an appreciated treat in Germany and that\nwe should find the house filled. It was true; all the six tiers were\nfilled, and remained so to the end--which suggested that it is not only\nbalcony people who like Shakespeare in Germany, but those of the pit and\ngallery, too.\n\nAnother time, we went to Mannheim and attended a shivaree--otherwise an\nopera--the one called \"Lohengrin.\" The banging and slamming and booming\nand crashing were something beyond belief. The racking and pitiless pain\nof it remains stored up in my memory alongside the memory of the time\nthat I had my teeth fixed.\n\n\n\nThere were circumstances which made it necessary for me to stay through\nthe four hours to the end, and I stayed; but the recollection of that\nlong, dragging, relentless season of suffering is indestructible. To\nhave to endure it in silence, and sitting still, made it all the harder.\nI was in a railed compartment with eight or ten strangers, of the two\nsexes, and this compelled repression; yet at times the pain was so\nexquisite that I could hardly keep the tears back.\n\n\n\nAt those times, as the howlings and wailings and shrieking of the\nsingers, and the ragings and roarings and explosions of the vast\norchestra rose higher and higher, and wilder and wilder, and fiercer and\nfiercer, I could have cried if I had been alone. Those strangers would\nnot have been surprised to see a man do such a thing who was being\ngradually skinned, but they would have marveled at it here, and made\nremarks about it no doubt, whereas there was nothing in the present case\nwhich was an advantage over being skinned.\n\n\n\nThere was a wait of half an hour at the end of the first act, and I\ncould have gone out and rested during that time, but I could not trust\nmyself to do it, for I felt that I should desert to stay out. There was\nanother wait of half an hour toward nine o'clock, but I had gone through\nso much by that time that I had no spirit left, and so had no desire but\nto be let alone.\n\n\n\nI do not wish to suggest that the rest of the people there were like\nme, for, indeed, they were not. Whether it was that they naturally\nliked that noise, or whether it was that they had learned to like it\nby getting used to it, I did not at the time know; but they did like\nit--this was plain enough. While it was going on they sat and looked as\nrapt and grateful as cats do when one strokes their backs; and whenever\nthe curtain fell they rose to their feet, in one solid mighty multitude,\nand the air was snowed thick with waving handkerchiefs, and hurricanes\nof applause swept the place. This was not comprehensible to me. Of\ncourse, there were many people there who were not under compulsion to\nstay; yet the tiers were as full at the close as they had been at the\nbeginning. This showed that the people liked it.\n\nIt was a curious sort of a play. In the manner of costumes and scenery\nit was fine and showy enough; but there was not much action. That is\nto say, there was not much really done, it was only talked about; and\nalways violently. It was what one might call a narrative play. Everybody\nhad a narrative and a grievance, and none were reasonable about it, but\nall in an offensive and ungovernable state. There was little of that\nsort of customary thing where the tenor and the soprano stand down by\nthe footlights, warbling, with blended voices, and keep holding out\ntheir arms toward each other and drawing them back and spreading both\nhands over first one breast and then the other with a shake and a\npressure--no, it was every rioter for himself and no blending. Each sang\nhis indictive narrative in turn, accompanied by the whole orchestra of\nsixty instruments, and when this had continued for some time, and one\nwas hoping they might come to an understanding and modify the noise, a\ngreat chorus composed entirely of maniacs would suddenly break forth,\nand then during two minutes, and sometimes three, I lived over again all\nthat I suffered the time the orphan asylum burned down.\n\n\n\nWe only had one brief little season of heaven and heaven's sweet ecstasy\nand peace during all this long and diligent and acrimonious reproduction\nof the other place. This was while a gorgeous procession of people\nmarched around and around, in the third act, and sang the Wedding\nChorus. To my untutored ear that was music--almost divine music. While\nmy seared soul was steeped in the healing balm of those gracious sounds,\nit seemed to me that I could almost resuffer the torments which had\ngone before, in order to be so healed again. There is where the deep\ningenuity of the operatic idea is betrayed. It deals so largely in pain\nthat its scattered delights are prodigiously augmented by the contrasts.\nA pretty air in an opera is prettier there than it could be anywhere\nelse, I suppose, just as an honest man in politics shines more than he\nwould elsewhere.\n\nI have since found out that there is nothing the Germans like so much as\nan opera. They like it, not in a mild and moderate way, but with their\nwhole hearts. This is a legitimate result of habit and education. Our\nnation will like the opera, too, by and by, no doubt. One in fifty of\nthose who attend our operas likes it already, perhaps, but I think a\ngood many of the other forty-nine go in order to learn to like it, and\nthe rest in order to be able to talk knowingly about it. The latter\nusually hum the airs while they are being sung, so that their neighbors\nmay perceive that they have been to operas before. The funerals of these\ndo not occur often enough.\n\n\n\nA gentle, old-maidish person and a sweet young girl of seventeen sat\nright in front of us that night at the Mannheim opera. These people\ntalked, between the acts, and I understood them, though I understood\nnothing that was uttered on the distant stage. At first they were\nguarded in their talk, but after they had heard my agent and me\nconversing in English they dropped their reserve and I picked up many\nof their little confidences; no, I mean many of HER little\nconfidences--meaning the elder party--for the young girl only listened,\nand gave assenting nods, but never said a word. How pretty she was,\nand how sweet she was! I wished she would speak. But evidently she was\nabsorbed in her own thoughts, her own young-girl dreams, and found a\ndearer pleasure in silence. But she was not dreaming sleepy dreams--no,\nshe was awake, alive, alert, she could not sit still a moment. She was\nan enchanting study. Her gown was of a soft white silky stuff that clung\nto her round young figure like a fish's skin, and it was rippled over\nwith the gracefulest little fringy films of lace; she had deep, tender\neyes, with long, curved lashes; and she had peachy cheeks, and a\ndimpled chin, and such a dear little rosebud of a mouth; and she was so\ndovelike, so pure, and so gracious, so sweet and so bewitching. For long\nhours I did mightily wish she would speak. And at last she did; the red\nlips parted, and out leaps her thought--and with such a guileless and\npretty enthusiasm, too: \"Auntie, I just KNOW I've got five hundred fleas\non me!\"\n\nThat was probably over the average. Yes, it must have been very much\nover the average. The average at that time in the Grand Duchy of Baden\nwas forty-five to a young person (when alone), according to the official\nestimate of the home secretary for that year; the average for older\npeople was shifty and indeterminable, for whenever a wholesome young\ngirl came into the presence of her elders she immediately lowered their\naverage and raised her own. She became a sort of contribution-box.\n\n\n\nThis dear young thing in the theater had been sitting there\nunconsciously taking up a collection. Many a skinny old being in our\nneighborhood was the happier and the restfuler for her coming.\n\nIn that large audience, that night, there were eight very conspicuous\npeople. These were ladies who had their hats or bonnets on. What a\nblessed thing it would be if a lady could make herself conspicuous in\nour theaters by wearing her hat.\n\n\n\nIt is not usual in Europe to allow ladies and gentlemen to take bonnets,\nhats, overcoats, canes, or umbrellas into the auditorium, but in\nMannheim this rule was not enforced because the audiences were largely\nmade up of people from a distance, and among these were always a few\ntimid ladies who were afraid that if they had to go into an anteroom to\nget their things when the play was over, they would miss their train.\nBut the great mass of those who came from a distance always ran the risk\nand took the chances, preferring the loss of a train to a breach of good\nmanners and the discomfort of being unpleasantly conspicuous during a\nstretch of three or four hours.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n[How Wagner Operas Bang Along]\n\n\nThree or four hours. That is a long time to sit in one place, whether\none be conspicuous or not, yet some of Wagner's operas bang along for\nsix whole hours on a stretch! But the people sit there and enjoy it all,\nand wish it would last longer. A German lady in Munich told me that a\nperson could not like Wagner's music at first, but must go through the\ndeliberate process of learning to like it--then he would have his sure\nreward; for when he had learned to like it he would hunger for it and\nnever be able to get enough of it. She said that six hours of Wagner was\nby no means too much. She said that this composer had made a complete\nrevolution in music and was burying the old masters one by one. And\nshe said that Wagner's operas differed from all others in one notable\nrespect, and that was that they were not merely spotted with music here\nand there, but were ALL music, from the first strain to the last. This\nsurprised me. I said I had attended one of his insurrections, and found\nhardly ANY music in it except the Wedding Chorus. She said \"Lohengrin\"\nwas noisier than Wagner's other operas, but that if I would keep on\ngoing to see it I would find by and by that it was all music, and\ntherefore would then enjoy it. I COULD have said, \"But would you advise\na person to deliberately practice having a toothache in the pit of his\nstomach for a couple of years in order that he might then come to enjoy\nit?\" But I reserved that remark.\n\nThis lady was full of the praises of the head-tenor who had performed in\na Wagner opera the night before, and went on to enlarge upon his old and\nprodigious fame, and how many honors had been lavished upon him by the\nprincely houses of Germany. Here was another surprise. I had attended\nthat very opera, in the person of my agent, and had made close and\naccurate observations. So I said:\n\n\"Why, madam, MY experience warrants me in stating that that tenor's\nvoice is not a voice at all, but only a shriek--the shriek of a hyena.\"\n\n\n\n\"That is very true,\" she said; \"he cannot sing now; it is already many\nyears that he has lost his voice, but in other times he sang, yes,\ndivinely! So whenever he comes now, you shall see, yes, that the theater\nwill not hold the people. JAWOHL BEI GOTT! his voice is WUNDERSCHOEN in\nthat past time.\"\n\nI said she was discovering to me a kindly trait in the Germans which\nwas worth emulating. I said that over the water we were not quite so\ngenerous; that with us, when a singer had lost his voice and a jumper\nhad lost his legs, these parties ceased to draw. I said I had been to\nthe opera in Hanover, once, and in Mannheim once, and in Munich\n(through my authorized agent) once, and this large experience had nearly\npersuaded me that the Germans PREFERRED singers who couldn't sing. This\nwas not such a very extravagant speech, either, for that burly Mannheim\ntenor's praises had been the talk of all Heidelberg for a week before\nhis performance took place--yet his voice was like the distressing noise\nwhich a nail makes when you screech it across a window-pane. I said so\nto Heidelberg friends the next day, and they said, in the calmest and\nsimplest way, that that was very true, but that in earlier times his\nvoice HAD been wonderfully fine. And the tenor in Hanover was just\nanother example of this sort. The English-speaking German gentleman who\nwent with me to the opera there was brimming with enthusiasm over that\ntenor. He said:\n\n\"ACH GOTT! a great man! You shall see him. He is so celebrate in all\nGermany--and he has a pension, yes, from the government. He not obliged\nto sing now, only twice every year; but if he not sing twice each year\nthey take him his pension away.\"\n\nVery well, we went. When the renowned old tenor appeared, I got a nudge\nand an excited whisper:\n\n\"Now you see him!\"\n\nBut the \"celebrate\" was an astonishing disappointment to me. If he\nhad been behind a screen I should have supposed they were performing a\nsurgical operation on him. I looked at my friend--to my great surprise\nhe seemed intoxicated with pleasure, his eyes were dancing with eager\ndelight. When the curtain at last fell, he burst into the stormiest\napplause, and kept it up--as did the whole house--until the afflictive\ntenor had come three times before the curtain to make his bow. While the\nglowing enthusiast was swabbing the perspiration from his face, I said:\n\n\"I don't mean the least harm, but really, now, do you think he can\nsing?\"\n\n\"Him? NO! GOTT IM HIMMEL, ABER, how he has been able to sing twenty-five\nyears ago?\" [Then pensively.] \"ACH, no, NOW he not sing any more, he\nonly cry. When he think he sing, now, he not sing at all, no, he only\nmake like a cat which is unwell.\"\n\n\n\nWhere and how did we get the idea that the Germans are a stolid,\nphlegmatic race? In truth, they are widely removed from that. They are\nwarm-hearted, emotional, impulsive, enthusiastic, their tears come at\nthe mildest touch, and it is not hard to move them to laughter. They are\nthe very children of impulse. We are cold and self-contained, compared\nto the Germans. They hug and kiss and cry and shout and dance and sing;\nand where we use one loving, petting expression, they pour out a score.\nTheir language is full of endearing diminutives; nothing that they love\nescapes the application of a petting diminutive--neither the house, nor\nthe dog, nor the horse, nor the grandmother, nor any other creature,\nanimate or inanimate.\n\nIn the theaters at Hanover, Hamburg, and Mannheim, they had a wise\ncustom. The moment the curtain went up, the light in the body of the\nhouse went down. The audience sat in the cool gloom of a deep twilight,\nwhich greatly enhanced the glowing splendors of the stage. It saved gas,\ntoo, and people were not sweated to death.\n\nWhen I saw \"King Lear\" played, nobody was allowed to see a scene\nshifted; if there was nothing to be done but slide a forest out of the\nway and expose a temple beyond, one did not see that forest split itself\nin the middle and go shrieking away, with the accompanying disenchanting\nspectacle of the hands and heels of the impelling impulse--no, the\ncurtain was always dropped for an instant--one heard not the least\nmovement behind it--but when it went up, the next instant, the forest\nwas gone. Even when the stage was being entirely reset, one heard no\nnoise. During the whole time that \"King Lear\" was playing the curtain\nwas never down two minutes at any one time. The orchestra played until\nthe curtain was ready to go up for the first time, then they departed\nfor the evening. Where the stage waits never reach two minutes there is\nno occasion for music. I had never seen this two-minute business between\nacts but once before, and that was when the \"Shaughraun\" was played at\nWallack's.\n\nI was at a concert in Munich one night, the people were streaming in,\nthe clock-hand pointed to seven, the music struck up, and instantly\nall movement in the body of the house ceased--nobody was standing, or\nwalking up the aisles, or fumbling with a seat, the stream of incomers\nhad suddenly dried up at its source. I listened undisturbed to a piece\nof music that was fifteen minutes long--always expecting some tardy\nticket-holders to come crowding past my knees, and being continuously\nand pleasantly disappointed--but when the last note was struck, here\ncame the stream again. You see, they had made those late comers wait in\nthe comfortable waiting-parlor from the time the music had begun until\nit was ended.\n\n\n\nIt was the first time I had ever seen this sort of criminals denied the\nprivilege of destroying the comfort of a house full of their betters.\nSome of these were pretty fine birds, but no matter, they had to tarry\noutside in the long parlor under the inspection of a double rank of\nliveried footmen and waiting-maids who supported the two walls with\ntheir backs and held the wraps and traps of their masters and mistresses\non their arms.\n\nWe had no footmen to hold our things, and it was not permissible to take\nthem into the concert-room; but there were some men and women to take\ncharge of them for us. They gave us checks for them and charged a fixed\nprice, payable in advance--five cents.\n\nIn Germany they always hear one thing at an opera which has never yet\nbeen heard in America, perhaps--I mean the closing strain of a fine solo\nor duet. We always smash into it with an earthquake of applause. The\nresult is that we rob ourselves of the sweetest part of the treat; we\nget the whiskey, but we don't get the sugar in the bottom of the glass.\n\nOur way of scattering applause along through an act seems to me to be\nbetter than the Mannheim way of saving it all up till the act is ended.\nI do not see how an actor can forget himself and portray hot passion\nbefore a cold still audience. I should think he would feel foolish. It\nis a pain to me to this day, to remember how that old German Lear raged\nand wept and howled around the stage, with never a response from that\nhushed house, never a single outburst till the act was ended. To\nme there was something unspeakably uncomfortable in the solemn dead\nsilences that always followed this old person's tremendous outpourings\nof his feelings. I could not help putting myself in his place--I thought\nI knew how sick and flat he felt during those silences, because I\nremembered a case which came under my observation once, and which--but I\nwill tell the incident:\n\nOne evening on board a Mississippi steamboat, a boy of ten years lay\nasleep in a berth--a long, slim-legged boy, he was, encased in quite\na short shirt; it was the first time he had ever made a trip on a\nsteamboat, and so he was troubled, and scared, and had gone to bed\nwith his head filled with impending snaggings, and explosions, and\nconflagrations, and sudden death. About ten o'clock some twenty ladies\nwere sitting around about the ladies' saloon, quietly reading, sewing,\nembroidering, and so on, and among them sat a sweet, benignant old dame\nwith round spectacles on her nose and her busy knitting-needles in her\nhands. Now all of a sudden, into the midst of this peaceful scene burst\nthat slim-shanked boy in the brief shirt, wild-eyed, erect-haired, and\nshouting, \"Fire, fire! JUMP AND RUN, THE BOAT'S AFIRE AND THERE AIN'T A\nMINUTE TO LOSE!\" All those ladies looked sweetly up and smiled, nobody\nstirred, the old lady pulled her spectacles down, looked over them, and\nsaid, gently:\n\n\"But you mustn't catch cold, child. Run and put on your breastpin, and\nthen come and tell us all about it.\"\n\nIt was a cruel chill to give to a poor little devil's gushing vehemence.\nHe was expecting to be a sort of hero--the creator of a wild panic--and\nhere everybody sat and smiled a mocking smile, and an old woman made fun\nof his bugbear. I turned and crept away--for I was that boy--and never\neven cared to discover whether I had dreamed the fire or actually seen\nit.\n\n\n\nI am told that in a German concert or opera, they hardly ever encore\na song; that though they may be dying to hear it again, their good\nbreeding usually preserves them against requiring the repetition.\n\nKings may encore; that is quite another matter; it delights everybody to\nsee that the King is pleased; and as to the actor encored, his pride and\ngratification are simply boundless. Still, there are circumstances in\nwhich even a royal encore--\n\nBut it is better to illustrate. The King of Bavaria is a poet, and has a\npoet's eccentricities--with the advantage over all other poets of being\nable to gratify them, no matter what form they may take. He is fond\nof opera, but not fond of sitting in the presence of an audience;\ntherefore, it has sometimes occurred, in Munich, that when an opera has\nbeen concluded and the players were getting off their paint and finery,\na command has come to them to get their paint and finery on again.\nPresently the King would arrive, solitary and alone, and the players\nwould begin at the beginning and do the entire opera over again with\nonly that one individual in the vast solemn theater for audience. Once\nhe took an odd freak into his head. High up and out of sight, over\nthe prodigious stage of the court theater is a maze of interlacing\nwater-pipes, so pierced that in case of fire, innumerable little\nthread-like streams of water can be caused to descend; and in case\nof need, this discharge can be augmented to a pouring flood. American\nmanagers might want to make a note of that. The King was sole audience.\nThe opera proceeded, it was a piece with a storm in it; the mimic\nthunder began to mutter, the mimic wind began to wail and sough, and\nthe mimic rain to patter. The King's interest rose higher and higher; it\ndeveloped into enthusiasm. He cried out:\n\n\"It is very, very good, indeed! But I will have real rain! Turn on the\nwater!\"\n\nThe manager pleaded for a reversal of the command; said it would ruin\nthe costly scenery and the splendid costumes, but the King cried:\n\n\"No matter, no matter, I will have real rain! Turn on the water!\"\n\nSo the real rain was turned on and began to descend in gossamer lances\nto the mimic flower-beds and gravel walks of the stage. The richly\ndressed actresses and actors tripped about singing bravely and\npretending not to mind it. The King was delighted--his enthusiasm grew\nhigher. He cried out:\n\n\"Bravo, bravo! More thunder! more lightning! turn on more rain!\"\n\n\n\nThe thunder boomed, the lightning glared, the storm-winds raged, the\ndeluge poured down. The mimic royalty on the stage, with their soaked\nsatins clinging to their bodies, slopped about ankle-deep in water,\nwarbling their sweetest and best, the fiddlers under the eaves of the\nstage sawed away for dear life, with the cold overflow spouting down the\nbacks of their necks, and the dry and happy King sat in his lofty box\nand wore his gloves to ribbons applauding.\n\n\"More yet!\" cried the King; \"more yet--let loose all the thunder, turn\non all the water! I will hang the man that raises an umbrella!\"\n\nWhen this most tremendous and effective storm that had ever been\nproduced in any theater was at last over, the King's approbation was\nmeasureless. He cried:\n\n\"Magnificent, magnificent! ENCORE! Do it again!\"\n\nBut the manager succeeded in persuading him to recall the encore, and\nsaid the company would feel sufficiently rewarded and complimented\nin the mere fact that the encore was desired by his Majesty, without\nfatiguing him with a repetition to gratify their own vanity.\n\nDuring the remainder of the act the lucky performers were those whose\nparts required changes of dress; the others were a soaked, bedraggled,\nand uncomfortable lot, but in the last degree picturesque. The stage\nscenery was ruined, trap-doors were so swollen that they wouldn't work\nfor a week afterward, the fine costumes were spoiled, and no end of\nminor damages were done by that remarkable storm.\n\nIt was a royal idea--that storm--and royally carried out. But observe\nthe moderation of the King; he did not insist upon his encore. If he had\nbeen a gladsome, unreflecting American opera-audience, he probably would\nhave had his storm repeated and repeated until he drowned all those\npeople.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n[I Paint a \"Turner\"]\n\n\nThe summer days passed pleasantly in Heidelberg. We had a skilled\ntrainer, and under his instructions we were getting our legs in the\nright condition for the contemplated pedestrian tours; we were well\nsatisfied with the progress which we had made in the German language,\n[1. See Appendix D for information concerning this fearful tongue.] and\nmore than satisfied with what we had accomplished in art. We had had the\nbest instructors in drawing and painting in Germany--Haemmerling, Vogel,\nMueller, Dietz, and Schumann. Haemmerling taught us landscape-painting.\nVogel taught us figure-drawing, Mueller taught us to do still-life,\nand Dietz and Schumann gave us a finishing course in two\nspecialties--battle-pieces and shipwrecks. Whatever I am in Art I owe to\nthese men. I have something of the manner of each and all of them;\nbut they all said that I had also a manner of my own, and that it\nwas conspicuous. They said there was a marked individuality about my\nstyle--insomuch that if I ever painted the commonest type of a dog, I\nshould be sure to throw a something into the aspect of that dog which\nwould keep him from being mistaken for the creation of any other artist.\nSecretly I wanted to believe all these kind sayings, but I could not; I\nwas afraid that my masters' partiality for me, and pride in me, biased\ntheir judgment. So I resolved to make a test. Privately, and unknown to\nany one, I painted my great picture, \"Heidelberg Castle Illuminated\"--my\nfirst really important work in oils--and had it hung up in the midst\nof a wilderness of oil-pictures in the Art Exhibition, with no name\nattached to it. To my great gratification it was instantly recognized\nas mine. All the town flocked to see it, and people even came from\nneighboring localities to visit it. It made more stir than any other\nwork in the Exhibition. But the most gratifying thing of all was, that\nchance strangers, passing through, who had not heard of my picture, were\nnot only drawn to it, as by a lodestone, the moment they entered the\ngallery, but always took it for a \"Turner.\"\n\n\n\nApparently nobody had ever done that. There were ruined castles on the\noverhanging cliffs and crags all the way; these were said to have their\nlegends, like those on the Rhine, and what was better still, they had\nnever been in print. There was nothing in the books about that lovely\nregion; it had been neglected by the tourist, it was virgin soil for the\nliterary pioneer.\n\nMeantime the knapsacks, the rough walking-suits and the stout\nwalking-shoes which we had ordered, were finished and brought to us.\nA Mr. X and a young Mr. Z had agreed to go with us. We went around one\nevening and bade good-by to our friends, and afterward had a little\nfarewell banquet at the hotel. We got to bed early, for we wanted to\nmake an early start, so as to take advantage of the cool of the morning.\n\nWe were out of bed at break of day, feeling fresh and vigorous, and took\na hearty breakfast, then plunged down through the leafy arcades of the\nCastle grounds, toward the town. What a glorious summer morning it was,\nand how the flowers did pour out their fragrance, and how the birds did\nsing! It was just the time for a tramp through the woods and mountains.\n\n\n\nWe were all dressed alike: broad slouch hats, to keep the sun off; gray\nknapsacks; blue army shirts; blue overalls; leathern gaiters buttoned\ntight from knee down to ankle; high-quarter coarse shoes snugly laced.\nEach man had an opera-glass, a canteen, and a guide-book case slung over\nhis shoulder, and carried an alpenstock in one hand and a sun-umbrella\nin the other. Around our hats were wound many folds of soft white\nmuslin, with the ends hanging and flapping down our backs--an idea\nbrought from the Orient and used by tourists all over Europe. Harris\ncarried the little watch-like machine called a \"pedometer,\" whose\noffice is to keep count of a man's steps and tell how far he has walked.\nEverybody stopped to admire our costumes and give us a hearty \"Pleasant\nmarch to you!\"\n\n\n\nWhen we got downtown I found that we could go by rail to within five\nmiles of Heilbronn. The train was just starting, so we jumped aboard and\nwent tearing away in splendid spirits. It was agreed all around that we\nhad done wisely, because it would be just as enjoyable to walk DOWN the\nNeckar as up it, and it could not be needful to walk both ways. There\nwere some nice German people in our compartment. I got to talking some\npretty private matters presently, and Harris became nervous; so he\nnudged me and said:\n\n\"Speak in German--these Germans may understand English.\"\n\nI did so, it was well I did; for it turned out that there was not a\nGerman in that party who did not understand English perfectly. It is\ncurious how widespread our language is in Germany. After a while some of\nthose folks got out and a German gentleman and his two young daughters\ngot in. I spoke in German of one of the latter several times, but\nwithout result. Finally she said:\n\n\"ICH VERSTEHE NUR DEUTCH UND ENGLISHE,\"--or words to that effect. That\nis, \"I don't understand any language but German and English.\"\n\nAnd sure enough, not only she but her father and sister spoke English.\nSo after that we had all the talk we wanted; and we wanted a good deal,\nfor they were agreeable people. They were greatly interested in our\ncustoms; especially the alpenstocks, for they had not seen any before.\nThey said that the Neckar road was perfectly level, so we must be going\nto Switzerland or some other rugged country; and asked us if we did not\nfind the walking pretty fatiguing in such warm weather. But we said no.\n\nWe reached Wimpfen--I think it was Wimpfen--in about three hours, and\ngot out, not the least tired; found a good hotel and ordered beer and\ndinner--then took a stroll through the venerable old village. It was\nvery picturesque and tumble-down, and dirty and interesting. It had\nqueer houses five hundred years old in it, and a military tower 115 feet\nhigh, which had stood there more than ten centuries. I made a little\nsketch of it. I kept a copy, but gave the original to the Burgomaster.\n\n\n\nI think the original was better than the copy, because it had more\nwindows in it and the grass stood up better and had a brisker look.\nThere was none around the tower, though; I composed the grass myself,\nfrom studies I made in a field by Heidelberg in Haemmerling's time. The\nman on top, looking at the view, is apparently too large, but I found\nhe could not be made smaller, conveniently. I wanted him there, and I\nwanted him visible, so I thought out a way to manage it; I composed the\npicture from two points of view; the spectator is to observe the man\nfrom bout where that flag is, and he must observe the tower itself from\nthe ground. This harmonizes the seeming discrepancy. [Figure 2]\n\nNear an old cathedral, under a shed, were three crosses of stone--moldy\nand damaged things, bearing life-size stone figures. The two thieves\nwere dressed in the fanciful court costumes of the middle of the\nsixteenth century, while the Saviour was nude, with the exception of a\ncloth around the loins.\n\nWe had dinner under the green trees in a garden belonging to the hotel\nand overlooking the Neckar; then, after a smoke, we went to bed. We had\na refreshing nap, then got up about three in the afternoon and put\non our panoply. As we tramped gaily out at the gate of the town, we\novertook a peasant's cart, partly laden with odds and ends of cabbages\nand similar vegetable rubbish, and drawn by a small cow and a smaller\ndonkey yoked together. It was a pretty slow concern, but it got us into\nHeilbronn before dark--five miles, or possibly it was seven.\n\n\n\nWe stopped at the very same inn which the famous old robber-knight\nand rough fighter Goetz von Berlichingen, abode in after he got out of\ncaptivity in the Square Tower of Heilbronn between three hundred and\nfifty and four hundred years ago. Harris and I occupied the same room\nwhich he had occupied and the same paper had not quite peeled off the\nwalls yet. The furniture was quaint old carved stuff, full four hundred\nyears old, and some of the smells were over a thousand. There was a hook\nin the wall, which the landlord said the terrific old Goetz used to hang\nhis iron hand on when he took it off to go to bed. This room was very\nlarge--it might be called immense--and it was on the first floor; which\nmeans it was in the second story, for in Europe the houses are so\nhigh that they do not count the first story, else they would get tired\nclimbing before they got to the top. The wallpaper was a fiery red, with\nhuge gold figures in it, well smirched by time, and it covered all the\ndoors. These doors fitted so snugly and continued the figures of the\npaper so unbrokenly, that when they were closed one had to go feeling\nand searching along the wall to find them. There was a stove in the\ncorner--one of those tall, square, stately white porcelain things that\nlooks like a monument and keeps you thinking of death when you ought to\nbe enjoying your travels. The windows looked out on a little alley, and\nover that into a stable and some poultry and pig yards in the rear of\nsome tenement-houses. There were the customary two beds in the room,\none in one end, the other in the other, about an old-fashioned\nbrass-mounted, single-barreled pistol-shot apart. They were fully\nas narrow as the usual German bed, too, and had the German bed's\nineradicable habit of spilling the blankets on the floor every time you\nforgot yourself and went to sleep.\n\nA round table as large as King Arthur's stood in the center of the room;\nwhile the waiters were getting ready to serve our dinner on it we\nall went out to see the renowned clock on the front of the municipal\nbuildings.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n[What the Wives Saved]\n\n\nThe RATHHAUS, or municipal building, is of the quaintest and most\npicturesque Middle-Age architecture. It has a massive portico and steps,\nbefore it, heavily balustraded, and adorned with life-sized rusty iron\nknights in complete armor. The clock-face on the front of the building\nis very large and of curious pattern. Ordinarily, a gilded angel\nstrikes the hour on a big bell with a hammer; as the striking ceases, a\nlife-sized figure of Time raises its hour-glass and turns it; two golden\nrams advance and butt each other; a gilded cock lifts its wings; but the\nmain features are two great angels, who stand on each side of the dial\nwith long horns at their lips; it was said that they blew melodious\nblasts on these horns every hour--but they did not do it for us. We were\ntold, later, that they blew only at night, when the town was still.\n\nWithin the RATHHAUS were a number of huge wild boars' heads, preserved,\nand mounted on brackets along the wall; they bore inscriptions telling\nwho killed them and how many hundred years ago it was done. One room in\nthe building was devoted to the preservation of ancient archives. There\nthey showed us no end of aged documents; some were signed by Popes,\nsome by Tilly and other great generals, and one was a letter written and\nsubscribed by Goetz von Berlichingen in Heilbronn in 1519 just after his\nrelease from the Square Tower.\n\n\n\nThis fine old robber-knight was a devoutly and sincerely religious\nman, hospitable, charitable to the poor, fearless in fight, active,\nenterprising, and possessed of a large and generous nature. He had in\nhim a quality of being able to overlook moderate injuries, and being\nable to forgive and forget mortal ones as soon as he had soundly\ntrounced the authors of them. He was prompt to take up any poor devil's\nquarrel and risk his neck to right him. The common folk held him dear,\nand his memory is still green in ballad and tradition. He used to go on\nthe highway and rob rich wayfarers; and other times he would swoop down\nfrom his high castle on the hills of the Neckar and capture passing\ncargoes of merchandise. In his memoirs he piously thanks the Giver of\nall Good for remembering him in his needs and delivering sundry such\ncargoes into his hands at times when only special providences could have\nrelieved him. He was a doughty warrior and found a deep joy in battle.\nIn an assault upon a stronghold in Bavaria when he was only twenty-three\nyears old, his right hand was shot away, but he was so interested in the\nfight that he did not observe it for a while. He said that the iron hand\nwhich was made for him afterward, and which he wore for more than half a\ncentury, was nearly as clever a member as the fleshy one had been. I was\nglad to get a facsimile of the letter written by this fine old German\nRobin Hood, though I was not able to read it. He was a better artist\nwith his sword than with his pen.\n\nWe went down by the river and saw the Square Tower. It was a very\nvenerable structure, very strong, and very ornamental. There was no\nopening near the ground. They had to use a ladder to get into it, no\ndoubt.\n\nWe visited the principal church, also--a curious old structure, with a\ntowerlike spire adorned with all sorts of grotesque images. The inner\nwalls of the church were placarded with large mural tablets of copper,\nbearing engraved inscriptions celebrating the merits of old Heilbronn\nworthies of two or three centuries ago, and also bearing rudely painted\neffigies of themselves and their families tricked out in the queer\ncostumes of those days. The head of the family sat in the foreground,\nand beyond him extended a sharply receding and diminishing row of\nsons; facing him sat his wife, and beyond her extended a low row of\ndiminishing daughters. The family was usually large, but the perspective\nbad.\n\nThen we hired the hack and the horse which Goetz von Berlichingen used\nto use, and drove several miles into the country to visit the place\ncalled WEIBERTREU--Wife's Fidelity I suppose it means. It was a feudal\ncastle of the Middle Ages. When we reached its neighborhood we found\nit was beautifully situated, but on top of a mound, or hill, round and\ntolerably steep, and about two hundred feet high. Therefore, as the sun\nwas blazing hot, we did not climb up there, but took the place on trust,\nand observed it from a distance while the horse leaned up against a\nfence and rested. The place has no interest except that which is lent it\nby its legend, which is a very pretty one--to this effect:\n\nTHE LEGEND\n\nIn the Middle Ages, a couple of young dukes, brothers, took opposite\nsides in one of the wars, the one fighting for the Emperor, the other\nagainst him. One of them owned the castle and village on top of the\nmound which I have been speaking of, and in his absence his brother\ncame with his knights and soldiers and began a siege. It was a long and\ntedious business, for the people made a stubborn and faithful defense.\nBut at last their supplies ran out and starvation began its work;\nmore fell by hunger than by the missiles of the enemy. They by and\nby surrendered, and begged for charitable terms. But the beleaguering\nprince was so incensed against them for their long resistance that he\nsaid he would spare none but the women and children--all men should be\nput to the sword without exception, and all their goods destroyed. Then\nthe women came and fell on their knees and begged for the lives of their\nhusbands.\n\n\"No,\" said the prince, \"not a man of them shall escape alive; you\nyourselves shall go with your children into houseless and friendless\nbanishment; but that you may not starve I grant you this one grace,\nthat each woman may bear with her from this place as much of her most\nvaluable property as she is able to carry.\"\n\nVery well, presently the gates swung open and out filed those women\ncarrying their HUSBANDS on their shoulders. The besiegers, furious at\nthe trick, rushed forward to slaughter the men, but the Duke stepped\nbetween and said:\n\n\"No, put up your swords--a prince's word is inviolable.\"\n\nWhen we got back to the hotel, King Arthur's Round Table was ready for\nus in its white drapery, and the head waiter and his first assistant, in\nswallow-tails and white cravats, brought in the soup and the hot plates\nat once.\n\nMr. X had ordered the dinner, and when the wine came on, he picked up\na bottle, glanced at the label, and then turned to the grave, the\nmelancholy, the sepulchral head waiter and said it was not the sort of\nwine he had asked for. The head waiter picked up the bottle, cast his\nundertaker-eye on it and said:\n\n\"It is true; I beg pardon.\" Then he turned on his subordinate and calmly\nsaid, \"Bring another label.\"\n\n\n\nAt the same time he slid the present label off with his hand and laid it\naside; it had been newly put on, its paste was still wet. When the new\nlabel came, he put it on; our French wine being now turned into German\nwine, according to desire, the head waiter went blandly about his other\nduties, as if the working of this sort of miracle was a common and easy\nthing to him.\n\nMr. X said he had not known, before, that there were people honest\nenough to do this miracle in public, but he was aware that thousands\nupon thousands of labels were imported into America from Europe every\nyear, to enable dealers to furnish to their customers in a quiet and\ninexpensive way all the different kinds of foreign wines they might\nrequire.\n\nWe took a turn around the town, after dinner, and found it fully as\ninteresting in the moonlight as it had been in the daytime. The streets\nwere narrow and roughly paved, and there was not a sidewalk or a\nstreet-lamp anywhere. The dwellings were centuries old, and vast enough\nfor hotels. They widened all the way up; the stories projected further\nand further forward and aside as they ascended, and the long rows\nof lighted windows, filled with little bits of panes, curtained with\nfigured white muslin and adorned outside with boxes of flowers, made a\npretty effect.\n\n\n\nThe moon was bright, and the light and shadow very strong; and nothing\ncould be more picturesque than those curving streets, with their rows\nof huge high gables leaning far over toward each other in a friendly\ngossiping way, and the crowds below drifting through the alternating\nblots of gloom and mellow bars of moonlight. Nearly everybody was\nabroad, chatting, singing, romping, or massed in lazy comfortable\nattitudes in the doorways.\n\nIn one place there was a public building which was fenced about with a\nthick, rusty chain, which sagged from post to post in a succession of\nlow swings. The pavement, here, was made of heavy blocks of stone. In\nthe glare of the moon a party of barefooted children were swinging on\nthose chains and having a noisy good time. They were not the first ones\nwho have done that; even their great-great-grandfathers had not been the\nfirst to do it when they were children. The strokes of the bare feet\nhad worn grooves inches deep in the stone flags; it had taken many\ngenerations of swinging children to accomplish that.\n\n\n\nEverywhere in the town were the mold and decay that go with antiquity,\nand evidence of it; but I do not know that anything else gave us so\nvivid a sense of the old age of Heilbronn as those footworn grooves in\nthe paving-stones.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n[My Long Crawl in the Dark]\n\n\nWhen we got back to the hotel I wound and set the pedometer and put\nit in my pocket, for I was to carry it next day and keep record of the\nmiles we made. The work which we had given the instrument to do during\nthe day which had just closed had not fatigued it perceptibly.\n\nWe were in bed by ten, for we wanted to be up and away on our tramp\nhomeward with the dawn. I hung fire, but Harris went to sleep at once.\nI hate a man who goes to sleep at once; there is a sort of indefinable\nsomething about it which is not exactly an insult, and yet is an\ninsolence; and one which is hard to bear, too. I lay there fretting\nover this injury, and trying to go to sleep; but the harder I tried, the\nwider awake I grew. I got to feeling very lonely in the dark, with no\ncompany but an undigested dinner. My mind got a start by and by, and\nbegan to consider the beginning of every subject which has ever been\nthought of; but it never went further than the beginning; it was touch\nand go; it fled from topic to topic with a frantic speed. At the end of\nan hour my head was in a perfect whirl and I was dead tired, fagged out.\n\nThe fatigue was so great that it presently began to make some head\nagainst the nervous excitement; while imagining myself wide awake, I\nwould really doze into momentary unconsciousness, and come suddenly out\nof it with a physical jerk which nearly wrenched my joints apart--the\ndelusion of the instant being that I was tumbling backward over a\nprecipice. After I had fallen over eight or nine precipices and thus\nfound out that one half of my brain had been asleep eight or nine times\nwithout the wide-awake, hard-working other half suspecting it, the\nperiodical unconsciousnesses began to extend their spell gradually over\nmore of my brain-territory, and at last I sank into a drowse which grew\ndeeper and deeper and was doubtless just on the very point of being a\nsolid, blessed dreamless stupor, when--what was that?\n\nMy dulled faculties dragged themselves partly back to life and took a\nreceptive attitude. Now out of an immense, a limitless distance, came\na something which grew and grew, and approached, and presently was\nrecognizable as a sound--it had rather seemed to be a feeling, before.\nThis sound was a mile away, now--perhaps it was the murmur of a storm;\nand now it was nearer--not a quarter of a mile away; was it the muffled\nrasping and grinding of distant machinery? No, it came still nearer; was\nit the measured tramp of a marching troop? But it came nearer still,\nand still nearer--and at last it was right in the room: it was merely\na mouse gnawing the woodwork. So I had held my breath all that time for\nsuch a trifle.\n\n\n\nWell, what was done could not be helped; I would go to sleep at once and\nmake up the lost time. That was a thoughtless thought. Without intending\nit--hardly knowing it--I fell to listening intently to that sound, and\neven unconsciously counting the strokes of the mouse's nutmeg-grater.\nPresently I was deriving exquisite suffering from this employment, yet\nmaybe I could have endured it if the mouse had attended steadily to\nhis work; but he did not do that; he stopped every now and then, and I\nsuffered more while waiting and listening for him to begin again than\nI did while he was gnawing. Along at first I was mentally offering a\nreward of five--six--seven--ten--dollars for that mouse; but toward\nthe last I was offering rewards which were entirely beyond my means. I\nclose-reefed my ears--that is to say, I bent the flaps of them down\nand furled them into five or six folds, and pressed them against the\nhearing-orifice--but it did no good: the faculty was so sharpened\nby nervous excitement that it was become a microphone and could hear\nthrough the overlays without trouble.\n\nMy anger grew to a frenzy. I finally did what all persons before me have\ndone, clear back to Adam,--resolved to throw something. I reached down\nand got my walking-shoes, then sat up in bed and listened, in order to\nexactly locate the noise. But I couldn't do it; it was as unlocatable as\na cricket's noise; and where one thinks that that is, is always the very\nplace where it isn't. So I presently hurled a shoe at random, and with\na vicious vigor. It struck the wall over Harris's head and fell down on\nhim; I had not imagined I could throw so far. It woke Harris, and I was\nglad of it until I found he was not angry; then I was sorry. He soon\nwent to sleep again, which pleased me; but straightway the mouse began\nagain, which roused my temper once more. I did not want to wake Harris\na second time, but the gnawing continued until I was compelled to throw\nthe other shoe.\n\n\n\nThis time I broke a mirror--there were two in the room--I got the\nlargest one, of course. Harris woke again, but did not complain, and\nI was sorrier than ever. I resolved that I would suffer all possible\ntorture before I would disturb him a third time.\n\nThe mouse eventually retired, and by and by I was sinking to sleep, when\na clock began to strike; I counted till it was done, and was about to\ndrowse again when another clock began; I counted; then the two great\nRATHHAUS clock angels began to send forth soft, rich, melodious blasts\nfrom their long trumpets. I had never heard anything that was so lovely,\nor weird, or mysterious--but when they got to blowing the quarter-hours,\nthey seemed to me to be overdoing the thing. Every time I dropped\noff for the moment, a new noise woke me. Each time I woke I missed my\ncoverlet, and had to reach down to the floor and get it again.\n\nAt last all sleepiness forsook me. I recognized the fact that I was\nhopelessly and permanently wide awake. Wide awake, and feverish and\nthirsty. When I had lain tossing there as long as I could endure it, it\noccurred to me that it would be a good idea to dress and go out in the\ngreat square and take a refreshing wash in the fountain, and smoke and\nreflect there until the remnant of the night was gone.\n\nI believed I could dress in the dark without waking Harris. I had\nbanished my shoes after the mouse, but my slippers would do for a summer\nnight. So I rose softly, and gradually got on everything--down to one\nsock. I couldn't seem to get on the track of that sock, any way I could\nfix it. But I had to have it; so I went down on my hands and knees, with\none slipper on and the other in my hand, and began to paw gently around\nand rake the floor, but with no success. I enlarged my circle, and went\non pawing and raking. With every pressure of my knee, how the floor\ncreaked! and every time I chanced to rake against any article, it seemed\nto give out thirty-five or thirty-six times more noise than it would\nhave done in the daytime. In those cases I always stopped and held\nmy breath till I was sure Harris had not awakened--then I crept along\nagain. I moved on and on, but I could not find the sock; I could not\nseem to find anything but furniture. I could not remember that there was\nmuch furniture in the room when I went to bed, but the place was alive\nwith it now --especially chairs--chairs everywhere--had a couple of\nfamilies moved in, in the mean time? And I never could seem to GLANCE on\none of those chairs, but always struck it full and square with my head.\nMy temper rose, by steady and sure degrees, and as I pawed on and on, I\nfell to making vicious comments under my breath.\n\n\n\nFinally, with a venomous access of irritation, I said I would leave\nwithout the sock; so I rose up and made straight for the door--as I\nsupposed--and suddenly confronted my dim spectral image in the unbroken\nmirror. It startled the breath out of me, for an instant; it also showed\nme that I was lost, and had no sort of idea where I was. When I realized\nthis, I was so angry that I had to sit down on the floor and take hold\nof something to keep from lifting the roof off with an explosion of\nopinion. If there had been only one mirror, it might possibly have\nhelped to locate me; but there were two, and two were as bad as a\nthousand; besides, these were on opposite sides of the room. I could see\nthe dim blur of the windows, but in my turned-around condition they were\nexactly where they ought not to be, and so they only confused me instead\nof helping me.\n\nI started to get up, and knocked down an umbrella; it made a noise\nlike a pistol-shot when it struck that hard, slick, carpetless floor;\nI grated my teeth and held my breath--Harris did not stir. I set the\numbrella slowly and carefully on end against the wall, but as soon as\nI took my hand away, its heel slipped from under it, and down it came\nagain with another bang. I shrunk together and listened a moment in\nsilent fury--no harm done, everything quiet. With the most painstaking\ncare and nicety, I stood the umbrella up once more, took my hand away,\nand down it came again.\n\nI have been strictly reared, but if it had not been so dark and solemn\nand awful there in that lonely, vast room, I do believe I should have\nsaid something then which could not be put into a Sunday-school book\nwithout injuring the sale of it. If my reasoning powers had not been\nalready sapped dry by my harassments, I would have known better than to\ntry to set an umbrella on end on one of those glassy German floors in\nthe dark; it can't be done in the daytime without four failures to one\nsuccess. I had one comfort, though--Harris was yet still and silent--he\nhad not stirred.\n\nThe umbrella could not locate me--there were four standing around the\nroom, and all alike. I thought I would feel along the wall and find the\ndoor in that way. I rose up and began this operation, but raked down\na picture. It was not a large one, but it made noise enough for a\npanorama. Harris gave out no sound, but I felt that if I experimented\nany further with the pictures I should be sure to wake him. Better give\nup trying to get out. Yes, I would find King Arthur's Round Table once\nmore--I had already found it several times--and use it for a base of\ndeparture on an exploring tour for my bed; if I could find my bed I\ncould then find my water pitcher; I would quench my raging thirst and\nturn in. So I started on my hands and knees, because I could go faster\nthat way, and with more confidence, too, and not knock down things. By\nand by I found the table--with my head--rubbed the bruise a little, then\nrose up and started, with hands abroad and fingers spread, to balance\nmyself. I found a chair; then a wall; then another chair; then a sofa;\nthen an alpenstock, then another sofa; this confounded me, for I had\nthought there was only one sofa. I hunted up the table again and took a\nfresh start; found some more chairs.\n\nIt occurred to me, now, as it ought to have done before, that as the\ntable was round, it was therefore of no value as a base to aim from; so\nI moved off once more, and at random among the wilderness of chairs and\nsofas--wandering off into unfamiliar regions, and presently knocked a\ncandlestick and knocked off a lamp, grabbed at the lamp and knocked\noff a water pitcher with a rattling crash, and thought to myself,\n\"I've found you at last--I judged I was close upon you.\" Harris shouted\n\"murder,\" and \"thieves,\" and finished with \"I'm absolutely drowned.\"\n\nThe crash had roused the house. Mr. X pranced in, in his long\nnight-garment, with a candle, young Z after him with another candle; a\nprocession swept in at another door, with candles and lanterns--landlord\nand two German guests in their nightgowns and a chambermaid in hers.\n\nI looked around; I was at Harris's bed, a Sabbath-day's journey from my\nown. There was only one sofa; it was against the wall; there was only\none chair where a body could get at it--I had been revolving around it\nlike a planet, and colliding with it like a comet half the night.\n\n\n\nI explained how I had been employing myself, and why. Then the\nlandlord's party left, and the rest of us set about our preparations for\nbreakfast, for the dawn was ready to break. I glanced furtively at my\npedometer, and found I had made 47 miles. But I did not care, for I had\ncome out for a pedestrian tour anyway.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n[Rafting Down the Neckar]\n\n\nWhen the landlord learned that I and my agents were artists, our party\nrose perceptibly in his esteem; we rose still higher when he learned\nthat we were making a pedestrian tour of Europe.\n\nHe told us all about the Heidelberg road, and which were the best places\nto avoid and which the best ones to tarry at; he charged me less than\ncost for the things I broke in the night; he put up a fine luncheon\nfor us and added to it a quantity of great light-green plums, the\npleasantest fruit in Germany; he was so anxious to do us honor that he\nwould not allow us to walk out of Heilbronn, but called up Goetz von\nBerlichingen's horse and cab and made us ride.\n\nI made a sketch of the turnout. It is not a Work, it is only what\nartists call a \"study\"--a thing to make a finished picture from. This\nsketch has several blemishes in it; for instance, the wagon is not\ntraveling as fast as the horse is. This is wrong. Again, the person\ntrying to get out of the way is too small; he is out of perspective,\nas we say. The two upper lines are not the horse's back, they are the\nreigns; there seems to be a wheel missing--this would be corrected in a\nfinished Work, of course. This thing flying out behind is not a flag,\nit is a curtain. That other thing up there is the sun, but I didn't get\nenough distance on it. I do not remember, now, what that thing is that\nis in front of the man who is running, but I think it is a haystack or a\nwoman. This study was exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1879, but did not\ntake any medal; they do not give medals for studies.\n\n\n\nWe discharged the carriage at the bridge. The river was full of\nlogs--long, slender, barkless pine logs--and we leaned on the rails\nof the bridge, and watched the men put them together into rafts. These\nrafts were of a shape and construction to suit the crookedness and\nextreme narrowness of the Neckar. They were from fifty to one hundred\nyards long, and they gradually tapered from a nine-log breadth at their\nsterns, to a three-log breadth at their bow-ends. The main part of the\nsteering is done at the bow, with a pole; the three-log breadth there\nfurnishes room for only the steersman, for these little logs are not\nlarger around than an average young lady's waist. The connections of the\nseveral sections of the raft are slack and pliant, so that the raft\nmay be readily bent into any sort of curve required by the shape of the\nriver.\n\nThe Neckar is in many places so narrow that a person can throw a dog\nacross it, if he has one; when it is also sharply curved in such places,\nthe raftsman has to do some pretty nice snug piloting to make the turns.\nThe river is not always allowed to spread over its whole bed--which is\nas much as thirty, and sometimes forty yards wide--but is split into\nthree equal bodies of water, by stone dikes which throw the main\nvolume, depth, and current into the central one. In low water these neat\nnarrow-edged dikes project four or five inches above the surface, like\nthe comb of a submerged roof, but in high water they are overflowed. A\nhatful of rain makes high water in the Neckar, and a basketful produces\nan overflow.\n\nThere are dikes abreast the Schloss Hotel, and the current is violently\nswift at that point. I used to sit for hours in my glass cage, watching\nthe long, narrow rafts slip along through the central channel, grazing\nthe right-bank dike and aiming carefully for the middle arch of the\nstone bridge below; I watched them in this way, and lost all this time\nhoping to see one of them hit the bridge-pier and wreck itself sometime\nor other, but was always disappointed. One was smashed there one\nmorning, but I had just stepped into my room a moment to light a pipe,\nso I lost it.\n\nWhile I was looking down upon the rafts that morning in Heilbronn, the\ndaredevil spirit of adventure came suddenly upon me, and I said to my\ncomrades:\n\n\"I am going to Heidelberg on a raft. Will you venture with me?\"\n\nTheir faces paled a little, but they assented with as good a grace as\nthey could. Harris wanted to cable his mother--thought it his duty to\ndo that, as he was all she had in this world--so, while he attended to\nthis, I went down to the longest and finest raft and hailed the captain\nwith a hearty \"Ahoy, shipmate!\" which put us upon pleasant terms at\nonce, and we entered upon business. I said we were on a pedestrian tour\nto Heidelberg, and would like to take passage with him. I said this\npartly through young Z, who spoke German very well, and partly through\nMr. X, who spoke it peculiarly. I can UNDERSTAND German as well as the\nmaniac that invented it, but I TALK it best through an interpreter.\n\nThe captain hitched up his trousers, then shifted his quid thoughtfully.\nPresently he said just what I was expecting he would say--that he had no\nlicense to carry passengers, and therefore was afraid the law would be\nafter him in case the matter got noised about or any accident happened.\nSo I CHARTERED the raft and the crew and took all the responsibilities\non myself.\n\n\n\nWith a rattling song the starboard watch bent to their work and hove\nthe cable short, then got the anchor home, and our bark moved off with a\nstately stride, and soon was bowling along at about two knots an hour.\n\nOur party were grouped amidships. At first the talk was a little gloomy,\nand ran mainly upon the shortness of life, the uncertainty of it, the\nperils which beset it, and the need and wisdom of being always prepared\nfor the worst; this shaded off into low-voiced references to the dangers\nof the deep, and kindred matters; but as the gray east began to redden\nand the mysterious solemnity and silence of the dawn to give place\nto the joy-songs of the birds, the talk took a cheerier tone, and our\nspirits began to rise steadily.\n\nGermany, in the summer, is the perfection of the beautiful, but nobody\nhas understood, and realized, and enjoyed the utmost possibilities of\nthis soft and peaceful beauty unless he has voyaged down the Neckar on\na raft. The motion of a raft is the needful motion; it is gentle,\nand gliding, and smooth, and noiseless; it calms down all feverish\nactivities, it soothes to sleep all nervous hurry and impatience; under\nits restful influence all the troubles and vexations and sorrows that\nharass the mind vanish away, and existence becomes a dream, a charm,\na deep and tranquil ecstasy. How it contrasts with hot and perspiring\npedestrianism, and dusty and deafening railroad rush, and tedious\njolting behind tired horses over blinding white roads!\n\nWe went slipping silently along, between the green and fragrant banks,\nwith a sense of pleasure and contentment that grew, and grew, all the\ntime. Sometimes the banks were overhung with thick masses of willows\nthat wholly hid the ground behind; sometimes we had noble hills on one\nhand, clothed densely with foliage to their tops, and on the other hand\nopen levels blazing with poppies, or clothed in the rich blue of\nthe corn-flower; sometimes we drifted in the shadow of forests, and\nsometimes along the margin of long stretches of velvety grass, fresh and\ngreen and bright, a tireless charm to the eye. And the birds!--they were\neverywhere; they swept back and forth across the river constantly, and\ntheir jubilant music was never stilled.\n\nIt was a deep and satisfying pleasure to see the sun create the new\nmorning, and gradually, patiently, lovingly, clothe it on with splendor\nafter splendor, and glory after glory, till the miracle was complete.\nHow different is this marvel observed from a raft, from what it is when\none observes it through the dingy windows of a railway-station in some\nwretched village while he munches a petrified sandwich and waits for the\ntrain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's A Tramp Abroad, by Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)\n\n\n\n"}

Instead of\nfeeling complimented when we are called an ass, we are left in \ndoubt.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nA person who is ignorant of legal matters is always liable to make\nmistakes when he tries to photograph a court scene with his pen; and so\nI was not willing to let the law chapters in this book go to press\nwithout first subjecting them to rigid and exhausting revision and\ncorrection by a trained barrister--if that is what they are called.\nThese chapters are right, now, in every detail, for they were rewritten\nunder the immediate eye of William Hicks, who studied law part of a\nwhile in southwest Missouri thirty-five years ago and then came over\nhere to Florence for his health and is still helping for exercise and\nboard in Macaroni Vermicelli's horse-feed shed which is up the back\nalley as you turn around the corner out of the Piazza del Duomo just\nbeyond the house where that stone that Dante used to sit on six hundred\nyears ago is let into the wall when he let on to be watching them build\nGiotto's campanile and yet always got tired looking as soon as Beatrice\npassed along on her way to get a chunk of chestnut cake to defend\nherself with in case of a Ghibelline outbreak before she got to school,\nat the same old stand where they sell the same old cake to this day and\nit is just as light and good as it was then, too, and this is not\nflattery, far from it. He was a little rusty on his law, but he rubbed\nup for this book, and those two or three legal chapters are right and\nstraight, now. He told me so himself.\n\nGiven under my hand this second day of January, 1893, at the Villa\nViviani, village of Settignano, three miles back of Florence, on the\nhills--the same certainly affording the most charming view to be found\non this planet, and with it the most dreamlike and enchanting sunsets to\nbe found in any planet or even in any solar system--and given, too, in\nthe swell room of the house, with the busts of Cerretani senators and\nother grandees of this line looking approvingly down upon me as they\nused to look down upon Dante, and mutely asking me to adopt them into my\nfamily, which I do with pleasure, for my remotest ancestors are but\nspring chickens compared with these robed and stately antiques, and it\nwill be a great and satisfying lift for me, that six hundred years will.\n\nMark Twain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nPudd'nhead Wins His Name.\n\nTell the truth or trump--but get the trick.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's\nCalendar.\n\nThe scene of this chronicle is the town of Dawson's Landing, on the\nMissouri side of the Mississippi, half a day's journey, per steamboat,\nbelow St. Louis.\n\nIn 1830 it was a snug little collection of modest one- and two-story\nframe dwellings whose whitewashed exteriors were almost concealed from\nsight by climbing tangles of rose-vines, honeysuckles, and\nmorning-glories. Each of these pretty homes had a garden in front fenced\nwith white palings and opulently stocked with hollyhocks, marigolds,\ntouch-me-nots, prince's-feathers and other old-fashioned flowers; while\non the window-sills of the houses stood wooden boxes containing\nmoss-rose plants and terra-cotta pots in which grew a breed of geranium\nwhose spread of intensely red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tint\nof the rose-clad house-front like an explosion of flame. When there was\nroom on the ledge outside of the pots and boxes for a cat, the cat was\nthere--in sunny weather--stretched at full length, asleep and blissful,\nwith her furry belly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose. Then\nthat house was complete, and its contentment and peace were made\nmanifest to the world by this symbol, whose testimony is infallible. A\nhome without a cat--and a well-fed, well-petted and properly revered\ncat--may be a perfect home, perhaps, but how can it prove title?\n\nAll along the streets, on both sides, at the outer edge of the brick\nsidewalks, stood locust-trees with trunks protected by wooden boxing,\nand these furnished shade for summer and a sweet fragrance in spring\nwhen the clusters of buds came forth. The main street, one block back\nfrom the river, and running parallel with it, was the sole business\nstreet. It was six blocks long, and in each block two or three brick\nstores three stories high towered above interjected bunches of little\nframe shops. Swinging signs creaked in the wind, the street's whole\nlength. The candy-striped pole which indicates nobility proud and\nancient along the palace-bordered canals of Venice, indicated merely the\nhumble barber shop along the main street of Dawson's Landing. On a chief\ncorner stood a lofty unpainted pole wreathed from top to bottom with tin\npots and pans and cups, the chief tinmonger's noisy notice to the world\n(when the wind blew) that his shop was on hand for business at that\ncorner.\n\nThe hamlet's front was washed by the clear waters of the great river;\nits body stretched itself rearward up a gentle incline; its most\nrearward border fringed itself out and scattered its houses about the\nbase-line of the hills; the hills rose high, inclosing the town in a\nhalf-moon curve, clothed with forests from foot to summit.\n\nSteamboats passed up and down every hour or so. Those belonging to the\nlittle Cairo line and the little Memphis line always stopped; the big\nOrleans liners stopped for hails only, or to land passengers or freight;\nand this was the case also with the great flotilla of \"transients.\"\nThese latter came out of a dozen rivers--the Illinois, the Missouri, the\nUpper Mississippi, the Ohio, the Monongahela, the Tennessee, the Red\nRiver, the White River, and so on; and were bound every whither and\nstocked with every imaginable comfort or necessity which the\nMississippi's communities could want, from the frosty Falls of St.\nAnthony down through nine climates to torrid New Orleans.\n\nDawson's Landing was a slaveholding town, with a rich slave-worked grain\nand pork country back of it. The town was sleepy and comfortable and\ncontented. It was fifty years old, and was growing slowly--very slowly,\nin fact, but still it was growing.\n\nThe chief citizen was York Leicester Driscoll, about forty years old,\njudge of the county court. He was very proud of his old Virginian\nancestry, and in his hospitalities and his rather formal and stately\nmanners he kept up its traditions. He was fine and just and generous. To\nbe a gentleman--a gentleman without stain or blemish--was his only\nreligion, and to it he was always faithful. He was respected, esteemed\nand beloved by all the community. He was well off, and was gradually\nadding to his store. He and his wife were very nearly happy, but not\nquite, for they had no children. The longing for the treasure of a child\nhad grown stronger and stronger as the years slipped away, but the\nblessing never came--and was never to come.\n\nWith this pair lived the Judge's widowed sister, Mrs. Rachel Pratt, and\nshe also was childless--childless, and sorrowful for that reason, and\nnot to be comforted. The women were good and commonplace people, and did\ntheir duty and had their reward in clear consciences and the community's\napprobation. They were Presbyterians, the Judge was a free-thinker.\n\nPembroke Howard, lawyer and bachelor, aged about forty, was another old\nVirginian grandee with proved descent from the First Families. He was a\nfine, brave, majestic creature, a gentleman according to the nicest\nrequirements of the Virginia rule, a devoted Presbyterian, an authority\non the \"code,\" and a man always courteously ready to stand up before you\nin the field if any act or word of his had seemed doubtful or suspicious\nto you, and explain it with any weapon you might prefer from brad-awls\nto artillery. He was very popular with the people, and was the Judge's\ndearest friend.\n\nThen there was Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex, another F. F. V. of\nformidable caliber--however, with him we have no concern.\n\nPercy Northumberland Driscoll, brother to the Judge, and younger than he\nby five years, was a married man, and had had children around his\nhearthstone; but they were attacked in detail by measles, croup and\nscarlet fever, and this had given the doctor a chance with his effective\nantediluvian methods; so the cradles were empty. He was a prosperous\nman, with a good head for speculations, and his fortune was growing. On\nthe 1st of February, 1830, two boy babes were born in his house: one to\nhim, the other to one of his slave girls, Roxana by name. Roxana was\ntwenty years old. She was up and around the same day, with her hands\nfull, for she was tending both babies.\n\nMrs. Percy Driscoll died within the week. Roxy remained in charge of the\nchildren. She had her own way, for Mr. Driscoll soon absorbed himself in\nhis speculations and left her to her own devices.\n\nIn that same month of February, Dawson's Landing gained a new citizen.\nThis was Mr. David Wilson, a young fellow of Scotch parentage. He had\nwandered to this remote region from his birthplace in the interior of\nthe State of New York, to seek his fortune. He was twenty-five years\nold, college-bred, and had finished a post-college course in an Eastern\nlaw school a couple of years before.\n\nHe was a homely, freckled, sandy-haired young fellow, with an\nintelligent blue eye that had frankness and comradeship in it and a\ncovert twinkle of a pleasant sort. But for an unfortunate remark of his,\nhe would no doubt have entered at once upon a successful career at\nDawson's Landing. But he made his fatal remark the first day he spent in\nthe village, and it \"gaged\" him. He had just made the acquaintance of a\ngroup of citizens when an invisible dog began to yelp and snarl and howl\nand make himself very comprehensively disagreeable, whereupon young\nWilson said, much as one who is thinking aloud--\n\n\"I wish I owned half of that dog.\"\n\n\"Why?\" somebody asked.\n\n\"Because I would kill my half.\"\n\nThe group searched his face with curiosity, with anxiety even, but found\nno light there, no expression that they could read. They fell away from\nhim as from something uncanny, and went into privacy to discuss him. One\nsaid:\n\n\"'Pears to be a fool.\"\n\n\"'Pears?\" said another. \"Is, I reckon you better say.\"\n\n\"Said he wished he owned half of the dog, the idiot,\" said a third.\n\"What did he reckon would become of the other half if he killed his\nhalf? Do you reckon he thought it would live?\"\n\n\"Why, he must have thought it, unless he is the downrightest fool in the\nworld; because if he hadn't thought it, he would have wanted to own the\nwhole dog, knowing that if he killed his half and the other half died,\nhe would be responsible for that half just the same as if he had killed\nthat half instead of his own. Don't it look that way to you, gents?\"\n\n\"Yes, it does. If he owned one half of the general dog, it would be so;\nif he owned one end of the dog and another person owned the other end,\nit would be so, just the same; particularly in the first case, because\nif you kill one half of a general dog, there ain't any man that can tell\nwhose half it was, but if he owned one end of the dog, maybe he could\nkill his end of it and--\"\n\n\"No, he couldn't either; he couldn't and not be responsible if the other\nend died, which it would. In my opinion that man ain't in his right\nmind.\"\n\n\"In my opinion he hain't got any mind.\"\n\nNo. 3 said: \"Well, he's a lummox, anyway.\"\n\n\"That's what he is,\" said No. 4, \"he's a labrick--just a Simon-pure\nlabrick, if ever there was one.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, he's a dam fool, that's the way I put him up,\" said No. 5.\n\"Anybody can think different that wants to, but those are my\nsentiments.\"\n\n\"I'm with you, gentlemen,\" said No. 6. \"Perfect jackass--yes, and it\nain't going too far to say he is a pudd'nhead. If he ain't a pudd'nhead,\nI ain't no judge, that's all.\"\n\nMr. Wilson stood elected. The incident was told all over the town, and\ngravely discussed by everybody. Within a week he had lost his first\nname; Pudd'nhead took its place. In time he came to be liked, and well\nliked too; but by that time the nickname had got well stuck on, and it\nstayed. That first day's verdict made him a fool, and he was not able to\nget it set aside, or even modified. The nickname soon ceased to carry\nany harsh or unfriendly feeling with it, but it held its place, and was\nto continue to hold its place for twenty long years.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nDriscoll Spares His Slaves.\n\nAdam was but human--this explains it all. He did not want the apple for\nthe apple's sake, he wanted it only because it was forbidden. The\nmistake was in not forbidding the serpent; then he would have eaten the\nserpent.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nPudd'nhead Wilson had a trifle of money when he arrived, and he bought a\nsmall house on the extreme western verge of the town. Between it and\nJudge Driscoll's house there was only a grassy yard, with a paling fence\ndividing the properties in the middle. He hired a small office down in\nthe town and hung out a tin sign with these words on it:\n\nDAVID WILSON.\n\nATTORNEY AND COUNSELOR-AT-LAW.\nSURVEYING, CONVEYANCING, ETC.\n\nBut his deadly remark had ruined his chance--at least in the law. No\nclients came. He took down his sign, after a while, and put it up on his\nown house with the law features knocked out of it. It offered his\nservices now in the humble capacities of land-surveyor and expert\naccountant. Now and then he got a job of surveying to do, and now and\nthen a merchant got him to straighten out his books. With Scotch\npatience and pluck he resolved to live down his reputation and work his\nway into the legal field yet. Poor fellow, he could not foresee that it\nwas going to take him such a weary long time to do it.\n\nHe had a rich abundance of idle time, but it never hung heavy on his\nhands, for he interested himself in every new thing that was born into\nthe universe of ideas, and studied it and experimented upon it at his\nhouse. One of his pet fads was palmistry. To another one he gave no\nname, neither would he explain to anybody what its purpose was, but\nmerely said it was an amusement. In fact he had found that his fads\nadded to his reputation as a pudd'nhead; therefore he was growing chary\nof being too communicative about them. The fad without a name was one\nwhich dealt with people's finger-marks. He carried in his coat pocket a\nshallow box with grooves in it, and in the grooves strips of glass five\ninches long and three inches wide. Along the lower edge of each strip\nwas pasted a slip of white paper. He asked people to pass their hands\nthrough their hair (thus collecting upon them a thin coating of the\nnatural oil) and then make a thumb-mark on a glass strip, following it\nwith the mark of the ball of each finger in succession. Under this row\nof faint grease-prints he would write a record on the strip of white\npaper--thus:\n\nJohn Smith, right hand--\n\nand add the day of the month and the year, then take Smith's left hand\non another glass strip, and add name and date and the words \"left hand.\"\nThe strips were now returned to the grooved box, and took their place\namong what Wilson called his \"records.\"\n\nHe often studied his records, examining and poring over them with\nabsorbing interest until far into the night; but what he found there--if\nhe found anything--he revealed to no one. Sometimes he copied on paper\nthe involved and delicate pattern left by the ball of a finger, and then\nvastly enlarged it with a pantograph so that he could examine its web of\ncurving lines with ease and convenience.\n\nOne sweltering afternoon--it was the first day of July, 1830--he was at\nwork over a set of tangled account-books in his work-room, which looked\nwestward over a stretch of vacant lots, when a conversation outside\ndisturbed him. It was carried on in yells, which showed that the people\nengaged in it were not close together:\n\n\"Say, Roxy, how does yo' baby come on?\" This from the distant voice.\n\n\"Fust-rate; how does you come on, Jasper?\" This yell was from close by.\n\n\"Oh, I's middlin'; hain't got noth'n' to complain of. I's gwine to come\na-court'n' you bimeby, Roxy.\"\n\n\"You is, you black mud-cat! Yah--yah--yah! I got somep'n' better to do\nden 'sociat'n' wid niggers as black as you is. Is ole Miss Cooper's\nNancy done give you de mitten?\" Roxy followed this sally with another\ndischarge of care-free laughter.\n\n\"You's jealous, Roxy, dat's what's de matter wid you, you\nhussy--yah--yah--yah! Dat's de time I got you!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you got me, hain't you. 'Clah to goodness if dat conceit o'\nyo'n strikes in, Jasper, it gwine to kill you sho'. If you b'longed to\nme I'd sell you down de river 'fo' you git too fur gone. Fust time I\nruns acrost yo' marster, I's gwine to tell him so.\"\n\nThis idle and aimless jabber went on and on, both parties enjoying the\nfriendly duel and each well satisfied with his own share of the wit\nexchanged--for wit they considered it.\n\nWilson stepped to the window to observe the combatants; he could not\nwork while their chatter continued. Over in the vacant lots was Jasper,\nyoung, coal-black and of magnificent build, sitting on a wheelbarrow in\nthe pelting sun--at work, supposably, whereas he was in fact only\npreparing for it by taking an hour's rest before beginning. In front of\nWilson's porch stood Roxy, with a local hand-made baby-wagon, in which\nsat her two charges--one at each end and facing each other. From Roxy's\nmanner of speech, a stranger would have expected her to be black, but\nshe was not. Only one sixteenth of her was black, and that sixteenth did\nnot show. She was of majestic form and stature, her attitudes were\nimposing and statuesque, and her gestures and movements distinguished by\na noble and stately grace. Her complexion was very fair, with the rosy\nglow of vigorous health in the cheeks, her face was full of character\nand expression, her eyes were brown and liquid, and she had a heavy suit\nof fine soft hair which was also brown, but the fact was not apparent\nbecause her head was bound about with a checkered handkerchief and the\nhair was concealed under it. Her face was shapely, intelligent and\ncomely--even beautiful. She had an easy, independent carriage--when she\nwas among her own caste--and a high and \"sassy\" way, withal; but of\ncourse she was meek and humble enough where white people were.\n\nTo all intents and purposes Roxy was as white as anybody, but the one\nsixteenth of her which was black outvoted the other fifteen parts and\nmade her a negro. She was a slave, and salable as such. Her child was\nthirty-one parts white, and he, too, was a slave, and by a fiction of\nlaw and custom a negro. He had blue eyes and flaxen curls like his white\ncomrade, but even the father of the white child was able to tell the\nchildren apart--little as he had commerce with them--by their clothes:\nfor the white babe wore ruffled soft muslin and a coral necklace, while\nthe other wore merely a coarse tow-linen shirt which barely reached to\nits knees, and no jewelry.\n\nThe white child's name was Thomas \u00e0 Becket Driscoll, the other's name\nwas Valet de Chambre: no surname--slaves hadn't the privilege. Roxana\nhad heard that phrase somewhere, the fine sound of it had pleased her\near, and as she had supposed it was a name, she loaded it on to her\ndarling. It soon got shorted to \"Chambers,\" of course.\n\nWilson knew Roxy by sight, and when the duel of wit began to play out,\nhe stepped outside to gather in a record or two. Jasper went to work\nenergetically, at once, perceiving that his leisure was observed. Wilson\ninspected the children and asked--\n\n\"How old are they, Roxy?\"\n\n\"Bofe de same age, sir--five months. Bawn de fust o' Feb'uary.\"\n\n\"They're handsome little chaps. One's just as handsome as the other,\ntoo.\"\n\nA delighted smile exposed the girl's white teeth, and she said:\n\n\"Bless yo' soul, Misto Wilson, it's pow'ful nice o' you to say dat,\n'ca'se one of 'em ain't on'y a nigger. Mighty prime little nigger, I\nal'ays says, but dat's 'ca'se it's mine, o' course.\"\n\n\"How do you tell them apart, Roxy, when they haven't any clothes on?\"\n\nRoxy laughed a laugh proportioned to her size, and said:\n\n\"Oh, I kin tell 'em 'part, Misto Wilson, but I bet Marse Percy couldn't,\nnot to save his life.\"\n\nWilson chatted along for awhile, and presently got Roxy's finger-prints\nfor his collection--right hand and left--on a couple of his glass\nstrips; then labeled and dated them, and took the \"records\" of both\nchildren, and labeled and dated them also.\n\nTwo months later, on the 3d of September, he took this trio of\nfinger-marks again. He liked to have a \"series,\" two or three \"takings\"\nat intervals during the period of childhood, these to be followed by\nothers at intervals of several years.\n\nThe next day--that is to say, on the 4th of September--something\noccurred which profoundly impressed Roxana. Mr. Driscoll missed another\nsmall sum of money--which is a way of saying that this was not a new\nthing, but had happened before. In truth it had happened three times\nbefore. Driscoll's patience was exhausted. He was a fairly humane man\ntoward slaves and other animals; he was an exceedingly humane man toward\nthe erring of his own race. Theft he could not abide, and plainly there\nwas a thief in his house. Necessarily the thief must be one of his\nnegroes. Sharp measures must be taken. He called his servants before\nhim. There were three of these, besides Roxy: a man, a woman, and a boy\ntwelve years old. They were not related. Mr. Driscoll said:\n\n\"You have all been warned before. It has done no good. This time I will\nteach you a lesson. I will sell the thief. Which of you is the guilty\none?\"\n\nThey all shuddered at the threat, for here they had a good home, and a\nnew one was likely to be a change for the worse. The denial was general.\nNone had stolen anything--not money, anyway--a little sugar, or cake, or\nhoney, or something like that, that \"Marse Percy wouldn't mind or miss,\"\nbut not money--never a cent of money. They were eloquent in their\nprotestations, but Mr. Driscoll was not moved by them. He answered each\nin turn with a stern \"Name the thief!\"\n\nThe truth was, all were guilty but Roxana; she suspected that the others\nwere guilty, but she did not know them to be so. She was horrified to\nthink how near she had come to being guilty herself; she had been saved\nin the nick of time by a revival in the colored Methodist Church, a\nfortnight before, at which time and place she \"got religion.\" The very\nnext day after that gracious experience, while her change of style was\nfresh upon her and she was vain of her purified condition, her master\nleft a couple dollars lying unprotected on his desk, and she happened\nupon that temptation when she was polishing around with a dust-rag. She\nlooked at the money awhile with a steady rising resentment, then she\nburst out with--\n\n\"Dad blame dat revival, I wisht it had 'a' be'n put off till to-morrow!\"\n\nThen she covered the tempter with a book, and another member of the\nkitchen cabinet got it. She made this sacrifice as a matter of religious\netiquette; as a thing necessary just now, but by no means to be wrested\ninto a precedent; no, a week or two would limber up her piety, then she\nwould be rational again, and the next two dollars that got left out in\nthe cold would find a comforter--and she could name the comforter.\n\nWas she bad? Was she worse than the general run of her race? No. They\nhad an unfair show in the battle of life, and they held it no sin to\ntake military advantage of the enemy--in a small way; in a small way,\nbut not in a large one. They would smouch provisions from the pantry\nwhenever they got a chance; or a brass thimble, or a cake of wax, or an\nemery-bag, or a paper of needles, or a silver spoon, or a dollar bill,\nor small articles of clothing, or any other property of light value; and\nso far were they from considering such reprisals sinful, that they would\ngo to church and shout and pray the loudest and sincerest with their\nplunder in their pockets. A farm smoke-house had to be kept heavily\npadlocked, for even the colored deacon himself could not resist a ham\nwhen Providence showed him in a dream, or otherwise, where such a thing\nhung lonesome and longed for some one to love. But with a hundred\nhanging before him the deacon would not take two--that is, on the same\nnight. On frosty nights the humane negro prowler would warm the end of a\nplank and put it up under the cold claws of chickens roosting in a tree;\na drowsy hen would step on to the comfortable board, softly clucking her\ngratitude, and the prowler would dump her into his bag, and later into\nhis stomach, perfectly sure that in taking this trifle from the man who\ndaily robbed him of an inestimable treasure--his liberty--he was not\ncommitting any sin that God would remember against him in the Last Great\nDay.\n\n\"Name the thief!\"\n\nFor the fourth time Mr. Driscoll had said it, and always in the same\nhard tone. And now he added these words of awful import:\n\n\"I give you one minute\"--he took out his watch. \"If at the end of that\ntime you have not confessed, I will not only sell all four of you,\nbut--I will sell you down the river!\"\n\nIt was equivalent to condemning them to hell! No Missouri negro doubted\nthis. Roxy reeled in her tracks and the color vanished out of her face;\nthe others dropped to their knees as if they had been shot; tears gushed\nfrom their eyes, their supplicating hands went up, and three answers\ncame in the one instant:\n\n\"I done it!\"\n\n\"I done it!\"\n\n\"I done it!--have mercy, marster--Lord have mercy on us po' niggers!\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the master, putting up his watch, \"I will sell you\nhere though you don't deserve it. You ought to be sold down the river.\"\n\nThe culprits flung themselves prone, in an ecstasy of gratitude, and\nkissed his feet, declaring that they would never forget his goodness and\nnever cease to pray for him as long as they lived. They were sincere,\nfor like a god he had stretched forth his mighty hand and closed the\ngates of hell against them. He knew, himself, that he had done a noble\nand gracious thing, and was privately well pleased with his magnanimity;\nand that night he set the incident down in his diary, so that his son\nmight read it in after years, and be thereby moved to deeds of\ngentleness and humanity himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nRoxy Plays a Shrewd Trick.\n\nWhoever has lived long enough to find out what life is, knows how deep a\ndebt of gratitude we owe to Adam, the first great benefactor of our\nrace. He brought death into the world.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nPercy Driscoll slept well the night he saved his house-minions from\ngoing down the river, but no wink of sleep visited Roxy's eyes. A\nprofound terror had taken possession of her. Her child could grow up and\nbe sold down the river! The thought crazed her with horror. If she dozed\nand lost herself for a moment, the next moment she was on her feet\nflying to her child's cradle to see if it was still there. Then she\nwould gather it to her heart and pour out her love upon it in a frenzy\nof kisses, moaning, crying, and saying, \"Dey sha'n't, oh, dey\nsha'n't!--yo' po' mammy will kill you fust!\"\n\nOnce, when she was tucking it back in its cradle again, the other child\nnestled in its sleep and attracted her attention. She went and stood\nover it a long time communing with herself:\n\n\"What has my po' baby done, dat he couldn't have yo' luck? He hain't\ndone noth'n'. God was good to you; why warn't he good to him? Dey can't\nsell you down de river. I hates yo' pappy; he hain't got no heart--for\nniggers he hain't, anyways. I hates him, en I could kill him!\" She\npaused awhile, thinking; then she burst into wild sobbings again, and\nturned away, saying, \"Oh, I got to kill my chile, dey ain't no yuther\nway,--killin' him wouldn't save de chile fum goin' down de river. Oh, I\ngot to do it, yo' po' mammy's got to kill you to save you, honey\"--she\ngathered her baby to her bosom, now, and began to smother it with\ncaresses--\"Mammy's got to kill you--how kin I do it! But yo' mammy ain't\ngwine to desert you--no, no; dah, don't cry--she gwine wid you, she\ngwine to kill herself too. Come along, honey, come along wid mammy; we\ngwine to jump in de river, den de troubles o' dis worl' is all over--dey\ndon't sell po' niggers down the river over yonder.\"\n\nShe started toward the door, crooning to the child and hushing it;\nmidway she stopped, suddenly. She had caught sight of her new Sunday\ngown--a cheap curtain-calico thing, a conflagration of gaudy colors and\nfantastic figures. She surveyed it wistfully, longingly.\n\n\"Hain't ever wore it yet,\" she said, \"en it's jist lovely.\" Then she\nnodded her head in response to a pleasant idea, and added, \"No, I ain't\ngwine to be fished out, wid everybody lookin' at me, in dis mis'able ole\nlinsey-woolsey.\"\n\nShe put down the child and made the change. She looked in the glass and\nwas astonished at her beauty. She resolved to make her death-toilet\nperfect. She took off her handkerchief-turban and dressed her glossy\nwealth of hair \"like white folks\"; she added some odds and ends of\nrather lurid ribbon and a spray of atrocious artificial flowers; finally\nshe threw over her shoulders a fluffy thing called a \"cloud\" in that\nday, which was of a blazing red complexion. Then she was ready for the\ntomb.\n\nShe gathered up her baby once more; but when her eye fell upon its\nmiserably short little gray tow-linen shirt and noted the contrast\nbetween its pauper shabbiness and her own volcanic irruption of infernal\nsplendors, her mother-heart was touched, and she was ashamed.\n\n\"No, dolling, mammy ain't gwine to treat you so. De angels is gwine to\n'mire you jist as much as dey does yo' mammy. Ain't gwine to have 'em\nputt'n' dey han's up 'fo' dey eyes en sayin' to David en Goliah en dem\nyuther prophets, 'Dat chile is dress' too indelicate fo' dis place.'\"\n\nBy this time she had stripped off the shirt. Now she clothed the naked\nlittle creature in one of Thomas \u00e0 Becket's snowy long baby-gowns, with\nits bright blue bows and dainty flummery of ruffles.\n\n\"Dah--now you's fixed.\" She propped the child in a chair and stood off\nto inspect it. Straightway her eyes began to widen with astonishment and\nadmiration, and she clapped her hands and cried out, \"Why, it do beat\nall!--I never knowed you was so lovely. Marse Tommy ain't a bit\nputtier--not a single bit.\"\n\nShe stepped over and glanced at the other infant; she flung a glance\nback at her own; then one more at the heir of the house. Now a strange\nlight dawned in her eyes, and in a moment she was lost in thought. She\nseemed in a trance; when she came out of it she muttered, \"When I 'uz\na-washin' 'em in de tub, yistiddy, his own pappy asked me which of 'em\nwas his'n.\"\n\nShe began to move about like one in a dream. She undressed Thomas \u00e0\nBecket, stripping him of everything, and put the tow-linen shirt on him.\nShe put his coral necklace on her own child's neck. Then she placed the\nchildren side by side, and after earnest inspection she muttered--\n\n\"Now who would b'lieve clo'es could do de like o' dat? Dog my cats if it\nain't all I kin do to tell t'other fum which, let alone his pappy.\"\n\nShe put her cub in Tommy's elegant cradle and said--\n\n\"You's young Marse Tom fum dis out, en I got to practise and git used to\n'memberin' to call you dat, honey, or I's gwine to make a mistake some\ntime en git us bofe into trouble. Dah--now you lay still en don't fret\nno mo', Marse Tom--oh, thank de good Lord in heaven, you's saved, you's\nsaved!--dey ain't no man kin ever sell mammy's po' little honey down de\nriver now!\"\n\nShe put the heir of the house in her own child's unpainted pine cradle,\nand said, contemplating its slumbering form uneasily--\n\n\"I's sorry for you, honey; I's sorry, God knows I is,--but what kin I\ndo, what could I do? Yo' pappy would sell him to somebody, some time, en\nden he'd go down de river, sho', en I couldn't, couldn't, couldn't stan'\nit.\"\n\nShe flung herself on her bed and began to think and toss, toss and\nthink. By and by she sat suddenly upright, for a comforting thought had\nflown through her worried mind--\n\n\"'Tain't no sin--white folks has done it! It ain't no sin, glory to\ngoodness it ain't no sin! Dey's done it--yes, en dey was de biggest\nquality in de whole bilin', too--kings!\"\n\nShe began to muse; she was trying to gather out of her memory the dim\nparticulars of some tale she had heard some time or other. At last she\nsaid--\n\n\"Now I's got it; now I 'member. It was dat ole nigger preacher dat tole\nit, de time he come over here fum Illinois en preached in de nigger\nchurch. He said dey ain't nobody kin save his own self--can't do it by\nfaith, can't do it by works, can't do it no way at all. Free grace is de\non'y way, en dat don't come fum nobody but jis' de Lord; en he kin give\nit to anybody he please, saint or sinner--he don't kyer. He do jis' as\nhe's a mineter. He s'lect out anybody dat suit him, en put another one\nin his place, and make de fust one happy forever en leave t'other one to\nburn wid Satan. De preacher said it was jist like dey done in Englan'\none time, long time ago. De queen she lef' her baby layin' aroun' one\nday, en went out callin'; en one o' de niggers roun'-'bout de place dat\nwas 'mos' white, she come in en see de chile layin' aroun', en tuck en\nput her own chile's clo'es on de queen's chile, en put de queen's\nchile's clo'es on her own chile, en den lef' her own chile layin' aroun'\nen tuck en toted de queen's chile home to de nigger-quarter, en nobody\never foun' it out, en her chile was de king bimeby, en sole de queen's\nchile down de river one time when dey had to settle up de estate. Dah,\nnow--de preacher said it his own self, en it ain't no sin, 'ca'se white\nfolks done it. Dey done it--yes, dey done it; en not on'y jis' common\nwhite folks nuther, but de biggest quality dey is in de whole bilin'.\nOh, I's so glad I 'member 'bout dat!\"\n\nShe got up light-hearted and happy, and went to the cradles and spent\nwhat was left of the night \"practising.\" She would give her own child a\nlight pat and say humbly, \"Lay still, Marse Tom,\" then give the real Tom\na pat and say with severity, \"Lay still, Chambers!--does you want me to\ntake somep'n' to you?\"\n\nAs she progressed with her practice, she was surprised to see how\nsteadily and surely the awe which had kept her tongue reverent and her\nmanner humble toward her young master was transferring itself to her\nspeech and manner toward the usurper, and how similarly handy she was\nbecoming in transferring her motherly curtness of speech and\nperemptoriness of manner to the unlucky heir of the ancient house of\nDriscoll.\n\nShe took occasional rests from practising, and absorbed herself in\ncalculating her chances.\n\n\"Dey'll sell dese niggers to-day fo' stealin' de money, den dey'll buy\nsome mo' dat don't know de chillen--so dat's all right. When I takes de\nchillen out to git de air, de minute I's roun' de corner I's gwine to\ngaum dey mouths all roun' wid jam, den dey can't nobody notice dey's\nchanged. Yes, I gwineter do dat till I's safe, if it's a year.\n\n\"Dey ain't but one man dat I's afeard of, en dat's dat Pudd'nhead\nWilson. Dey calls him a pudd'nhead, en says he's a fool. My lan', dat\nman ain't no mo' fool den I is! He's de smartes' man in dis town, less'n\nit's Jedge Driscoll or maybe Pem Howard. Blame dat man, he worries me\nwid dem ornery glasses o' hisn; I b'lieve he's a witch. But nemmine, I's\ngwine to happen aroun' dah one o' dese days en let on dat I reckon he\nwants to print de chillen's fingers ag'in; en if he don't notice dey's\nchanged, I bound dey ain't nobody gwine to notice it, en den I's safe,\nsho'. But I reckon I'll tote along a hoss-shoe to keep off de\nwitch-work.\"\n\nThe new negroes gave Roxy no trouble, of course. The master gave her\nnone, for one of his speculations was in jeopardy, and his mind was so\noccupied that he hardly saw the children when he looked at them, and all\nRoxy had to do was to get them both into a gale of laughter when he came\nabout; then their faces were mainly cavities exposing gums, and he was\ngone again before the spasm passed and the little creatures resumed a\nhuman aspect.\n\nWithin a few days the fate of the speculation became so dubious that Mr.\nPercy went away with his brother the Judge, to see what could be done\nwith it. It was a land speculation as usual, and it had gotten\ncomplicated with a lawsuit. The men were gone seven weeks. Before they\ngot back Roxy had paid her visit to Wilson, and was satisfied. Wilson\ntook the finger-prints, labeled them with the names and with the\ndate--October the first--put them carefully away and continued his chat\nwith Roxy, who seemed very anxious that he should admire the great\nadvance in flesh and beauty which the babies had made since he took\ntheir finger-prints a month before. He complimented their improvement to\nher contentment; and as they were without any disguise of jam or other\nstain, she trembled all the while and was miserably frightened lest at\nany moment he--\n\nBut he didn't. He discovered nothing; and she went home jubilant, and\ndropped all concern about the matter permanently out of her mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nThe Ways of the Changelings.\n\nAdam and Eve had many advantages, but the principal one was, that they\nescaped teething.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nThere is this trouble about special providences--namely, there is so\noften a doubt as to which party was intended to be the beneficiary. In\nthe case of the children, the bears and the prophet, the bears got more\nreal satisfaction out of the episode than the prophet did, because they\ngot the children.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nThis history must henceforth accommodate itself to the change which\nRoxana has consummated, and call the real heir \"Chambers\" and the\nusurping little slave \"Thomas \u00e0 Becket\"--shortening this latter name to\n\"Tom,\" for daily use, as the people about him did.\n\n\"Tom\" was a bad baby, from the very beginning of his usurpation. He\nwould cry for nothing; he would burst into storms of devilish temper\nwithout notice, and let go scream after scream and squall after squall,\nthen climax the thing with \"holding his breath\"--that frightful\nspecialty of the teething nursling, in the throes of which the creature\nexhausts its lungs, then is convulsed with noiseless squirmings and\ntwistings and kickings in the effort to get its breath, while the lips\nturn blue and the mouth stands wide and rigid, offering for inspection\none wee tooth set in the lower rim of a hoop of red gums; and when the\nappalling stillness has endured until one is sure the lost breath will\nnever return, a nurse comes flying, and dashes water in the child's\nface, and--presto! the lungs fill, and instantly discharge a shriek, or\na yell, or a howl which bursts the listening ear and surprises the owner\nof it into saying words which would not go well with a halo if he had\none. The baby Tom would claw anybody who came within reach of his nails,\nand pound anybody he could reach with his rattle. He would scream for\nwater until he got it, and then throw cup and all on the floor and\nscream for more. He was indulged in all his caprices, howsoever\ntroublesome and exasperating they might be; he was allowed to eat\nanything he wanted, particularly things that would give him the\nstomach-ache.\n\nWhen he got to be old enough to begin to toddle about and say broken\nwords and get an idea of what his hands were for, he was a more\nconsummate pest than ever. Roxy got no rest while he was awake. He would\ncall for anything and everything he saw, simply saying \"Awnt it!\" (want\nit), which was a command. When it was brought, he said in a frenzy, and\nmotioning it away with his hands, \"Don't awnt it! don't awnt it!\" and\nthe moment it was gone he set up frantic yells of \"Awnt it! awnt it!\nawnt it!\" and Roxy had to give wings to her heels to get that thing back\nto him again before he could get time to carry out his intention of\ngoing into convulsions about it.\n\nWhat he preferred above all other things was the tongs. This was because\nhis \"father\" had forbidden him to have them lest he break windows and\nfurniture with them. The moment Roxy's back was turned he would toddle\nto the presence of the tongs and say \"Like it!\" and cock his eye to one\nside to see if Roxy was observing; then, \"Awnt it!\" and cock his eye\nagain; then, \"Hab it!\" with another furtive glance; and finally, \"Take\nit!\"--and the prize was his. The next moment the heavy implement was\nraised aloft; the next, there was a crash and a squall, and the cat was\noff on three legs to meet an engagement; Roxy would arrive just as the\nlamp or a window went to irremediable smash.\n\nTom got all the petting, Chambers got none. Tom got all the delicacies,\nChambers got mush and milk, and clabber without sugar. In consequence\nTom was a sickly child and Chambers wasn't. Tom was \"fractious,\" as Roxy\ncalled it, and overbearing; Chambers was meek and docile.\n\nWith all her splendid common sense and practical every-day ability, Roxy\nwas a doting fool of a mother. She was this toward her child--and she\nwas also more than this: by the fiction created by herself, he was\nbecome her master; the necessity of recognizing this relation outwardly\nand of perfecting herself in the forms required to express the\nrecognition, had moved her to such diligence and faithfulness in\npracticing these forms that this exercise soon concreted itself into\nhabit; it became automatic and unconscious; then a natural result\nfollowed: deceptions intended solely for others gradually grew\npractically into self-deceptions as well; the mock reverence became real\nreverence, the mock obsequiousness real obsequiousness, the mock homage\nreal homage; the little counterfeit rift of separation between\nimitation-slave and imitation-master widened and widened, and became an\nabyss, and a very real one--and on one side of it stood Roxy, the dupe\nof her own deceptions, and on the other stood her child, no longer a\nusurper to her, but her accepted and recognized master. He was her\ndarling, her master, and her deity all in one, and in her worship of him\nshe forgot who she was and what he had been.\n\nIn babyhood Tom cuffed and banged and scratched Chambers unrebuked, and\nChambers early learned that between meekly bearing it and resenting it,\nthe advantage all lay with the former policy. The few times that his\npersecutions had moved him beyond control and made him fight back had\ncost him very dear at headquarters; not at the hands of Roxy, for if she\never went beyond scolding him sharply for \"forgitt'n' who his young\nmarster was,\" she at least never extended her punishment beyond a box on\nthe ear. No, Percy Driscoll was the person. He told Chambers that under\nno provocation whatever was he privileged to lift his hand against his\nlittle master. Chambers overstepped the line three times, and got three\nsuch convincing canings from the man who was his father and didn't know\nit, that he took Tom's cruelties in all humility after that, and made no\nmore experiments.\n\nOutside of the house the two boys were together all through their\nboyhood. Chambers was strong beyond his years, and a good fighter;\nstrong because he was coarsely fed and hard worked about the house, and\na good fighter because Tom furnished him plenty of practice--on white\nboys whom he hated and was afraid of. Chambers was his constant\nbody-guard, to and from school; he was present on the playground at\nrecess to protect his charge. He fought himself into such a formidable\nreputation, by and by, that Tom could have changed clothes with him, and\n\"ridden in peace,\" like Sir Kay in Launcelot's armor.\n\nHe was good at games of skill, too. Tom staked him with marbles to play\n\"keeps\" with, and then took all the winnings away from him. In the\nwinter season Chambers was on hand, in Tom's worn-out clothes, with\n\"holy\" red mittens, and \"holy\" shoes, and pants \"holy\" at the knees and\nseat, to drag a sled up the hill for Tom, warmly clad, to ride down on;\nbut he never got a ride himself. He built snow men and snow\nfortifications under Tom's directions. He was Tom's patient target when\nTom wanted to do some snowballing, but the target couldn't fire back.\nChambers carried Tom's skates to the river and strapped them on him,\nthen trotted around after him on the ice, so as to be on hand when\nwanted; but he wasn't ever asked to try the skates himself.\n\nIn summer the pet pastime of the boys of Dawson's Landing was to steal\napples, peaches, and melons from the farmers' fruit-wagons,--mainly on\naccount of the risk they ran of getting their heads laid open with the\nbutt of the farmer's whip. Tom was a distinguished adept at these\nthefts--by proxy. Chambers did his stealing, and got the peach-stones,\napple-cores, and melon-rinds for his share.\n\nTom always made Chambers go in swimming with him, and stay by him as a\nprotection. When Tom had had enough, he would slip out and tie knots in\nChambers's shirt, dip the knots in the water and make them hard to undo,\nthen dress himself and sit by and laugh while the naked shiverer tugged\nat the stubborn knots with his teeth.\n\nTom did his humble comrade these various ill turns partly out of native\nviciousness, and partly because he hated him for his superiorities of\nphysique and pluck, and for his manifold cleverness. Tom couldn't dive,\nfor it gave him splitting headaches. Chambers could dive without\ninconvenience, and was fond of doing it. He excited so much admiration,\none day, among a crowd of white boys, by throwing back somersaults from\nthe stern of a canoe, that it wearied Tom's spirit, and at last he\nshoved the canoe underneath Chambers while he was in the air--so he came\ndown on his head in the canoe-bottom; and while he lay unconscious,\nseveral of Tom's ancient adversaries saw that their long-desired\nopportunity was come, and they gave the false heir such a drubbing that\nwith Chambers's best help he was hardly able to drag himself home\nafterward.\n\nWhen the boys were fifteen and upward, Tom was \"showing off\" in the\nriver one day, when he was taken with a cramp, and shouted for help. It\nwas a common trick with the boys--particularly if a stranger was\npresent--to pretend a cramp and howl for help; then when the stranger\ncame tearing hand over hand to the rescue, the howler would go on\nstruggling and howling till he was close at hand, then replace the howl\nwith a sarcastic smile and swim blandly away, while the town boys\nassailed the dupe with a volley of jeers and laughter. Tom had never\ntried this joke as yet, but was supposed to be trying it now, so the\nboys held warily back; but Chambers believed his master was in earnest,\ntherefore he swam out, and arrived in time, unfortunately, and saved his\nlife.\n\nThis was the last feather. Tom had managed to endure everything else,\nbut to have to remain publicly and permanently under such an obligation\nas this to a nigger, and to this nigger of all niggers--this was too\nmuch. He heaped insults upon Chambers for \"pretending\" to think he was\nin earnest in calling for help, and said that anybody but a block-headed\nnigger would have known he was funning and left him alone.\n\nTom's enemies were in strong force here, so they came out with their\nopinions quite freely. They laughed at him, and called him coward, liar,\nsneak, and other sorts of pet names, and told him they meant to call\nChambers by a new name after this, and make it common in the town--\"Tom\nDriscoll's niggerpappy,\"--to signify that he had had a second birth into\nthis life, and that Chambers was the author of his new being. Tom grew\nfrantic under these taunts, and shouted--\n\n\"Knock their heads off, Chambers! knock their heads off! What do you\nstand there with your hands in your pockets for?\"\n\nChambers expostulated, and said, \"But, Marse Tom, dey's too many of\n'em--dey's--\"\n\n\"Do you hear me?\"\n\n\"Please, Marse Tom, don't make me! Dey's so many of 'em dat--\"\n\nTom sprang at him and drove his pocket-knife into him two or three times\nbefore the boys could snatch him away and give the wounded lad a chance\nto escape. He was considerably hurt, but not seriously. If the blade had\nbeen a little longer his career would have ended there.\n\nTom had long ago taught Roxy \"her place.\" It had been many a day now\nsince she had ventured a caress or a fondling epithet in his quarter.\nSuch things, from a \"nigger,\" were repulsive to him, and she had been\nwarned to keep her distance and remember who she was. She saw her\ndarling gradually cease from being her son, she saw that detail perish\nutterly; all that was left was master--master, pure and simple, and it\nwas not a gentle mastership, either. She saw herself sink from the\nsublime height of motherhood to the somber depths of unmodified slavery.\nThe abyss of separation between her and her boy was complete. She was\nmerely his chattel, now, his convenience, his dog, his cringing and\nhelpless slave, the humble and unresisting victim of his capricious\ntemper and vicious nature.\n\nSometimes she could not go to sleep, even when worn out with fatigue,\nbecause her rage boiled so high over the day's experiences with her boy.\nShe would mumble and mutter to herself--\n\n\"He struck me, en I warn't no way to blame--struck me in de face, right\nbefore folks. En he's al'ays callin' me nigger-wench, en hussy, en all\ndem mean names, when I's doin' de very bes' I kin. Oh, Lord, I done so\nmuch for him--I lift' him away up to what he is--en dis is what I git\nfor it.\"\n\nSometimes when some outrage of peculiar offensiveness stung her to the\nheart, she would plan schemes of vengeance and revel in the fancied\nspectacle of his exposure to the world as an imposter and a slave; but\nin the midst of these joys fear would strike her: she had made him too\nstrong; she could prove nothing, and--heavens, she might get sold down\nthe river for her pains! So her schemes always went for nothing, and she\nlaid them aside in impotent rage against the fates, and against herself\nfor playing the fool on that fatal September day in not providing\nherself with a witness for use in the day when such a thing might be\nneeded for the appeasing of her vengeance-hungry heart.\n\nAnd yet the moment Tom happened to be good to her, and kind,--and this\noccurred every now and then,--all her sore places were healed, and she\nwas happy; happy and proud, for this was her son, her nigger son,\nlording it among the whites and securely avenging their crimes against\nher race.\n\nThere were two grand funerals in Dawson's Landing that fall--the fall of\n1845. One was that of Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex, the other that of\nPercy Driscoll.\n\nOn his death-bed Driscoll set Roxy free and delivered his idolized\nostensible son solemnly into the keeping of his brother, the Judge and\nhis wife. Those childless people were glad to get him. Childless people\nare not difficult to please.\n\nJudge Driscoll had gone privately to his brother, a month before, and\nbought Chambers. He had heard that Tom had been trying to get his father\nto sell the boy down the river, and he wanted to prevent the\nscandal--for public sentiment did not approve of that way of treating\nfamily servants for light cause or for no cause.\n\nPercy Driscoll had worn himself out in trying to save his great\nspeculative landed estate, and had died without succeeding. He was\nhardly in his grave before the boom collapsed and left his hitherto\nenvied young devil of an heir a pauper. But that was nothing; his uncle\ntold him he should be his heir and have all his fortune when he died; so\nTom was comforted.\n\nRoxy had no home, now; so she resolved to go around and say good-by to\nher friends and then clear out and see the world--that is to say, she\nwould go chambermaiding on a steamboat, the darling ambition of her race\nand sex.\n\nHer last call was on the black giant, Jasper. She found him chopping\nPudd'nhead Wilson's winter provision of wood.\n\nWilson was chatting with him when Roxy arrived. He asked her how she\ncould bear to go off chambermaiding and leave her boys; and chaffingly\noffered to copy off a series of their finger-prints, reaching up to\ntheir twelfth year, for her to remember them by; but she sobered in a\nmoment, wondering if he suspected anything; then she said she believed\nshe didn't want them. Wilson said to himself, \"The drop of black blood\nin her is superstitious; she thinks there's some devilry, some\nwitch-business about my glass mystery somewhere; she used to come here\nwith an old horseshoe in her hand; it could have been an accident, but I\ndoubt it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nThe Twins Thrill Dawson's Landing.\n\nTraining is everything. The peach was once a bitter almond; cauliflower\nis nothing but cabbage with a college education.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's\nCalendar.\n\nRemark of Dr. Baldwin's, concerning upstarts: We don't care to eat\ntoadstools that think they are truffles.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nMrs. York Driscoll enjoyed two years of bliss with that prize,\nTom--bliss that was troubled a little at times, it is true, but bliss\nnevertheless; then she died, and her husband and his childless sister,\nMrs. Pratt, continued the bliss-business at the old stand. Tom was\npetted and indulged and spoiled to his entire content--or nearly that.\nThis went on till he was nineteen, then he was sent to Yale. He went\nhandsomely equipped with \"conditions,\" but otherwise he was not an\nobject of distinction there. He remained at Yale two years, and then\nthrew up the struggle. He came home with his manners a good deal\nimproved; he had lost his surliness and brusqueness, and was rather\npleasantly soft and smooth, now; he was furtively, and sometimes openly,\nironical of speech, and given to gently touching people on the raw, but\nhe did it with a good-natured semiconscious air that carried it off\nsafely, and kept him from getting into trouble. He was as indolent as\never and showed no very strenuous desire to hunt up an occupation.\nPeople argued from this that he preferred to be supported by his uncle\nuntil his uncle's shoes should become vacant. He brought back one or two\nnew habits with him, one of which he rather openly\npractised--tippling--but concealed another which was gambling. It would\nnot do to gamble where his uncle could hear of it; he knew that quite\nwell.\n\nTom's Eastern polish was not popular among the young people. They could\nhave endured it, perhaps, if Tom had stopped there; but he wore gloves,\nand that they couldn't stand, and wouldn't; so he was mainly without\nsociety. He brought home with him a suit of clothes of such exquisite\nstyle and cut and fashion,--Eastern fashion, city fashion,--that it\nfilled everybody with anguish and was regarded as a peculiarly wanton\naffront. He enjoyed the feeling which he was exciting, and paraded the\ntown serene and happy all day; but the young fellows set a tailor to\nwork that night, and when Tom started out on his parade next morning he\nfound the old deformed negro bell-ringer straddling along in his wake\ntricked out in a flamboyant curtain-calico exaggeration of his finery,\nand imitating his fancy Eastern graces as well as he could.\n\nTom surrendered, and after that clothed himself in the local fashion.\nBut the dull country town was tiresome to him, since his\nacquaintanceship with livelier regions, and it grew daily more and more\nso. He began to make little trips to St. Louis for refreshment. There he\nfound companionship to suit him, and pleasures to his taste, along with\nmore freedom, in some particulars, than he could have at home. So,\nduring the next two years his visits to the city grew in frequency and\nhis tarryings there grew steadily longer in duration.\n\nHe was getting into deep waters. He was taking chances, privately, which\nmight get him into trouble some day--in fact, did.\n\nJudge Driscoll had retired from the bench and from all business\nactivities in 1850, and had now been comfortably idle three years. He\nwas president of the Free-thinkers' Society, and Pudd'nhead Wilson was\nthe other member. The society's weekly discussions were now the old\nlawyer's main interest in life. Pudd'nhead was still toiling in\nobscurity at the bottom of the ladder, under the blight of that unlucky\nremark which he had let fall twenty-three years before about the dog.\n\nJudge Driscoll was his friend, and claimed that he had a mind above the\naverage, but that was regarded as one of the Judge's whims, and it\nfailed to modify the public opinion. Or rather, that was one of the\nreasons why it failed, but there was another and better one. If the\nJudge had stopped with bare assertion, it would have had a good deal of\neffect; but he made the mistake of trying to prove his position. For\nsome years Wilson had been privately at work on a whimsical almanac, for\nhis amusement--a calendar, with a little dab of ostensible philosophy,\nusually in ironical form, appended to each date; and the Judge thought\nthat these quips and fancies of Wilson's were neatly turned and cute; so\nhe carried a handful of them around, one day, and read them to some of\nthe chief citizens. But irony was not for those people; their mental\nvision was not focussed for it. They read those playful trifles in the\nsolidest earnest, and decided without hesitancy that if there had ever\nbeen any doubt that Dave Wilson was a pudd'nhead--which there\nhadn't--this revelation removed that doubt for good and all. That is\njust the way in this world; an enemy can partly ruin a man, but it takes\na good-natured injudicious friend to complete the thing and make it\nperfect. After this the Judge felt tenderer than ever toward Wilson, and\nsurer than ever that his calendar had merit.\n\nJudge Driscoll could be a free-thinker and still hold his place in\nsociety because he was the person of most consequence in the community,\nand therefore could venture to go his own way and follow out his own\nnotions. The other member of his pet organization was allowed the like\nliberty because he was a cipher in the estimation of the public, and\nnobody attached any importance to what he thought or did. He was liked,\nhe was welcome enough all around, but he simply didn't count for\nanything.\n\nThe widow Cooper--affectionately called \"aunt Patsy\" by everybody--lived\nin a snug and comely cottage with her daughter Rowena, who was nineteen,\nromantic, amiable, and very pretty, but otherwise of no consequence.\nRowena had a couple of young brothers--also of no consequence.\n\nThe widow had a large spare room which she let to a lodger, with board,\nwhen she could find one, but this room had been empty for a year now, to\nher sorrow. Her income was only sufficient for the family support, and\nshe needed the lodging-money for trifling luxuries. But now, at last, on\na flaming June day, she found herself happy; her tedious wait was ended;\nher year-worn advertisement had been answered; and not by a village\napplicant, oh, no!--this letter was from away off yonder in the dim\ngreat world to the North: it was from St. Louis. She sat on her porch\ngazing out with unseeing eyes upon the shining reaches of the mighty\nMississippi, her thoughts steeped in her good fortune. Indeed, it was\nspecially good fortune, for she was to have two lodgers instead of one.\n\nShe had read the letter to the family, and Rowena had danced away to see\nto the cleaning and airing of the room by the slave woman Nancy, and the\nboys had rushed abroad in the town to spread the great news, for it was\nmatter of public interest, and the public would wonder and not be\npleased if not informed. Presently Rowena returned, all ablush with\njoyous excitement, and begged for a re-reading of the letter. It was\nframed thus:\n\nHonored Madam: My brother and I have seen your advertisement, by chance,\nand beg leave to take the room you offer. We are twenty-four years of\nage and twins. We are Italians by birth, but have lived long in the\nvarious countries of Europe, and several years in the United States. Our\nnames are Luigi and Angelo Capello. You desire but one guest; but dear\nMadam, if you will allow us to pay for two, we will not incommode you.\nWe shall be down Thursday.\n\n\"Italians! How romantic! Just think, ma--there's never been one in this\ntown, and everybody will be dying to see them, and they're all ours!\nThink of that!\"\n\n\"Yes, I reckon they'll make a grand stir.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed they will. The whole town will be on its head!\nThink--they've been in Europe and everywhere! There's never been a\ntraveler in this town before. Ma, I shouldn't wonder if they've seen\nkings!\"\n\n\"Well, a body can't tell, but they'll make stir enough, without that.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's of course. Luigi--Angelo. They're lovely names; and so\ngrand and foreign--not like Jones and Robinson and such. Thursday they\nare coming, and this is only Tuesday; it's a cruel long time to wait.\nHere comes Judge Driscoll in at the gate. He's heard about it. I'll go\nand open the door.\"\n\nThe Judge was full of congratulations and curiosity. The letter was read\nand discussed. Soon Justice Robinson arrived with more congratulations,\nand there was a new reading and a new discussion. This was the\nbeginning. Neighbor after neighbor, of both sexes, followed, and the\nprocession drifted in and out all day and evening and all Wednesday and\nThursday. The letter was read and re-read until it was nearly worn out;\neverybody admired its courtly and gracious tone, and smooth and\npractised style, everybody was sympathetic and excited, and the Coopers\nwere steeped in happiness all the while.\n\nThe boats were very uncertain in low water, in these primitive times.\nThis time the Thursday boat had not arrived at ten at night--so the\npeople had waited at the landing all day for nothing; they were driven\nto their homes by a heavy storm without having had a view of the\nillustrious foreigners.\n\nEleven o'clock came; and the Cooper house was the only one in the town\nthat still had lights burning. The rain and thunder were booming yet,\nand the anxious family were still waiting, still hoping. At last there\nwas a knock at the door and the family jumped to open it. Two negro men\nentered, each carrying a trunk, and proceeded up-stairs toward the\nguest-room. Then entered the twins--the handsomest, the best dressed,\nthe most distinguished-looking pair of young fellows the West had ever\nseen. One was a little fairer than the other, but otherwise they were\nexact duplicates.\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nSwimming in Glory.\n\nLet us endeavor so to live that when we come to die even the undertaker\nwill be sorry.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nHabit is habit, and not to be flung out of the window by any man, but\ncoaxed down-stairs a step at a time.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nAt breakfast in the morning the twins' charm of manner and easy and\npolished bearing made speedy conquest of the family's good graces. All\nconstraint and formality quickly disappeared, and the friendliest\nfeeling succeeded. Aunt Patsy called them by their Christian names\nalmost from the beginning. She was full of the keenest curiosity about\nthem, and showed it; they responded by talking about themselves, which\npleased her greatly. It presently appeared that in their early youth\nthey had known poverty and hardship. As the talk wandered along the old\nlady watched for the right place to drop in a question or two concerning\nthat matter, and when she found it she said to the blond twin who was\nnow doing the biographies in his turn while the brunette one rested--\n\n\"If it ain't asking what I ought not to ask, Mr. Angelo, how did you\ncome to be so friendless and in such trouble when you were little? Do\nyou mind telling? But don't if you do.\"\n\n\"Oh, we don't mind it at all, madam; in our case it was merely\nmisfortune, and nobody's fault. Our parents were well to do, there in\nItaly, and we were their only child. We were of the old Florentine\nnobility\"--Rowena's heart gave a great bound, her nostrils expanded, and\na fine light played in her eyes--\"and when the war broke out my father\nwas on the losing side and had to fly for his life. His estates were\nconfiscated, his personal property seized, and there we were, in\nGermany, strangers, friendless, and in fact paupers. My brother and I\nwere ten years old, and well educated for that age, very studious, very\nfond of our books, and well grounded in the German, French, Spanish, and\nEnglish languages. Also, we were marvelous musical prodigies--if you\nwill allow me to say it, it being only the truth.\n\n\"Our father survived his misfortunes only a month, our mother soon\nfollowed him, and we were alone in the world. Our parents could have\nmade themselves comfortable by exhibiting us as a show, and they had\nmany and large offers; but the thought revolted their pride, and they\nsaid they would starve and die first. But what they wouldn't consent to\ndo we had to do without the formality of consent. We were seized for the\ndebts occasioned by their illness and their funerals, and placed among\nthe attractions of a cheap museum in Berlin to earn the liquidation\nmoney. It took us two years to get out of that slavery. We traveled all\nabout Germany receiving no wages, and not even our keep. We had to be\nexhibited for nothing, and beg our bread.\n\n\"Well, madam, the rest is not of much consequence. When we escaped from\nthat slavery at twelve years of age, we were in some respects men.\nExperience had taught us some valuable things; among others, how to take\ncare of ourselves, how to avoid and defeat sharks and sharpers, and how\nto conduct our own business for our own profit and without other\npeople's help. We traveled everywhere--years and years--picking up\nsmatterings of strange tongues, familiarizing ourselves with strange\nsights and strange customs, accumulating an education of a wide and\nvaried and curious sort. It was a pleasant life. We went to Venice--to\nLondon, Paris, Russia, India, China, Japan--\"\n\nAt this point Nancy the slave woman thrust her head in at the door and\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Ole Missus, de house is plum' jam full o' people, en dey's jes\na-spi'lin' to see de gen'lmen!\" She indicated the twins with a nod of\nher head, and tucked it back out of sight again.\n\nIt was a proud occasion for the widow, and she promised herself high\nsatisfaction in showing off her fine foreign birds before her neighbors\nand friends--simple folk who had hardly ever seen a foreigner of any\nkind, and never one of any distinction or style. Yet her feeling was\nmoderate indeed when contrasted with Rowena's. Rowena was in the clouds,\nshe walked on air; this was to be the greatest day, the most romantic\nepisode, in the colorless history of that dull country town. She was to\nbe familiarly near the source of its glory and feel the full flood of it\npour over her and about her; the other girls could only gaze and envy,\nnot partake.\n\nThe widow was ready, Rowena was ready, so also were the foreigners.\n\nThe party moved along the hall, the twins in advance, and entered the\nopen parlor door, whence issued a low hum of conversation. The twins\ntook a position near the door, the widow stood at Luigi's side, Rowena\nstood beside Angelo, and the march-past and the introductions began. The\nwidow was all smiles and contentment. She received the procession and\npassed it on to Rowena.\n\n\"Good mornin', Sister Cooper\"--hand-shake.\n\n\"Good morning, Brother Higgins--Count Luigi Capello, Mr. \nHiggins\"--hand-shake, followed by a devouring stare and \"I'm glad to see\nye,\" on the part of Higgins, and a courteous inclination of the head and\na pleasant \"Most happy!\" on the part of Count Luigi.\n\n\"Good mornin', Roweny\"--hand-shake.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Higgins--present you to Count Angelo Capello.\"\nHand-shake, admiring stare, \"Glad to see ye,\"--courteous nod, smily\n\"Most happy!\" and Higgins passes on.\n\nNone of these visitors was at ease, but, being honest people, they\ndidn't pretend to be. None of them had ever seen a person bearing a\ntitle of nobility before, and none had been expecting to see one now,\nconsequently the title came upon them as a kind of pile-driving surprise\nand caught them unprepared. A few tried to rise to the emergency, and\ngot out an awkward \"My lord,\" or \"Your lordship,\" or something of that\nsort, but the great majority were overwhelmed by the unaccustomed word\nand its dim and awful associations with gilded courts and stately\nceremony and anointed kingship, so they only fumbled through the\nhand-shake and passed on, speechless. Now and then, as happens at all\nreceptions everywhere, a more than ordinary friendly soul blocked the\nprocession and kept it waiting while he inquired how the brothers liked\nthe village, and how long they were going to stay, and if their families\nwere well, and dragged in the weather, and hoped it would get cooler\nsoon, and all that sort of thing, so as to be able to say, when they got\nhome, \"I had quite a long talk with them\"; but nobody did or said\nanything of a regrettable kind, and so the great affair went through to\nthe end in a creditable and satisfactory fashion.\n\nGeneral conversation followed, and the twins drifted about from group to\ngroup, talking easily and fluently and winning approval, compelling\nadmiration and achieving favor from all. The widow followed their\nconquering march with a proud eye, and every now and then Rowena said to\nherself with deep satisfaction, \"And to think they are ours--all ours!\"\n\nThere were no idle moments for mother or daughter. Eager inquiries\nconcerning the twins were pouring into their enchanted ears all the\ntime; each was the constant center of a group of breathless listeners;\neach recognized that she knew now for the first time the real meaning of\nthat great word Glory, and perceived the stupendous value of it, and\nunderstood why men in all ages had been willing to throw away meaner\nhappinesses, treasure, life itself, to get a taste of its sublime and\nsupreme joy. Napoleon and all his kind stood accounted for--and\njustified.\n\nWhen Rowena had at last done all her duty by the people in the parlor,\nshe went up-stairs to satisfy the longings of an overflow-meeting there,\nfor the parlor was not big enough to hold all the comers. Again she was\nbesieged by eager questioners and again she swam in sunset seas of\nglory. When the forenoon was nearly gone, she recognized with a pang\nthat this most splendid episode of her life was almost over, that\nnothing could prolong it, that nothing quite its equal could ever fall\nto her fortune again. But never mind, it was sufficient unto itself, the\ngrand occasion had moved on an ascending scale from the start, and was a\nnoble and memorable success. If the twins could but do some crowning\nact, now, to climax it, something unusual, something startling,\nsomething to concentrate upon themselves the company's loftiest\nadmiration, something in the nature of an electric surprise--\n\nHere a prodigious slam-banging broke out below, and everybody rushed\ndown to see. It was the twins knocking out a classic four-handed piece\non the piano, in great style. Rowena was satisfied--satisfied down to\nthe bottom of her heart.\n\nThe young strangers were kept long at the piano. The villagers were\nastonished and enchanted with the magnificence of their performance, and\ncould not bear to have them stop. All the music that they had ever heard\nbefore seemed spiritless prentice-work and barren of grace or charm when\ncompared with these intoxicating floods of melodious sound. They\nrealized that for once in their lives they were hearing masters.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\nThe Unknown Nymph\n\nOne of the most striking differences between a cat and a lie is that a\ncat has only nine lives.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nThe company broke up reluctantly, and drifted toward their several\nhomes, chatting with vivacity, and all agreeing that it would be many a\nlong day before Dawson's Landing would see the equal of this one again.\nThe twins had accepted several invitations while the reception was in\nprogress, and had also volunteered to play some duets at an amateur\nentertainment for the benefit of a local charity. Society was eager to\nreceive them to its bosom. Judge Driscoll had the good fortune to secure\nthem for an immediate drive, and to be the first to display them in\npublic. They entered his buggy with him, and were paraded down the main\nstreet, everybody flocking to the windows and sidewalks to see.\n\nThe Judge showed the strangers the new graveyard, and the jail, and\nwhere the richest man lived, and the Freemasons' hall, and the Methodist\nchurch, and the Presbyterian church, and where the Baptist church was\ngoing to be when they got some money to build it with, and showed them\nthe town hall and the slaughter-house, and got out the independent fire\ncompany in uniform and had them put out an imaginary fire; then he let\nthem inspect the muskets of the militia company, and poured out an\nexhaustless stream of enthusiasm over all these splendors, and seemed\nvery well satisfied with the responses he got, for the twins admired his\nadmiration, and paid him back the best they could, though they could\nhave done better if some fifteen or sixteen hundred thousand previous\nexperiences of this sort in various countries had not already rubbed off\na considerable part of the novelty of it.\n\nThe Judge laid himself out hospitably to make them have a good time, and\nif there was a defect anywhere it was not his fault. He told them a good\nmany humorous anecdotes, and always forgot the nub, but they were always\nable to furnish it, for these yarns were of a pretty early vintage, and\nthey had had many a rejuvenating pull at them before. And he told them\nall about his several dignities, and how he had held this and that and\nthe other place of honor or profit, and had once been to the\nlegislature, and was now president of the Society of Free-thinkers. He\nsaid the society had been in existence four years, and already had two\nmembers, and was firmly established. He would call for the brothers in\nthe evening if they would like to attend a meeting of it.\n\nAccordingly he called for them, and on the way he told them all about\nPudd'nhead Wilson, in order that they might get a favorable impression\nof him in advance and be prepared to like him. This scheme\nsucceeded--the favorable impression was achieved. Later it was confirmed\nand solidified when Wilson proposed that out of courtesy to the\nstrangers the usual topics be put aside and the hour be devoted to\nconversation upon ordinary subjects and the cultivation of friendly\nrelations and good-fellowship,--a proposition which was put to vote and\ncarried.\n\nThe hour passed quickly away in lively talk, and when it was ended the\nlonesome and neglected Wilson was richer by two friends than he had been\nwhen it began. He invited the twins to look in at his lodgings,\npresently, after disposing of an intervening engagement, and they\naccepted with pleasure.\n\nToward the middle of the evening they found themselves on the road to\nhis house. Pudd'nhead was at home waiting for them and putting in his\ntime puzzling over a thing which had come under his notice that morning.\nThe matter was this: He happened to be up very early--at dawn, in fact;\nand he crossed the hall which divided his cottage through the center,\nand entered a room to get something there. The window of the room had no\ncurtains, for that side of the house had long been unoccupied, and\nthrough this window he caught sight of something which surprised and\ninterested him. It was a young woman--a young woman where properly no\nyoung woman belonged; for she was in Judge Driscoll's house, and in the\nbedroom over the Judge's private study or sitting-room. This was young\nTom Driscoll's bedroom. He and the Judge, the Judge's widowed sister\nMrs. Pratt and three negro servants were the only people who belonged in\nthe house. Who, then, might this young lady be? The two houses were\nseparated by an ordinary yard, with a low fence running back through its\nmiddle from the street in front to the lane in the rear. The distance\nwas not great, and Wilson was able to see the girl very well, the\nwindow-shades of the room she was in being up, and the window also. The\ngirl had on a neat and trim summer dress, patterned in broad stripes of\npink and white, and her bonnet was equipped with a pink veil. She was\npractising steps, gaits and attitudes, apparently; she was doing the\nthing gracefully, and was very much absorbed in her work. Who could she\nbe, and how came she to be in young Tom Driscoll's room?\n\nWilson had quickly chosen a position from which he could watch the girl\nwithout running much risk of being seen by her, and he remained there\nhoping she would raise her veil and betray her face. But she\ndisappointed him. After a matter of twenty minutes she disappeared, and\nalthough he stayed at his post half an hour longer, she came no more.\n\nToward noon he dropped in at the Judge's and talked with Mrs. Pratt\nabout the great event of the day, the levee of the distinguished\nforeigners at Aunt Patsy Cooper's. He asked after her nephew Tom, and\nshe said he was on his way home, and that she was expecting him to\narrive a little before night; and added that she and the Judge were\ngratified to gather from his letters that he was conducting himself very\nnicely and creditably--at which Wilson winked to himself privately.\nWilson did not ask if there was a newcomer in the house, but he asked\nquestions that would have brought light-throwing answers as to that\nmatter if Mrs. Pratt had had any light to throw; so he went away\nsatisfied that he knew of things that were going on in her house of\nwhich she herself was not aware.\n\nHe was now waiting for the twins, and still puzzling over the problem of\nwho that girl might be, and how she happened to be in that young\nfellow's room at daybreak in the morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nMarse Tom Tramples His Chance.\n\nThe holy passion of Friendship is of so sweet and steady and loyal and\nenduring a nature that it will last through a whole lifetime, if not\nasked to lend money.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nConsider well the proportions of things. It is better to be a young\nJune-bug than an old bird of paradise.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nIt is necessary now, to hunt up Roxy.\n\nAt the time she was set free and went away chambermaiding, she was\nthirty-five. She got a berth as second chambermaid on a Cincinnati boat\nin the New Orleans trade, the Grand Mogul. A couple of trips made her\nwonted and easy-going at the work, and infatuated her with the stir and\nadventure and independence of steamboat life. Then she was promoted and\nbecame head chambermaid. She was a favorite with the officers, and\nexceedingly proud of their joking and friendly way with her.\n\nDuring eight years she served three parts of the year on that boat, and\nthe winters on a Vicksburg packet. But now for two months she had had\nrheumatism in her arms, and was obliged to let the wash-tub alone. So\nshe resigned. But she was well fixed--rich, as she would have described\nit; for she had lived a steady life, and had banked four dollars every\nmonth in New Orleans as a provision for her old age. She said in the\nstart that she had \"put shoes on one bar'footed nigger to tromple on her\nwith,\" and that one mistake like that was enough; she would be\nindependent of the human race thenceforth forevermore if hard work and\neconomy could accomplish it. When the boat touched the levee at New\nOrleans she bade good-by to her comrades on the Grand Mogul and moved\nher kit ashore.\n\nBut she was back in a hour. The bank had gone to smash and carried her\nfour hundred dollars with it. She was a pauper, and homeless. Also\ndisabled bodily, at least for the present. The officers were full of\nsympathy for her in her trouble, and made up a little purse for her. She\nresolved to go to her birthplace; she had friends there among the\nnegroes, and the unfortunate always help the unfortunate, she was well\naware of that; those lowly comrades of her youth would not let her\nstarve.\n\nShe took the little local packet at Cairo, and now she was on the\nhome-stretch. Time had worn away her bitterness against her son, and she\nwas able to think of him with serenity. She put the vile side of him out\nof her mind, and dwelt only on recollections of his occasional acts of\nkindness to her. She gilded and otherwise decorated these, and made them\nvery pleasant to contemplate. She began to long to see him. She would go\nand fawn upon him, slave-like--for this would have to be her attitude,\nof course--and maybe she would find that time had modified him, and that\nhe would be glad to see his long-forgotten old nurse and treat her\ngently. That would be lovely; that would make her forget her woes and\nher poverty.\n\nHer poverty! That thought inspired her to add another castle to her\ndream: maybe he would give her a trifle now and then--maybe a dollar,\nonce a month, say; any little thing like that would help, oh, ever so\nmuch.\n\nBy the time she reached Dawson's Landing she was her old self again; her\nblues were gone, she was in high feather. She would get along, surely;\nthere were many kitchens where the servants would share their meals with\nher, and also steal sugar and apples and other dainties for her to carry\nhome--or give her a chance to pilfer them herself, which would answer\njust as well. And there was the church. She was a more rabid and devoted\nMethodist than ever, and her piety was no sham, but was strong and\nsincere. Yes, with plenty of creature comforts and her old place in the\namen-corner in her possession again, she would be perfectly happy and at\npeace thenceforward to the end.\n\nShe went to Judge Driscoll's kitchen first of all. She was received\nthere in great form and with vast enthusiasm. Her wonderful travels, and\nthe strange countries she had seen and the adventures she had had, made\nher a marvel, and a heroine of romance. The negroes hung enchanted upon\nthe great story of her experiences, interrupting her all along with\neager questions, with laughter, exclamations of delight and expressions\nof applause; and she was obliged to confess to herself that if there was\nanything better in this world than steamboating, it was the glory to be\ngot by telling about it. The audience loaded her stomach with their\ndinners, and then stole the pantry bare to load up her basket.\n\nTom was in St. Louis. The servants said he had spent the best part of\nhis time there during the previous two years. Roxy came every day, and\nhad many talks about the family and its affairs. Once she asked why Tom\nwas away so much. The ostensible \"Chambers\" said:\n\n\"De fac' is, ole marster kin git along better when young marster's away\nden he kin when he's in de town; yes, en he love him better, too; so he\ngives him fifty dollahs a month--\"\n\n\"No, is dat so? Chambers, you's a-jokin', ain't you?\"\n\n\"'Clah to goodness I ain't, mammy; Marse Tom tole me so his own self.\nBut nemmine, 'tain't enough.\"\n\n\"My lan', what de reason 'tain't enough?\"\n\n\"Well, I's gwine to tell you, if you gimme a chanst, mammy. De reason it\nain't enough is 'ca'se Marse Tom gambles.\"\n\nRoxy threw up her hands in astonishment and Chambers went on--\n\n\"Ole marster found it out, 'ca'se he had to pay two hundred dollahs for\nMarse Tom's gamblin' debts, en dat's true, mammy, jes as dead certain as\nyou's bawn.\"\n\n\"Two--hund'd--dollahs! Why, what is you talkin' 'bout? \nTwo--hund'd--dollahs. Sakes alive, it's 'mos' enough to buy a tol'able\ngood second-hand nigger wid. En you ain't lyin', honey?--you wouldn't\nlie to yo' ole mammy?\"\n\n\"It's God's own truth, jes as I tell you--two hund'd dollahs--I wisht I\nmay never stir outen my tracks if it ain't so. En, oh, my lan', ole\nMarse was jes a-hoppin'! he was b'ilin' mad, I tell you! He tuck 'n'\ndissenhurrit him.\"\n\nHe licked his chops with relish after that stately word. Roxy struggled\nwith it a moment, then gave it up and said--\n\n\"Dissenwhiched him?\"\n\n\"Dissenhurrit him.\"\n\n\"What's dat? What do it mean?\"\n\n\"Means he bu'sted de will.\"\n\n\"Bu's--ted de will! He wouldn't ever treat him so! Take it back, you\nmis'able imitation nigger dat I bore in sorrow en tribbilation.\"\n\nRoxy's pet castle--an occasional dollar from Tom's pocket--was tumbling\nto ruin before her eyes. She could not abide such a disaster as that;\nshe couldn't endure the thought of it. Her remark amused Chambers:\n\n\"Yah-yah-yah! jes listen to dat! If I's imitation, what is you? Bofe of\nus is imitation white--dat's what we is--en pow'ful good imitation,\ntoo--yah-yah-yah!--we don't 'mount to noth'n as imitation niggers; en as\nfor--\"\n\n\"Shet up yo' foolin', 'fo' I knock you side de head, en tell me 'bout de\nwill. Tell me 'tain't bu'sted--do, honey, en I'll never forgit you.\"\n\n\"Well, 'tain't--'ca'se dey's a new one made, en Marse Tom's all right\nag'in. But what is you in sich a sweat 'bout it for, mammy? 'Tain't none\no' your business I don't reckon.\"\n\n\"'Tain't none o' my business? Whose business is it den, I'd like to\nknow? Wuz I his mother tell he was fifteen years old, or wusn't I?--you\nanswer me dat. En you speck I could see him turned out po' en ornery on\nde worl' en never care noth'n' 'bout it? I reckon if you'd ever be'n a\nmother yo'self, Valet de Chambers, you wouldn't talk sich foolishness as\ndat.\"\n\n\"Well, den, ole Marse forgive him en fixed up de will ag'in--do dat\nsatisfy you?\"\n\nYes, she was satisfied now, and quite happy and sentimental over it. She\nkept coming daily, and at last she was told that Tom had come home. She\nbegan to tremble with emotion, and straightway sent to beg him to let\nhis \"po' ole nigger mammy have jes one sight of him en die for joy.\"\n\nTom was stretched at his lazy ease on a sofa when Chambers brought the\npetition. Time had not modified his ancient detestation of the humble\ndrudge and protector of his boyhood; it was still bitter and\nuncompromising. He sat up and bent a severe gaze upon the fair face of\nthe young fellow whose name he was unconsciously using and whose family\nrights he was enjoying. He maintained the gaze until the victim of it\nhad become satisfactorily pallid with terror, then he said--\n\n\"What does the old rip want with me?\"\n\nThe petition was meekly repeated.\n\n\"Who gave you permission to come and disturb me with the social\nattentions of niggers?\"\n\nTom had risen. The other young man was trembling now, visibly. He saw\nwhat was coming, and bent his head sideways, and put up his left arm to\nshield it. Tom rained cuffs upon the head and its shield, saying no\nword: the victim received each blow with a beseeching, \"Please, Marse\nTom!--oh, please, Marse Tom!\" Seven blows--then Tom said, \"Face the\ndoor--march!\" He followed behind with one, two, three solid kicks. The\nlast one helped the pure-white slave over the door-sill, and he limped\naway mopping his eyes with his old ragged sleeve. Tom shouted after him,\n\"Send her in!\"\n\nThen he flung himself panting on the sofa again, and rasped out the\nremark, \"He arrived just at the right moment; I was full to the brim\nwith bitter thinkings, and nobody to take it out of. How refreshing it\nwas! I feel better.\"\n\nTom's mother entered now, closing the door behind her, and approached\nher son with all the wheedling and supplicating servilities that fear\nand interest can impart to the words and attitudes of the born slave.\nShe stopped a yard from her boy and made two or three admiring\nexclamations over his manly stature and general handsomeness, and Tom\nput an arm under his head and hoisted a leg over the sofa-back in order\nto look properly indifferent.\n\n\"My lan', how you is growed, honey! 'Clah to goodness, I wouldn't\na-knowed you, Marse Tom! 'deed I wouldn't! Look at me good; does you\n'member old Roxy?--does you know yo' old nigger mammy, honey? Well, now,\nI kin lay down en die in peace, 'ca'se I'se seed--\"\n\n\"Cut it short, ------ it, cut it short! What is it you want?\"\n\n\"You heah dat? Jes the same old Marse Tom, al'ays so gay and funnin' wid\nde ole mammy. I 'uz jes as shore--\"\n\n\"Cut it short, I tell you, and get along! What do you want?\"\n\nThis was a bitter disappointment. Roxy had for so many days nourished\nand fondled and petted her notion that Tom would be glad to see his old\nnurse, and would make her proud and happy to the marrow with a cordial\nword or two, that it took two rebuffs to convince her that he was not\nfunning, and that her beautiful dream was a fond and foolish vanity, a\nshabby and pitiful mistake. She was hurt to the heart, and so ashamed\nthat for a moment she did not quite know what to do or how to act. Then\nher breast began to heave, the tears came, and in her forlornness she\nwas moved to try that other dream of hers--an appeal to her boy's\ncharity; and so, upon the impulse, and without reflection, she offered\nher supplication:\n\n\"Oh, Marse Tom, de po' ole mammy is in sich hard luck dese days; en\nshe's kinder crippled in de arms and can't work, en if you could gimme a\ndollah--on'y jes one little dol--\"\n\nTom was on his feet so suddenly that the supplicant was startled into a\njump herself.\n\n\"A dollar!--give you a dollar! I've a notion to strangle you! Is that\nyour errand here? Clear out! and be quick about it!\"\n\nRoxy backed slowly toward the door. When she was half-way she stopped,\nand said mournfully:\n\n\"Marse Tom, I nussed you when you was a little baby, en I raised you all\nby myself tell you was 'most a young man; en now you is young en rich,\nen I is po' en gitt'n ole, en I come heah b'lievin' dat you would he'p\nde ole mammy 'long down de little road dat's lef' 'twix' her en de\ngrave, en--\"\n\nTom relished this tune less than any that had preceded it, for it began\nto wake up a sort of echo in his conscience; so he interrupted and said\nwith decision, though without asperity, that he was not in a situation\nto help her, and wasn't going to do it.\n\n\"Ain't you ever gwine to he'p me, Marse Tom?\"\n\n\"No! Now go away and don't bother me any more.\"\n\nRoxy's head was down, in an attitude of humility. But now the fires of\nher old wrongs flamed up in her breast and began to burn fiercely. She\nraised her head slowly, till it was well up, and at the same time her\ngreat frame unconsciously assumed an erect and masterful attitude, with\nall the majesty and grace of her vanished youth in it. She raised her\nfinger and punctuated with it:\n\n\"You has said de word. You has had yo' chance, en you has trompled it\nunder yo' foot. When you git another one, you'll git down on yo' knees\nen beg for it!\"\n\nA cold chill went to Tom's heart, he didn't know why; for he did not\nreflect that such words, from such an incongruous source, and so\nsolemnly delivered, could not easily fail of that effect. However, he\ndid the natural thing: he replied with bluster and mockery:\n\n\"You'll give me a chance--you! Perhaps I'd better get down on my knees\nnow! But in case I don't--just for argument's sake--what's going to\nhappen, pray?\"\n\n\"Dis is what is gwine to happen. I's gwine as straight to yo' uncle as I\nkin walk, en tell him every las' thing I knows 'bout you.\"\n\nTom's cheek blenched, and she saw it. Disturbing thoughts began to chase\neach other through his head. \"How can she know? And yet she must have\nfound out--she looks it. I've had the will back only three months, and\nam already deep in debt again, and moving heaven and earth to save\nmyself from exposure and destruction, with a reasonably fair show of\ngetting the thing covered up if I'm let alone, and now this fiend has\ngone and found me out somehow or other. I wonder how much she knows? Oh,\noh, oh, it's enough to break a body's heart! But I've got to humor\nher--there's no other way.\"\n\nThen he worked up a rather sickly sample of a gay laugh and a hollow\nchipperness of manner, and said:\n\n\"Well, well, Roxy dear, old friends like you and me mustn't quarrel.\nHere's your dollar--now tell me what you know.\"\n\nHe held out the wild-cat bill; she stood as she was, and made no\nmovement. It was her turn to scorn persuasive foolery, now, and she did\nnot waste it. She said, with a grim implacability in voice and manner\nwhich made Tom almost realize that even a former slave can remember for\nten minutes insults and injuries returned for compliments and flatteries\nreceived, and can also enjoy taking revenge for them when the\nopportunity offers:\n\n\"What does I know? I'll tell you what I knows. I knows enough to bu'st\ndat will to flinders--en more, mind you, more!\"\n\nTom was aghast.\n\n\"More?\" he said. \"What do you call more? Where's there any room for\nmore?\"\n\nRoxy laughed a mocking laugh, and said scoffingly, with a toss of her\nhead, and her hands on her hips--\n\n\"Yes!--oh, I reckon! Co'se you'd like to know--wid yo' po' little ole\nrag dollah. What you reckon I's gwine to tell you for?--you ain't got no\nmoney. I's gwine to tell yo' uncle--en I'll do it dis minute, too--he'll\ngimme five dollahs for de news, en mighty glad, too.\"\n\nShe swung herself around disdainfully, and started away. Tom was in a\npanic. He seized her skirts, and implored her to wait. She turned and\nsaid, loftily--\n\n\"Look-a-heah, what 'uz it I tole you?\"\n\n\"You--you--I don't remember anything. What was it you told me?\"\n\n\"I tole you dat de next time I give you a chance you'd git down on yo'\nknees en beg for it.\"\n\nTom was stupefied for a moment. He was panting with excitement. Then he\nsaid:\n\n\"Oh, Roxy, you wouldn't require your young master to do such a horrible\nthing. You can't mean it.\"\n\n\"I'll let you know mighty quick whether I means it or not! You call me\nnames, en as good as spit on me when I comes here po' en ornery en\n'umble, to praise you for bein' growed up so fine en handsome, en tell\nyou how I used to nuss you en tend you en watch you when you 'uz sick en\nhadn't no mother but me in de whole worl', en beg you to give de po' ole\nnigger a dollah for to git her som'n' to eat, en you call me\nnames--names, dad blame you! Yassir, I gives you jes one chance mo', and\ndat's now, en it las' on'y a half a second--you hear?\"\n\nTom slumped to his knees and began to beg, saying--\n\n\"You see, I'm begging, and it's honest begging, too! Now tell me, Roxy,\ntell me.\"\n\nThe heir of two centuries of unatoned insult and outrage looked down on\nhim and seemed to drink in deep draughts of satisfaction. Then she\nsaid--\n\n\"Fine nice young white gen'l'man kneelin' down to a nigger-wench! I's\nwanted to see dat jes once befo' I's called. Now, Gabr'el, blow de hawn,\nI's ready ... Git up!\"\n\nTom did it. He said, humbly--\n\n\"Now, Roxy, don't punish me any more. I deserved what I've got, but be\ngood and let me off with that. Don't go to uncle. Tell me--I'll give you\nthe five dollars.\"\n\n\"Yes, I bet you will; en you won't stop dah, nuther. But I ain't gwine\nto tell you heah--\"\n\n\"Good gracious, no!\"\n\n\"Is you 'feared o' de ha'nted house?\"\n\n\"N-no.\"\n\n\"Well, den, you come to de ha'nted house 'bout ten or 'leven to-night,\nen climb up de ladder, 'ca'se de sta'r-steps is broke down, en you'll\nfind me. I's a-roostin' in de ha'nted house 'ca'se I can't 'ford to\nroos' nowhers' else.\" She started toward the door, but stopped and said,\n\"Gimme de dollah bill!\" He gave it to her. She examined it and said,\n\"H'm--like enough de bank's bu'sted.\" She started again, but halted\nagain. \"Has you got any whisky?\"\n\n\"Yes, a little.\"\n\n\"Fetch it!\"\n\nHe ran to his room overhead and brought down a bottle which was\ntwo-thirds full. She tilted it up and took a drink. Her eyes sparkled\nwith satisfaction, and she tucked the bottle under her shawl, saying,\n\"It's prime. I'll take it along.\"\n\nTom humbly held the door for her, and she marched out as grim and erect\nas a grenadier.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTom Practises Sycophancy.\n\nWhy is it that we rejoice at a birth and grieve at a funeral? It is\nbecause we are not the person involved.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nIt is easy to find fault, if one has that disposition. There was once a\nman who, not being able to find any other fault with his coal,\ncomplained that there were too many prehistoric toads in it.--Pudd'nhead\nWilson's Calendar.\n\nTom flung himself on the sofa, and put his throbbing head in his hands,\nand rested his elbows on his knees. He rocked himself back and forth and\nmoaned.\n\n\"I've knelt to a nigger wench!\" he muttered. \"I thought I had struck the\ndeepest depths of degradation before, but oh, dear, it was nothing to\nthis.... Well, there is one consolation, such as it is--I've struck\nbottom this time; there's nothing lower.\"\n\nBut that was a hasty conclusion.\n\nAt ten that night he climbed the ladder in the haunted house, pale, weak\nand wretched. Roxy was standing in the door of one of the rooms,\nwaiting, for she had heard him.\n\nThis was a two-story log house which had acquired the reputation a few\nyears before of being haunted, and that was the end of its usefulness.\nNobody would live in it afterward, or go near it by night, and most\npeople even gave it a wide berth in the daytime. As it had no\ncompetition, it was called the haunted house. It was getting crazy and\nruinous, now, from long neglect. It stood three hundred yards beyond\nPudd'nhead Wilson's house, with nothing between but vacancy. It was the\nlast house in the town at that end.\n\nTom followed Roxy into the room. She had a pile of clean straw in the\ncorner for a bed, some cheap but well-kept clothing was hanging on the\nwall, there was a tin lantern freckling the floor with little spots of\nlight, and there were various soap-and-candle boxes scattered about,\nwhich served for chairs. The two sat down. Roxy said--\n\n\"Now den, I'll tell you straight off, en I'll begin to k'leck de money\nlater on; I ain't in no hurry. What does you reckon I's gwine to tell\nyou?\"\n\n\"Well, you--you--oh, Roxy, don't make it too hard for me! Come right out\nand tell me you've found out somehow what a shape I'm in on account of\ndissipation and foolishness.\"\n\n\"Disposition en foolishness! No sir, dat ain't it. Dat jist ain't\nnothin' at all, 'longside o' what I knows.\"\n\nTom stared at her, and said--\n\n\"Why, Roxy, what do you mean?\"\n\nShe rose, and gloomed above him like a Fate.\n\n\"I means dis--en it's de Lord's truth. You ain't no more kin to ole\nMarse Driscoll den I is!--dat's what I means!\" and her eyes flamed with\ntriumph.\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Yassir, en dat ain't all! You's a nigger!--bawn a nigger en a\nslave!--en you's a nigger en a slave dis minute; en if I opens my mouf\nole Marse Driscoll'll sell you down de river befo' you is two days older\nden what you is now!\"\n\n\"It's a thundering lie, you miserable old blatherskite!\"\n\n\"It ain't no lie, nuther. It's jes de truth, en nothin' but de truth, so\nhe'p me. Yassir--you's my son--\"\n\n\"You devil!\"\n\n\"En dat po' boy dat you's be'n a-kickin' en a-cuffin' to-day is Percy\nDriscoll's son en yo' marster--\"\n\n\"You beast!\"\n\n\"En his name's Tom Driscoll, en yo' name's Valet de Chambers, en you\nain't got no fambly name, beca'se niggers don't have em!\"\n\nTom sprang up and seized a billet of wood and raised raised it; but his\nmother only laughed at him, and said--\n\n\"Set down, you pup! Does you think you kin skyer me? It ain't in you,\nnor de likes of you. I reckon you'd shoot me in de back, maybe, if you\ngot a chance, for dat's jist yo' style--I knows you, throo en throo--but\nI don't mind gitt'n killed, beca'se all dis is down in writin' en it's\nin safe hands, too, en de man dat's got it knows whah to look for de\nright man when I gits killed. Oh, bless yo' soul, if you puts yo' mother\nup for as big a fool as you is, you's pow'ful mistaken, I kin tell you!\nNow den, you set still en behave yo'self; en don't you git up ag'in till\nI tell you!\"\n\nTom fretted and chafed awhile in a whirlwind of disorganizing sensations\nand emotions, and finally said, with something like settled conviction--\n\n\"The whole thing is moonshine; now then, go ahead and do your worst; I'm\ndone with you.\"\n\nRoxy made no answer. She took the lantern and started toward the door.\nTom was in a cold panic in a moment.\n\n\"Come back, come back!\" he wailed. \"I didn't mean it, Roxy; I take it\nall back, and I'll never say it again! Please come back, Roxy!\"\n\nThe woman stood a moment, then she said gravely:\n\n\"Dat's one thing you's got to stop, Valet de Chambers. You can't call me\nRoxy, same as if you was my equal. Chillen don't speak to dey mammies\nlike dat. You'll call me ma or mammy, dat's what you'll call\nme--leastways when dey ain't nobody aroun'. Say it!\"\n\nIt cost Tom a struggle, but he got it out.\n\n\"Dat's all right. Don't you ever forgit it ag'in, if you knows what's\ngood for you. Now den, you has said you wouldn't ever call it lies en\nmoonshine ag'in. I'll tell you dis, for a warnin': if you ever does say\nit ag'in, it's de las' time you'll ever say it to me; I'll tramp as\nstraight to de Judge as I kin walk, en tell him who you is, en prove it.\nDoes you b'lieve me when I says dat?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" groaned Tom, \"I more than believe it; I know it.\"\n\nRoxy knew her conquest was complete. She could have proved nothing to\nanybody, and her threat about the writings was a lie; but she knew the\nperson she was dealing with, and had made both statements without any\ndoubt as to the effect they would produce.\n\nShe went and sat down on her candle-box, and the pride and pomp of her\nvictorious attitude made it a throne. She said--\n\n\"Now den, Chambers, we's gwine to talk business, en dey ain't gwine to\nbe no mo' foolishness. In de fust place, you gits fifty dollahs a month;\nyou's gwine to han' over half of it to yo' ma. Plank it out!\"\n\nBut Tom had only six dollars in the world. He gave her that, and\npromised to start fair on next month's pension.\n\n\"Chambers, how much is you in debt?\"\n\nTom shuddered, and said--\n\n\"Nearly three hundred dollars.\"\n\n\"How is you gwine to pay it?\"\n\nTom groaned out--\"Oh, I don't know; don't ask me such awful questions.\"\n\nBut she stuck to her point until she wearied a confession out of him: he\nhad been prowling about in disguise, stealing small valuables from\nprivate houses; in fact, he made a good deal of a raid on his\nfellow-villagers a fortnight before, when he was supposed to be in St.\nLouis; but he doubted if he had sent away enough stuff to realize the\nrequired amount, and was afraid to make a further venture in the present\nexcited state of the town. His mother approved of his conduct, and\noffered to help, but this frightened him. He tremblingly ventured to say\nthat if she would retire from the town he should feel better and safer,\nand could hold his head higher--and was going on to make an argument,\nbut she interrupted and surprised him pleasantly by saying she was\nready; it didn't make any difference to her where she stayed, so that\nshe got her share of the pension regularly. She said she would not go\nfar, and would call at the haunted house once a month for her money.\nThen she said--\n\n\"I don't hate you so much now, but I've hated you a many a year--and\nanybody would. Didn't I change you off, en give you a good fambly en a\ngood name, en made you a white gen'l'man en rich, wid store clothes\non--en what did I git for it? You despised me all de time, en was al'ays\nsayin' mean hard things to me befo' folks, en wouldn't ever let me\nforgit I's a nigger--en--en------\"\n\nShe fell to sobbing, and broke down. Tom said--\"But you know I didn't\nknow you were my mother; and besides--\"\n\n\"Well, nemmine 'bout dat, now; let it go. I's gwine to fo'git it.\" Then\nshe added fiercely, \"En don't ever make me remember it ag'in, or you'll\nbe sorry, I tell you.\"\n\nWhen they were parting, Tom said, in the most persuasive way he could\ncommand--\n\n\"Ma, would you mind telling me who was my father?\"\n\nHe had supposed he was asking an embarrassing question. He was mistaken.\nRoxy drew herself up with a proud toss of her head, and said--\n\n\"Does I mine tellin' you? No, dat I don't! You ain't got no 'casion to\nbe shame' o' yo' father, I kin tell you. He wuz de highest quality in\ndis whole town--ole Virginny stock. Fust famblies, he wuz. Jes as good\nstock as de Driscolls en de Howards, de bes' day dey ever seed.\" She put\non a little prouder air, if possible, and added impressively: \"Does you\n'member Cunnel Cecil Burleigh Essex, dat died de same year yo' young\nMarse Tom Driscoll's pappy died, en all de Masons en Odd Fellers en\nChurches turned out en give him de bigges' funeral dis town ever seed?\nDat's de man.\"\n\nUnder the inspiration of her soaring complacency the departed graces of\nher earlier days returned to her, and her bearing took to itself a\ndignity and state that might have passed for queenly if her surroundings\nhad been a little more in keeping with it.\n\n\"Dey ain't another nigger in dis town dat's as high-bawn as you is. Now\nden, go 'long! En jes you hold yo' head up as high as you want to--you\nhas de right, en dat I kin swah.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nThe Nymph Revealed.\n\nAll say, \"How hard it is that we have to die\"--a strange complaint to\ncome from the mouths of people who have had to live.--Pudd'nhead\nWilson's Calendar.\n\nWhen angry, count four; when very angry, swear.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's\nCalendar.\n\nEvery now and then, after Tom went to bed, he had sudden wakings out of\nhis sleep, and his first thought was, \"Oh, joy, it was all a dream!\"\nThen he laid himself heavily down again, with a groan and the muttered\nwords, \"A nigger! I am a nigger! Oh, I wish I was dead!\"\n\nHe woke at dawn with one more repetition of this horror, and then he\nresolved to meddle no more with that treacherous sleep. He began to\nthink. Sufficiently bitter thinkings they were. They wandered along\nsomething after this fashion:\n\n\"Why were niggers and whites made? What crime did the uncreated first\nnigger commit that the curse of birth was decreed for him? And why is\nthis awful difference made between white and black? ... How hard the\nnigger's fate seems, this morning!--yet until last night such a thought\nnever entered my head.\"\n\nHe sighed and groaned an hour or more away. Then \"Chambers\" came humbly\nin to say that breakfast was nearly ready. \"Tom\" blushed scarlet to see\nthis aristocratic white youth cringe to him, a nigger, and call him\n\"Young Marster.\" He said roughly--\n\n\"Get out of my sight!\" and when the youth was gone, he muttered, \"He has\ndone me no harm, poor wretch, but he is an eyesore to me now, for he is\nDriscoll the young gentleman, and I am a--oh, I wish I was dead!\"\n\nA gigantic irruption, like that of Krakatoa a few years ago, with the\naccompanying earthquakes, tidal waves, and clouds of volcanic dust,\nchanges the face of the surrounding landscape beyond recognition,\nbringing down the high lands, elevating the low, making fair lakes where\ndeserts had been, and deserts where green prairies had smiled before.\nThe tremendous catastrophe which had befallen Tom had changed his moral\nlandscape in much the same way. Some of his low places he found lifted\nto ideals, some of his ideals had sunk to the valleys, and lay there\nwith the sackcloth and ashes of pumice-stone and sulphur on their ruined\nheads.\n\nFor days he wandered in lonely places, thinking, thinking,\nthinking--trying to get his bearings. It was new work. If he met a\nfriend, he found that the habit of a lifetime had in some mysterious way\nvanished--his arm hung limp, instead of involuntarily extending the hand\nfor a shake. It was the \"nigger\" in him asserting its humility, and he\nblushed and was abashed. And the \"nigger\" in him was surprised when the\nwhite friend put out his hand for a shake with him. He found the\n\"nigger\" in him involuntarily giving the road, on the sidewalk, to a\nwhite rowdy and loafer. When Rowena, the dearest thing his heart knew,\nthe idol of his secret worship, invited him in, the \"nigger\" in him made\nan embarrassed excuse and was afraid to enter and sit with the dread\nwhite folks on equal terms. The \"nigger\" in him went shrinking and\nskulking here and there and yonder, and fancying it saw suspicion and\nmaybe detection in all faces, tones, and gestures. So strange and\nuncharacteristic was Tom's conduct that people noticed it, and turned to\nlook after him when he passed on; and when he glanced back--as he could\nnot help doing, in spite of his best resistance--and caught that puzzled\nexpression in a person's face, it gave him a sick feeling, and he took\nhimself out of view as quickly as he could. He presently came to have a\nhunted sense and a hunted look, and then he fled away to the hill-tops\nand the solitudes. He said to himself that the curse of Ham was upon\nhim.\n\nHe dreaded his meals; the \"nigger\" in him was ashamed to sit at the\nwhite folks' table, and feared discovery all the time; and once when\nJudge Driscoll said, \"What's the matter with you? You look as meek as a\nnigger,\" he felt as secret murderers are said to feel when the accuser\nsays, \"Thou art the man!\" Tom said he was not well, and left the table.\n\nHis ostensible \"aunt's\" solicitudes and endearments were become a terror\nto him, and he avoided them.\n\nAnd all the time, hatred of his ostensible \"uncle\" was steadily growing\nin his heart; for he said to himself, \"He is white; and I am his\nchattel, his property, his goods, and he can sell me, just as he could\nhis dog.\"\n\nFor as much as a week after this, Tom imagined that his character had\nundergone a pretty radical change. But that was because he did not know\nhimself.\n\nIn several ways his opinions were totally changed, and would never go\nback to what they were before, but the main structure of his character\nwas not changed, and could not be changed. One or two very important\nfeatures of it were altered, and in time effects would result from this,\nif opportunity offered--effects of a quite serious nature, too. Under\nthe influence of a great mental and moral upheaval his character and\nhabits had taken on the appearance of complete change, but after a while\nwith the subsidence of the storm both began to settle toward their\nformer places. He dropped gradually back into his old frivolous and\neasy-going ways and conditions of feeling and manner of speech, and no\nfamiliar of his could have detected anything in him that differentiated\nhim from the weak and careless Tom of other days.\n\nThe theft-raid which he had made upon the village turned out better than\nhe had ventured to hope. It produced the sum necessary to pay his\ngaming-debts, and saved him from exposure to his uncle and another\nsmashing of the will. He and his mother learned to like each other\nfairly well. She couldn't love him, as yet, because there \"warn't\nnothing to him,\" as she expressed it, but her nature needed something or\nsomebody to rule over, and he was better than nothing. Her strong\ncharacter and aggressive and commanding ways compelled Tom's admiration\nin spite of the fact that he got more illustrations of them than he\nneeded for his comfort. However, as a rule her conversation was made up\nof racy tattle about the privacies of the chief families of the town\n(for she went harvesting among their kitchens every time she came to the\nvillage), and Tom enjoyed this. It was just in his line. She always\ncollected her half of his pension punctually, and he was always at the\nhaunted house to have a chat with her on these occasions. Every now and\nthen she paid him a visit there on between-days also.\n\nOccasionally he would run up to St. Louis for a few weeks, and at last\ntemptation caught him again. He won a lot of money, but lost it, and\nwith it a deal more besides, which he promised to raise as soon as\npossible.\n\nFor this purpose he projected a new raid on his town. He never meddled\nwith any other town, for he was afraid to venture into houses whose ins\nand outs he did not know and the habits of whose households he was not\nacquainted with. He arrived at the haunted house in disguise on the\nWednesday before the advent of the twins--after writing his aunt Pratt\nthat he would not arrive until two days after--and lay in hiding there\nwith his mother until toward daylight Friday morning, when he went to\nhis uncle's house and entered by the back way with his own key, and\nslipped up to his room, where he could have the use of the mirror and\ntoilet articles. He had a suit of girl's clothes with him in a bundle as\na disguise for his raid, and was wearing a suit of his mother's\nclothing, with black gloves and veil. By dawn he was tricked out for his\nraid, but he caught a glimpse of Pudd'nhead Wilson through the window\nover the way, and knew that Pudd'nhead had caught a glimpse of him. So\nhe entertained Wilson with some airs and graces and attitudes for a\nwhile, then stepped out of sight and resumed the other disguise, and by\nand by went down and out the back way and started down town to\nreconnoiter the scene of his intended labors.\n\nBut he was ill at ease. He had changed back to Roxy's dress, with the\nstoop of age added to the disguise, so that Wilson would not bother\nhimself about a humble old woman leaving a neighbor's house by the back\nway in the early morning, in case he was still spying. But supposing\nWilson had seen him leave, and had thought it suspicious, and had also\nfollowed him? The thought made Tom cold. He gave up the raid for the\nday, and hurried back to the haunted house by the obscurest route he\nknew. His mother was gone; but she came back, by and by, with the news\nof the grand reception at Patsy Cooper's, and soon persuaded him that\nthe opportunity was like a special providence, it was so inviting and\nperfect. So he went raiding, after all, and made a nice success of it\nwhile everybody was gone to Patsy Cooper's. Success gave him nerve and\neven actual intrepidity; insomuch, indeed, that after he had conveyed\nhis harvest to his mother in a back alley, he went to the reception\nhimself, and added several of the valuables of that house to his\ntakings.\n\nAfter this long digression we have now arrived once more at the point\nwhere Pudd'nhead Wilson, while waiting for the arrival of the twins on\nthat same Friday evening, sat puzzling over the strange apparition of\nthat morning--a girl in young Tom Driscoll's bedroom; fretting, and\nguessing, and puzzling over it, and wondering who the shameless creature\nmight be.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nPudd'nhead's Startling Discovery.\n\nThere are three infallible ways of pleasing an author, and the three\nform a rising scale of compliment: 1, to tell him you have read one of\nhis books; 2, to tell him you have read all of his books; 3, to ask him\nto let you read the manuscript of his forthcoming book. No. 1 admits you\nto his respect; No. 2 admits you to his admiration; No. 3 carries you\nclear into his heart.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nAs to the Adjective: when in doubt, strike it out.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's\nCalendar.\n\nThe twins arrived presently, and talk began. It flowed along chattily\nand sociably, and under its influence the new friendship gathered ease\nand strength. Wilson got out his Calendar, by request, and read a\npassage or two from it, which the twins praised quite cordially. This\npleased the author so much that he complied gladly when they asked him\nto lend them a batch of the work to read at home. In the course of their\nwide travels they had found out that there are three sure ways of\npleasing an author; they were now working the best of the three.\n\nThere was an interruption, now. Young Tom Driscoll appeared, and joined\nthe party. He pretended to be seeing the distinguished strangers for the\nfirst time when they rose to shake hands; but this was only a blind, as\nhe had already had a glimpse of them, at the reception, while robbing\nthe house. The twins made mental note that he was smooth-faced and\nrather handsome, and smooth and undulatory in his movements--graceful,\nin fact. Angelo thought he had a good eye; Luigi thought there was\nsomething veiled and sly about it. Angelo thought he had a pleasant\nfree-and-easy way of talking; Luigi thought it was more so than was\nagreeable. Angelo thought he was a sufficiently nice young man; Luigi\nreserved his decision. Tom's first contribution to the conversation was\na question which he had put to Wilson a hundred times before. It was\nalways cheerily and good-naturedly put, and always inflicted a little\npang, for it touched a secret sore; but this time the pang was sharp,\nsince strangers were present.\n\n\"Well, how does the law come on? Had a case yet?\"\n\nWilson bit his lip, but answered, \"No--not yet,\" with as much\nindifference as he could assume. Judge Driscoll had generously left the\nlaw feature out of the Wilson biography which he had furnished to the\ntwins. Young Tom laughed pleasantly, and said:\n\n\"Wilson's a lawyer, gentlemen, but he doesn't practise now.\"\n\nThe sarcasm bit, but Wilson kept himself under control, and said without\npassion:\n\n\"I don't practise, it is true. It is true that I have never had a case,\nand have had to earn a poor living for twenty years as an expert\naccountant in a town where I can't get hold of a set of books to\nuntangle as often as I should like. But it is also true that I did fit\nmyself well for the practice of the law. By the time I was your age,\nTom, I had chosen a profession, and was soon competent to enter upon\nit.\" Tom winced. \"I never got a chance to try my hand at it, and I may\nnever get a chance; and yet if I ever do get it I shall be found ready,\nfor I have kept up my law-studies all these years.\"\n\n\"That's it; that's good grit! I like to see it. I've a notion to throw\nall my business your way. My business and your law-practice ought to\nmake a pretty gay team, Dave,\" and the young fellow laughed again.\n\n\"If you will throw--\" Wilson had thought of the girl in Tom's bedroom,\nand was going to say, \"If you will throw the surreptitious and\ndisreputable part of your business my way, it may amount to something;\"\nbut thought better of it and said, \"However, this matter doesn't fit\nwell in a general conversation.\"\n\n\"All right, we'll change the subject; I guess you were about to give me\nanother dig, anyway, so I'm willing to change. How's the Awful Mystery\nflourishing these days? Wilson's got a scheme for driving plain\nwindow-glass out of the market by decorating it with greasy\nfinger-marks, and getting rich by selling it at famine prices to the\ncrowned heads over in Europe to outfit their palaces with. Fetch it out,\nDave.\"\n\nWilson brought three of his glass strips, and said--\n\n\"I get the subject to pass the fingers of his right hand through his\nhair, so as to get a little coating of the natural oil on them, and then\npress the balls of them on the glass. A fine and delicate print of the\nlines in the skin results, and is permanent, if it doesn't come in\ncontact with something able to rub it off. You begin, Tom.\"\n\n\"Why, I think you took my finger-marks once or twice before.\"\n\n\"Yes; but you were a little boy the last time, only about twelve years\nold.\"\n\n\"That's so. Of course I've changed entirely since then, and variety is\nwhat the crowned heads want, I guess.\"\n\nHe passed his fingers through his crop of short hair, and pressed them\none at a time on the glass. Angelo made a print of his fingers on\nanother glass, and Luigi followed with the third. Wilson marked the\nglasses with names and date, and put them away. Tom gave one of his\nlittle laughs, and said--\n\n\"I thought I wouldn't say anything, but if variety is what you are\nafter, you have wasted a piece of glass. The hand-print of one twin is\nthe same as the hand-print of the fellow-twin.\"\n\n\"Well, it's done now, and I like to have them both, anyway,\" said\nWilson, returning to his place.\n\n\"But look here, Dave,\" said Tom, \"you used to tell people's fortunes,\ntoo, when you took their finger-marks. Dave's just an all-round\ngenius--a genius of the first water, gentlemen; a great scientist\nrunning to seed here in this village, a prophet with the kind of honor\nthat prophets generally get at home--for here they don't give shucks for\nhis scientifics, and they call his skull a notion-factory--hey, Dave,\nain't it so? But never mind; he'll make his mark some day--finger-mark,\nyou know, he-he! But really, you want to let him take a shy at your\npalms once; it's worth twice the price of admission or your money's\nreturned at the door. Why, he'll read your wrinkles as easy as a book,\nand not only tell you fifty or sixty things that's going to happen to\nyou, but fifty or sixty thousand that ain't. Come, Dave, show the\ngentlemen what an inspired Jack-at-all-science we've got in this town,\nand don't know it.\"\n\nWilson winced under this nagging and not very courteous chaff, and the\ntwins suffered with him and for him. They rightly judged, now, that the\nbest way to relieve him would be to take the thing in earnest and treat\nit with respect, ignoring Tom's rather overdone raillery; so Luigi\nsaid--\n\n\"We have seen something of palmistry in our wanderings, and know very\nwell what astonishing things it can do. If it isn't a science, and one\nof the greatest of them, too, I don't know what its other name ought to\nbe. In the Orient--\"\n\nTom looked surprised and incredulous. He said--\n\n\"That juggling a science? But really, you ain't serious, are you?\"\n\n\"Yes, entirely so. Four years ago we had our hands read out to us as if\nour palms had been covered with print.\"\n\n\"Well, do you mean to say there was actually anything in it?\" asked Tom,\nhis incredulity beginning to weaken a little.\n\n\"There was this much in it,\" said Angelo: \"what was told us of our\ncharacters was minutely exact--we could not have bettered it ourselves.\nNext, two or three memorable things that had happened to us were laid\nbare--things which no one present but ourselves could have known about.\"\n\n\"Why, it's rank sorcery!\" exclaimed Tom, who was now becoming very much\ninterested. \"And how did they make out with what was going to happen to\nyou in the future?\"\n\n\"On the whole, quite fairly,\" said Luigi. \"Two or three of the most\nstriking things foretold have happened since; much the most striking one\nof all happened within that same year. Some of the minor prophecies have\ncome true; some of the minor and some of the major ones have not been\nfulfilled yet, and of course may never be: still, I should be more\nsurprised if they failed to arrive than if they didn't.\"\n\nTom was entirely sobered, and profoundly impressed. He said,\napologetically--\n\n\"Dave, I wasn't meaning to belittle that science; I was only\nchaffing--chattering, I reckon I'd better say. I wish you would look at\ntheir palms. Come, won't you?\"\n\n\"Why certainly, if you want me to; but you know I've had no chance to\nbecome an expert, and don't claim to be one. When a past event is\nsomewhat prominently recorded in the palm I can generally detect that,\nbut minor ones often escape me,--not always, of course, but often,--but\nI haven't much confidence in myself when it comes to reading the future.\nI am talking as if palmistry was a daily study with me, but that is not\nso. I haven't examined half a dozen hands in the last half dozen years;\nyou see, the people got to joking about it, and I stopped to let the\ntalk die down. I'll tell you what we'll do, Count Luigi: I'll make a try\nat your past, and if I have any success there--no, on the whole, I'll\nlet the future alone; that's really the affair of an expert.\"\n\nHe took Luigi's hand. Tom said--\n\n\"Wait--don't look yet, Dave! Count Luigi, here's paper and pencil. Set\ndown that thing that you said was the most striking one that was\nforetold to you, and happened less than a year afterward, and give it to\nme so I can see if Dave finds it in your hand.\"\n\nLuigi wrote a line privately, and folded up the piece of paper, and\nhanded it to Tom, saying--\n\n\"I'll tell you when to look at it, if he finds it.\"\n\nWilson began to study Luigi's palm, tracing life lines, heart lines,\nhead lines, and so on, and noting carefully their relations with the\ncobweb of finer and more delicate marks and lines that enmeshed them on\nall sides; he felt of the fleshy cushion at the base of the thumb, and\nnoted its shape; he felt of the fleshy side of the hand between the\nwrist and the base of the little finger, and noted its shape also; he\npainstakingly examined the fingers, observing their form, proportions,\nand natural manner of disposing themselves when in repose. All this\nprocess was watched by the three spectators with absorbing interest,\ntheir heads bent together over Luigi's palm, and nobody disturbing the\nstillness with a word. Wilson now entered upon a close survey of the\npalm again, and his revelations began.\n\nHe mapped out Luigi's character and disposition, his tastes, aversions,\nproclivities, ambitions, and eccentricities in a way which sometimes\nmade Luigi wince and the others laugh, but both twins declared that the\nchart was artistically drawn and was correct.\n\nNext, Wilson took up Luigi's history. He proceeded cautiously and with\nhesitation, now, moving his finger slowly along the great lines of the\npalm, and now and then halting it at a \"star\" or some such landmark, and\nexamining that neighborhood minutely. He proclaimed one or two past\nevents, Luigi confirmed his correctness, and the search went on.\nPresently Wilson glanced up suddenly with a surprised expression--\n\n\"Here is a record of an incident which you would perhaps not wish me\nto--\"\n\n\"Bring it out,\" said Luigi, good-naturedly; \"I promise you it sha'n't\nembarrass me.\"\n\nBut Wilson still hesitated, and did not seem quite to know what to do.\nThen he said--\n\n\"I think it is too delicate a matter to--to--I believe I would rather\nwrite it or whisper it to you, and let you decide for yourself whether\nyou want it talked out or not.\"\n\n\"That will answer,\" said Luigi; \"write it.\"\n\nWilson wrote something on a slip of paper and handed it to Luigi, who\nread it to himself and said to Tom--\n\n\"Unfold your slip and read it, Mr. Driscoll.\"\n\nTom read:\n\n\"It was prophesied that I would kill a man. It came true before the year\nwas out.\"\n\nTom added, \"Great Scott!\"\n\nLuigi handed Wilson's paper to Tom, and said--\n\n\"Now read this one.\"\n\nTom read:\n\n\"You have killed some one, but whether man, woman or child, I do not\nmake out.\"\n\n\"C\u00e6sar's ghost!\" commented Tom, with astonishment. \"It beats anything\nthat was ever heard of! Why, a man's own hand is his deadliest enemy!\nJust think of that--a man's own hand keeps a record of the deepest and\nfatalest secrets of his life, and is treacherously ready to expose him\nto any black-magic stranger that comes along. But what do you let a\nperson look at your hand for, with that awful thing printed on it?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Luigi, reposefully, \"I don't mind it. I killed the man for\ngood reasons, and I don't regret it.\"\n\n\"What were the reasons?\"\n\n\"Well, he needed killing.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you why he did it, since he won't say himself,\" said Angelo,\nwarmly. \"He did it to save my life, that's what he did it for. So it was\na noble act, and not a thing to be hid in the dark.\"\n\n\"So it was, so it was,\" said Wilson; \"to do such a thing to save a\nbrother's life is a great and fine action.\"\n\n\"Now come,\" said Luigi, \"it is very pleasant to hear you say these\nthings, but for unselfishness, or heroism, or magnanimity, the\ncircumstances won't stand scrutiny. You overlook one detail; suppose I\nhadn't saved Angelo's life, what would have become of mine? If I had let\nthe man kill him, wouldn't he have killed me, too? I saved my own life,\nyou see.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is your way of talking,\" said Angelo, \"but I know you--I\ndon't believe you thought of yourself at all. I keep that weapon yet\nthat Luigi killed the man with, and I'll show it to you sometime. That\nincident makes it interesting, and it had a history before it came into\nLuigi's hands which adds to its interest. It was given to Luigi by a\ngreat Indian prince, the Gaikowar of Baroda, and it had been in his\nfamily two or three centuries. It killed a good many disagreeable people\nwho troubled that hearthstone at one time and another. It isn't much too\nlook at, except that it isn't shaped like other knives, or dirks, or\nwhatever it may be called--here, I'll draw it for you.\" He took a sheet\nof paper and made a rapid sketch. \"There it is--a broad and murderous\nblade, with edges like a razor for sharpness. The devices engraved on it\nare the ciphers or names of its long line of possessors--I had Luigi's\nname added in Roman letters myself with our coat of arms, as you see.\nYou notice what a curious handle the thing has. It is solid ivory,\npolished like a mirror, and is four or five inches long--round, and as\nthick as a large man's wrist, with the end squared off flat, for your\nthumb to rest on; for you grasp it, with your thumb resting on the blunt\nend--so--and lift it aloft and strike downward. The Gaikowar showed us\nhow the thing was done when he gave it to Luigi, and before that night\nwas ended Luigi had used the knife, and the Gaikowar was a man short by\nreason of it. The sheath is magnificently ornamented with gems of great\nvalue. You will find the sheath more worth looking at than the knife\nitself, of course.\"\n\nTom said to himself--\n\n\"It's lucky I came here. I would have sold that knife for a song; I\nsupposed the jewels were glass.\"\n\n\"But go on; don't stop,\" said Wilson. \"Our curiosity is up now, to hear\nabout the homicide. Tell us about that.\"\n\n\"Well, briefly, the knife was to blame for that, all around. A native\nservant slipped into our room in the palace in the night, to kill us and\nsteal the knife on account of the fortune incrusted on its sheath,\nwithout a doubt. Luigi had it under his pillow; we were in bed together.\nThere was a dim night-light burning. I was asleep, but Luigi was awake,\nand he thought he detected a vague form nearing the bed. He slipped the\nknife out of the sheath and was ready, and unembarrassed by hampering\nbed-clothes, for the weather was hot and we hadn't any. Suddenly that\nnative rose at the bedside, and bent over me with his right hand lifted\nand a dirk in it aimed at my throat; but Luigi grabbed his wrist, pulled\nhim downward, and drove his own knife into the man's neck. That is the\nwhole story.\"\n\nWilson and Tom drew deep breaths, and after some general chat about the\ntragedy, Pudd'nhead said, taking Tom's hand--\n\n\"Now, Tom, I've never had a look at your palms, as it happens; perhaps\nyou've got some little questionable privacies that need--hel-lo!\"\n\nTom had snatched away his hand, and was looking a good deal confused.\n\n\"Why, he's blushing!\" said Luigi.\n\nTom darted an ugly look at him, and said sharply--\n\n\"Well, if I am, it ain't because I'm a murderer!\" Luigi's dark face\nflushed, but before he could speak or move, Tom added with anxious\nhaste: \"Oh, I beg a thousand pardons. I didn't mean that; it was out\nbefore I thought, and I'm very, very sorry--you must forgive me!\"\n\nWilson came to the rescue, and smoothed things down as well as he could;\nand in fact was entirely successful as far as the twins were concerned,\nfor they felt sorrier for the affront put upon him by his guest's\noutburst of ill manners than for the insult offered to Luigi. But the\nsuccess was not so pronounced with the offender. Tom tried to seem at\nhis ease, and he went through the motions fairly well, but at bottom he\nfelt resentful toward all the three witnesses of his exhibition; in\nfact, he felt so annoyed at them for having witnessed it and noticed it\nthat he almost forgot to feel annoyed at himself for placing it before\nthem. However, something presently happened which made him almost\ncomfortable, and brought him nearly back to a state of charity and\nfriendliness. This was a little spat between the twins; not much of a\nspat, but still a spat; and before they got far with it they were in a\ndecided condition of irritation with each other. Tom was charmed; so\npleased, indeed, that he cautiously did what he could to increase the\nirritation while pretending to be actuated by more respectable motives.\nBy his help the fire got warmed up to the blazing-point, and he might\nhave had the happiness of seeing the flames show up, in another moment,\nbut for the interruption of a knock on the door--an interruption which\nfretted him as much as it gratified Wilson. Wilson opened the door.\n\nThe visitor was a good-natured, ignorant, energetic, middle-aged\nIrishman named John Buckstone, who was a great politician in a small\nway, and always took a large share in public matters of every sort. One\nof the town's chief excitements, just now, was over the matter of rum.\nThere was a strong rum party and a strong anti-rum party. Buckstone was\ntraining with the rum party, and he had been sent to hunt up the twins\nand invite them to attend a mass-meeting of that faction. He delivered\nhis errand, and said the clans were already gathering in the big hall\nover the market-house. Luigi accepted the invitation cordially, Angelo\nless cordially, since he disliked crowds, and did not drink the powerful\nintoxicants of America. In fact, he was even a teetotaler\nsometimes--when it was judicious to be one.\n\nThe twins left with Buckstone, and Tom Driscoll joined company with them\nuninvited.\n\nIn the distance one could see a long wavering line of torches drifting\ndown the main street, and could hear the throbbing of the bass drum, the\nclash of cymbals, the squeaking of a fife or two, and the faint roar of\nremote hurrahs. The tail-end of this procession was climbing the\nmarket-house stairs when the twins arrived in its neighborhood; when\nthey reached the hall it was full of people, torches, smoke, noise and\nenthusiasm. They were conducted to the platform by Buckstone--Tom\nDriscoll still following--and were delivered to the chairman in the\nmidst of a prodigious explosion of welcome. When the noise had moderated\na little, the chair proposed that \"our illustrious guests be at once\nelected, by complimentary acclamation, to membership in our\never-glorious organization, the paradise of the free and the perdition\nof the slave.\"\n\nThis eloquent discharge opened the flood-gates of enthusiasm again, and\nthe election was carried with thundering unanimity. Then arose a storm\nof cries:\n\n\"Wet them down! Wet them down! Give them a drink!\"\n\nGlasses of whisky were handed to the twins. Luigi waved his aloft, then\nbrought it to his lips; but Angelo set his down. There was another storm\nof cries:\n\n\"What's the matter with the other one?\" \"What is the blond one going\nback on us for?\" \"Explain! Explain!\"\n\nThe chairman inquired, and then reported--\n\n\"We have made an unfortunate mistake, gentlemen. I find that the Count\nAngelo Capello is opposed to our creed--is a teetotaler, in fact, and\nwas not intending to apply for membership with us. He desires that we\nreconsider the vote by which he was elected. What is the pleasure of the\nhouse?\"\n\nThere was a general burst of laughter, plentifully accented with\nwhistlings and cat-calls, but the energetic use of the gavel presently\nrestored something like order. Then a man spoke from the crowd, and said\nthat while he was very sorry that the mistake had been made, it would\nnot be possible to rectify it at the present meeting. According to the\nby-laws it must go over to the next regular meeting for action. He would\nnot offer a motion, as none was required. He desired to apologize to the\ngentleman in the name of the house, and begged to assure him that as far\nas it might lie in the power of the Sons of Liberty, his temporary\nmembership in the order would be made pleasant to him.\n\nThis speech was received with great applause, mixed with cries of--\n\n\"That's the talk!\" \"He's a good fellow, anyway, if he is a teetotaler!\"\n\"Drink his health!\" \"Give him a rouser, and no heeltaps!\"\n\nGlasses were handed around, and everybody on the platform drank Angelo's\nhealth, while the house bellowed forth in song:\n\n   For he's a jolly good fel-low,\n   For he's a jolly good fel-low,\n   For he's a jolly good fe-el-low,--\n      Which nobody can deny.\n\nTom Driscoll drank. It was his second glass, for he had drunk Angelo's\nthe moment that Angelo had set it down. The two drinks made him very\nmerry--almost idiotically so--and he began to take a most lively and\nprominent part in the proceedings, particularly in the music and\ncat-calls and side-remarks.\n\nThe chairman was still standing at the front, the twins at his side. The\nextraordinarily close resemblance of the brothers to each other\nsuggested a witticism to Tom Driscoll, and just as the chairman began a\nspeech he skipped forward and said with an air of tipsy confidence to\nthe audience--\n\n\"Boys, I move that he keeps still and lets this human philopena snip you\nout a speech.\"\n\nThe descriptive aptness of the phrase caught the house, and a mighty\nburst of laughter followed.\n\nLuigi's southern blood leaped to the boiling-point in a moment under the\nsharp humiliation of this insult delivered in the presence of four\nhundred strangers. It was not in the young man's nature to let the\nmatter pass, or to delay the squaring of the account. He took a couple\nof strides and halted behind the unsuspecting joker. Then he drew back\nand delivered a kick of such titanic vigor that it lifted Tom clear over\nthe footlights and landed him on the heads of the front row of the Sons\nof Liberty.\n\nEven a sober person does not like to have a human being emptied on him\nwhen he is not doing any harm; a person who is not sober cannot endure\nsuch an attention at all. The nest of Sons of Liberty that Driscoll\nlanded in had not a sober bird in it; in fact there was probably not an\nentirely sober one in the auditorium. Driscoll was promptly and\nindignantly flung on to the heads of Sons in the next row, and these\nSons passed him on toward the rear, and then immediately began to pummel\nthe front-row Sons who had passed him to them. This course was strictly\nfollowed by bench after bench as Driscoll traveled in his tumultuous and\nairy flight toward the door; so he left behind him an ever lengthening\nwake of raging and plunging and fighting and swearing humanity. Down\nwent group after group of torches, and presently above the deafening\nclatter of the gavel, roar of angry voices, and crash of succumbing\nbenches, rose the paralyzing cry of \"Fire!\"\n\nThe fighting ceased instantly; the cursing ceased; for one distinctly\ndefined moment there was a dead hush, a motionless calm, where the\ntempest had been; then with one impulse the multitude awoke to life and\nenergy again, and went surging and struggling and swaying, this way and\nthat, its outer edges melting away through windows and doors and\ngradually lessening the pressure and relieving the mass.\n\nThe fire-boys were never on hand so suddenly before; for there was no\ndistance to go, this time, their quarters being in the rear end of the\nmarket-house. There was an engine company and a hook-and-ladder company.\nHalf of each was composed of rummies and the other half of anti-rummies,\nafter the moral and political share-and-share-alike fashion of the\nfrontier town of the period. Enough anti-rummies were loafing in\nquarters to man the engine and the ladders. In two minutes they had\ntheir red shirts and helmets on--they never stirred officially in\nunofficial costume--and as the mass meeting overhead smashed through the\nlong row of windows and poured out upon the roof of the arcade, the\ndeliverers were ready for them with a powerful stream of water which\nwashed some of them off the roof and nearly drowned the rest. But water\nwas preferable to fire, and still the stampede from the windows\ncontinued, and still the pitiless drenching assailed it until the\nbuilding was empty; then the fire-boys mounted to the hall and flooded\nit with water enough to annihilate forty times as much fire as there was\nthere; for a village fire-company does not often get a chance to show\noff, and so when it does get a chance it makes the most of it. Such\ncitizens of that village as were of a thoughtful and judicious\ntemperament did not insure against fire; they insured against the\nfire-company.\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nThe Shame of Judge Driscoll.\n\nCourage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear--not absence of fear.\nExcept a creature be part coward it is not a compliment to say it is\nbrave; it is merely a loose misapplication of the word. Consider the\nflea!--incomparably the bravest of all the creatures of God, if\nignorance of fear were courage. Whether you are asleep or awake he will\nattack you, caring nothing for the fact that in bulk and strength you\nare to him as are the massed armies of the earth to a sucking child; he\nlives both day and night and all days and nights in the very lap of\nperil and the immediate presence of death, and yet is no more afraid\nthan is the man who walks the streets of a city that was threatened by\nan earthquake ten centuries before. When we speak of Clive, Nelson, and\nPutnam as men who \"didn't know what fear was,\" we ought always to add\nthe flea--and put him at the head of the procession.--Pudd'nhead\nWilson's Calendar.\n\nJudge Driscoll was in bed and asleep by ten o'clock on Friday night, and\nhe was up and gone a-fishing before daylight in the morning with his\nfriend Pembroke Howard. These two had been boys together in Virginia\nwhen that State still ranked as the chief and most imposing member of\nthe Union, and they still coupled the proud and affectionate adjective\n\"old\" with her name when they spoke of her. In Missouri a recognized\nsuperiority attached to any person who hailed from Old Virginia; and\nthis superiority was exalted to supremacy when a person of such nativity\ncould also prove descent from the First Families of that great\ncommonwealth. The Howards and Driscolls were of this aristocracy. In\ntheir eyes it was a nobility. It had its unwritten laws, and they were\nas clearly defined and as strict as any that could be found among the\nprinted statutes of the land. The F. F. V. was born a gentleman; his\nhighest duty in life was to watch over that great inheritance and keep\nit unsmirched. He must keep his honor spotless. Those laws were his\nchart; his course was marked out on it; if he swerved from it by so much\nas half a point of the compass it meant shipwreck to his honor; that is\nto say, degradation from his rank as a gentleman. These laws required\ncertain things of him which his religion might forbid: then his religion\nmust yield--the laws could not be relaxed to accommodate religions or\nanything else. Honor stood first; and the laws defined what it was and\nwherein it differed in certain details from honor as defined by church\ncreeds and by the social laws and customs of some of the minor divisions\nof the globe that had got crowded out when the sacred boundaries of\nVirginia were staked out.\n\nIf Judge Driscoll was the recognized first citizen of Dawson's Landing,\nPembroke Howard was easily its recognized second citizen. He was called\n\"the great lawyer\"--an earned title. He and Driscoll were of the same\nage--a year or two past sixty.\n\nAlthough Driscoll was a free-thinker and Howard a strong and determined\nPresbyterian, their warm intimacy suffered no impairment in consequence.\nThey were men whose opinions were their own property and not subject to\nrevision and amendment, suggestion or criticism, by anybody, even their\nfriends.\n\nThe day's fishing finished, they came floating down stream in their\nskiff, talking national politics and other high matters, and presently\nmet a skiff coming up from town, with a man in it who said:\n\n\"I reckon you know one of the new twins gave your nephew a kicking last\nnight, Judge?\"\n\n\"Did what?\"\n\n\"Gave him a kicking.\"\n\nThe old Judge's lips paled, and his eyes began to flame. He choked with\nanger for a moment, then he got out what he was trying to say--\n\n\"Well--well--go on! give me the details!\"\n\nThe man did it. At the finish the Judge was silent a minute, turning\nover in his mind the shameful picture of Tom's flight over the\nfootlights; then he said, as if musing aloud--\"H'm--I don't understand\nit. I was asleep at home. He didn't wake me. Thought he was competent to\nmanage his affair without my help, I reckon.\" His face lit up with pride\nand pleasure at that thought, and he said with a cheery complacency, \"I\nlike that--it's the true old blood--hey, Pembroke?\"\n\nHoward smiled an iron smile, and nodded his head approvingly. Then the\nnews-bringer spoke again--\n\n\"But Tom beat the twin on the trial.\"\n\nThe Judge looked at the man wonderingly, and said--\n\n\"The trial? What trial?\"\n\n\"Why, Tom had him up before Judge Robinson for assault and battery.\"\n\nThe old man shrank suddenly together like one who has received a\ndeath-stroke. Howard sprang for him as he sank forward in a swoon, and\ntook him in his arms, and bedded him on his back in the boat. He\nsprinkled water in his face, and said to the startled visitor--\n\n\"Go, now--don't let him come to and find you here. You see what an\neffect your heedless speech has had; you ought to have been more\nconsiderate than to blurt out such a cruel piece of slander as that.\"\n\n\"I'm right down sorry I did it now, Mr. Howard, and I wouldn't have done\nit if I had thought: but it ain't slander; it's perfectly true, just as\nI told him.\"\n\nHe rowed away. Presently the old Judge came out of his faint and looked\nup piteously into the sympathetic face that was bent over him.\n\n\"Say it ain't true, Pembroke; tell me it ain't true!\" he said in a weak\nvoice.\n\nThere was nothing weak in the deep organ-tones that responded--\n\n\"You know it's a lie as well as I do, old friend. He is of the best\nblood of the Old Dominion.\"\n\n\"God bless you for saying it!\" said the old gentleman, fervently. \"Ah,\nPembroke, it was such a blow!\"\n\nHoward stayed by his friend, and saw him home, and entered the house\nwith him. It was dark, and past supper-time, but the Judge was not\nthinking of supper; he was eager to hear the slander refuted from\nheadquarters, and as eager to have Howard hear it, too. Tom was sent\nfor, and he came immediately. He was bruised and lame, and was not a\nhappy-looking object. His uncle made him sit down, and said--\n\n\"We have been hearing about your adventure, Tom, with a handsome lie\nadded to it for embellishment. Now pulverize that lie to dust! What\nmeasures have you taken? How does the thing stand?\"\n\nTom answered guilelessly: \"It don't stand at all; it's all over. I had\nhim up in court and beat him. Pudd'nhead Wilson defended him--first case\nhe ever had, and lost it. The judge fined the miserable hound five\ndollars for the assault.\"\n\nHoward and the Judge sprang to their feet with the opening\nsentence--why, neither knew; then they stood gazing vacantly at each\nother. Howard stood a moment, then sat mournfully down without saying\nanything. The Judge's wrath began to kindle, and he burst out--\n\n\"You cur! You scum! You vermin! Do you mean to tell me that blood of my\nrace has suffered a blow and crawled to a court of law about it? Answer\nme!\"\n\nTom's head drooped, and he answered with an eloquent silence. His uncle\nstared at him with a mixed expression of amazement and shame and\nincredulity that was sorrowful to see. At last he said--\n\n\"Which of the twins was it?\"\n\n\"Count Luigi.\"\n\n\"You have challenged him?\"\n\n\"N--no,\" hesitated Tom, turning pale.\n\n\"You will challenge him to-night. Howard will carry it.\"\n\nTom began to turn sick, and to show it. He turned his hat round and\nround in his hand, his uncle glowering blacker and blacker upon him as\nthe heavy seconds drifted by; then at last he began to stammer, and said\npiteously--\n\n\"Oh, please don't ask me to do it, uncle! He is a murderous devil--I\nnever could--I--I'm afraid of him!\"\n\nOld Driscoll's mouth opened and closed three times before he could get\nit to perform its office; then he stormed out--\n\n\"A coward in my family! A Driscoll a coward! Oh, what have I done to\ndeserve this infamy!\" He tottered to his secretary in the corner\nrepeating that lament again and again in heartbreaking tones, and got\nout of a drawer a paper, which he slowly tore to bits scattering the\nbits absently in his track as he walked up and down the room, still\ngrieving and lamenting. At last he said--\n\n\"There it is, shreds and fragments once more--my will. Once more you\nhave forced me to disinherit you, you base son of a most noble father!\nLeave my sight! Go--before I spit on you!\"\n\nThe young man did not tarry. Then the Judge turned to Howard:\n\n\"You will be my second, old friend?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"There is pen and paper. Draft the cartel, and lose no time.\"\n\n\"The Count shall have it in his hands in fifteen minutes,\" said Howard.\n\nTom was very heavy-hearted. His appetite was gone with his property and\nhis self-respect. He went out the back way and wandered down the obscure\nlane grieving, and wondering if any course of future conduct, however\ndiscreet and carefully perfected and watched over, could win back his\nuncle's favor and persuade him to reconstruct once more that generous\nwill which had just gone to ruin before his eyes. He finally concluded\nthat it could. He said to himself that he had accomplished this sort of\ntriumph once already, and that what had been done once could be done\nagain. He would set about it. He would bend every energy to the task,\nand he would score that triumph once more, cost what it might to his\nconvenience, limit as it might his frivolous and liberty-loving life.\n\n\"To begin,\" he said to himself, \"I'll square up with the proceeds of my\nraid, and then gambling has got to be stopped--and stopped short off.\nIt's the worst vice I've got--from my standpoint, anyway, because it's\nthe one he can most easily find out, through the impatience of my\ncreditors. He thought it expensive to have to pay two hundred dollars to\nthem for me once. Expensive--that! Why, it cost me the whole of his\nfortune--but of course he never thought of that; some people can't think\nof any but their own side of a case. If he had known how deep I am in,\nnow, the will would have gone to pot without waiting for a duel to help.\nThree hundred dollars! It's a pile! But he'll never hear of it, I'm\nthankful to say. The minute I've cleared it off, I'm safe; and I'll\nnever touch a card again. Anyway, I won't while he lives, I make oath to\nthat. I'm entering on my last reform--I know it--yes, and I'll win; but\nafter that, if I ever slip again I'm gone.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nTom Stares at Ruin.\n\nWhen I reflect upon the number of disagreeable people who I know have\ngone to a better world, I am moved to lead a different life.--Pudd'nhead\nWilson's Calendar.\n\nOctober. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in\nstocks in. The others are July, January, September, April, November,\nMay, March, June, December, August, and February.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's\nCalendar.\n\nThus mournfully communing with himself Tom moped along the lane past\nPudd'nhead Wilson's house, and still on and on between fences inclosing\nvacant country on each hand till he neared the haunted house, then he\ncame moping back again, with many sighs and heavy with trouble. He\nsorely wanted cheerful company. Rowena! His heart gave a bound at the\nthought, but the next thought quieted it--the detested twins would be\nthere.\n\nHe was on the inhabited side of Wilson's house, and now as he approached\nit he noticed that the sitting-room was lighted. This would do; others\nmade him feel unwelcome sometimes, but Wilson never failed in courtesy\ntoward him, and a kindly courtesy does at least save one's feelings,\neven if it is not professing to stand for a welcome. Wilson heard\nfootsteps at his threshold, then the clearing of a throat.\n\n\"It's that fickle-tempered, dissipated young goose--poor devil, he find\nfriends pretty scarce to-day, likely, after the disgrace of carrying a\npersonal-assault case into a law-court.\"\n\nA dejected knock. \"Come in!\"\n\nTom entered, and drooped into a chair, without saying anything. Wilson\nsaid kindly--\n\n\"Why, my boy, you look desolate. Don't take it so hard. Try and forget\nyou have been kicked.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" said Tom, wretchedly, \"it's not that, Pudd'nhead--it's not\nthat. It's a thousand times worse than that--oh, yes, a million times\nworse.\"\n\n\"Why, Tom, what do you mean? Has Rowena--\"\n\n\"Flung me? No, but the old man has.\"\n\nWilson said to himself, \"Aha!\" and thought of the mysterious girl in the\nbedroom. \"The Driscolls have been making discoveries!\" Then he said\naloud, gravely:\n\n\"Tom, there are some kinds of dissipation which--\"\n\n\"Oh, shucks, this hasn't got anything to do with dissipation. He wanted\nme to challenge that derned Italian savage, and I wouldn't do it.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course he would do that,\" said Wilson in a meditative\nmatter-of-course way, \"but the thing that puzzled me was, why he didn't\nlook to that last night, for one thing, and why he let you carry such a\nmatter into a court of law at all, either before the duel or after it.\nIt's no place for it. It was not like him. I couldn't understand it. How\ndid it happen?\"\n\n\"It happened because he didn't know anything about it. He was asleep\nwhen I got home last night.\"\n\n\"And you didn't wake him? Tom, is that possible?\"\n\nTom was not getting much comfort here. He fidgeted a moment, then said:\n\n\"I didn't choose to tell him--that's all. He was going a-fishing before\ndawn, with Pembroke Howard, and if I got the twins into the common\ncalaboose--and I thought sure I could--I never dreamed of their slipping\nout on a paltry fine for such an outrageous offense--well, once in the\ncalaboose they would be disgraced, and uncle wouldn't want any duels\nwith that sort of characters, and wouldn't allow any.\"\n\n\"Tom, I am ashamed of you! I don't see how you could treat your good old\nuncle so. I am a better friend of his than you are; for if I had known\nthe circumstances I would have kept that case out of court until I got\nword to him and let him have a gentleman's chance.\"\n\n\"You would?\" exclaimed Tom, with lively surprise. \"And it your first\ncase! And you know perfectly well there never would have been any case\nif he had got that chance, don't you? And you'd have finished your days\na pauper nobody, instead of being an actually launched and recognized\nlawyer to-day. And you would really have done that, would you?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nTom looked at him a moment or two, then shook his head sorrowfully and\nsaid--\n\n\"I believe you--upon my word I do. I don't know why I do, but I do.\nPudd'nhead Wilson, I think you're the biggest fool I ever saw.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it.\"\n\n\"Well, he has been requiring you to fight the Italian and you have\nrefused. You degenerate remnant of an honorable line! I'm thoroughly\nashamed of you, Tom!\"\n\n\"Oh, that's nothing! I don't care for anything, now that the will's torn\nup again.\"\n\n\"Tom, tell me squarely--didn't he find any fault with you for anything\nbut those two things--carrying the case into court and refusing to\nfight?\"\n\nHe watched the young fellow's face narrowly, but it was entirely\nreposeful, and so also was the voice that answered:\n\n\"No, he didn't find any other fault with me. If he had had any to find,\nhe would have begun yesterday, for he was just in the humor for it. He\ndrove that jack-pair around town and showed them the sights, and when he\ncame home he couldn't find his father's old silver watch that don't keep\ntime and he thinks so much of, and couldn't remember what he did with it\nthree or four days ago when he saw it last, and so when I arrived he was\nall in a sweat about it, and when I suggested that it probably wasn't\nlost but stolen, it put him in a regular passion and he said I was a\nfool--which convinced me, without any trouble, that that was just what\nhe was afraid had happened, himself, but did not want to believe it,\nbecause lost things stand a better chance of being found again than\nstolen ones.\"\n\n\"Whe-ew!\" whistled Wilson; \"score another on the list.\"\n\n\"Another what?\"\n\n\"Another theft!\"\n\n\"Theft?\"\n\n\"Yes, theft. That watch isn't lost, it's stolen. There's been another\nraid on the town--and just the same old mysterious sort of thing that\nhas happened once before, as you remember.\"\n\n\"You don't mean it!\"\n\n\"It's as sure as you are born! Have you missed anything yourself?\"\n\n\"No. That is, I did miss a silver pencil-case that Aunt Mary Pratt gave\nme last birthday--\"\n\n\"You'll find it stolen--that's what you'll find.\"\n\n\"No, I sha'n't; for when I suggested theft about the watch and got such\na rap, I went and examined my room, and the pencil-case was missing, but\nit was only mislaid, and I found it again.\"\n\n\"You are sure you missed nothing else?\"\n\n\"Well, nothing of consequence. I missed a small plain gold ring worth\ntwo or three dollars, but that will turn up. I'll look again.\"\n\n\"In my opinion you'll not find it. There's been a raid, I tell you. Come\nin!\"\n\nMr. Justice Robinson entered, followed by Buckstone and the\ntown-constable, Jim Blake. They sat down, and after some wandering and\naimless weather-conversation Wilson said--\n\n\"By the way, we've just added another to the list of thefts, maybe two.\nJudge Driscoll's old silver watch is gone, and Tom here has missed a\ngold ring.\"\n\n\"Well, it is a bad business,\" said the Justice, \"and gets worse the\nfurther it goes. The Hankses, the Dobsons, the Pilligrews, the Ortons,\nthe Grangers, the Hales, the Fullers, the Holcombs, in fact everybody\nthat lives around about Patsy Cooper's has been robbed of little things\nlike trinkets and teaspoons and such-like small valuables that are\neasily carried off. It's perfectly plain that the thief took advantage\nof the reception at Patsy Cooper's when all the neighbors were in her\nhouse and all their niggers hanging around her fence for a look at the\nshow, to raid the vacant houses undisturbed. Patsy is miserable about\nit; miserable on account of the neighbors, and particularly miserable on\naccount of her foreigners, of course; so miserable on their account that\nshe hasn't any room to worry about her own little losses.\"\n\n\"It's the same old raider,\" said Wilson. \"I suppose there isn't any\ndoubt about that.\"\n\n\"Constable Blake doesn't think so.\"\n\n\"No, you're wrong there,\" said Blake; \"the other times it was a man;\nthere was plenty of signs of that, as we know, in the profession, though\nwe never got hands on him; but this time it's a woman.\"\n\nWilson thought of the mysterious girl straight off. She was always in\nhis mind now. But she failed him again. Blake continued:\n\n\"She's a stoop-shouldered old woman with a covered basket on her arm, in\na black veil, dressed in mourning. I saw her going aboard the ferry-boat\nyesterday. Lives in Illinois, I reckon; but I don't care where she\nlives, I'm going to get her--she can make herself sure of that.\"\n\n\"What makes you think she's the thief?\"\n\n\"Well, there ain't any other, for one thing; and for another, some\nnigger draymen that happened to be driving along saw her coming out of\nor going into houses, and told me so--and it just happens that they was\nrobbed houses, every time.\"\n\nIt was granted that this was plenty good enough circumstantial evidence.\nA pensive silence followed, which lasted some moments, then Wilson\nsaid--\n\n\"There's one good thing, anyway. She can't either pawn or sell Count\nLuigi's costly Indian dagger.\"\n\n\"My!\" said Tom, \"is that gone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, that was a haul! But why can't she pawn it or sell it?\"\n\n\"Because when the twins went home from the Sons of Liberty meeting last\nnight, news of the raid was sifting in from everywhere, and Aunt Patsy\nwas in distress to know if they had lost anything. They found that the\ndagger was gone, and they notified the police and pawnbrokers\neverywhere. It was a great haul, yes, but the old woman won't get\nanything out of it, because she'll get caught.\"\n\n\"Did they offer a reward?\" asked Buckstone.\n\n\"Yes; five hundred dollars for the knife, and five hundred more for the\nthief.\"\n\n\"What a leather-headed idea!\" exclaimed the constable. \"The thief\nda'sn't go near them, nor send anybody. Whoever goes is going to get\nhimself nabbed, for their ain't any pawnbroker that's going to lose the\nchance to--\"\n\nIf anybody had noticed Tom's face at that time, the gray-green color of\nit might have provoked curiosity; but nobody did. He said to himself:\n\"I'm gone! I never can square up; the rest of the plunder won't pawn or\nsell for half of the bill. Oh, I know it--I'm gone, I'm gone--and this\ntime it's for good. Oh, this is awful--I don't know what to do, nor\nwhich way to turn!\"\n\n\"Softly, softly,\" said Wilson to Blake. \"I planned their scheme for them\nat midnight last night, and it was all finished up shipshape by two this\nmorning. They'll get their dagger back, and then I'll explain to you how\nthe thing was done.\"\n\nThere were strong signs of a general curiosity, and Buckstone said--\n\n\"Well, you have whetted us up pretty sharp, Wilson, and I'm free to say\nthat if you don't mind telling us in confidence--\"\n\n\"Oh, I'd as soon tell as not, Buckstone, but as long as the twins and I\nagreed to say nothing about it, we must let it stand so. But you can\ntake my word for it you won't be kept waiting three days. Somebody will\napply for that reward pretty promptly, and I'll show you the thief and\nthe dagger both very soon afterward.\"\n\nThe constable was disappointed, and also perplexed. He said--\n\n\"It may all be--yes, and I hope it will, but I'm blamed if I can see my\nway through it. It's too many for yours truly.\"\n\nThe subject seemed about talked out. Nobody seemed to have anything\nfurther to offer. After a silence the justice of the peace informed\nWilson that he and Buckstone and the constable had come as a committee,\non the part of the Democratic party, to ask him to run for mayor--for\nthe little town was about to become a city and the first charter\nelection was approaching. It was the first attention which Wilson had\never received at the hands of any party; it was a sufficiently humble\none, but it was a recognition of his d\u00e9but into the town's life and\nactivities at last; it was a step upward, and he was deeply gratified.\nHe accepted, and the committee departed, followed by young Tom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nRoxana Insists Upon Reform.\n\nThe true Southern watermelon is a boon apart, and not to be mentioned\nwith commoner things. It is chief of this world's luxuries, king by the\ngrace of God over all the fruits of the earth. When one has tasted it,\nhe knows what the angels eat. It was not a Southern watermelon that Eve\ntook: we know it because she repented.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nAbout the time that Wilson was bowing the committee out, Pembroke Howard\nwas entering the next house to report. He found the old Judge sitting\ngrim and straight in his chair, waiting.\n\n\"Well, Howard--the news?\"\n\n\"The best in the world.\"\n\n\"Accepts, does he?\" and the light of battle gleamed joyously in the\nJudge's eye.\n\n\"Accepts? Why, he jumped at it.\"\n\n\"Did, did he? Now that's fine--that's very fine. I like that. When is it\nto be?\"\n\n\"Now! Straight off! To-night! An admirable fellow--admirable!\"\n\n\"Admirable? He's a darling! Why, it's an honor as well as a pleasure to\nstand up before such a man. Come--off with you! Go and arrange\neverything--and give him my heartiest compliments. A rare fellow,\nindeed; an admirable fellow, as you have said!\"\n\nHoward hurried away, saying--\n\n\"I'll have him in the vacant stretch between Wilson's and the haunted\nhouse within the hour, and I'll bring my own pistols.\"\n\nJudge Driscoll began to walk the floor in a state of pleased excitement;\nbut presently he stopped, and began to think--began to think of Tom.\nTwice he moved toward the secretary, and twice he turned away again; but\nfinally he said--\n\n\"This may be my last night in the world--I must not take the chance. He\nis worthless and unworthy, but it is largely my fault. He was intrusted\nto me by my brother on his dying bed, and I have indulged him to his\nhurt, instead of training him up severely, and making a man of him. I\nhave violated my trust, and I must not add the sin of desertion to that.\nI have forgiven him once already, and would subject him to a long and\nhard trial before forgiving him again, if I could live; but I must not\nrun that risk. No, I must restore the will. But if I survive the duel, I\nwill hide it away, and he will not know, and I will not tell him until\nhe reforms, and I see that his reformation is going to be permanent.\"\n\nHe re-drew the will, and his ostensible nephew was heir to a fortune\nagain. As he was finishing his task, Tom, wearied with another brooding\ntramp, entered the house and went tiptoeing past the sitting-room door.\nHe glanced in, and hurried on, for the sight of his uncle had nothing\nbut terrors for him to-night. But his uncle was writing! That was\nunusual at this late hour. What could he be writing? A chill of anxiety\nsettled down upon Tom's heart. Did that writing concern him? He was\nafraid so. He reflected that when ill luck begins, it does not come in\nsprinkles, but in showers. He said he would get a glimpse of that\ndocument or know the reason why. He heard some one coming, and stepped\nout of sight and hearing. It was Pembroke Howard. What could be\nhatching?\n\nHoward said, with great satisfaction:\n\n\"Everything's right and ready. He's gone to the battle-ground with his\nsecond and the surgeon--also with his brother. I've arranged it all with\nWilson--Wilson's his second. We are to have three shots apiece.\"\n\n\"Good! How is the moon?\"\n\n\"Bright as day, nearly. Perfect, for the distance--fifteen yards. No\nwind--not a breath; hot and still.\"\n\n\"All good; all first-rate. Here, Pembroke, read this, and witness it.\"\n\nPembroke read and witnessed the will, then gave the old man's hand a\nhearty shake and said:\n\n\"Now that's right, York--but I knew you would do it. You couldn't leave\nthat poor chap to fight along without means or profession, with certain\ndefeat before him, and I knew you wouldn't, for his father's sake if not\nfor his own.\"\n\n\"For his dead father's sake I couldn't, I know; for poor Percy--but you\nknow what Percy was to me. But mind--Tom is not to know of this unless I\nfall to-night.\"\n\n\"I understand. I'll keep the secret.\"\n\nThe Judge put the will away, and the two started for the battle-ground.\nIn another minute the will was in Tom's hands. His misery vanished, his\nfeelings underwent a tremendous revulsion. He put the will carefully\nback in its place, and spread his mouth and swung his hat once, twice,\nthree times around his head, in imitation of three rousing huzzas, no\nsound issuing from his lips. He fell to communing with himself excitedly\nand joyously, but every now and then he let off another volley of dumb\nhurrahs.\n\nHe said to himself: \"I've got the fortune again, but I'll not let on\nthat I know about it. And this time I'm going to hang on to it. I take\nno more risks. I'll gamble no more, I'll drink no more, because--well,\nbecause I'll not go where there is any of that sort of thing going on,\nagain. It's the sure way, and the only sure way; I might have thought of\nthat sooner--well, yes, if I had wanted to. But now--dear me, I've had a\nscare this time, and I'll take no more chances. Not a single chance\nmore. Land! I persuaded myself this evening that I could fetch him\naround without any great amount of effort, but I've been getting more\nand more heavy-hearted and doubtful straight along, ever since. If he\ntells me about this thing, all right; but if he doesn't, I sha'n't let\non. I--well, I'd like to tell Pudd'nhead Wilson, but--no, I'll think\nabout that; perhaps I won't.\" He whirled off another dead huzza, and\nsaid, \"I'm reformed, and this time I'll stay so, sure!\"\n\nHe was about to close with a final grand silent demonstration, when he\nsuddenly recollected that Wilson had put it out of his power to pawn or\nsell the Indian knife, and that he was once more in awful peril of\nexposure by his creditors for that reason. His joy collapsed utterly,\nand he turned away and moped toward the door moaning and lamenting over\nthe bitterness of his luck. He dragged himself up-stairs, and brooded in\nhis room a long time disconsolate and forlorn, with Luigi's Indian knife\nfor a text. At last he sighed and said:\n\n\"When I supposed these stones were glass and this ivory bone, the thing\nhadn't any interest for me because it hadn't any value, and couldn't\nhelp me out of my trouble. But now--why, now it is full of interest;\nyes, and of a sort to break a body's heart. It's a bag of gold that has\nturned to dirt and ashes in my hands. It could save me, and save me so\neasily, and yet I've got to go to ruin. It's like drowning with a\nlife-preserver in my reach. All the hard luck comes to me, and all the\ngood luck goes to other people--Pudd'nhead Wilson, for instance; even\nhis career has got a sort of a little start at last, and what has he\ndone to deserve it, I should like to know? Yes, he has opened his own\nroad, but he isn't content with that, but must block mine. It's a\nsordid, selfish world, and I wish I was out of it.\" He allowed the light\nof the candle to play upon the jewels of the sheath, but the flashings\nand sparklings had no charm for his eye; they were only just so many\npangs to his heart. \"I must not say anything to Roxy about this thing,\"\nhe said, \"she is too daring. She would be for digging these stones out\nand selling them, and then--why, she would be arrested and the stones\ntraced, and then--\" The thought made him quake, and he hid the knife\naway, trembling all over and glancing furtively about, like a criminal\nwho fancies that the accuser is already at hand.\n\nShould he try to sleep? Oh, no, sleep was not for him; his trouble was\ntoo haunting, too afflicting for that. He must have somebody to mourn\nwith. He would carry his despair to Roxy.\n\nHe had heard several distant gunshots, but that sort of thing was not\nuncommon, and they had made no impression upon him. He went out at the\nback door, and turned westward. He passed Wilson's house and proceeded\nalong the lane, and presently saw several figures approaching Wilson's\nplace through the vacant lots. These were the duelists returning from\nthe fight; he thought he recognized them, but as he had no desire for\nwhite people's company, he stooped down behind the fence until they were\nout of his way.\n\nRoxy was feeling fine. She said:\n\n\"Whah was you, child? Warn't you in it?\"\n\n\"In what?\"\n\n\"In de duel.\"\n\n\"Duel? Has there been a duel?\"\n\n\"'Co'se dey has. De ole Jedge has be'n havin' a duel wid one o' dem\ntwins.\"\n\n\"Great Scott!\" Then he added to himself: \"That's what made him re-make\nthe will; he thought he might get killed, and it softened him toward me.\nAnd that's what he and Howard were so busy about.... Oh dear, if the\ntwin had only killed him, I should be out of my--\"\n\n\"What is you mumblin' bout, Chambers? Whah was you? Didn't you know dey\nwas gwyne to be a duel?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't. The old man tried to get me to fight one with Count\nLuigi, but he didn't succeed, so I reckon he concluded to patch up the\nfamily honor himself.\"\n\nHe laughed at the idea, and went rambling on with a detailed account of\nhis talk with the Judge, and how shocked and ashamed the Judge was to\nfind that he had a coward in his family. He glanced up at last, and got\na shock himself. Roxana's bosom was heaving with suppressed passion, and\nshe was glowering down upon him with measureless contempt written in her\nface.\n\n\"En you refuse' to fight a man dat kicked you, 'stid o' jumpin' at de\nchance! En you ain't got no mo' feelin' den to come en tell me, dat\nfetched sich a po' low-down ornery rabbit into de worl'! Pah! it make me\nsick! It's de nigger in you, dat's what it is. Thirty-one parts o' you\nis white, en on'y one part nigger, en dat po' little one part is yo'\nsoul. Tain't wuth savin'; tain't wuth totin' out on a shovel en throwin'\nin de gutter. You has disgraced yo' birth. What would yo' pa think o'\nyou? It's enough to make him turn in his grave.\"\n\nThe last three sentences stung Tom into a fury, and he said to himself\nthat if his father were only alive and in reach of assassination his\nmother would soon find that he had a very clear notion of the size of\nhis indebtedness to that man, and was willing to pay it up in full, and\nwould do it too, even at risk of his life; but he kept this thought to\nhimself; that was safest in his mother's present state.\n\n\"Whatever has come o' yo' Essex blood? Dat's what I can't understan'. En\nit ain't on'y jist Essex blood dat's in you, not by a long sight--'deed\nit ain't! My great-great-great-gran'father en yo'\ngreat-great-great-great-gran'father was Ole Cap'n John Smith, de highest\nblood dat Ole Virginny ever turned out, en his great-great-gran'mother\nor somers along back dah, was Pocahontas de Injun queen, en her husbun'\nwas a nigger king outen Africa--en yit here you is, a slinkin' outen a\nduel en disgracin' our whole line like a ornery low-down hound! Yes,\nit's de nigger in you!\"\n\nShe sat down on her candle-box and fell into a reverie. Tom did not\ndisturb her; he sometimes lacked prudence, but it was not in\ncircumstances of this kind, Roxana's storm went gradually down, but it\ndied hard, and even when it seemed to be quite gone, it would now and\nthen break out in a distant rumble, so to speak, in the form of muttered\nejaculations. One of these was, \"Ain't nigger enough in him to show in\nhis finger-nails, en dat takes mighty little--yit dey's enough to paint\nhis soul.\"\n\nPresently she muttered. \"Yassir, enough to paint a whole thimbleful of\n'em.\" At last her ramblings ceased altogether, and her countenance began\nto clear--a welcome sign to Tom, who had learned her moods, and knew she\nwas on the threshold of good-humor, now. He noticed that from time to\ntime she unconsciously carried her finger to the end of her nose. He\nlooked closer and said:\n\n\"Why, mammy, the end of your nose is skinned. How did that come?\"\n\nShe sent out the sort of whole-hearted peal of laughter which God had\nvouchsafed in its perfection to none but the happy angels in heaven and\nthe bruised and broken black slave on the earth, and said:\n\n\"Dad fetch dat duel, I be'n in it myself.\"\n\n\"Gracious! did a bullet do that?\"\n\n\"Yassir, you bet it did!\"\n\n\"Well, I declare! Why, how did that happen?\"\n\n\"Happened dis-away. I 'uz a-sett'n' here kinder dozin' in de dark, en\nche-bang! goes a gun, right out dah. I skips along out towards t'other\nend o' de house to see what's gwyne on, en stops by de ole winder on de\nside towards Pudd'nhead Wilson's house dat ain't got no sash in it,--but\ndey ain't none of 'em got any sashes, fur as dat's concerned,--en I\nstood dah in de dark en look out, en dar in de moonlight, right down\nunder me 'uz one o' de twins a-cussin'--not much, but jist a-cussin'\nsoft--it 'uz de brown one dat 'uz cussin', 'ca'se he 'uz hit in de\nshoulder. En Doctor Claypool he 'uz a-workin' at him, en Pudd'nhead\nWilson he 'uz a-he'pin', en ole Jedge Driscoll en Pem Howard 'uz\na-standin' out yonder a little piece waitin' for 'em to git ready agin.\nEn treckly dey squared off en give de word, en bang-bang went de\npistols, en de twin he say, 'Ouch!'--hit him on de han' dis time,--en I\nhear dat same bullet go spat! ag'in, de logs under de winder; en de nex'\ntime dey shoot, de twin say, 'Ouch!' ag'in, en I done it too, 'ca'se de\nbullet glance' on his cheek-bone en skip up here en glance on de side o'\nde winder en whiz right acrost my face en tuck de hide off'n my\nnose--why, if I'd 'a' be'n jist a inch or a inch en a half furder 't\nwould 'a' tuck de whole nose en disfiggered me. Here's de bullet; I\nhunted her up.\"\n\n\"Did you stand there all the time?\"\n\n\"Dat's a question to ask, ain't it? What else would I do? Does I git a\nchance to see a duel every day?\"\n\n\"Why, you were right in range! Weren't you afraid?\"\n\nThe woman gave a sniff of scorn.\n\n\"'Fraid! De Smith-Pocahontases ain't 'fraid o' nothin', let alone\nbullets.\"\n\n\"They've got pluck enough, I suppose; what they lack is judgment. I\nwouldn't have stood there.\"\n\n\"Nobody's accusin' you!\"\n\n\"Did anybody else get hurt?\"\n\n\"Yes, we all got hit 'cep' de blon' twin en de doctor en de seconds. De\nJedge didn't git hurt, but I hear Pudd'nhead say de bullet snip some o'\nhis ha'r off.\"\n\n\"'George!\" said Tom to himself, \"to come so near being out of my\ntrouble, and miss it by an inch. Oh dear, dear, he will live to find me\nout and sell me to some nigger-trader yet--yes, and he would do it in a\nminute.\" Then he said aloud, in a grave tone--\n\n\"Mother, we are in an awful fix.\"\n\nRoxana caught her breath with a spasm, and said--\n\n\"Chile! What you hit a body so sudden for, like dat? What's be'n en gone\nen happen'?\"\n\n\"Well, there's one thing I didn't tell you. When I wouldn't fight, he\ntore up the will again, and--\"\n\nRoxana's face turned a dead white, and she said--\n\n\"Now you's done!--done forever! Dat's de end. Bofe un us is gwyne to\nstarve to--\"\n\n\"Wait and hear me through, can't you! I reckon that when he resolved to\nfight, himself, he thought he might get killed and not have a chance to\nforgive me any more in this life, so he made the will again, and I've\nseen it, and it's all right. But--\"\n\n\"Oh, thank goodness, den we's safe ag'in!--safe! en so what did you want\nto come here en talk sich dreadful--\"\n\n\"Hold on, I tell you, and let me finish. The swag I gathered won't half\nsquare me up, and the first thing we know, my creditors--well, you know\nwhat'll happen.\"\n\nRoxana dropped her chin, and told her son to leave her alone--she must\nthink this matter out. Presently she said impressively:\n\n\"You got to go mighty keerful now, I tell you! En here's what you got to\ndo. He didn't git killed, en if you gives him de least reason, he'll\nbust de will ag'in, en dat's de las' time, now you hear me! So--you's\ngot to show him what you kin do in de nex' few days. You's got to be\npison good, en let him see it; you got to do everything dat'll make him\nb'lieve in you, en you got to sweeten aroun' ole Aunt Pratt, too,--she's\npow'ful strong wid de Jedge, en de bes' frien' you got. Nex', you'll go\n'long away to Sent Louis, en dat'll keep him in yo' favor. Den you go en\nmake a bargain wid dem people. You tell 'em he ain't gwyne to live\nlong--en dat's de fac', too,--en tell 'em you'll pay 'em intrust, en big\nintrust, too,--ten per--what you call it?\"\n\n\"Ten per cent. a month?\"\n\n\"Dat's it. Den you take and sell yo' truck aroun', a little at a time,\nen pay de intrust. How long will it las'?\"\n\n\"I think there's enough to pay the interest five or six months.\"\n\n\"Den you's all right. If he don't die in six months, dat don't make no\ndiff'rence--Providence'll provide. You's gwyne to be safe--if you\nbehaves.\" She bent an austere eye on him and added, \"En you is gwyne to\nbehave--does you know dat?\"\n\nHe laughed and said he was going to try, anyway. She did not unbend. She\nsaid gravely:\n\n\"Tryin' ain't de thing. You's gwyne to do it. You ain't gwyne to steal a\npin--'ca'se it ain't safe no mo'; en you ain't gwyne into no bad\ncomp'ny--not even once, you understand; en you ain't gwyne to drink a\ndrop--nary single drop; en you ain't gwyne to gamble one single\ngamble--not one! Dis ain't what you's gwyne to try to do, it's what\nyou's gwyne to do. En I'll tell you how I knows it. Dis is how. I's\ngwyne to foller along to Sent Louis my own self; en you's gwyne to come\nto me every day o' yo' life, en I'll look you over; en if you fails in\none single one o' dem things--jist one--I take my oath I'll come\nstraight down to dis town en tell de Jedge you's a nigger en a slave--en\nprove it!\" She paused to let her words sink home. Then she added,\n\"Chambers, does you b'lieve me when I says dat?\"\n\nTom was sober enough now. There was no levity in his voice when he\nanswered:\n\n\"Yes, mother, I know, now, that I am reformed--and permanently.\nPermanently--and beyond the reach of any human temptation.\"\n\n\"Den g' long home en begin!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nThe Robber Robbed.\n\nNothing so needs reforming as other people's habits.--Pudd'nhead\nWilson's Calendar.\n\nBehold, the fool saith, \"Put not all thine eggs in the one\nbasket\"--which is but a manner of saying, \"Scatter your money and your\nattention;\" but the wise man saith, \"Put all your eggs in the one basket\nand--watch that basket\"--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nWhat a time of it Dawson's Landing was having! All its life it had been\nasleep, but now it hardly got a chance for a nod, so swiftly did big\nevents and crashing surprises come along in one another's wake: Friday\nmorning, first glimpse of Real Nobility, also grand reception at Aunt\nPatsy Cooper's, also great robber-raid; Friday evening, dramatic kicking\nof the heir of the chief citizen in presence of four hundred people;\nSaturday morning, emergence as practising lawyer of the long-submerged\nPudd'nhead Wilson; Saturday night, duel between chief citizen and titled\nstranger.\n\nThe people took more pride in the duel than in all the other events put\ntogether, perhaps. It was a glory to their town to have such a thing\nhappen there. In their eyes the principals had reached the summit of\nhuman honor. Everybody paid homage to their names; their praises were in\nall mouths. Even the duelists' subordinates came in for a handsome share\nof the public approbation: wherefore Pudd'nhead Wilson was suddenly\nbecome a man of consequence. When asked to run for the mayoralty\nSaturday night he was risking defeat, but Sunday morning found him a\nmade man and his success assured.\n\nThe twins were prodigiously great, now; the town took them to its bosom\nwith enthusiasm. Day after day, and night after night, they went dining\nand visiting from house to house, making friends, enlarging and\nsolidifying their popularity, and charming and surprising all with their\nmusical prodigies, and now and then heightening the effects with samples\nof what they could do in other directions, out of their stock of rare\nand curious accomplishments. They were so pleased that they gave the\nregulation thirty days' notice, the required preparation for\ncitizenship, and resolved to finish their days in this pleasant place.\nThat was the climax. The delighted community rose as one man and\napplauded; and when the twins were asked to stand for seats in the\nforthcoming aldermanic board, and consented, the public contentment was\nrounded and complete.\n\nTom Driscoll was not happy over these things; they sunk deep, and hurt\nall the way down. He hated the one twin for kicking him, and the other\none for being the kicker's brother.\n\nNow and then the people wondered why nothing was heard of the raider, or\nof the stolen knife or the other plunder, but nobody was able to throw\nany light on that matter. Nearly a week had drifted by, and still the\nthing remained a vexed mystery.\n\nOn Saturday Constable Blake and Pudd'nhead Wilson met on the street, and\nTom Driscoll joined them in time to open their conversation for them. He\nsaid to Blake--\"You are not looking well, Blake; you seem to be annoyed\nabout something. Has anything gone wrong in the detective business? I\nbelieve you fairly and justifiably claim to have a pretty good\nreputation in that line, isn't it so?\"--which made Blake feel good, and\nlook it; but Tom added, \"for a country detective\"--which made Blake feel\nthe other way, and not only look it, but betray it in his voice--\n\n\"Yes, sir, I have got a reputation; and it's as good as anybody's in the\nprofession, too, country or no country.\"\n\n\"Oh, I beg pardon; I didn't mean any offense. What I started out to ask\nwas only about the old woman that raided the town--the stoop-shouldered\nold woman, you know, that you said you were going to catch; and I knew\nyou would, too, because you have the reputation of never boasting,\nand--well, you--you've caught the old woman?\"\n\n\"D------ the old woman!\"\n\n\"Why, sho! you don't mean to say you haven't caught her?\"\n\n\"No; I haven't caught her. If anybody could have caught her, I could;\nbut nobody couldn't, I don't care who he is.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, real sorry--for your sake; because, when it gets around\nthat a detective has expressed himself so confidently, and then--\"\n\n\"Don't you worry, that's all--don't you worry; and as for the town, the\ntown needn't worry, either. She's my meat--make yourself easy about\nthat. I'm on her track; I've got clues that--\"\n\n\"That's good! Now if you could get an old veteran detective down from\nSt. Louis to help you find out what the clues mean, and where they lead\nto, and then--\"\n\n\"I'm plenty veteran enough myself, and I don't need anybody's help. I'll\nhave her inside of a we--inside of a month. That I'll swear to!\"\n\nTom said carelessly--\n\n\"I suppose that will answer--yes, that will answer. But I reckon she is\npretty old, and old people don't often outlive the cautious pace of the\nprofessional detective when he has got his clues together and is out on\nhis still-hunt.\"\n\nBlake's dull face flushed under this gibe, but before he could set his\nretort in order Tom had turned to Wilson, and was saying, with placid\nindifference of manner and voice--\n\n\"Who got the reward, Pudd'nhead?\"\n\nWilson winced slightly, and saw that his own turn was come.\n\n\"What reward?\"\n\n\"Why, the reward for the thief, and the other one for the knife.\"\n\nWilson answered--and rather uncomfortably, to judge by his hesitating\nfashion of delivering himself--\n\n\"Well, the--well, in fact, nobody has claimed it yet.\"\n\nTom seemed surprised.\n\n\"Why, is that so?\"\n\nWilson showed a trifle of irritation when he replied--\n\n\"Yes, it's so. And what of it?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing. Only I thought you had struck out a new idea, and invented\na scheme that was going to revolutionize the time-worn and ineffectual\nmethods of the--\" He stopped, and turned to Blake, who was happy now\nthat another had taken his place on the gridiron: \"Blake, didn't you\nunderstand him to intimate that it wouldn't be necessary for you to hunt\nthe old woman down?\"\n\n\"B'George, he said he'd have thief and swag both inside of three\ndays--he did, by hokey! and that's just about a week ago. Why, I said at\nthe time that no thief and no thief's pal was going to try to pawn or\nsell a thing where he knowed the pawnbroker could get both rewards by\ntaking him into camp with the swag. It was the blessedest idea that ever\nI struck!\"\n\n\"You'd change your mind,\" said Wilson, with irritated bluntness, \"if you\nknew the entire scheme instead of only part of it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the constable, pensively, \"I had the idea that it wouldn't\nwork, and up to now I'm right anyway.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, let it stand at that, and give it a further show. It\nhas worked at least as well as your own methods, you perceive.\"\n\nThe constable hadn't anything handy to hit back with, so he discharged a\ndiscontented sniff, and said nothing.\n\nAfter the night that Wilson had partly revealed his scheme at his house,\nTom had tried for several days to guess out the secret of the rest of\nit, but had failed. Then it occurred to him to give Roxana's smarter\nhead a chance at it. He made up a supposititious case, and laid it\nbefore her. She thought it over, and delivered her verdict upon it. Tom\nsaid to himself, \"She's hit it, sure!\" He thought he would test that\nverdict, now, and watch Wilson's face; so he said reflectively--\n\n\"Wilson, you're not a fool--a fact of recent discovery. Whatever your\nscheme was, it had sense in it, Blake's opinion to the contrary\nnotwithstanding. I don't ask you to reveal it, but I will suppose a\ncase--a case which will answer as a starting-point for the real thing I\nam going to come at, and that's all I want. You offered five hundred\ndollars for the knife, and five hundred for the thief. We will suppose,\nfor argument's sake, that the first reward is advertised and the second\noffered by private letter to pawnbrokers and--\"\n\nBlake slapped his thigh, and cried out--\n\n\"By Jackson, he's got you, Pudd'nhead! Now why couldn't I or any fool\nhave thought of that?\"\n\nWilson said to himself, \"Anybody with a reasonably good head would have\nthought of it. I am not surprised that Blake didn't detect it; I am only\nsurprised that Tom did. There is more to him than I supposed.\" He said\nnothing aloud, and Tom went on:\n\n\"Very well. The thief would not suspect that there was a trap, and he\nwould bring or send the knife, and say he bought it for a song, or found\nit in the road, or something like that, and try to collect the reward,\nand be arrested--wouldn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Wilson.\n\n\"I think so,\" said Tom. \"There can't be any doubt of it. Have you ever\nseen that knife?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Has any friend of yours?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"Well, I begin to think I understand why your scheme failed.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Tom? What are you driving at?\" asked Wilson, with a\ndawning sense of discomfort.\n\n\"Why, that there isn't any such knife.\"\n\n\"Look here, Wilson,\" said Blake, \"Tom Driscoll's right, for a thousand\ndollars--if I had it.\"\n\nWilson's blood warmed a little, and he wondered if he had been played\nupon by those strangers; it certainly had something of that look. But\nwhat could they gain by it? He threw out that suggestion. Tom replied:\n\n\"Gain? Oh, nothing that you would value, maybe. But they are strangers\nmaking their way in a new community. Is it nothing to them to appear as\npets of an Oriental prince--at no expense? Is it nothing to them to be\nable to dazzle this poor little town with thousand-dollar rewards--at no\nexpense? Wilson, there isn't any such knife, or your scheme would have\nfetched it to light. Or if there is any such knife, they've got it yet.\nI believe, myself, that they've seen such a knife, for Angelo pictured\nit out with his pencil too swiftly and handily for him to have been\ninventing it, and of course I can't swear that they've never had it; but\nthis I'll go bail for--if they had it when they came to this town,\nthey've got it yet.\"\n\nBlake said--\n\n\"It looks mighty reasonable, the way Tom puts it; it most certainly\ndoes.\"\n\nTom responded, turning to leave--\n\n\"You find the old woman, Blake, and if she can't furnish the knife, go\nand search the twins!\"\n\nTom sauntered away. Wilson felt a good deal depressed. He hardly knew\nwhat to think. He was loath to withdraw his faith from the twins, and\nwas resolved not to do it on the present indecisive evidence; but--well,\nhe would think, and then decide how to act.\n\n\"Blake, what do you think of this matter?\"\n\n\"Well, Pudd'nhead, I'm bound to say I put it up the way Tom does. They\nhadn't the knife; or if they had it, they've got it yet.\"\n\nThe men parted. Wilson said to himself:\n\n\"I believe they had it; if it had been stolen, the scheme would have\nrestored it, that is certain. And so I believe they've got it yet.\"\n\nTom had no purpose in his mind when he encountered those two men. When\nhe began his talk he hoped to be able to gall them a little and get a\ntrifle of malicious entertainment out of it. But when he left, he left\nin great spirits, for he perceived that just by pure luck and no\ntroublesome labor he had accomplished several delightful things: he had\ntouched both men on a raw spot and seen them squirm; he had modified\nWilson's sweetness for the twins with one small bitter taste that he\nwouldn't be able to get out of his mouth right away; and, best of all,\nhe had taken the hated twins down a peg with the community; for Blake\nwould gossip around freely, after the manner of detectives, and within a\nweek the town would be laughing at them in its sleeve for offering a\ngaudy reward for a bauble which they either never possessed or hadn't\nlost. Tom was very well satisfied with himself.\n\nTom's behavior at home had been perfect during the entire week. His\nuncle and aunt had seen nothing like it before. They could find no fault\nwith him anywhere.\n\nSaturday evening he said to the Judge--\n\n\"I've had something preying on my mind, uncle, and as I am going away,\nand might never see you again, I can't bear it any longer. I made you\nbelieve I was afraid to fight that Italian adventurer. I had to get out\nof it on some pretext or other, and maybe I chose badly, being taken\nunawares, but no honorable person could consent to meet him in the\nfield, knowing what I knew about him.\"\n\n\"Indeed? What was that?\"\n\n\"Count Luigi is a confessed assassin.\"\n\n\"Incredible!\"\n\n\"It's perfectly true. Wilson detected it in his hand, by palmistry, and\ncharged him with it, and cornered him up so close that he had to\nconfess; but both twins begged us on their knees to keep the secret, and\nswore they would lead straight lives here; and it was all so pitiful\nthat we gave our word of honor never to expose them while they kept that\npromise. You would have done it yourself, uncle.\"\n\n\"You are right, my boy; I would. A man's secret is still his own\nproperty, and sacred, when it has been surprised out of him like that.\nYou did well, and I am proud of you.\" Then he added mournfully, \"But I\nwish I could have been saved the shame of meeting an assassin on the\nfield of honor.\"\n\n\"It couldn't be helped, uncle. If I had known you were going to\nchallenge him I should have felt obliged to sacrifice my pledged word in\norder to stop it, but Wilson couldn't be expected to do otherwise than\nkeep silent.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; Wilson did right, and is in no way to blame. Tom, Tom, you have\nlifted a heavy load from my heart; I was stung to the very soul when I\nseemed to have discovered that I had a coward in my family.\"\n\n\"You may imagine what it cost me to assume such a part, uncle.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know it, poor boy, I know it. And I can understand how much it\nhas cost you to remain under that unjust stigma to this time. But it is\nall right now, and no harm is done. You have restored my comfort of\nmind, and with it your own; and both of us had suffered enough.\"\n\nThe old man sat awhile plunged in thought; then he looked up with a\nsatisfied light in his eye, and said: \"That this assassin should have\nput the affront upon me of letting me meet him on the field of honor as\nif he were a gentleman is a matter which I will presently settle--but\nnot now. I will not shoot him until after election. I see a way to ruin\nthem both before; I will attend to that first. Neither of them shall be\nelected, that I promise. You are sure that the fact that he is an\nassassin has not got abroad?\"\n\n\"Perfectly certain of it, sir.\"\n\n\"It will be a good card. I will fling a hint at it from the stump on the\npolling-day. It will sweep the ground from under both of them.\"\n\n\"There's not a doubt of it. It will finish them.\"\n\n\"That and outside work among the voters will, to a certainty. I want you\nto come down here by and by and work privately among the rag-tag and\nbobtail. You shall spend money among them; I will furnish it.\"\n\nAnother point scored against the detested twins! Really it was a great\nday for Tom. He was encouraged to chance a parting shot, now, at the\nsame target, and did it.\n\n\"You know that wonderful Indian knife that the twins have been making\nsuch a to-do about? Well, there's no track or trace of it yet; so the\ntown is beginning to sneer and gossip and laugh. Half the people believe\nthey never had any such knife, the other half believe they had it and\nhave got it still. I've heard twenty people talking like that to-day.\"\n\nYes, Tom's blemishless week had restored him to the favor of his aunt\nand uncle.\n\nHis mother was satisfied with him, too. Privately, she believed she was\ncoming to love him, but she did not say so. She told him to go along to\nSt. Louis, now, and she would get ready and follow. Then she smashed her\nwhisky bottle and said--\n\n\"Dah now! I's a-gwyne to make you walk as straight as a string,\nChambers, en so I's bown' you ain't gwyne to git no bad example out o'\nyo' mammy. I tole you you couldn't go into no bad comp'ny. Well, you's\ngwyne into my comp'ny, en I's gwyne to fill de bill. Now, den, trot\nalong, trot along!\"\n\nTom went aboard one of the big transient boats that night with his heavy\nsatchel of miscellaneous plunder, and slept the sleep of the unjust,\nwhich is serener and sounder than the other kind, as we know by the\nhanging-eve history of a million rascals. But when he got up in the\nmorning, luck was against him again: A brother-thief had robbed him\nwhile he slept, and gone ashore at some intermediate landing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nSold Down the River.\n\nIf you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite\nyou. This is the principal difference between a dog and a\nman.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nWe know all about the habits of the ant, we know all about the habits of\nthe bee, but we know nothing at all about the habits of the oyster. It\nseems almost certain that we have been choosing the wrong time for\nstudying the oyster.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nWhen Roxana arrived, she found her son in such despair and misery that\nher heart was touched and her motherhood rose up strong in her. He was\nruined past hope, now; his destruction would be immediate and sure, and\nhe would be an outcast and friendless. That was reason enough for a\nmother to love a child; so she loved him, and told him so. It made him\nwince, secretly--for she was a \"nigger.\" That he was one himself was far\nfrom reconciling him to that despised race.\n\nRoxana poured out endearments upon him, to which he responded\nuncomfortably, but as well as he could. And she tried to comfort him,\nbut that was not possible. These intimacies quickly became horrible to\nhim, and within the hour he began to try to get up courage enough to\ntell her so, and require that they be discontinued or very considerably\nmodified. But he was afraid of her; and besides, there came a lull, now,\nfor she had begun to think. She was trying to invent a saving plan.\nFinally she started up, and said she had found a way out. Tom was almost\nsuffocated by the joy of this sudden good news. Roxana said:\n\n\"Here is de plan, en she'll win, sure. I's a nigger, en nobody ain't\ngwyne to doubt it dat hears me talk. I's wuth six hund'd dollahs. Take\nen sell me, en pay off dese gamblers.\"\n\nTom was dazed. He was not sure he had heard aright. He was dumb for a\nmoment; then he said:\n\n\"Do you mean that you would be sold into slavery to save me?\"\n\n\"Ain't you my chile? En does you know anything dat a mother won't do for\nher chile? Day ain't nothin' a white mother won't do for her chile. Who\nmade 'em so? De Lord done it. En who made de niggers? De Lord made 'em.\nIn de inside, mothers is all de same. De good Lord he made 'em so. I's\ngwyne to be sole into slavery, en in a year you's gwyne to buy yo' ole\nmammy free ag'in. I'll show you how. Dat's de plan.\"\n\nTom's hopes began to rise, and his spirits along with them. He said--\n\n\"It's lovely of you, mammy--it's just--\"\n\n\"Say it ag'in! En keep on sayin' it! It's all de pay a body kin want in\ndis worl', en it's mo' den enough. Laws bless you, honey, when I's\nslavin' aroun', en dey 'buses me, if I knows you's a-sayin' dat, 'way\noff yonder somers, it'll heal up all de sore places, en I kin stan'\n'em.\"\n\n\"I do say it again, mammy, and I'll keep on saying it, too. But how am I\ngoing to sell you? You're free, you know.\"\n\n\"Much diff'rence dat make! White folks ain't partic'lar. De law kin sell\nme now if dey tell me to leave de State in six months en I don't go. You\ndraw up a paper--bill o' sale--en put it 'way off yonder, down in de\nmiddle o' Kaintuck somers, en sign some names to it, en say you'll sell\nme cheap 'ca'se you's hard up; you'll find you ain't gwyne to have no\ntrouble. You take me up de country a piece, en sell me on a farm; dem\npeople ain't gwyne to ask no questions if I's a bargain.\"\n\nTom forged a bill of sale and sold his mother to an Arkansas\ncotton-planter for a trifle over six hundred dollars. He did not want to\ncommit this treachery, but luck threw the man in his way, and this saved\nhim the necessity of going up country to hunt up a purchaser, with the\nadded risk of having to answer a lot of questions, whereas this planter\nwas so pleased with Roxy that he asked next to none at all. Besides, the\nplanter insisted that Roxy wouldn't know where she was, at first, and\nthat by the time she found out she would already have become contented.\nAnd Tom argued with himself that it was an immense advantage for Roxy to\nhave a master who was so pleased with her, as this planter manifestly\nwas. In almost no time his flowing reasonings carried him to the point\nof even half believing he was doing Roxy a splendid surreptitious\nservice in selling her \"down the river.\" And then he kept diligently\nsaying to himself all the time: \"It's for only a year. In a year I buy\nher free again; she'll keep that in mind, and it'll reconcile her.\" Yes;\nthe little deception could do no harm, and everything would come out\nright and pleasant in the end, any way. By agreement, the conversation\nin Roxy's presence was all about the man's \"upcountry\" farm, and how\npleasant a place it was, and how happy the slaves were there; so poor\nRoxy was entirely deceived; and easily, for she was not dreaming that\nher own son could be guilty of treason to a mother who, in voluntarily\ngoing into slavery--slavery of any kind, mild or severe, or of any\nduration, brief or long--was making a sacrifice for him compared with\nwhich death would have been a poor and commonplace one. She lavished\ntears and loving caresses upon him privately, and then went away with\nher owner--went away broken-hearted, and yet proud of what she was\ndoing, and glad it was in her power to do it.\n\nTom squared his accounts, and resolved to keep to the very letter of his\nreform, and never to put that will in jeopardy again. He had three\nhundred dollars left. According to his mother's plan, he was to put that\nsafely away, and add her half of his pension to it monthly. In one year\nthis fund would buy her free again.\n\nFor a whole week he was not able to sleep well, so much the villainy\nwhich he had played upon his trusting mother preyed upon his rag of a\nconscience; but after that he began to get comfortable again, and was\npresently able to sleep like any other miscreant.\n\nThe boat bore Roxy away from St. Louis at four in the afternoon, and she\nstood on the lower guard abaft the paddle-box and watched Tom through a\nblur of tears until he melted into the throng of people and disappeared;\nthen she looked no more, but sat there on a coil of cable crying till\nfar into the night. When she went to her foul steerage-bunk at last,\nbetween the clashing engines, it was not to sleep, but only to wait for\nthe morning, and, waiting, grieve.\n\nIt had been imagined that she \"would not know,\" and would think she was\ntraveling up stream. She! Why, she had been steamboating for years. At\ndawn she got up and went listlessly and sat down on the cable-coil\nagain. She passed many a snag whose \"break\" could have told her a thing\nto break her heart, for it showed a current moving in the same direction\nthat the boat was going; but her thoughts were elsewhere, and she did\nnot notice. But at last the roar of a bigger and nearer break than usual\nbrought her out of her torpor, and she looked up, and her practised eye\nfell upon that telltale rush of water. For one moment her petrified gaze\nfixed itself there. Then her head dropped upon her breast, and she\nsaid--\n\n\"Oh, de good Lord God have mercy on po' sinful me--I's sole down de\nriver!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nThe Judge Utters Dire Prophecy.\n\nEven popularity can be overdone. In Rome, along at first, you are full\nof regrets that Michelangelo died; but by and by you only regret that\nyou didn't see him do it.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nJuly 4. Statistics show that we lose more fools on this day than in all\nthe other days of the year put together. This proves, by the number left\nin stock, that one Fourth of July per year is now inadequate, the\ncountry has grown so.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nThe summer weeks dragged by, and then the political campaign\nopened--opened in pretty warm fashion, and waxed hotter and hotter\ndaily. The twins threw themselves into it with their whole heart, for\ntheir self-love was engaged. Their popularity, so general at first, had\nsuffered afterward; mainly because they had been too popular, and so a\nnatural reaction had followed. Besides, it had been diligently whispered\naround that it was curious--indeed, very curious--that that wonderful\nknife of theirs did not turn up--if it was so valuable, or if it had\never existed. And with the whisperings went chucklings and nudgings and\nwinks, and such things have an effect. The twins considered that success\nin the election would reinstate them, and that defeat would work them\nirreparable damage. Therefore they worked hard, but not harder than\nJudge Driscoll and Tom worked against them in the closing days of the\ncanvas. Tom's conduct had remained so letter-perfect during two whole\nmonths, now, that his uncle not only trusted him with money with which\nto persuade voters, but trusted him to go and get it himself out of the\nsafe in the private sitting-room.\n\nThe closing speech of the campaign was made by Judge Driscoll, and he\nmade it against both of the foreigners. It was disastrously effective.\nHe poured out rivers of ridicule upon them, and forced the big\nmass-meeting to laugh and applaud. He scoffed at them as adventurers,\nmountebanks, side-show riff-raff, dime museum freaks; he assailed their\nshowy titles with measureless derision; he said they were back-alley\nbarbers disguised as nobilities, peanut peddlers masquerading as\ngentlemen, organ-grinders bereft of their brother monkey. At last he\nstopped and stood still. He waited until the place had become absolutely\nsilent and expectant, then he delivered his deadliest shot; delivered it\nwith ice-cold seriousness and deliberation, with a significant emphasis\nupon the closing words: he said that he believed that the reward offered\nfor the lost knife was humbug and buncombe, and that its owner would\nknow where to find it whenever he should have occasion to assassinate\nsomebody.\n\nThen he stepped from the stand, leaving a startled and impressive hush\nbehind him instead of the customary explosion of cheers and party cries.\n\nThe strange remark flew far and wide over the town and made an\nextraordinary sensation. Everybody was asking, \"What could he mean by\nthat?\" And everybody went on asking that question, but in vain; for the\nJudge only said he knew what he was talking about, and stopped there;\nTom said he hadn't any idea what his uncle meant, and Wilson, whenever\nhe was asked what he thought it meant, parried the question by asking\nthe questioner what he thought it meant.\n\nWilson was elected, the twins were defeated--crushed, in fact, and left\nforlorn and substantially friendless. Tom went back to St. Louis happy.\n\nDawson's Landing had a week of repose, now, and it needed it. But it was\nin an expectant state, for the air was full of rumors of a new duel.\nJudge Driscoll's election labors had prostrated him, but it was said\nthat as soon as he was well enough to entertain a challenge he would get\none from Count Luigi.\n\nThe brothers withdrew entirely from society, and nursed their\nhumiliation in privacy. They avoided the people, and went out for\nexercise only late at night, when the streets were deserted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nRoxana Commands.\n\nGratitude and treachery are merely the two extremities of the same\nprocession. You have seen all of it that is worth staying for when the\nband and the gaudy officials have gone by.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's\nCalendar.\n\nThanksgiving Day. Let all give humble, hearty, and sincere thanks, now,\nbut the turkeys. In the island of Fiji they do not use turkeys; they use\nplumbers. It does not become you and me to sneer at Fiji.--Pudd'nhead\nWilson's Calendar.\n\nThe Friday after the election was a rainy one in St. Louis. It rained\nall day long, and rained hard, apparently trying its best to wash that\nsoot-blackened town white, but of course not succeeding. Toward midnight\nTom Driscoll arrived at his lodgings from the theatre in the heavy\ndownpour, and closed his umbrella and let himself in; but when he would\nhave shut the door, he found that there was another person\nentering--doubtless another lodger; this person closed the door and\ntramped up-stairs behind Tom. Tom found his door in the dark, and\nentered it and turned up the gas. When he faced about, lightly\nwhistling, he saw the back of a man. The man was closing and locking his\ndoor for him. His whistle faded out and he felt uneasy. The man turned\naround, a wreck of shabby old clothes, sodden with rain and all a-drip,\nand showed a black face under an old slouch hat. Tom was frightened. He\ntried to order the man out, but the words refused to come, and the other\nman got the start. He said, in a low voice--\n\n\"Keep still--I's yo' mother!\"\n\nTom sunk in a heap on a chair, and gasped out--\n\n\"It was mean of me, and base--I know it; but I meant it for the best, I\ndid indeed--I can swear it.\"\n\nRoxana stood awhile looking mutely down on him while he writhed in shame\nand went on incoherently babbling self-accusations mixed with pitiful\nattempts at explanation and palliation of his crime; then she seated\nherself and took off her hat, and her unkept masses of long brown hair\ntumbled down about her shoulders.\n\n\"It ain't no fault o' yo'n dat dat ain't gray,\" she said sadly, noticing\nthe hair.\n\n\"I know it, I know it! I'm a scoundrel. But I swear I meant it for the\nbest. It was a mistake, of course, but I thought it was for the best, I\ntruly did.\"\n\nRoxana began to cry softly, and presently words began to find their way\nout between her sobs. They were uttered lamentingly, rather than\nangrily--\n\n\"Sell a pusson down de river--down the river!--for de bes'! I wouldn't\ntreat a dog so! I is all broke down en wore out, now, en so I reckon it\nain't in me to storm aroun' no mo', like I used to when I 'uz trompled\non en 'bused. I don't know--but maybe it's so. Leastways, I's suffered\nso much dat mournin' seem to come mo' handy to me now den stormin'.\"\n\nThese words should have touched Tom Driscoll, but if they did, that\neffect was obliterated by a stronger one--one which removed the heavy\nweight of fear which lay upon him, and gave his crushed spirit a most\ngrateful rebound, and filled all his small soul with a deep sense of\nrelief. But he kept prudently still, and ventured no comment. There was\na voiceless interval of some duration, now, in which no sounds were\nheard but the beating of the rain upon the panes, the sighing and\ncomplaining of the winds, and now and then a muffled sob from Roxana.\nThe sobs became more and more infrequent, and at last ceased. Then the\nrefugee began to talk again:\n\n\"Shet down dat light a little. More. More yit. A pusson dat is hunted\ndon't like de light. Dah--dat'll do. I kin see whah you is, en dat's\nenough. I's gwine to tell you de tale, en cut it jes as short as I kin,\nen den I'll tell you what you's got to do. Dat man dat bought me ain't a\nbad man; he's good enough, as planters goes; en if he could 'a' had his\nway I'd 'a' be'n a house servant in his fambly en be'n comfortable: but\nhis wife she was a Yank, en not right down good lookin', en she riz up\nagin me straight off; so den dey sent me out to de quarter 'mongst de\ncommon fiel' han's. Dat woman warn't satisfied even wid dat, but she\nworked up de overseer ag'in' me, she 'uz dat jealous en hateful; so de\noverseer he had me out befo' day in de mawnin's en worked me de whole\nlong day as long as dey 'uz any light to see by; en many's de lashin's I\ngot 'ca'se I couldn't come up to de work o' de stronges'. Dat overseer\nwuz a Yank, too, outen New Englan', en anybody down South kin tell you\nwhat dat mean. Dey knows how to work a nigger to death, en dey knows how\nto whale 'em, too--whale 'em till dey backs is welted like a washboard.\n'Long at fust my marster say de good word for me to de overseer, but dat\n'uz bad for me; for de mistis she fine it out, en arter dat I jist\nketched it at every turn--dey warn't no mercy for me no mo'.\"\n\nTom's heart was fired--with fury against the planter's wife; and he said\nto himself, \"But for that meddlesome fool, everything would have gone\nall right.\" He added a deep and bitter curse against her.\n\nThe expression of this sentiment was fiercely written in his face, and\nstood thus revealed to Roxana by a white glare of lightning which turned\nthe somber dusk of the room into dazzling day at that moment. She was\npleased--pleased and grateful; for did not that expression show that her\nchild was capable of grieving for his mother's wrongs and of feeling\nresentment toward her persecutors?--a thing which she had been doubting.\nBut her flash of happiness was only a flash, and went out again and left\nher spirit dark; for she said to herself, \"He sole me down de river--he\ncan't feel for a body long: dis'll pass en go.\" Then she took up her\ntale again.\n\n\"'Bout ten days ago I 'uz sayin' to myself dat I couldn't las' many mo'\nweeks I 'uz so wore out wid de awful work en de lashin's, en so\ndownhearted en misable. En I didn't care no mo', nuther--life warn't\nwuth noth'n' to me, if I got to go on like dat. Well, when a body is in\na frame o' mine like dat, what do a body care what a body do? Dey was a\nlittle sickly nigger wench 'bout ten year ole dat 'uz good to me, en\nhadn't no mammy, po' thing, en I loved her en she loved me; en she come\nout whah I 'uz workin 'en she had a roasted tater, en tried to slip it\nto me,--robbin' herself, you see, 'ca'se she knowed de overseer didn't\ngimme enough to eat,--en he ketched her at it, en give her a lick acrost\nde back wid his stick, which 'uz as thick as a broom-handle, en she\ndrop' screamin' on de groun', en squirmin' en wallerin' aroun' in de\ndust like a spider dat's got crippled. I couldn't stan' it. All de\nhell-fire dat 'uz ever in my heart flame' up, en I snatch de stick outen\nhis han' en laid him flat. He laid dah moanin' en cussin', en all out of\nhis head, you know, en de niggers 'uz plumb sk'yred to death. Dey\ngathered roun' him to he'p him, en I jumped on his hoss en took out for\nde river as tight as I could go. I knowed what dey would do wid me. Soon\nas he got well he would start in en work me to death if marster let him;\nen if dey didn't do dat, they'd sell me furder down de river, en dat's\nde same thing. So I 'lowed to drown myself en git out o' my troubles. It\n'uz gitt'n' towards dark. I 'uz at de river in two minutes. Den I see a\ncanoe, en I says dey ain't no use to drown myself tell I got to; so I\nties de hoss in de edge o' de timber en shove out down de river, keepin'\nin under de shelter o' de bluff bank en prayin' for de dark to shet down\nquick. I had a pow'ful good start, 'ca'se de big house 'uz three mile\nback f'om de river en on'y de work-mules to ride dah on, en on'y niggers\nto ride 'em, en dey warn't gwine to hurry--dey'd gimme all de chance dey\ncould. Befo' a body could go to de house en back it would be long pas'\ndark, en dey couldn't track de hoss en fine out which way I went tell\nmawnin', en de niggers would tell 'em all de lies dey could 'bout it.\n\n\"Well, de dark come, en I went on a-spinnin' down de river. I paddled\nmo'n two hours, den I warn't worried no mo', so I quit paddlin, en\nfloated down de current, considerin' what I 'uz gwine to do if I didn't\nhave to drown myself. I made up some plans, en floated along, turnin'\n'em over in my mine. Well, when it 'uz a little pas' midnight, as I\nreckoned, en I had come fifteen or twenty mile, I see de lights o' a\nsteamboat layin' at de bank, whah dey warn't no town en no woodyard, en\nputty soon I ketched de shape o' de chimbly-tops ag'in' de stars, en den\ngood gracious me, I 'most jumped out o' my skin for joy! It 'uz de Gran'\nMogul--I 'uz chambermaid on her for eight seasons in de Cincinnati en\nOrleans trade. I slid 'long pas'--don't see nobody stirrin' nowhah--hear\n'em a-hammerin' away in de engine-room, den I knowed what de matter\nwas--some o' de machinery's broke. I got asho' below de boat and turn'\nde canoe loose, den I goes 'long up, en dey 'uz jes one plank out, en I\nstep' 'board de boat. It 'uz pow'ful hot, deckhan's en roustabouts 'uz\nsprawled aroun' asleep on de fo'cas'l', de second mate, Jim Bangs, he\nsot dah on de bitts wid his head down, asleep--'ca'se dat's de way de\nsecond mate stan' de cap'n's watch!--en de ole watchman, Billy Hatch, he\n'uz a-noddin' on de companionway;--en I knowed 'em all; 'en, lan', but\ndey did look good! I says to myself, I wished old marster'd come along\nnow en try to take me--bless yo' heart, I's 'mong frien's, I is. So I\ntromped right along 'mongst 'em, en went up on de b'iler deck en 'way\nback aft to de ladies' cabin guard, en sot down dah in de same cheer dat\nI'd sot in 'mos' a hund'd million times, I reckon; en it 'uz jist home\nag'in, I tell you!\n\n\"In 'bout an hour I heard de ready-bell jingle, en den de racket begin.\nPutty soon I hear de gong strike. 'Set her back on de outside,' I says\nto myself--'I reckon I knows dat music!' I hear de gong ag'in. 'Come\nahead on de inside,' I says. Gong ag'in. 'Stop de outside.' Gong ag'in.\n'Come ahead on de outside--now we's pinted for Sent Louis, en I's outer\nde woods en ain't got to drown myself at all.' I knowed de Mogul 'uz in\nde Sent Louis trade now, you see. It 'uz jes fair daylight when we\npassed our plantation, en I seed a gang o' niggers en white folks\nhuntin' up en down de sho', en troublin' deyselves a good deal 'bout me;\nbut I warn't troublin' myself none 'bout dem.\n\n\"'Bout dat time Sally Jackson, dat used to be my second chambermaid en\n'uz head chambermaid now, she come out on de guard, en 'uz pow'ful glad\nto see me, en so 'uz all de officers; en I tole 'em I'd got kidnapped en\nsole down de river, en dey made me up twenty dollahs en give it to me,\nen Sally she rigged me out wid good clo'es, en when I got here I went\nstraight to whah you used to wuz, en den I come to dis house, en dey say\nyou's away but 'spected back every day; so I didn't dast to go down de\nriver to Dawson's, 'ca'se I might miss you.\n\n\"Well, las' Monday I 'uz pass'n' by one o' dem places in Fourth street\nwhah deh sticks up runaway-nigger bills, en he'ps to ketch 'em, en I\nseed my marster! I 'mos' flopped down on de groun', I felt so gone. He\nhad his back to me, en 'uz talkin' to de man en givin' him some\nbills--nigger-bills, I reckon, en I'se de nigger. He's offerin' a\nreward--dat's it. Ain't I right, don't you reckon?\"\n\nTom had been gradually sinking into a state of ghastly terror, and he\nsaid to himself, now: \"I'm lost, no matter what turn things take! This\nman has said to me that he thinks there was something suspicious about\nthat sale. He said he had a letter from a passenger on the Grand Mogul\nsaying that Roxy came here on that boat and that everybody on board knew\nall about the case; so he says that her coming here instead of flying to\na free State looks bad for me, and that if I don't find her for him, and\nthat pretty soon, he will make trouble for me. I never believed that\nstory; I couldn't believe she would be so dead to all motherly instincts\nas to come here, knowing the risk she would run of getting me into\nirremediable trouble. And after all, here she is! And I stupidly swore I\nwould help him find her, thinking it was a perfectly safe thing to\npromise. If I venture to deliver her up, she--she--but how can I help\nmyself? I've got to do that or pay the money, and where's the money to\ncome from? I--I--well, I should think that if he would swear to treat\nher kindly hereafter--and she says, herself, that he is a good man--and\nif he would swear to never allow her to be overworked, or ill fed, or--\"\n\nA flash of lightning exposed Tom's pallid face, drawn and rigid with\nthese worrying thoughts. Roxana spoke up sharply now, and there was\napprehension in her voice--\n\n\"Turn up dat light! I want to see yo' face better. Dah now--lemme look\nat you. Chambers, you's as white as yo' shirt! Has you see dat man? Has\nhe be'n to see you?\"\n\n\"Ye-s.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Monday noon.\"\n\n\"Monday noon! Was he on my track?\"\n\n\"He--well, he thought he was. That is, he hoped he was. This is the bill\nyou saw.\" He took it out of his pocket.\n\n\"Read it to me!\"\n\nShe was panting with excitement, and there was a dusky glow in her eyes\nthat Tom could not translate with certainty, but there seemed to be\nsomething threatening about it. The handbill had the usual rude woodcut\nof a turbaned negro woman running, with the customary bundle on a stick\nover her shoulder, and the heading in bold type, \"$100 Reward.\" Tom read\nthe bill aloud--at least the part that described Roxana and named the\nmaster and his St. Louis address and the address of the Fourth-street\nagency; but he left out the item that applicants for the reward might\nalso apply to Mr. Thomas Driscoll.\n\n\"Gimme de bill!\"\n\nTom had folded it and was putting it in his pocket. He felt a chilly\nstreak creeping down his back, but said as carelessly as he could--\n\n\"The bill? Why, it isn't any use to you, you can't read it. What do you\nwant with it?\"\n\n\"Gimme de bill!\" Tom gave it to her, but with a reluctance which he\ncould not entirely disguise. \"Did you read it all to me?\"\n\n\"Certainly I did.\"\n\n\"Hole up yo' han' en swah to it.\"\n\nTom did it. Roxana put the bill carefully away in her pocket, with her\neyes fixed upon Tom's face all the while; then she said--\n\n\"Yo's lyin'!\"\n\n\"What would I want to lie about it for?\"\n\n\"I don't know--but you is. Dat's my opinion, anyways. But nemmine 'bout\ndat. When I seed dat man I 'uz dat sk'yerd dat I could sca'cely wobble\nhome. Den I give a nigger man a dollar for dese clo'es, en I ain't be'n\nin a house sence, night ner day, till now. I blacked my face en laid hid\nin de cellar of a ole house dat's burnt down, daytimes, en robbed de\nsugar hogsheads en grain sacks on de wharf, nights, to git somethin' to\neat, en never dast to try to buy noth'n', en I's 'mos' starved. En I\nnever dast to come near dis place till dis rainy night, when dey ain't\nno people roun' sca'cely. But to-night I be'n a-stannin' in de dark\nalley ever sence night come, waitin' for you to go by. En here I is.\"\n\nShe fell to thinking. Presently she said--\n\n\"You seed dat man at noon, las' Monday?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I seed him de middle o' dat arternoon. He hunted you up, didn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did he give you de bill dat time?\"\n\n\"No, he hadn't got it printed yet.\"\n\nRoxana darted a suspicious glance at him.\n\n\"Did you he'p him fix up de bill?\"\n\nTom cursed himself for making that stupid blunder, and tried to rectify\nit by saying he remembered, now, that it was at noon Monday that the man\ngave him the bill. Roxana said--\n\n\"You's lyin' ag'in, sho.\" Then she straightened up and raised her\nfinger:\n\n\"Now den! I's gwine to ask you a question, en I wants to know how you's\ngwine to git aroun' it. You knowed he 'uz arter me; en if you run off,\n'stid o' stayin' here to he'p him, he'd know dey 'uz somethin' wrong\n'bout dis business, en den he would inquire 'bout you, en dat would take\nhim to yo' uncle, en yo' uncle would read de bill en see dat you be'n\nsellin' a free nigger down de river, en you know him, I reckon! He'd\nt'ar up de will en kick you outen de house. Now, den, you answer me dis\nquestion: hain't you tole dat man dat I would be sho' to come here, en\nden you would fix it so he could set a trap en ketch me?\"\n\nTom recognized that neither lies nor arguments could help him any\nlonger--he was in a vise, with the screw turned on, and out of it there\nwas no budging. His face began to take on an ugly look, and presently he\nsaid, with a snarl--\n\n\"Well, what could I do? You see, yourself, that I was in his grip and\ncouldn't get out.\"\n\nRoxy scorched him with a scornful gaze awhile, then she said--\n\n\"What could you do? You could be Judas to yo' own mother to save yo'\nwuthless hide! Would anybody b'lieve it? No--a dog couldn't! You is de\nlow-downest orneriest hound dat was ever pup'd into dis worl'--en I's\n'sponsible for it!\"--and she spat on him.\n\nHe made no effort to resent this. Roxy reflected a moment, then she\nsaid--\n\n\"Now I'll tell you what you's gwine to do. You's gwine to give dat man\nde money dat you's got laid up, en make him wait till you kin go to de\nJudge en git de res' en buy me free agin.\"\n\n\"Thunder! what are you thinking of? Go and ask him for three hundred\ndollars and odd? What would I tell him I want with it, pray?\"\n\nRoxy's answer was delivered in a serene and level voice--\n\n\"You'll tell him you's sole me to pay yo' gamblin' debts en dat you lied\nto me en was a villain, en dat I 'quires you to git dat money en buy me\nback ag'in.\"\n\n\"Why, you've gone stark mad! He would tear the will to shreds in a\nminute--don't you know that?\"\n\n\"Yes, I does.\"\n\n\"Then you don't believe I'm idiot enough to go to him, do you?\"\n\n\"I don't b'lieve nothin' 'bout it--I knows you's a-goin'. I knows it\n'ca'se you knows dat if you don't raise dat money I'll go to him myself,\nen den he'll sell you down de river, en you kin see how you like it!\"\n\nTom rose, trembling and excited, and there was an evil light in his eye.\nHe strode to the door and said he must get out of this suffocating place\nfor a moment and clear his brain in the fresh air so that he could\ndetermine what to do. The door wouldn't open. Roxy smiled grimly, and\nsaid--\n\n\"I's got de key, honey--set down. You needn't cle'r up yo' brain none to\nfine out what you gwine to do--I knows what you's gwine to do.\" Tom sat\ndown and began to pass his hands through his hair with a helpless and\ndesperate air. Roxy said, \"Is dat man in dis house?\"\n\nTom glanced up with a surprised expression, and asked--\n\n\"What gave you such an idea?\"\n\n\"You done it. Gwine out to cle'r yo' brain! In de fust place you ain't\ngot none to cle'r, en in de second place yo' ornery eye tole on you.\nYou's de low-downest hound dat ever--but I done tole you dat befo'. Now\nden, dis is Friday. You kin fix it up wid dat man, en tell him you's\ngwine away to git de res' o' de money, en dat you'll be back wid it nex'\nTuesday, or maybe Wednesday. You understan'?\"\n\nTom answered sullenly--\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"En when you gits de new bill o' sale dat sells me to my own self, take\nen send it in de mail to Mr. Pudd'nhead Wilson, en write on de back dat\nhe's to keep it tell I come. You understan'?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Dat's all den. Take yo' umbreller, en put on yo' hat.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Beca'se you's gwine to see me home to de wharf. You see dis knife? I's\ntoted it aroun' sence de day I seed dat man en bought dese clo'es en it.\nIf he ketch me, I's gwine to kill myself wid it. Now start along, en go\nsof', en lead de way; en if you gives a sign in dis house, or if anybody\ncomes up to you in de street, I's gwine to jam it right into you.\nChambers, does you b'lieve me when I says dat?\"\n\n\"It's no use to bother me with that question. I know your word's good.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's diff'rent from yo'n! Shet de light out en move along--here's\nde key.\"\n\nThey were not followed. Tom trembled every time a late straggler brushed\nby them on the street, and half expected to feel the cold steel in his\nback. Roxy was right at his heels and always in reach. After tramping a\nmile they reached a wide vacancy on the deserted wharves, and in this\ndark and rainy desert they parted.\n\nAs Tom trudged home his mind was full of dreary thoughts and wild plans;\nbut at last he said to himself, wearily--\n\n\"There is but the one way out. I must follow her plan. But with a\nvariation--I will not ask for the money and ruin myself; I will rob the\nold skinflint.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nThe Prophecy Realized.\n\nFew things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good\nexample.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nIt were not best that we should all think alike; it is difference of\nopinion that makes horse-races.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nDawson's Landing was comfortably finishing its season of dull repose and\nwaiting patiently for the duel. Count Luigi was waiting, too; but not\npatiently, rumor said. Sunday came, and Luigi insisted on having his\nchallenge conveyed. Wilson carried it. Judge Driscoll declined to fight\nwith an assassin--\"that is,\" he added significantly, \"in the field of\nhonor.\"\n\nElsewhere, of course, he would be ready. Wilson tried to convince him\nthat if he had been present himself when Angelo told about the homicide\ncommitted by Luigi, he would not have considered the act discreditable\nto Luigi; but the obstinate old man was not to be moved.\n\nWilson went back to his principal and reported the failure of his\nmission. Luigi was incensed, and asked how it could be that the old\ngentleman, who was by no means dull-witted, held his trifling nephew's\nevidence and inferences to be of more value than Wilson's. But Wilson\nlaughed, and said--\n\n\"That is quite simple; that is easily explicable. I am not his doll--his\nbaby--his infatuation: his nephew is. The Judge and his late wife never\nhad any children. The Judge and his wife were past middle age when this\ntreasure fell into their lap. One must make allowances for a parental\ninstinct that has been starving for twenty-five or thirty years. It is\nfamished, it is crazed with hunger by that time, and will be entirely\nsatisfied with anything that comes handy; its taste is atrophied, it\ncan't tell mud-cat from shad. A devil born to a young couple is\nmeasurably recognizable by them as a devil before long, but a devil\nadopted by an old couple is an angel to them, and remains so, through\nthick and thin. Tom is this old man's angel; he is infatuated with him.\nTom can persuade him into things which other people can't--not all\nthings; I don't mean that, but a good many--particularly one class of\nthings: the things that create or abolish personal partialities or\nprejudices in the old man's mind. The old man liked both of you. Tom\nconceived a hatred for you. That was enough; it turned the old man\naround at once. The oldest and strongest friendship must go to the\nground when one of these late-adopted darlings throws a brick at it.\"\n\n\"It's a curious philosophy,\" said Luigi.\n\n\"It ain't a philosophy at all--it's a fact. And there is something\npathetic and beautiful about it, too. I think there is nothing more\npathetic than to see one of these poor old childless couples taking a\nmenagerie of yelping little worthless dogs to their hearts; and then\nadding some cursing and squawking parrots and a jackass-voiced macaw;\nand next a couple of hundred screeching song-birds, and presently some\nfetid guinea-pigs and rabbits, and a howling colony of cats. It is all a\ngroping and ignorant effort to construct out of base metal and brass\nfilings, so to speak, something to take the place of that golden\ntreasure denied them by Nature, a child. But this is a digression. The\nunwritten law of this region requires you to kill Judge Driscoll on\nsight, and he and the community will expect that attention at your\nhands--though of course your own death by his bullet will answer every\npurpose. Look out for him! Are you heeled--that is, fixed?\"\n\n\"Yes, he shall have his opportunity. If he attacks me I will respond.\"\n\nAs Wilson was leaving, he said--\n\n\"The Judge is still a little used up by his campaign work, and will not\nget out for a day or so; but when he does get out, you want to be on the\nalert.\"\n\nAbout eleven at night the twins went out for exercise, and started on a\nlong stroll in the veiled moonlight.\n\nTom Driscoll had landed at Hackett's Store, two miles below Dawson's,\njust about half an hour earlier, the only passenger for that lonely\nspot, and had walked up the shore road and entered Judge Driscoll's\nhouse without having encountered any one either on the road or under the\nroof.\n\nHe pulled down his window-blinds and lighted his candle. He laid off his\ncoat and hat and began his preparations. He unlocked his trunk and got\nhis suit of girl's clothes out from under the male attire in it, and\nlaid it by. Then he blacked his face with burnt cork and put the cork in\nhis pocket. His plan was, to slip down to his uncle's private\nsitting-room below, pass into the bedroom, steal the safe-key from the\nold gentleman's clothes, and then go back and rob the safe. He took up\nhis candle to start. His courage and confidence were high, up to this\npoint, but both began to waver a little, now. Suppose he should make a\nnoise, by some accident, and get caught--say, in the act of opening the\nsafe? Perhaps it would be well to go armed. He took the Indian knife\nfrom its hiding-place, and felt a pleasant return of his wandering\ncourage. He slipped stealthily down the narrow stair, his hair rising\nand his pulses halting at the slightest creak. When he was half-way\ndown, he was disturbed to perceive that the landing below was touched by\na faint glow of light. What could that mean? Was his uncle still up? No,\nthat was not likely; he must have left his night-taper there when he\nwent to bed. Tom crept on down, pausing at every step to listen. He\nfound the door standing open, and glanced in. What he saw pleased him\nbeyond measure. His uncle was asleep on the sofa; on a small table at\nthe head of the sofa a lamp was burning low, and by it stood the old\nman's small tin cash-box, closed. Near the box was a pile of bank-notes\nand a piece of paper covered with figures in pencil. The safe-door was\nnot open. Evidently the sleeper had wearied himself with work upon his\nfinances, and was taking a rest.\n\nTom set his candle on the stairs, and began to make his way toward the\npile of notes, stooping low as he went. When he was passing his uncle,\nthe old man stirred in his sleep, and Tom stopped instantly--stopped,\nand softly drew the knife from its sheath, with his heart thumping, and\nhis eyes fastened upon his benefactor's face. After a moment or two he\nventured forward again--one step--reached for his prize and seized it,\ndropping the knife-sheath. Then he felt the old man's strong grip upon\nhim, and a wild cry of \"Help! help!\" rang in his ear. Without hesitation\nhe drove the knife home--and was free. Some of the notes escaped from\nhis left hand and fell in the blood on the floor. He dropped the knife\nand snatched them up and started to fly; transferred them to his left\nhand, and seized the knife again, in his fright and confusion, but\nremembered himself and flung it from him, as being a dangerous witness\nto carry away with him.\n\nHe jumped for the stair-foot, and closed the door behind him; and as he\nsnatched his candle and fled upward, the stillness of the night was\nbroken by the sound of urgent footsteps approaching the house. In\nanother moment he was in his room and the twins were standing aghast\nover the body of the murdered man!\n\nTom put on his coat, buttoned his hat under it, threw on his suit of\ngirl's clothes, dropped the veil, blew out his light, locked the room\ndoor by which he had just entered, taking the key, passed through his\nother door into the back hall, locked that door and kept the key, then\nworked his way along in the dark and descended the back stairs. He was\nnot expecting to meet anybody, for all interest was centered in the\nother part of the house, now; his calculation proved correct. By the\ntime he was passing through the back-yard, Mrs. Pratt, her servants, and\na dozen half-dressed neighbors had joined the twins and the dead, and\naccessions were still arriving at the front door.\n\nAs Tom, quaking as with a palsy, passed out at the gate, three women\ncame flying from the house on the opposite side of the lane. They rushed\nby him and in at the gate, asking him what the trouble was there, but\nnot waiting for an answer. Tom said to himself, \"Those old maids waited\nto dress--they did the same thing the night Stevens's house burned down\nnext door.\" In a few minutes he was in the haunted house. He lighted a\ncandle and took off his girl-clothes. There was blood on him all down\nhis left side, and his right hand was red with the stains of the\nblood-soaked notes which he had crushed in it; but otherwise he was free\nfrom this sort of evidence. He cleansed his hand on the straw, and\ncleaned most of the smut from his face. Then he burned his male and\nfemale attire to ashes, scattered the ashes, and put on a disguise\nproper for a tramp. He blew out his light, went below, and was soon\nloafing down the river road with the intent to borrow and use one of\nRoxy's devices. He found a canoe and paddled off down-stream, setting\nthe canoe adrift as dawn approached, and making his way by land to the\nnext village, where he kept out of sight till a transient steamer came\nalong, and then took deck passage for St. Louis. He was ill at ease\nuntil Dawson's Landing was behind him; then he said to himself, \"All the\ndetectives on earth couldn't trace me now; there's not a vestige of a\nclue left in the world; that homicide will take its place with the\npermanent mysteries, and people won't get done trying to guess out the\nsecret of it for fifty years.\"\n\nIn St. Louis, next morning, he read this brief telegram in the\npapers--dated at Dawson's Landing:\n\nJudge Driscoll, an old and respected citizen, was assassinated here\nabout midnight by a profligate Italian nobleman or barber on account of\na quarrel growing out of the recent election. The assassin will probably\nbe lynched.\n\n\"One of the twins!\" soliloquized Tom; \"how lucky! It is the knife that\nhas done him this grace. We never know when fortune is trying to favor\nus. I actually cursed Pudd'nhead Wilson in my heart for putting it out\nof my power to sell that knife. I take it back, now.\"\n\nTom was now rich and independent. He arranged with the planter, and\nmailed to Wilson the new bill of sale which sold Roxana to herself; then\nhe telegraphed his Aunt Pratt:\n\nHave seen the awful news in the papers and am almost prostrated with\ngrief. Shall start by packet to-day. Try to bear up till I come.\n\nWhen Wilson reached the house of mourning and had gathered such details\nas Mrs. Pratt and the rest of the crowd could tell him, he took command\nas mayor, and gave orders that nothing should be touched, but everything\nleft as it was until Justice Robinson should arrive and take the proper\nmeasures as coroner. He cleared everybody out of the room but the twins\nand himself. The sheriff soon arrived and took the twins away to jail.\nWilson told them to keep heart, and promised to do his best in their\ndefense when the case should come to trial. Justice Robinson came\npresently, and with him Constable Blake. They examined the room\nthoroughly. They found the knife and the sheath. Wilson noticed that\nthere were finger-prints on the knife-handle. That pleased him, for the\ntwins had required the earliest comers to make a scrutiny of their hands\nand clothes, and neither these people nor Wilson himself had found any\nblood-stains upon them. Could there be a possibility that the twins had\nspoken the truth when they said they found the man dead when they ran\ninto the house in answer to the cry for help? He thought of that\nmysterious girl at once. But this was not the sort of work for a girl to\nbe engaged in. No matter; Tom Driscoll's room must be examined.\n\nAfter the coroner's jury had viewed the body and its surroundings,\nWilson suggested a search up-stairs, and he went along. The jury forced\nan entrance to Tom's room, but found nothing, of course.\n\nThe coroner's jury found that the homicide was committed by Luigi, and\nthat Angelo was accessory to it.\n\nThe town was bitter against the unfortunates, and for the first few days\nafter the murder they were in constant danger of being lynched. The\ngrand jury presently indicted Luigi for murder in the first degree, and\nAngelo as accessory before the fact. The twins were transferred from the\ncity jail to the county prison to await trial.\n\nWilson examined the finger-marks on the knife-handle and said to\nhimself, \"Neither of the twins made those marks.\" Then manifestly there\nwas another person concerned, either in his own interest or as hired\nassassin.\n\nBut who could it be? That, he must try to find out. The safe was not\nopen, the cash-box was closed, and had three thousand dollars in it.\nThen robbery was not the motive, and revenge was. Where had the murdered\nman an enemy except Luigi? There was but that one person in the world\nwith a deep grudge against him.\n\nThe mysterious girl! The girl was a great trial to Wilson. If the motive\nhad been robbery, the girl might answer; but there wasn't any girl that\nwould want to take this old man's life for revenge. He had no quarrels\nwith girls; he was a gentleman.\n\nWilson had perfect tracings of the finger-marks of the knife-handle; and\namong his glass-records he had a great array of finger-prints of women\nand girls, collected during the last fifteen or eighteen years, but he\nscanned them in vain, they successfully withstood every test; among them\nwere no duplicates of the prints on the knife.\n\nThe presence of the knife on the stage of the murder was a worrying\ncircumstance for Wilson. A week previously he had as good as admitted to\nhimself that he believed Luigi had possessed such a knife, and that he\nstill possessed it notwithstanding his pretense that it had been stolen.\nAnd now here was the knife, and with it the twins. Half the town had\nsaid the twins were humbugging when they claimed that they had lost\ntheir knife, and now these people were joyful, and said, \"I told you\nso!\"\n\nIf their finger-prints had been on the handle--but it was useless to\nbother any further about that; the finger-prints on the handle were not\ntheirs--that he knew perfectly.\n\nWilson refused to suspect Tom; for first, Tom couldn't murder\nanybody--he hadn't character enough; secondly, if he could murder a\nperson he wouldn't select his doting benefactor and nearest relative;\nthirdly, self-interest was in the way; for while the uncle lived, Tom\nwas sure of a free support and a chance to get the destroyed will\nrevived again, but with the uncle gone, that chance was gone, too. It\nwas true the will had really been revived, as was now discovered, but\nTom could not have been aware of it, or he would have spoken of it, in\nhis native talky, unsecretive way. Finally, Tom was in St. Louis when\nthe murder was done, and got the news out of the morning journals, as\nwas shown by his telegram to his aunt. These speculations were\nunemphasized sensations rather than articulated thoughts, for Wilson\nwould have laughed at the idea of seriously connecting Tom with the\nmurder.\n\nWilson regarded the case of the twins as desperate--in fact, about\nhopeless. For he argued that if a confederate was not found, an\nenlightened Missouri jury would hang them, sure; if a confederate was\nfound, that would not improve the matter, but simply furnish one more\nperson for the sheriff to hang. Nothing could save the twins but the\ndiscovery of a person who did the murder on his sole personal\naccount--an undertaking which had all the aspect of the impossible.\nStill, the person who made the finger-prints must be sought. The twins\nmight have no case with him, but they certainly would have none without\nhim.\n\nSo Wilson mooned around, thinking, thinking, guessing, guessing, day and\nnight, and arriving nowhere. Whenever he ran across a girl or a woman he\nwas not acquainted with, he got her finger-prints, on one pretext or\nanother; and they always cost him a sigh when he got home, for they\nnever tallied with the finger-marks on the knife-handle.\n\nAs to the mysterious girl, Tom swore he knew no such girl, and did not\nremember ever seeing a girl wearing a dress like the one described by\nWilson. He admitted that he did not always lock his room, and that\nsometimes the servants forgot to lock the house doors; still, in his\nopinion the girl must have made but few visits or she would have been\ndiscovered. When Wilson tried to connect her with the stealing-raid, and\nthought she might have been the old woman's confederate, if not the very\nthief herself disguised as an old woman, Tom seemed stuck, and also much\ninterested, and said he would keep a sharp eye out for this person or\npersons, although he was afraid that she or they would be too smart to\nventure again into a town where everybody would now be on the watch for\na good while to come.\n\nEverybody was pitying Tom, he looked so quiet and sorrowful, and seemed\nto feel his great loss so deeply. He was playing a part, but it was not\nall a part. The picture of his alleged uncle, as he had last seen him,\nwas before him in the dark pretty frequently, when he was awake, and\ncalled again in his dreams, when he was asleep. He wouldn't go into the\nroom where the tragedy had happened. This charmed the doting Mrs. Pratt,\nwho realized now, \"as she had never done before,\" she said, what a\nsensitive and delicate nature her darling had, and how he adored his\npoor uncle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nThe Murderer Chuckles.\n\nEven the clearest and most perfect circumstantial evidence is likely to\nbe at fault, after all, and therefore ought to be received with great\ncaution. Take the case of any pencil, sharpened by any woman: if you\nhave witnesses, you will find she did it with a knife; but if you take\nsimply the aspect of the pencil, you will say she did it with her\nteeth.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nThe weeks dragged along, no friend visiting the jailed twins but their\ncounsel and Aunt Patsy Cooper, and the day of trial came at last--the\nheaviest day in Wilson's life; for with all his tireless diligence he\nhad discovered no sign or trace of the missing confederate.\n\"Confederate\" was the term he had long ago privately accepted for that\nperson--not as being unquestionably the right term, but as being at\nleast possibly the right one, though he was never able to understand why\nthe twins did not vanish and escape, as the confederate had done,\ninstead of remaining by the murdered man and getting caught there.\n\nThe court-house was crowded, of course, and would remain so to the\nfinish, for not only in the town itself, but in the country for miles\naround, the trial was the one topic of conversation among the people.\nMrs. Pratt, in deep mourning, and Tom with a weed on his hat, had seats\nnear Pembroke Howard, the public prosecutor, and back of them sat a\ngreat array of friends of the family. The twins had but one friend\npresent to keep their counsel in countenance, their poor old sorrowing\nlandlady. She sat near Wilson, and looked her friendliest. In the\n\"nigger corner\" sat Chambers; also Roxy, with good clothes on, and her\nbill of sale in her pocket. It was her most precious possession, and she\nnever parted with it, day or night. Tom had allowed her thirty-five\ndollars a month ever since he came into his property, and had said that\nhe and she ought to be grateful to the twins for making them rich; but\nhad roused such a temper in her by this speech that he did not repeat\nthe argument afterward. She said the old Judge had treated her child a\nthousand times better than he deserved, and had never done her an\nunkindness in his life; so she hated these outlandish devils for killing\nhim, and shouldn't ever sleep satisfied till she saw them hanged for it.\nShe was here to watch the trial, now, and was going to lift up just one\n\"hooraw\" over it if the County Judge put her in jail a year for it. She\ngave her turbaned head a toss and said, \"When dat verdic' comes, I's\ngwine to lif' dat roof, now, I tell you.\"\n\nPembroke Howard briefly sketched the State's case. He said he would show\nby a chain of circumstantial evidence without break or fault in it\nanywhere, that the principal prisoner at the bar committed the murder;\nthat the motive was partly revenge, and partly a desire to take his own\nlife out of jeopardy, and that his brother, by his presence, was a\nconsenting accessory to the crime; a crime which was the basest known to\nthe calendar of human misdeeds--assassination; that it was conceived by\nthe blackest of hearts and consummated by the cowardliest of hands; a\ncrime which had broken a loving sister's heart, blighted the happiness\nof a young nephew who was as dear as a son, brought inconsolable grief\nto many friends, and sorrow and loss to the whole community. The utmost\npenalty of the outraged law would be exacted, and upon the accused, now\npresent at the bar, that penalty would unquestionably be executed. He\nwould reserve further remark until his closing speech.\n\nHe was strongly moved, and so also was the whole house; Mrs. Pratt and\nseveral other women were weeping when he sat down, and many an eye that\nwas full of hate was riveted upon the unhappy prisoners.\n\nWitness after witness was called by the State, and questioned at length;\nbut the cross-questioning was brief. Wilson knew they could furnish\nnothing valuable for his side. People were sorry for Pudd'nhead; his\nbudding career would get hurt by this trial.\n\nSeveral witnesses swore they heard Judge Driscoll say in his public\nspeech that the twins would be able to find their lost knife again when\nthey needed it to assassinate somebody with. This was not news, but now\nit was seen to have been sorrowfully prophetic, and a profound sensation\nquivered through the hushed court-room when those dismal words were\nrepeated.\n\nThe public prosecutor rose and said that it was within his knowledge,\nthrough a conversation held with Judge Driscoll on the last day of his\nlife, that counsel for the defense had brought him a challenge from the\nperson charged at this bar with murder; that he had refused to fight\nwith a confessed assassin--\"that is, on the field of honor,\" but had\nadded significantly, that he would be ready for him elsewhere.\nPresumably the person here charged with murder was warned that he must\nkill or be killed the first time he should meet Judge Driscoll. If\ncounsel for the defense chose to let the statement stand so, he would\nnot call him to the witness stand. Mr. Wilson said he would offer no\ndenial. [Murmurs in the house--\"It is getting worse and worse for\nWilson's case.\"]\n\nMrs. Pratt testified that she heard no outcry, and did not know what\nwoke her up, unless it was the sound of rapid footsteps approaching the\nfront door. She jumped up and ran out in the hall just as she was, and\nheard the footsteps flying up the front steps and then following behind\nher as she ran to the sitting-room. There she found the accused standing\nover her murdered brother. [Here she broke down and sobbed. Sensation in\nthe court.] Resuming, she said the persons entering behind her were Mr.\nRogers and Mr. Buckstone.\n\nCross-examined by Wilson, she said the twins proclaimed their innocence;\ndeclared that they had been taking a walk, and had hurried to the house\nin response to a cry for help which was so loud and strong that they had\nheard it at a considerable distance; that they begged her and the\ngentlemen just mentioned to examine their hands and clothes--which was\ndone, and no blood stains found.\n\nConfirmatory evidence followed from Rogers and Buckstone.\n\nThe finding of the knife was verified, the advertisement minutely\ndescribing it and offering a reward for it was put in evidence, and its\nexact correspondence with that description proved. Then followed a few\nminor details, and the case for the State was closed.\n\nWilson said that he had three witnesses, the Misses Clarkson, who would\ntestify that they met a veiled young woman leaving Judge Driscoll's\npremises by the back gate a few minutes after the cries for help were\nheard, and that their evidence, taken with certain circumstantial\nevidence which he would call the court's attention to, would in his\nopinion convince the court that there was still one person concerned in\nthis crime who had not yet been found, and also that a stay of\nproceedings ought to be granted, in justice to his clients, until that\nperson should be discovered. As it was late, he would ask leave to defer\nthe examination of his three witnesses until the next morning.\n\nThe crowd poured out of the place and went flocking away in excited\ngroups and couples, talking the events of the session over with vivacity\nand consuming interest, and everybody seemed to have had a satisfactory\nand enjoyable day except the accused, their counsel, and their old-lady\nfriend. There was no cheer among these, and no substantial hope.\n\nIn parting with the twins Aunt Patsy did attempt a good-night with a gay\npretense of hope and cheer in it, but broke down without finishing.\n\nAbsolutely secure as Tom considered himself to be, the opening\nsolemnities of the trial had nevertheless oppressed him with a vague\nuneasiness, his being a nature sensitive to even the smallest alarms;\nbut from the moment that the poverty and weakness of Wilson's case lay\nexposed to the court, he was comfortable once more, even jubilant. He\nleft the court-room sarcastically sorry for Wilson. \"The Clarksons met\nan unknown woman in the back lane,\" he said to himself--\"that is his\ncase! I'll give him a century to find her in--a couple of them if he\nlikes. A woman who doesn't exist any longer, and the clothes that gave\nher her sex burnt up and the ashes thrown away--oh, certainly, he'll\nfind her easy enough!\" This reflection set him to admiring, for the\nhundredth time, the shrewd ingenuities by which he had insured himself\nagainst detection--more, against even suspicion.\n\n\"Nearly always in cases like this there is some little detail or other\noverlooked, some wee little track or trace left behind, and detection\nfollows; but here there's not even the faintest suggestion of a trace\nleft. No more than a bird leaves when it flies through the air--yes,\nthrough the night, you may say. The man that can track a bird through\nthe air in the dark and find that bird is the man to track me out and\nfind the Judge's assassin--no other need apply. And that is the job that\nhas been laid out for poor Pudd'nhead Wilson, of all people in the\nworld! Lord, it will be pathetically funny to see him grubbing and\ngroping after that woman that don't exist, and the right person sitting\nunder his very nose all the time!\" The more he thought the situation\nover, the more the humor of it struck him. Finally he said, \"I'll never\nlet him hear the last of that woman. Every time I catch him in company,\nto his dying day, I'll ask him in the guileless affectionate way that\nused to gravel him so when I inquired how his unborn law-business was\ncoming along, 'Got on her track yet--hey, Pudd'nhead?'\" He wanted to\nlaugh, but that would not have answered; there were people about, and he\nwas mourning for his uncle. He made up his mind that it would be good\nentertainment to look in on Wilson that night and watch him worry over\nhis barren law-case and goad him with an exasperating word or two of\nsympathy and commiseration now and then.\n\nWilson wanted no supper, he had no appetite. He got out all the\nfinger-prints of girls and women in his collection of records and pored\ngloomily over them an hour or more, trying to convince himself that that\ntroublesome girl's marks were there somewhere and had been overlooked.\nBut it was not so. He drew back his chair, clasped his hands over his\nhead, and gave himself up to dull and arid musings.\n\nTom Driscoll dropped in, an hour after dark, and said with a pleasant\nlaugh as he took a seat--\n\n\"Hello, we've gone back to the amusements of our days of neglect and\nobscurity for consolation, have we?\" and he took up one of the glass\nstrips and held it against the light to inspect it. \"Come, cheer up, old\nman; there's no use in losing your grip and going back to this\nchild's-play merely because this big sunspot is drifting across your\nshiny new disk. It'll pass, and you'll be all right again,\"--and he laid\nthe glass down. \"Did you think you could win always?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Wilson, with a sigh, \"I didn't expect that, but I can't\nbelieve Luigi killed your uncle, and I feel very sorry for him. It makes\nme blue. And you would feel as I do, Tom, if you were not prejudiced\nagainst those young fellows.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" and Tom's countenance darkened, for his\nmemory reverted to his kicking; \"I owe them no good will, considering\nthe brunette one's treatment of me that night. Prejudice or no\nprejudice, Pudd'nhead, I don't like them, and when they get their\ndeserts you're not going to find me sitting on the mourner's bench.\"\n\nHe took up another strip of glass, and exclaimed--\n\n\"Why, here's old Roxy's label! Are you going to ornament the royal\npalaces with nigger paw-marks, too? By the date here, I was seven months\nold when this was done, and she was nursing me and her little nigger\ncub. There's a line straight across her thumb-print. How comes that?\"\nand Tom held out the piece of glass to Wilson.\n\n\"That is common,\" said the bored man, wearily. \"Scar of a cut or a\nscratch, usually\"--and he took the strip of glass indifferently, and\nraised it toward the lamp.\n\nAll the blood sunk suddenly out of his face; his hand quaked, and he\ngazed at the polished surface before him with the glassy stare of a\ncorpse.\n\n\"Great Heavens, what's the matter with you, Wilson? Are you going to\nfaint?\"\n\nTom sprang for a glass of water and offered it, but Wilson shrank\nshuddering from him and said--\n\n\"No, no!--take it away!\" His breast was rising and falling, and he moved\nhis head about in a dull and wandering way, like a person who had been\nstunned. Presently he said, \"I shall feel better when I get to bed; I\nhave been overwrought to-day; yes, and over worked for many days.\"\n\n\"Then I'll leave you and let you to get to your rest. Good-night, old\nman.\" But as Tom went out he couldn't deny himself a small parting gibe:\n\"Don't take it so hard; a body can't win every time; you'll hang\nsomebody yet.\"\n\nWilson muttered to himself, \"It is no lie to say I am sorry I have to\nbegin with you, miserable dog though you are!\"\n\nHe braced himself up with a glass of cold whisky, and went to work\nagain. He did not compare the new finger-marks unintentionally left by\nTom a few minutes before on Roxy's glass with the tracings of the marks\nleft on the knife-handle, there being no need for that (for his trained\neye), but busied himself with another matter, muttering from time to\ntime, \"Idiot that I was!--Nothing but a girl would do me--a man in\ngirl's clothes never occurred to me.\" First, he hunted out the plate\ncontaining the finger-prints made by Tom when he was twelve years old,\nand laid it by itself; then he brought forth the marks made by Tom's\nbaby fingers when he was a suckling of seven months, and placed these\ntwo plates with the one containing this subject's newly (and\nunconsciously) made record.\n\n\"Now the series is complete,\" he said with satisfaction, and sat down to\ninspect these things and enjoy them.\n\nBut his enjoyment was brief. He stared a considerable time at the three\nstrips, and seemed stupefied with astonishment. At last he put them down\nand said, \"I can't make it out at all--hang it, the baby's don't tally\nwith the others!\"\n\nHe walked the floor for half an hour puzzling over his enigma, then he\nhunted out two other glass plates.\n\nHe sat down and puzzled over these things a good while, but kept\nmuttering, \"It's no use; I can't understand it. They don't tally right,\nand yet I'll swear the names and dates are right, and so of course they\nought to tally. I never labeled one of these thing carelessly in my\nlife. There is a most extraordinary mystery here.\"\n\nHe was tired out, now, and his brains were beginning to clog. He said he\nwould sleep himself fresh, and then see what he could do with this\nriddle. He slept through a troubled and unrestful hour, then\nunconsciousness began to shred away, and presently he rose drowsily to a\nsitting posture. \"Now what was that dream?\" he said, trying to recall\nit; \"what was that dream?--it seemed to unravel that puz--\"\n\nHe landed in the middle of the floor at a bound, without finishing the\nsentence, and ran and turned up his light and seized his \"records.\" He\ntook a single swift glance at them and cried out--\n\n\"It's so! Heavens, what a revelation! And for twenty-three years no man\nhas ever suspected it!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nDoom.\n\nHe is useless on top of the ground; he ought to be under it, inspiring\nthe cabbages.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nApril 1. This is the day upon which we are reminded of what we are on\nthe other three hundred and sixty-four.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nWilson put on enough clothes for business purposes and went to work\nunder a high pressure of steam. He was awake all over. All sense of\nweariness had been swept away by the invigorating refreshment of the\ngreat and hopeful discovery which he had made. He made fine and accurate\nreproductions of a number of his \"records,\" and then enlarged them on a\nscale of ten to one with his pantograph. He did these pantograph\nenlargements on sheets of white cardboard, and made each individual line\nof the bewildering maze of whorls or curves or loops which constituted\nthe \"pattern,\" of a \"record\" stand out bold and black by reinforcing it\nwith ink. To the untrained eye the collection of delicate originals made\nby the human finger on the glass plates looked about alike; but when\nenlarged ten times they resembled the markings of a block of wood that\nhas been sawed across the grain, and the dullest eye could detect at a\nglance, and at a distance of many feet, that no two of the patterns were\nalike. When Wilson had at last finished his tedious and difficult work,\nhe arranged its results according to a plan in which a progressive order\nand sequence was a principal feature; then he added to the batch several\npantograph enlargements which he had made from time to time in bygone\nyears.\n\nThe night was spent and the day well advanced, now. By the time he had\nsnatched a trifle of breakfast it was nine o'clock, and the court was\nready to begin its sitting. He was in his place twelve minutes later\nwith his \"records.\"\n\nTom Driscoll caught a slight glimpse of the records, and nudged his\nnearest friend and said, with a wink, \"Pudd'nhead's got a rare eye to\nbusiness--thinks that as long as he can't win his case it's at least a\nnoble good chance to advertise his palace-window decorations without any\nexpense.\" Wilson was informed that his witnesses had been delayed, but\nwould arrive presently; but he rose and said he should probably not have\noccasion to make use of their testimony. [An amused murmur ran through\nthe room--\"It's a clean backdown! he gives up without hitting a lick!\"]\nWilson continued--\"I have other testimony--and better. [This compelled\ninterest, and evoked murmurs of surprise that had a detectable\ningredient of disappointment in them.] If I seem to be springing this\nevidence upon the court, I offer as my justification for this, that I\ndid not discover its existence until late last night, and have been\nengaged in examining and classifying it ever since, until half an hour\nago. I shall offer it presently; but first I wish to say a few\npreliminary words.\n\n\"May it please the Court, the claim given the front place, the claim\nmost persistently urged, the claim most strenuously and I may even say\naggressively and defiantly insisted upon by the prosecution, is\nthis--that the person whose hand left the blood-stained finger-prints\nupon the handle of the Indian knife is the person who committed the\nmurder.\" Wilson paused, during several moments, to give impressiveness\nto what he was about to say, and then added tranquilly, \"We grant that\nclaim.\"\n\nIt was an electrical surprise. No one was prepared for such an\nadmission. A buzz of astonishment rose on all sides, and people were\nheard to intimate that the overworked lawyer had lost his mind. Even the\nveteran judge, accustomed as he was to legal ambushes and masked\nbatteries in criminal procedure, was not sure that his ears were not\ndeceiving him, and asked counsel what it was he had said. Howard's\nimpassive face betrayed no sign, but his attitude and bearing lost\nsomething of their careless confidence for a moment. Wilson resumed:\n\n\"We not only grant that claim, but we welcome it and strongly endorse\nit. Leaving that matter for the present, we will now proceed to consider\nother points in the case which we propose to establish by evidence, and\nshall include that one in the chain in its proper place.\"\n\nHe had made up his mind to try a few hardy guesses, in mapping out his\ntheory of the origin and motive of the murder--guesses designed to fill\nup gaps in it--guesses which could help if they hit, and would probably\ndo no harm if they didn't.\n\n\"To my mind, certain circumstances of the case before the court seem to\nsuggest a motive for the homicide quite different from the one insisted\non by the State. It is my conviction that the motive was not revenge,\nbut robbery. It has been urged that the presence of the accused brothers\nin that fatal room, just after notification that one of them must take\nthe life of Judge Driscoll or lose his own the moment the parties should\nmeet, clearly signifies that the natural instinct of self-preservation\nmoved my clients to go there secretly and save Count Luigi by destroying\nhis adversary.\n\n\"Then why did they stay there, after the deed was done? Mrs. Pratt had\ntime, although she did not hear the cry for help, but woke up some\nmoments later, to run to that room--and there she found these men\nstanding and making no effort to escape. If they were guilty, they ought\nto have been running out of the house at the same time that she was\nrunning to that room. If they had had such a strong instinct toward\nself-preservation as to move them to kill that unarmed man, what had\nbecome of it now, when it should have been more alert than ever? Would\nany of us have remained there? Let us not slander our intelligence to\nthat degree.\n\n\"Much stress has been laid upon the fact that the accused offered a very\nlarge reward for the knife with which this murder was done; that no\nthief came forward to claim that extraordinary reward; that the latter\nfact was good circumstantial evidence that the claim that the knife had\nbeen stolen was a vanity and a fraud; that these details taken in\nconnection with the memorable and apparently prophetic speech of the\ndeceased concerning that knife, and the final discovery of that very\nknife in the fatal room where no living person was found present with\nthe slaughtered man but the owner of the knife and his brother, form an\nindestructible chain of evidence which fixes the crime upon those\nunfortunate strangers.\n\n\"But I shall presently ask to be sworn, and shall testify that there was\na large reward offered for the thief, also; and it was offered secretly\nand not advertised; that this fact was indiscreetly mentioned--or at\nleast tacitly admitted--in what was supposed to be safe circumstances,\nbut may not have been. The thief may have been present himself. [Tom\nDriscoll had been looking at the speaker, but dropped his eyes at this\npoint.] In that case he would retain the knife in his possession, not\ndaring to offer it for sale, or for pledge in a pawn-shop. [There was a\nnodding of heads among the audience by way of admission that this was\nnot a bad stroke.] I shall prove to the satisfaction of the jury that\nthere was a person in Judge Driscoll's room several minutes before the\naccused entered it. [This produced a strong sensation; the last\ndrowsy-head in the court-room roused up, now, and made preparation to\nlisten.] If it shall seem necessary, I will prove by the Misses Clarkson\nthat they met a veiled person--ostensibly a woman--coming out of the\nback gate a few minutes after the cry for help was heard. This person\nwas not a woman, but a man dressed in woman's clothes.\" Another\nsensation. Wilson had his eye on Tom when he hazarded this guess, to see\nwhat effect it would produce. He was satisfied with the result, and said\nto himself, \"It was a success--he's hit!\"\n\n\"The object of that person in that house was robbery, not murder. It is\ntrue that the safe was not open, but there was an ordinary tin cash-box\non the table, with three thousand dollars in it. It is easily supposable\nthat the thief was concealed in the house; that he knew of this box, and\nof its owner's habit of counting its contents and arranging his accounts\nat night--if he had that habit, which I do not assert, of course;--that\nhe tried to take the box while its owner slept, but made a noise and was\nseized, and had to use the knife to save himself from capture; and that\nhe fled without his booty because he heard help coming.\n\n\"I have now done with my theory, and will proceed to the evidences by\nwhich I propose to try to prove its soundness.\" Wilson took up several\nof his strips of glass. When the audience recognized these familiar\nmementoes of Pudd'nhead's old-time childish \"puttering\" and folly, the\ntense and funereal interest vanished out of their faces, and the house\nburst into volleys of relieving and refreshing laughter, and Tom chirked\nup and joined in the fun himself; but Wilson was apparently not\ndisturbed. He arranged his records on the table before him, and said--\n\n\"I beg the indulgence of the court while I make a few remarks in\nexplanation of some evidence which I am about to introduce, and which I\nshall presently ask to be allowed to verify under oath on the witness\nstand. Every human being carries with him from his cradle to his grave\ncertain physical marks which do not change their character, and by which\nhe can always be identified--and that without shade of doubt or\nquestion. These marks are his signature, his physiological autograph, so\nto speak, and this autograph can not be counterfeited, nor can he\ndisguise it or hide it away, nor can it become illegible by the wear and\nmutations of time. This signature is not his face--age can change that\nbeyond recognition; it is not his hair, for that can fall out; it is not\nhis height, for duplicates of that exist; it is not his form, for\nduplicates of that exist also, whereas this signature is each man's very\nown--there is no duplicate of it among the swarming populations of the\nglobe! [The audience were interested once more.]\n\n\"This autograph consists of the delicate lines or corrugations with\nwhich Nature marks the insides of the hands and the soles of the feet.\nIf you will look at the balls of your fingers,--you that have very sharp\neyesight,--you will observe that these dainty curving lines lie close\ntogether, like those that indicate the borders of oceans in maps, and\nthat they form various clearly defined patterns, such as arches,\ncircles, long curves, whorls, etc., and that these patterns differ on\nthe different fingers. [Every man in the room had his hand up to the\nlight, now, and his head canted to one side, and was minutely\nscrutinizing the balls of his fingers; there were whispered ejaculations\nof 'Why, it's so--I never noticed that before!'] The patterns on the\nright hand are not the same as those on the left. [Ejaculations of 'Why,\nthat's so, too!'] Taken finger for finger, your patterns differ from\nyour neighbor's. [Comparisons were made all over the house--even the\njudge and jury were absorbed in this curious work.] The patterns of a\ntwin's right hand are not the same as those on his left. One twin's\npatterns are never the same as his fellow-twin's patterns--the jury will\nfind that the patterns upon the finger-balls of the accused follow this\nrule. [An examination of the twins' hands was begun at once.] You have\noften heard of twins who were so exactly alike that when dressed alike\ntheir own parents could not tell them apart. Yet there was never a twin\nborn into this world that did not carry from birth to death a sure\nidentifier in this mysterious and marvelous natal autograph. That once\nknown to you, his fellow-twin could never personate him and deceive\nyou.\"\n\nWilson stopped and stood silent. Inattention dies a quick and sure death\nwhen a speaker does that. The stillness gives warning that something is\ncoming. All palms and finger-balls went down, now, all slouching forms\nstraightened, all heads came up, all eyes were fastened upon Wilson's\nface. He waited yet one, two, three moments, to let his pause complete\nand perfect its spell upon the house; then, when through the profound\nhush he could hear the ticking of the clock on the wall, he put out his\nhand and took the Indian knife by the blade and held it aloft where all\ncould see the sinister spots upon its ivory handle; then he said, in a\nlevel and passionless voice--\n\n\"Upon this haft stands the assassin's natal autograph, written in the\nblood of that helpless and unoffending old man who loved you and whom\nyou all loved. There is but one man in the whole earth whose hand can\nduplicate that crimson sign,\"--he paused and raised his eyes to the\npendulum swinging back and forth,--\"and please God we will produce that\nman in this room before the clock strikes noon!\"\n\nStunned, distraught, unconscious of its own movement, the house half\nrose, as if expecting to see the murderer appear at the door, and a\nbreeze of muttered ejaculations swept the place. \"Order in the\ncourt!--sit down!\" This from the sheriff. He was obeyed, and quiet\nreigned again. Wilson stole a glance at Tom, and said to himself, \"He is\nflying signals of distress, now; even people who despise him are pitying\nhim; they think this is a hard ordeal for a young fellow who has lost\nhis benefactor by so cruel a stroke--and they are right.\" He resumed his\nspeech:\n\n\"For more than twenty years I have amused my compulsory leisure with\ncollecting these curious physical signatures in this town. At my house I\nhave hundreds upon hundreds of them. Each and every one is labelled with\nname and date; not labelled the next day or even the next hour, but in\nthe very minute that the impression was taken. When I go upon the\nwitness stand I will repeat under oath the things which I am now saying.\nI have the finger-prints of the court, the sheriff, and every member of\nthe jury. There is hardly a person in this room, white or black, whose\nnatal signature I cannot produce, and not one of them can so disguise\nhimself that I cannot pick him out from a multitude of his\nfellow-creatures and unerringly identify him by his hands. And if he and\nI should live to be a hundred I could still do it. [The interest of the\naudience was steadily deepening, now.]\n\n\"I have studied some of these signatures so much that I know them as\nwell as the bank cashier knows the autograph of his oldest customer.\nWhile I turn my back now, I beg that several persons will be so good as\nto pass their fingers through their hair, and then press them upon one\nof the panes of the window near the jury, and that among them the\naccused may set their finger-marks. Also, I beg that these\nexperimenters, or others, will set their finger-marks upon another pane,\nand add again the marks of the accused, but not placing them in the same\norder or relation to the other signatures as before--for, by one chance\nin a million, a person might happen upon the right marks by pure\nguess-work once, therefore I wish to be tested twice.\"\n\nHe turned his back, and the two panes were quickly covered with\ndelicately-lined oval spots, but visible only to such persons as could\nget a dark background for them--the foliage of a tree, outside, for\ninstance. Then, upon call, Wilson went to the window, made his\nexamination, and said--\n\n\"This is Count Luigi's right hand; this one, three signatures below, is\nhis left. Here is Count Angelo's right; down here is his left. Now for\nthe other pane: here and here are Count Luigi's, here and here are his\nbrother's.\" He faced about. \"Am I right?\"\n\nA deafening explosion of applause was the answer. The Bench said--\n\n\"This certainly approaches the miraculous!\"\n\nWilson turned to the window again and remarked, pointing with his\nfinger--\n\n\"This is the signature of Mr. Justice Robinson. [Applause.] This, of\nConstable Blake. [Applause.] This, of John Mason, juryman. [Applause.]\nThis, of the sheriff. [Applause.] I cannot name the others, but I have\nthem all at home, named and dated, and could identify them all by my\nfinger-print records.\"\n\nHe moved to his place through a storm of applause--which the sheriff\nstopped, and also made the people sit down, for they were all standing\nand struggling to see, of course. Court, jury, sheriff, and everybody\nhad been too absorbed in observing Wilson's performance to attend to the\naudience earlier.\n\n\"Now, then,\" said Wilson, \"I have here the natal autographs of two\nchildren--thrown up to ten times the natural size by the pantograph, so\nthat any one who can see at all can tell the markings apart at a glance.\nWe will call the children A and B. Here are A's finger-marks, taken at\nthe age of five months. Here they are again, taken at seven months. [Tom\nstarted.] They are alike, you see. Here are B's at five months, and also\nat seven months. They, too, exactly copy each other, but the patterns\nare quite different from A's, you observe. I shall refer to these again\npresently, but we will turn them face down, now.\n\n\"Here, thrown up ten sizes, are the natal autographs of the two persons\nwho are here before you accused of murdering Judge Driscoll. I made\nthese pantograph copies last night, and will so swear when I go upon the\nwitness stand. I ask the jury to compare them with the finger-marks of\nthe accused upon the window panes, and tell the court if they are the\nsame.\"\n\nHe passed a powerful magnifying-glass to the foreman.\n\nOne juryman after another took the cardboard and the glass and made the\ncomparison. Then the foreman said to the judge--\n\n\"Your honor, we are all agreed that they are identical.\"\n\nWilson said to the foreman--\n\n\"Please turn that cardboard face down, and take this one, and compare it\nsearchingly, by the magnifier, with the fatal signature upon the\nknife-handle, and report your finding to the court.\"\n\nAgain the jury made minute examinations, and again reported--\n\n\"We find them to be exactly identical, your honor.\"\n\nWilson turned toward the counsel for the prosecution, and there was a\nclearly recognizable note of warning in his voice when he said--\n\n\"May it please the court, the State has claimed, strenuously and\npersistently, that the blood-stained finger-prints upon that\nknife-handle were left there by the assassin of Judge Driscoll. You have\nheard us grant that claim, and welcome it.\" He turned to the jury:\n\"Compare the finger-prints of the accused with the finger-prints left by\nthe assassin--and report.\"\n\nThe comparison began. As it proceeded, all movement and all sound\nceased, and the deep silence of an absorbed and waiting suspense settled\nupon the house; and when at last the words came--\n\n\"They do not even resemble,\" a thunder-crash of applause followed and\nthe house sprang to its feet, but was quickly repressed by official\nforce and brought to order again. Tom was altering his position every\nfew minutes, now, but none of his changes brought repose nor any small\ntrifle of comfort. When the house's attention was become fixed once\nmore, Wilson said gravely, indicating the twins with a gesture--\n\n\"These men are innocent--I have no further concern with them. [Another\noutbreak of applause began, but was promptly checked.] We will now\nproceed to find the guilty. [Tom's eyes were starting from their\nsockets--yes, it was a cruel day for the bereaved youth, everybody\nthought.] We will return to the infant autographs of A and B. I will ask\nthe jury to take these large pantograph facsimilies of A's marked five\nmonths and seven months. Do they tally?\"\n\nThe foreman responded--\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Now examine this pantograph, taken at eight months, and also marked A.\nDoes it tally with the other two?\"\n\nThe surprised response was--\n\n\"No--they differ widely!\"\n\n\"You are quite right. Now take these two pantographs of B's autograph,\nmarked five months and seven months. Do they tally with each other?\"\n\n\"Yes--perfectly.\"\n\n\"Take this third pantograph marked B, eight months. Does it tally with\nB's other two?\"\n\n\"By no means!\"\n\n\"Do you know how to account for those strange discrepancies? I will tell\nyou. For a purpose unknown to us, but probably a selfish one, somebody\nchanged those children in the cradle.\"\n\nThis produced a vast sensation, naturally; Roxana was astonished at this\nadmirable guess, but not disturbed by it. To guess the exchange was one\nthing, to guess who did it quite another. Pudd'nhead Wilson could do\nwonderful things, no doubt, but he couldn't do impossible ones. Safe?\nShe was perfectly safe. She smiled privately.\n\n\"Between the ages of seven months and eight months those children were\nchanged in the cradle\"--he made one of his effect-collecting pauses, and\nadded--\"and the person who did it is in this house!\"\n\nRoxy's pulses stood still! The house was thrilled as with an electric\nshock, and the people half rose as if to seek a glimpse of the person\nwho had made that exchange. Tom was growing limp; the life seemed oozing\nout of him. Wilson resumed:\n\n\"A was put into B's cradle in the nursery; B was transferred to the\nkitchen and became a negro and a slave, [Sensation--confusion of angry\nejaculations]--but within a quarter of an hour he will stand before you\nwhite and free! [Burst of applause, checked by the officers.] From seven\nmonths onward until now, A has still been a usurper, and in my\nfinger-record he bears B's name. Here is his pantograph at the age of\ntwelve. Compare it with the assassin's signature upon the knife-handle.\nDo they tally?\"\n\nThe foreman answered--\n\n\"To the minutest detail!\"\n\nWilson said, solemnly--\n\n\"The murderer of your friend and mine--York Driscoll of the generous\nhand and the kindly spirit--sits in among you. Valet de Chambre, negro\nand slave,--falsely called Thomas \u00e0 Becket Driscoll,--make upon the\nwindow the finger-prints that will hang you!\"\n\nTom turned his ashen face imploring toward the speaker, made some\nimpotent movements with his white lips, then slid limp and lifeless to\nthe floor.\n\nWilson broke the awed silence with the words--\n\n\"There is no need. He has confessed.\"\n\nRoxy flung herself upon her knees, covered her face with her hands, and\nout through her sobs the words struggled--\n\n\"De Lord have mercy on me, po' misable sinner dat I is!\"\n\nThe clock struck twelve.\n\nThe court rose; the new prisoner, handcuffed, was removed.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is often the case that the man who can't tell a lie thinks he is the\nbest judge of one.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.\n\nOctober 12, the Discovery. It was wonderful to find America, but it\nwould have been more wonderful to miss it.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's\nCalendar.\n\nThe town sat up all night to discuss the amazing events of the day and\nswap guesses as to when Tom's trial would begin. Troop after troop of\ncitizens came to serenade Wilson, and require a speech, and shout\nthemselves hoarse over every sentence that fell from his lips--for all\nhis sentences were golden, now, all were marvelous. His long fight\nagainst hard luck and prejudice was ended; he was a made man for good.\n\nAnd as each of these roaring gangs of enthusiasts marched away, some\nremorseful member of it was quite sure to raise his voice and say--\n\n\"And this is the man the likes of us have called a pudd'nhead for more\nthan twenty years. He has resigned from that position, friends.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it isn't vacant--we're elected.\"\n\nThe twins were heroes of romance, now, and with rehabilitated\nreputations. But they were weary of Western adventure, and straightway\nretired to Europe.\n\nRoxy's heart was broken. The young fellow upon whom she had inflicted\ntwenty-three years of slavery continued the false heir's pension of\nthirty-five dollars a month to her, but her hurts were too deep for\nmoney to heal; the spirit in her eye was quenched, her martial bearing\ndeparted with it, and the voice of her laughter ceased in the land. In\nher church and its affairs she found her only solace.\n\nThe real heir suddenly found himself rich and free, but in a most\nembarrassing situation. He could neither read nor write, and his speech\nwas the basest dialect of the negro quarter. His gait, his attitudes,\nhis gestures, his bearing, his laugh--all were vulgar and uncouth; his\nmanners were the manners of a slave. Money and fine clothes could not\nmend these defects or cover them up; they only made them the more\nglaring and the more pathetic. The poor fellow could not endure the\nterrors of the white man's parlor, and felt at home and at peace nowhere\nbut in the kitchen. The family pew was a misery to him, yet he could\nnevermore enter into the solacing refuge of the \"nigger gallery\"--that\nwas closed to him for good and all. But we cannot follow his curious\nfate further--that would be a long story.\n\nThe false heir made a full confession and was sentenced to imprisonment\nfor life. But now a complication came up. The Percy Driscoll estate was\nin such a crippled shape when its owner died that it could pay only\nsixty per cent. of its great indebtedness, and was settled at that rate.\nBut the creditors came forward, now, and complained that inasmuch as\nthrough an error for which they were in no way to blame the false heir\nwas not inventoried at the time with the rest of the property, great\nwrong and loss had thereby been inflicted upon them. They rightly\nclaimed that \"Tom\" was lawfully their property and had been so for eight\nyears; that they had already lost sufficiently in being deprived of his\nservices during that long period, and ought not to be required to add\nanything to that loss; that if he had been delivered up to them in the\nfirst place, they would have sold him and he could not have murdered\nJudge Driscoll; therefore it was not he that had really committed the\nmurder, the guilt lay with the erroneous inventory. Everybody saw that\nthere was reason in this. Everybody granted that if \"Tom\" were white and\nfree it would be unquestionably right to punish him--it would be no loss\nto anybody; but to shut up a valuable slave for life--that was quite\nanother matter.\n\nAs soon as the Governor understood the case, he pardoned Tom at once,\nand the creditors sold him down the river.\n\nTranscriber's Notes\n\nIntroduction:\n\n1. Background.\n\nWelcome to Project Gutenberg's presentation of Pudd'nhead Wilson. The\nItalian twins in this novel, Luigi and Angelo, were inspired by a real\npair of Italian conjoined twins who toured America in the 1890s. These\nwere Giacomo and Giovanni Battista Tocci.\n\nHomer Plessy was arrested for sitting in a whites-only passenger car on\nJune 7, 1892, and one month later he stood before Judge John Howard\nFerguson to plead his case. Plessy was an octaroon who could easily\n\"pass white.\" Four years later, the Supreme Court condoned \"Separate but\nEqual\" laws in the famous Plessy vs. Ferguson case, which affirmed the\ndecision of Justice Ferguson in local court. These events in 1892\nunfolded as Twain wrote this story, and changed the tale that he ended\nup telling.\n\nArthur Conan Doyle released his best-selling collection of short\nstories, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, on October 14, 1892. The\nstories had already appeared in The Strand Magazine, one each month,\nfrom July 1891 to June 1892. Holmes inspired Twain to add a component of\nforensics to this story.\n\n2. Dialect.\n\nThe soliloquies and conversations in the novel follow some general\nrules. Twain introduced some variations in the spelling of dialect, and\nsometimes the sound of dialect, but the end meaning seems to be the\nsame thing. Below is a table of some of these words, and alternatives\nfound in the text:\n\nDialect used in Pudd'nhead Wilson\n\nEnglish Dialect,        Alternative,    Another\nand     en\nagainst agin,           ag'in,          ag'in'\nbecause 'ca'se\ngoing   gwine,          gwyne\nmore    mo'\nthat    dat\nthe     de\nthen    den\nthere   dere,           dah\nthese   dese\nthey    dey,            deh\nthis    dis\nwas     'uz\nwith    wid\nwhere   whah\n\nThe above table was presented as a foundation which played into the\ndecision to make some emendations, below, that were not authorized by\nTwain in 1899. One curious notation is that there was sometimes\npronounced dere, but also dah. Along the same lines, they most often\nbecame dey, but in one case, deh.\n\n3. This version.\n\nOur version is based on the 1894 publication of this novel in Hartford.\nThis was Twain's original American release of the novel in book form. A\nscanned copy of this book is available through Hathitrust. The book\ncontained some spaces in contractions: I 'll, dat 'll, had n't, could\nn't, dis 'll, 't ain't / t ain't, and dey 'll are some examples. These\nspaces were not retained in our transcription, and are not identified.\nWe did make a few other emendations. These emendations were checked with\nthe 1899 version of Pudd'nhead Wilson published by Harper & Brothers.\n\n4. Notes on emendations.\n\nThe errors on Page 233 and Page 288, were not changed in the 1899 book,\nso the case for making those changes may be found in the Detailed Notes\nsection. The remaining errors were corrected in the 1899 publication,\npresumably authorized by Twain, who essentially made the case for those\nemendations.\n\nIn the HTML version of this e-book, you can place your cursor over the\nfaint silver dotted lines below the changed text to discover the\noriginal text. The Detailed Notes section of these notes describe these\nemendations.\n\n5. Other versions.\n\nPlease note that many print versions of Pudd'nhead Wilson include the\nphrase 'spelling and usage have been brought into conformity with modern\nusage,' and editors have been liberal with their renditions of Twain's\nstory.\n\n6. Detailed notes.\n\nThe Detailed Notes Section also includes issues that have come up during\ntranscription. One common issue is that words are sometimes split into\ntwo lines for spacing purposes in the original text. These words are\nhyphenated in the physical book, but there is a question sometimes as to\nwhether the hyphen should be retained in transcription. The reasons\nbehind some of these decisions are itemized.\n\nProduction Notes Section:\n\n1. Chapter Titles.\n\nThe Chapter Titles, such as Doom in Chapter XXI., were not part of\nTwain's book. They remain from another version of this book. The chapter\ntitles are used in PG's Mark Twain index, so we have retained them.\n\n2. The Author's Note.\n\nThe Author's Note to Those Extraordinary Twins is actually the author's\nintroduction to the novella, Those Extraordinary Twins. Twain originally\nproduced this book with two parts: Pudd'nhead Wilson and Those\nExtraordinary Twins.\n\nProject Gutenberg offers both stories, so we present the Author's Note\nas the Introduction to Those Extraordinary Twins, as Twain intended. If\nyou want to read the Author's Note, please visit the Introduction of our\nproduction of the novella, Those Extraordinary Twins.\n\nDetailed Notes Section:\n\nChapter 1.\n\nOn Page 19, barber-shop was hyphenated between two lines for spacing.\nThe 1899 Harper & Brothers version used \"barber shop\" in this spot. Even\nthough barber-shop cannot be transcribed as such, the assumption is that\nthe 1894 version put in the hyphen by mistake. We transcribed the word\nbarber shop.\n\nChapter 2.\n\nOn Page 34, changed ca'se to 'ca'se, used as dialect for because, in the\nclause: \"but dat's ca'se it's mine.\" The author used 'ca'se eighteen\nother times as dialect for because, and did not use ca'se again.\n\nChapter 3.\n\nOn Page 43, insert missing period after tomb.\n\nChapter 6.\n\nOn Page 81, add a comma after door: \"The twins took a position near the\ndoor the widow stood at Luigi's side, Rowena stood beside Angelo,...\"\n\nChapter 7.\n\nOn Page 88, add a period after fault in the sentence: The Judge laid\nhimself out hospitably to make them have a good time, and if there was a\ndefect anywhere it was not his fault.\n\nChapter 9.\n\nOn Page 114, there is a word missing before the semicolon in the clause:\nTom sprang up and seized a billet of wood and raised   ; the 1899 Harper\n& Brothers version provided the missing word, \"it.\"\n\nChapter 11.\n\nOn Page 131, change dicision to decision in the clause: Luigi reserved\nhis dicision.\n\nOn Page 133, change comma to a period after years in the sentence: \"I\nnever got a chance to try my hand at it, and I may never get a chance;\nand yet if I ever do get it I shall be found ready, for I have kept up\nmy law-studies all these years,\"\n\nOn Page 149, Correct spelling of Cappello to Capello. The surname of the\ntwins was Capello in the letter on page 73, and two other times in\nChapter 6.\n\nChapter 13.\n\nOn Page 167, Change ' to \" in the sentence: \"Why, my boy, you look\ndesolate. Don't take it so hard. Try and forget you have been kicked.'\n\nOn Page 176, ship-shape was hyphenated and split between two lines for\nspacing. The 1899 Harper & Brothers version of the novel used shipshape,\nand so will we.\n\nChapter 14.\n\nOn Page 182, changed period after hatching to question mark in the\nsentence: What could be hatching.\nOn Page 184, remove comma after sha'n't, in the clause: but if he\ndoesn't, I sha'n't, let on.\n\nOn Page 189, low-down is hyphenated and split between two lines for\nspacing. On Page 188, low-down is spelled with a hyphen, and on pages\n241 and 243 low-downest is also hyphenated. There is no occurrence of\nlowdown. We transcribed low-down with a hyphen: like a ornery low-down\nhound!\n\nChapter 16.\nOn Page 216, Changed ? to ! in the sentence: En keep on sayin' it?\n\nChapter 18.\n\nOn Page 229, Changed 'against to against in the clause: with fury\n'against the planter's wife.\n\nOn Page 233, Changed de to den in the clause \"en de good gracious me.\"\nThe author always used den for then, except in this case. De is dialect\nfor the. Twain did not correct this in the 1899 Harper & Brothers\nversion of the novel, but den makes more sense then de. Roxy was\nfloating on the river, and then she cried good gracious me, because she\nspotted the Grand Mogul.\n\nChanged day to dey in two places. The novel used dey as dialect for they\nregularly, and almost consistently, except in two cases. Both cases were\npresumed errata:\n\n\u2022   On Page 232, en day warn't gwine to hurry\n\u2022   On Page 229, en day knows how to whale 'em, too.\n\nChapter 19.\n\nOn Page 253, back-yard is hyphenated and split between two lines for\nspacing. The 1899 Harper & Brothers version of the novel used back-yard,\nand so will we.\n\nChapter 20.\n\nOn Page 273, changed countenence to countenance in the clause: \"I don't\nknow about that,\" and Tom's countenence darkened,...\n\nChapter 21.\n\nOn Page 288, there are two quotes made by the crowd in double quotes.\nTwain did not correct this in the 1899 version of the novel by Harper &\nBrothers. But these lines are surrounded by Wilson's narrative, which is\nalready in double quotes. Therefore, we have used single quotes for the\ntwo remarks from the gallery.\n\n\u2022   'Why, it's so--I never noticed that before!'\n\u2022   'Why, that's so, too!'\n\nConclusion.\n\nOn Page 302, removed in from the sentence: \"But we cannot follow his\ncurious fate further--that in would be a long story.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            "}

He catched me a couple of\ntimes and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him\nor outrun him most of the time.  I didn't want to go to school much\nbefore, but I reckoned I'd go now to spite pap.  That law trial was a\nslow business--appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on\nit; so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the\njudge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding.  Every time he got money\nhe got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and\nevery time he raised Cain he got jailed.  He was just suited--this kind\nof thing was right in his line.\n\nHe got to hanging around the widow's too much and so she told him at last\nthat if he didn't quit using around there she would make trouble for him.\nWell, WASN'T he mad?  He said he would show who was Huck Finn's boss.  So\nhe watched out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and took me\nup the river about three mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the\nIllinois shore where it was woody and there warn't no houses but an old\nlog hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldn't find it if\nyou didn't know where it was.\n\nHe kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off.\nWe lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key\nunder his head nights.  He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon, and we\nfished and hunted, and that was what we lived on.  Every little while he\nlocked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the ferry, and\ntraded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got drunk and\nhad a good time, and licked me.  The widow she found out where I was by\nand by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but pap drove\nhim off with the gun, and it warn't long after that till I was used to\nbeing where I was, and liked it--all but the cowhide part.\n\nIt was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking\nand fishing, and no books nor study.  Two months or more run along, and\nmy clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn't see how I'd ever got\nto like it so well at the widow's, where you had to wash, and eat on a\nplate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever\nbothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the\ntime.  I didn't want to go back no more.  I had stopped cussing, because\nthe widow didn't like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn't\nno objections.  It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it\nall around.\n\nBut by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry, and I couldn't stand\nit. I was all over welts.  He got to going away so much, too, and locking\nme in.  Once he locked me in and was gone three days.  It was dreadful\nlonesome.  I judged he had got drowned, and I wasn't ever going to get\nout any more.  I was scared.  I made up my mind I would fix up some way\nto leave there.  I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but I\ncouldn't find no way.  There warn't a window to it big enough for a dog\nto get through.  I couldn't get up the chimbly; it was too narrow.  The\ndoor was thick, solid oak slabs.  Pap was pretty careful not to leave a\nknife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted\nthe place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time\nat it, because it was about the only way to put in the time.  But this\ntime I found something at last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any\nhandle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof.\nI greased it up and went to work.  There was an old horse-blanket nailed\nagainst the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep\nthe wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out.  I\ngot under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a\nsection of the big bottom log out--big enough to let me through.  Well,\nit was a good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I\nheard pap's gun in the woods.  I got rid of the signs of my work, and\ndropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.\n\nPap warn't in a good humor--so he was his natural self.  He said he was\ndown town, and everything was going wrong.  His lawyer said he reckoned\nhe would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on\nthe trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge\nThatcher knowed how to do it.  And he said people allowed there'd be\nanother trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my\nguardian, and they guessed it would win this time.  This shook me up\nconsiderable, because I didn't want to go back to the widow's any more\nand be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it.  Then the old man\ngot to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of,\nand then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any,\nand after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round,\nincluding a considerable parcel of people which he didn't know the names\nof, and so called them what's-his-name when he got to them, and went\nright along with his cussing.\n\nHe said he would like to see the widow get me.  He said he would watch\nout, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place\nsix or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they\ndropped and they couldn't find me.  That made me pretty uneasy again, but\nonly for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn't stay on hand till he got that\nchance.\n\nThe old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got.\nThere was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,\nammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two\nnewspapers for wadding, besides some tow.  I toted up a load, and went\nback and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest.  I thought it all\nover, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and\ntake to the woods when I run away.  I guessed I wouldn't stay in one\nplace, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and\nhunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor\nthe widow couldn't ever find me any more.  I judged I would saw out and\nleave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would.  I got\nso full of it I didn't notice how long I was staying till the old man\nhollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.\n\nI got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark.  While\nI was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of\nwarmed up, and went to ripping again.  He had been drunk over in town,\nand laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at.  A body\nwould a thought he was Adam--he was just all mud.  Whenever his liquor\nbegun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:\n\n\"Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it's like.\nHere's the law a-standing ready to take a man's son away from him--a\nman's own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and\nall the expense of raising.  Yes, just as that man has got that son\nraised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin' for HIM\nand give him a rest, the law up and goes for him.  And they call THAT\ngovment!  That ain't all, nuther.  The law backs that old Judge Thatcher\nup and helps him to keep me out o' my property.  Here's what the law\ndoes:  The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up'ards, and\njams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round in\nclothes that ain't fitten for a hog. They call that govment!  A man can't\nget his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes I've a mighty notion to\njust leave the country for good and all. Yes, and I TOLD 'em so; I told\nold Thatcher so to his face.  Lots of 'em heard me, and can tell what I\nsaid.  Says I, for two cents I'd leave the blamed country and never come\na-near it agin.  Them's the very words.  I says look at my hat--if you\ncall it a hat--but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till\nit's below my chin, and then it ain't rightly a hat at all, but more like\nmy head was shoved up through a jint o' stove-pipe.  Look at it, says I\n--such a hat for me to wear--one of the wealthiest men in this town if I\ncould git my rights.\n\n\"Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful.  Why, looky here.\nThere was a free nigger there from Ohio--a mulatter, most as white as a\nwhite man.  He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the\nshiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine\nclothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a\nsilver-headed cane--the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State.  And\nwhat do you think?  They said he was a p'fessor in a college, and could\ntalk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything.  And that ain't the\nwust. They said he could VOTE when he was at home.  Well, that let me\nout. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to?  It was 'lection day, and\nI was just about to go and vote myself if I warn't too drunk to get\nthere; but when they told me there was a State in this country where\nthey'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out.  I says I'll never vote agin.\nThem's the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot\nfor all me --I'll never vote agin as long as I live.  And to see the cool\nway of that nigger--why, he wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn't\nshoved him out o' the way.  I says to the people, why ain't this nigger\nput up at auction and sold?--that's what I want to know.  And what do you\nreckon they said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in\nthe State six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet.  There,\nnow--that's a specimen.  They call that a govment that can't sell a free\nnigger till he's been in the State six months.  Here's a govment that\ncalls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a\ngovment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it\ncan take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free\nnigger, and--\"\n\nPap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was\ntaking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and\nbarked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of\nlanguage--mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give the\ntub some, too, all along, here and there.  He hopped around the cabin\nconsiderable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first one\nshin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot\nall of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick.  But it warn't good\njudgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking\nout of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a\nbody's hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there, and\nheld his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had\never done previous.  He said so his own self afterwards.  He had heard\nold Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid over him, too;\nbut I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.\n\nAfter supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for\ntwo drunks and one delirium tremens.  That was always his word.  I judged\nhe would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal the key,\nor saw myself out, one or t'other.  He drank and drank, and tumbled down\non his blankets by and by; but luck didn't run my way.  He didn't go\nsound asleep, but was uneasy.  He groaned and moaned and thrashed around\nthis way and that for a long time.  At last I got so sleepy I couldn't\nkeep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed what I was about\nI was sound asleep, and the candle burning.\n\nI don't know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an\nawful scream and I was up.  There was pap looking wild, and skipping\naround every which way and yelling about snakes.  He said they was\ncrawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say\none had bit him on the cheek--but I couldn't see no snakes.  He started\nand run round and round the cabin, hollering \"Take him off! take him off!\nhe's biting me on the neck!\"  I never see a man look so wild in the eyes.\nPretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled\nover and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and\nstriking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and saying\nthere was devils a-hold of him.  He wore out by and by, and laid still a\nwhile, moaning.  Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound.  I could\nhear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed\nterrible still.  He was laying over by the corner. By and by he raised up\npart way and listened, with his head to one side.  He says, very low:\n\n\"Tramp--tramp--tramp; that's the dead; tramp--tramp--tramp; they're\ncoming after me; but I won't go.  Oh, they're here! don't touch me\n--don't! hands off--they're cold; let go.  Oh, let a poor devil alone!\"\n\nThen he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him\nalone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the\nold pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying.  I could\nhear him through the blanket.\n\nBy and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he\nsee me and went for me.  He chased me round and round the place with a\nclasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,\nand then I couldn't come for him no more.  I begged, and told him I was\nonly Huck; but he laughed SUCH a screechy laugh, and roared and cussed,\nand kept on chasing me up.  Once when I turned short and dodged under his\narm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders, and I\nthought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning, and\nsaved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and dropped down with his\nback against the door, and said he would rest a minute and then kill me.\nHe put his knife under him, and said he would sleep and get strong, and\nthen he would see who was who.\n\nSo he dozed off pretty soon.  By and by I got the old split-bottom chair\nand clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the\ngun.  I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I\nlaid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down\nbehind it to wait for him to stir.  And how slow and still the time did\ndrag along.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\"GIT up!  What you 'bout?\"\n\nI opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was.  It\nwas after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep.  Pap was standing over me\nlooking sour and sick, too.  He says:\n\n\"What you doin' with this gun?\"\n\nI judged he didn't know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:\n\n\"Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you roust me out?\"\n\n\"Well, I tried to, but I couldn't; I couldn't budge you.\"\n\n\"Well, all right.  Don't stand there palavering all day, but out with you\nand see if there's a fish on the lines for breakfast.  I'll be along in a\nminute.\"\n\nHe unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank.  I noticed\nsome pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of\nbark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise.  I reckoned I would have\ngreat times now if I was over at the town.  The June rise used to be\nalways luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes\ncordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts--sometimes a dozen logs\ntogether; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the\nwood-yards and the sawmill.\n\nI went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t'other one out for\nwhat the rise might fetch along.  Well, all at once here comes a canoe;\njust a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding high\nlike a duck.  I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog, clothes and\nall on, and struck out for the canoe.  I just expected there'd be\nsomebody laying down in it, because people often done that to fool folks,\nand when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd raise up and\nlaugh at him.  But it warn't so this time.  It was a drift-canoe sure\nenough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore.  Thinks I, the old man\nwill be glad when he sees this--she's worth ten dollars.  But when I\ngot to shore pap wasn't in sight yet, and as I was running her into a\nlittle creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck\nanother idea:  I judged I'd hide her good, and then, 'stead of taking to\nthe woods when I run off, I'd go down the river about fifty mile and camp\nin one place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot.\n\nIt was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man\ncoming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around\na bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just\ndrawing a bead on a bird with his gun.  So he hadn't seen anything.\n\nWhen he got along I was hard at it taking up a \"trot\" line.  He abused me\na little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and that\nwas what made me so long.  I knowed he would see I was wet, and then he\nwould be asking questions.  We got five catfish off the lines and went\nhome.\n\nWhile we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about\nwore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap\nand the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing\nthan trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you\nsee, all kinds of things might happen.  Well, I didn't see no way for a\nwhile, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of\nwater, and he says:\n\n\"Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you\nhear? That man warn't here for no good.  I'd a shot him.  Next time you\nroust me out, you hear?\"\n\nThen he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been saying\ngive me the very idea I wanted.  I says to myself, I can fix it now so\nnobody won't think of following me.\n\nAbout twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank.  The river\nwas coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the rise.\nBy and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together.  We\nwent out with the skiff and towed it ashore.  Then we had dinner.\nAnybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch\nmore stuff; but that warn't pap's style.  Nine logs was enough for one\ntime; he must shove right over to town and sell.  So he locked me in and\ntook the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.  I\njudged he wouldn't come back that night.  I waited till I reckoned he had\ngot a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that log\nagain.  Before he was t'other side of the river I was out of the hole;\nhim and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.\n\nI took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and\nshoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same\nwith the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug.  I took all the coffee and\nsugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the\nbucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two\nblankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot.  I took fish-lines and\nmatches and other things--everything that was worth a cent.  I cleaned\nout the place.  I wanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the one out\nat the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that.  I fetched\nout the gun, and now I was done.\n\nI had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging\nout so many things.  So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside\nby scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the\nsawdust.  Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two\nrocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up at\nthat place and didn't quite touch ground.  If you stood four or five foot\naway and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never notice it; and\nbesides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't likely anybody\nwould go fooling around there.\n\nIt was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left a track.  I\nfollowed around to see.  I stood on the bank and looked out over the\nriver.  All safe.  So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,\nand was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon\nwent wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms.\nI shot this fellow and took him into camp.\n\nI took the axe and smashed in the door.  I beat it and hacked it\nconsiderable a-doing it.  I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly\nto the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down\non the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,\nand no boards.  Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks\nin it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it\nto the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and\ndown it sunk, out of sight.  You could easy see that something had been\ndragged over the ground.  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he\nwould take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy\ntouches.  Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as\nthat.\n\nWell, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and\nstuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.  Then I took\nup the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't drip)\ntill I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the\nriver.  Now I thought of something else.  So I went and got the bag of\nmeal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.  I\ntook the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom\nof it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the place\n--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.  Then I\ncarried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the\nwillows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and\nfull of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season.  There was a\nslough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles\naway, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river.  The meal sifted\nout and made a little track all the way to the lake.  I dropped pap's\nwhetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by accident.\nThen I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it wouldn't\nleak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.\n\nIt was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some\nwillows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.  I made\nfast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid down in\nthe canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.  I says to myself, they'll\nfollow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the\nriver for me.  And they'll follow that meal track to the lake and go\nbrowsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that\nkilled me and took the things.  They won't ever hunt the river for\nanything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't\nbother no more about me.  All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.\nJackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,\nand nobody ever comes there.  And then I can paddle over to town nights,\nand slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the place.\n\nI was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep.  When I\nwoke up I didn't know where I was for a minute.  I set up and looked\naround, a little scared.  Then I remembered.  The river looked miles and\nmiles across.  The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs\nthat went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from\nshore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and SMELT late.\nYou know what I mean--I don't know the words to put it in.\n\nI took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start\nwhen I heard a sound away over the water.  I listened.  Pretty soon I\nmade it out.  It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from\noars working in rowlocks when it's a still night.  I peeped out through\nthe willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.  I\ncouldn't tell how many was in it.  It kept a-coming, and when it was\nabreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it.  Think's I, maybe\nit's pap, though I warn't expecting him.  He dropped below me with the\ncurrent, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water, and\nhe went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.  Well,\nit WAS pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his oars.\n\nI didn't lose no time.  The next minute I was a-spinning down stream soft\nbut quick in the shade of the bank.  I made two mile and a half, and then\nstruck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river,\nbecause pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and people\nmight see me and hail me.  I got out amongst the driftwood, and then laid\ndown in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.  I laid there, and had\na good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking away into the sky; not a\ncloud in it.  The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back\nin the moonshine; I never knowed it before.  And how far a body can hear\non the water such nights!  I heard people talking at the ferry landing.\nI heard what they said, too--every word of it.  One man said it was\ngetting towards the long days and the short nights now.  T'other one said\nTHIS warn't one of the short ones, he reckoned--and then they laughed,\nand he said it over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up\nanother fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped\nout something brisk, and said let him alone.  The first fellow said he\n'lowed to tell it to his old woman--she would think it was pretty good;\nbut he said that warn't nothing to some things he had said in his time.\nI heard one man say it was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight\nwouldn't wait more than about a week longer.  After that the talk got\nfurther and further away, and I couldn't make out the words any more; but\nI could hear the mumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a\nlong ways off.\n\nI was away below the ferry now.  I rose up, and there was Jackson's\nIsland, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and\nstanding up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like\na steamboat without any lights.  There warn't any signs of the bar at the\nhead--it was all under water now.\n\nIt didn't take me long to get there.  I shot past the head at a ripping\nrate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and\nlanded on the side towards the Illinois shore.  I run the canoe into a\ndeep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow\nbranches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe\nfrom the outside.\n\nI went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked out\non the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three\nmile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.  A monstrous\nbig lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down, with a\nlantern in the middle of it.  I watched it come creeping down, and when\nit was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, \"Stern oars,\nthere! heave her head to stabboard!\"  I heard that just as plain as if\nthe man was by my side.\n\nThere was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and\nlaid down for a nap before breakfast.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight\no'clock.  I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about\nthings, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.  I could\nsee the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all\nabout, and gloomy in there amongst them.  There was freckled places on\nthe ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the\nfreckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little breeze\nup there.  A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very\nfriendly.\n\nI was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn't want to get up and cook\nbreakfast.  Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep\nsound of \"boom!\" away up the river.  I rouses up, and rests on my elbow\nand listens; pretty soon I hears it again.  I hopped up, and went and\nlooked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying on\nthe water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry.  And there was the\nferryboat full of people floating along down.  I knowed what was the\nmatter now.  \"Boom!\" I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's\nside.  You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my\ncarcass come to the top.\n\nI was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,\nbecause they might see the smoke.  So I set there and watched the\ncannon-smoke and listened to the boom.  The river was a mile wide there,\nand it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good\nenough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to\neat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in\nloaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the\ndrownded carcass and stop there.  So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and if\nany of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show.  I changed\nto the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have, and I\nwarn't disappointed.  A big double loaf come along, and I most got it\nwith a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out further.  Of\ncourse I was where the current set in the closest to the shore--I knowed\nenough for that.  But by and by along comes another one, and this time I\nwon.  I took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver,\nand set my teeth in.  It was \"baker's bread\"--what the quality eat; none\nof your low-down corn-pone.\n\nI got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching\nthe bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.  And then\nsomething struck me.  I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson or\nsomebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone and\ndone it.  So there ain't no doubt but there is something in that thing\n--that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the parson\nprays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for only just\nthe right kind.\n\nI lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching.  The\nferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance\nto see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in\nclose, where the bread did.  When she'd got pretty well along down\ntowards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,\nand laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.  Where the\nlog forked I could peep through.\n\nBy and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could a\nrun out a plank and walked ashore.  Most everybody was on the boat.  Pap,\nand Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom Sawyer,\nand his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.  Everybody was\ntalking about the murder, but the captain broke in and says:\n\n\"Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he's\nwashed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge.  I\nhope so, anyway.\"\n\n\"I didn't hope so.  They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly\nin my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.  I could see\nthem first-rate, but they couldn't see me.  Then the captain sung out:\n\n\"Stand away!\" and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it\nmade me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and I\njudged I was gone.  If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'd a\ngot the corpse they was after.  Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to\ngoodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder\nof the island.  I could hear the booming now and then, further and\nfurther off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.  The\nisland was three mile long.  I judged they had got to the foot, and was\ngiving it up.  But they didn't yet a while.  They turned around the foot\nof the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side, under\nsteam, and booming once in a while as they went.  I crossed over to that\nside and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the island they\nquit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the\ntown.\n\nI knowed I was all right now.  Nobody else would come a-hunting after me.\nI got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick\nwoods.  I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under\nso the rain couldn't get at them.  I catched a catfish and haggled him\nopen with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had\nsupper.  Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.\n\nWhen it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well\nsatisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set\non the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the\nstars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;\nthere ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can't\nstay so, you soon get over it.\n\nAnd so for three days and nights.  No difference--just the same thing.\nBut the next day I went exploring around down through the island.  I was\nboss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know all\nabout it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.  I found plenty\nstrawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green\nrazberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.  They\nwould all come handy by and by, I judged.\n\nWell, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't far\nfrom the foot of the island.  I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot\nnothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh home.\nAbout this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it went\nsliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to get\na shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on to\nthe ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.\n\nMy heart jumped up amongst my lungs.  I never waited for to look further,\nbut uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever\nI could.  Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves\nand listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear nothing else.  I\nslunk along another piece further, then listened again; and so on, and so\non.  If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod on a stick and\nbroke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two\nand I only got half, and the short half, too.\n\nWhen I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand in\nmy craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around.  So I got\nall my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight, and I\nput out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last\nyear's camp, and then clumb a tree.\n\nI reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing, I\ndidn't hear nothing--I only THOUGHT I heard and seen as much as a\nthousand things.  Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last I\ngot down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time.\nAll I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast.\n\nBy the time it was night I was pretty hungry.  So when it was good and\ndark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the\nIllinois bank--about a quarter of a mile.  I went out in the woods and\ncooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all\nnight when I hear a PLUNKETY-PLUNK, PLUNKETY-PLUNK, and says to myself,\nhorses coming; and next I hear people's voices.  I got everything into\nthe canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping through the woods\nto see what I could find out.  I hadn't got far when I hear a man say:\n\n\"We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about\nbeat out.  Let's look around.\"\n\nI didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy.  I tied up in the\nold place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.\n\nI didn't sleep much.  I couldn't, somehow, for thinking.  And every time\nI waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.  So the sleep didn't do\nme no good.  By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm\na-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'll\nfind it out or bust.  Well, I felt better right off.\n\nSo I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then\nlet the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.  The moon was shining,\nand outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.  I poked\nalong well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound asleep.\nWell, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.  A little\nripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the\nnight was about done.  I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her\nnose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the\nwoods.  I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the leaves.  I\nsee the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket the river.\nBut in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops, and knowed\nthe day was coming.  So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had\nrun across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen.  But I\nhadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the place.  But by and\nby, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees.  I\nwent for it, cautious and slow.  By and by I was close enough to have a\nlook, and there laid a man on the ground.  It most give me the fantods.\nHe had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire.  I\nset there behind a clump of bushes in about six foot of him, and kept my\neyes on him steady.  It was getting gray daylight now.  Pretty soon he\ngapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss\nWatson's Jim!  I bet I was glad to see him.  I says:\n\n\"Hello, Jim!\" and skipped out.\n\nHe bounced up and stared at me wild.  Then he drops down on his knees,\nand puts his hands together and says:\n\n\"Doan' hurt me--don't!  I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'.  I alwuz\nliked dead people, en done all I could for 'em.  You go en git in de\nriver agin, whah you b'longs, en doan' do nuffn to Ole Jim, 'at 'uz awluz\nyo' fren'.\"\n\nWell, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead.  I was ever so\nglad to see Jim.  I warn't lonesome now.  I told him I warn't afraid of\nHIM telling the people where I was.  I talked along, but he only set\nthere and looked at me; never said nothing.  Then I says:\n\n\"It's good daylight.  Le's get breakfast.  Make up your camp fire good.\"\n\n\"What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich\ntruck? But you got a gun, hain't you?  Den we kin git sumfn better den\nstrawbries.\"\n\n\"Strawberries and such truck,\" I says.  \"Is that what you live on?\"\n\n\"I couldn' git nuffn else,\" he says.\n\n\"Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?\"\n\n\"I come heah de night arter you's killed.\"\n\n\"What, all that time?\"\n\n\"Yes--indeedy.\"\n\n\"And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?\"\n\n\"No, sah--nuffn else.\"\n\n\"Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?\"\n\n\"I reck'n I could eat a hoss.  I think I could. How long you ben on de\nislan'?\"\n\n\"Since the night I got killed.\"\n\n\"No!  W'y, what has you lived on?  But you got a gun.  Oh, yes, you got a\ngun.  Dat's good.  Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire.\"\n\nSo we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a\ngrassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee,\nand coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was\nset back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with\nwitchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with\nhis knife, and fried him.\n\nWhen breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.\nJim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved.  Then\nwhen we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.  By and by\nJim says:\n\n\"But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef it\nwarn't you?\"\n\nThen I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart.  He said Tom\nSawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what I had.  Then I says:\n\n\"How do you come to be here, Jim, and how'd you get here?\"\n\nHe looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute.  Then he\nsays:\n\n\"Maybe I better not tell.\"\n\n\"Why, Jim?\"\n\n\"Well, dey's reasons.  But you wouldn' tell on me ef I uz to tell you,\nwould you, Huck?\"\n\n\"Blamed if I would, Jim.\"\n\n\"Well, I b'lieve you, Huck.  I--I RUN OFF.\"\n\n\"Jim!\"\n\n\"But mind, you said you wouldn' tell--you know you said you wouldn' tell,\nHuck.\"\n\n\"Well, I did.  I said I wouldn't, and I'll stick to it.  Honest INJUN, I\nwill.  People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for\nkeeping mum--but that don't make no difference.  I ain't a-going to tell,\nand I ain't a-going back there, anyways.  So, now, le's know all about\nit.\"\n\n\"Well, you see, it 'uz dis way.  Ole missus--dat's Miss Watson--she pecks\non me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she\nwouldn' sell me down to Orleans.  But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader\nroun' de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy.  Well, one\nnight I creeps to de do' pooty late, en de do' warn't quite shet, en I\nhear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but\nshe didn' want to, but she could git eight hund'd dollars for me, en it\n'uz sich a big stack o' money she couldn' resis'.  De widder she try to\ngit her to say she wouldn' do it, but I never waited to hear de res'.  I\nlit out mighty quick, I tell you.\n\n\"I tuck out en shin down de hill, en 'spec to steal a skift 'long de sho'\nsom'ers 'bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de\nole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go 'way.\nWell, I wuz dah all night.  Dey wuz somebody roun' all de time.  'Long\n'bout six in de mawnin' skifts begin to go by, en 'bout eight er nine\nevery skift dat went 'long wuz talkin' 'bout how yo' pap come over to de\ntown en say you's killed.  Dese las' skifts wuz full o' ladies en genlmen\na-goin' over for to see de place.  Sometimes dey'd pull up at de sho' en\ntake a res' b'fo' dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to know all\n'bout de killin'.  I 'uz powerful sorry you's killed, Huck, but I ain't\nno mo' now.\n\n\"I laid dah under de shavin's all day.  I 'uz hungry, but I warn't\nafeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin' to start to de\ncamp-meet'n' right arter breakfas' en be gone all day, en dey knows I\ngoes off wid de cattle 'bout daylight, so dey wouldn' 'spec to see me\nroun' de place, en so dey wouldn' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin'.\nDe yuther servants wouldn' miss me, kase dey'd shin out en take holiday\nsoon as de ole folks 'uz out'n de way.\n\n\"Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went 'bout two\nmile er more to whah dey warn't no houses.  I'd made up my mine 'bout\nwhat I's agwyne to do.  You see, ef I kep' on tryin' to git away afoot,\nde dogs 'ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey'd miss dat\nskift, you see, en dey'd know 'bout whah I'd lan' on de yuther side, en\nwhah to pick up my track.  So I says, a raff is what I's arter; it doan'\nMAKE no track.\n\n\"I see a light a-comin' roun' de p'int bymeby, so I wade' in en shove' a\nlog ahead o' me en swum more'n half way acrost de river, en got in\n'mongst de drift-wood, en kep' my head down low, en kinder swum agin de\ncurrent tell de raff come along.  Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck\na-holt.  It clouded up en 'uz pooty dark for a little while.  So I clumb\nup en laid down on de planks.  De men 'uz all 'way yonder in de middle,\nwhah de lantern wuz.  De river wuz a-risin', en dey wuz a good current;\nso I reck'n'd 'at by fo' in de mawnin' I'd be twenty-five mile down de\nriver, en den I'd slip in jis b'fo' daylight en swim asho', en take to\nde woods on de Illinois side.\n\n\"But I didn' have no luck.  When we 'uz mos' down to de head er de islan'\na man begin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it warn't no use fer to\nwait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan'.  Well, I had a\nnotion I could lan' mos' anywhers, but I couldn't--bank too bluff.  I 'uz\nmos' to de foot er de islan' b'fo' I found' a good place.  I went into de\nwoods en jedged I wouldn' fool wid raffs no mo', long as dey move de\nlantern roun' so.  I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en some matches in\nmy cap, en dey warn't wet, so I 'uz all right.\"\n\n\"And so you ain't had no meat nor bread to eat all this time?  Why didn't\nyou get mud-turkles?\"\n\n\"How you gwyne to git 'm?  You can't slip up on um en grab um; en how's a\nbody gwyne to hit um wid a rock?  How could a body do it in de night?  En\nI warn't gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime.\"\n\n\"Well, that's so.  You've had to keep in the woods all the time, of\ncourse. Did you hear 'em shooting the cannon?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.  I knowed dey was arter you.  I see um go by heah--watched um\nthoo de bushes.\"\n\nSome young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting.\nJim said it was a sign it was going to rain.  He said it was a sign when\nyoung chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way when\nyoung birds done it.  I was going to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn't\nlet me.  He said it was death.  He said his father laid mighty sick once,\nand some of them catched a bird, and his old granny said his father would\ndie, and he did.\n\nAnd Jim said you mustn't count the things you are going to cook for\ndinner, because that would bring bad luck.  The same if you shook the\ntable-cloth after sundown.  And he said if a man owned a beehive and that\nman died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning, or\nelse the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die.  Jim said bees\nwouldn't sting idiots; but I didn't believe that, because I had tried\nthem lots of times myself, and they wouldn't sting me.\n\nI had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them.  Jim\nknowed all kinds of signs.  He said he knowed most everything.  I said it\nlooked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if\nthere warn't any good-luck signs.  He says:\n\n\"Mighty few--an' DEY ain't no use to a body.  What you want to know when\ngood luck's a-comin' for?  Want to keep it off?\"  And he said:  \"Ef you's\ngot hairy arms en a hairy breas', it's a sign dat you's agwyne to be\nrich. Well, dey's some use in a sign like dat, 'kase it's so fur ahead.\nYou see, maybe you's got to be po' a long time fust, en so you might git\ndiscourage' en kill yo'sef 'f you didn' know by de sign dat you gwyne to\nbe rich bymeby.\"\n\n\"Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?\"\n\n\"What's de use to ax dat question?  Don't you see I has?\"\n\n\"Well, are you rich?\"\n\n\"No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin.  Wunst I had foteen\ndollars, but I tuck to specalat'n', en got busted out.\"\n\n\"What did you speculate in, Jim?\"\n\n\"Well, fust I tackled stock.\"\n\n\"What kind of stock?\"\n\n\"Why, live stock--cattle, you know.  I put ten dollars in a cow.  But I\nain' gwyne to resk no mo' money in stock.  De cow up 'n' died on my\nhan's.\"\n\n\"So you lost the ten dollars.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't lose it all.  I on'y los' 'bout nine of it.  I sole de hide\nen taller for a dollar en ten cents.\"\n\n\"You had five dollars and ten cents left.  Did you speculate any more?\"\n\n\"Yes.  You know that one-laigged nigger dat b'longs to old Misto Bradish?\nWell, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar would git fo'\ndollars mo' at de en' er de year.  Well, all de niggers went in, but dey\ndidn't have much.  I wuz de on'y one dat had much.  So I stuck out for\nmo' dan fo' dollars, en I said 'f I didn' git it I'd start a bank mysef.\nWell, o' course dat nigger want' to keep me out er de business, bekase he\nsays dey warn't business 'nough for two banks, so he say I could put in\nmy five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en' er de year.\n\n\"So I done it.  Den I reck'n'd I'd inves' de thirty-five dollars right\noff en keep things a-movin'.  Dey wuz a nigger name' Bob, dat had ketched\na wood-flat, en his marster didn' know it; en I bought it off'n him en\ntold him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en' er de year come; but\nsomebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex day de one-laigged nigger\nsay de bank's busted.  So dey didn' none uv us git no money.\"\n\n\"What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?\"\n\n\"Well, I 'uz gwyne to spen' it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me to\ngive it to a nigger name' Balum--Balum's Ass dey call him for short; he's\none er dem chuckleheads, you know.  But he's lucky, dey say, en I see I\nwarn't lucky.  De dream say let Balum inves' de ten cents en he'd make a\nraise for me.  Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in church he\nhear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po' len' to de Lord, en boun'\nto git his money back a hund'd times.  So Balum he tuck en give de ten\ncents to de po', en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to come of it.\"\n\n\"Well, what did come of it, Jim?\"\n\n\"Nuffn never come of it.  I couldn' manage to k'leck dat money no way; en\nBalum he couldn'.  I ain' gwyne to len' no mo' money 'dout I see de\nsecurity.  Boun' to git yo' money back a hund'd times, de preacher says!\nEf I could git de ten CENTS back, I'd call it squah, en be glad er de\nchanst.\"\n\n\"Well, it's all right anyway, Jim, long as you're going to be rich again\nsome time or other.\"\n\n\"Yes; en I's rich now, come to look at it.  I owns mysef, en I's wuth\neight hund'd dollars.  I wisht I had de money, I wouldn' want no mo'.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nI WANTED to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island\nthat I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,\nbecause the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile\nwide.\n\nThis place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot\nhigh. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and\nthe bushes so thick.  We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by and\nby found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the side\ntowards Illinois.  The cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched\ntogether, and Jim could stand up straight in it.  It was cool in there.\nJim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we didn't\nwant to be climbing up and down there all the time.\n\nJim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps\nin the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,\nand they would never find us without dogs.  And, besides, he said them\nlittle birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to\nget wet?\n\nSo we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and\nlugged all the traps up there.  Then we hunted up a place close by to\nhide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.  We took some fish off of\nthe lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.\n\nThe door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one\nside of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a\ngood place to build a fire on.  So we built it there and cooked dinner.\n\nWe spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.\nWe put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.  Pretty soon\nit darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was right\nabout it.  Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury, too,\nand I never see the wind blow so.  It was one of these regular summer\nstorms.  It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black outside, and\nlovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a\nlittle ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would come a blast of\nwind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the\nleaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set\nthe branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild; and next,\nwhen it was just about the bluest and blackest--FST! it was as bright as\nglory, and you'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away\noff yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards further than you could see\nbefore; dark as sin again in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let\ngo with an awful crash, and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down\nthe sky towards the under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels\ndown stairs--where it's long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you\nknow.\n\n\"Jim, this is nice,\" I says.  \"I wouldn't want to be nowhere else but\nhere. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.\"\n\n\"Well, you wouldn't a ben here 'f it hadn't a ben for Jim.  You'd a ben\ndown dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn' mos' drownded, too; dat\nyou would, honey.  Chickens knows when it's gwyne to rain, en so do de\nbirds, chile.\"\n\nThe river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at\nlast it was over the banks.  The water was three or four foot deep on the\nisland in the low places and on the Illinois bottom.  On that side it was\na good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same old\ndistance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore was just a\nwall of high bluffs.\n\nDaytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool\nand shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.  We\nwent winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung\nso thick we had to back away and go some other way.  Well, on every old\nbroken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and\nwhen the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on\naccount of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand\non them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would\nslide off in the water.  The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.\nWe could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them.\n\nOne night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.\nIt was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and the\ntop stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor.  We\ncould see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;\nwe didn't show ourselves in daylight.\n\nAnother night when we was up at the head of the island, just before\ndaylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.  She was a\ntwo-story, and tilted over considerable.  We paddled out and got aboard\n--clumb in at an upstairs window.  But it was too dark to see yet, so we\nmade the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.\n\nThe light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.  Then we\nlooked in at the window.  We could make out a bed, and a table, and two\nold chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there was\nclothes hanging against the wall.  There was something laying on the\nfloor in the far corner that looked like a man.  So Jim says:\n\n\"Hello, you!\"\n\nBut it didn't budge.  So I hollered again, and then Jim says:\n\n\"De man ain't asleep--he's dead.  You hold still--I'll go en see.\"\n\nHe went, and bent down and looked, and says:\n\n\"It's a dead man.  Yes, indeedy; naked, too.  He's ben shot in de back.\nI reck'n he's ben dead two er three days.  Come in, Huck, but doan' look\nat his face--it's too gashly.\"\n\nI didn't look at him at all.  Jim throwed some old rags over him, but he\nneedn't done it; I didn't want to see him.  There was heaps of old greasy\ncards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles, and a\ncouple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls was the\nignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.  There was two\nold dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some women's underclothes\nhanging against the wall, and some men's clothing, too.  We put the lot\ninto the canoe--it might come good.  There was a boy's old speckled straw\nhat on the floor; I took that, too.  And there was a bottle that had had\nmilk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck.  We would a took\nthe bottle, but it was broke.  There was a seedy old chest, and an old\nhair trunk with the hinges broke.  They stood open, but there warn't\nnothing left in them that was any account.  The way things was scattered\nabout we reckoned the people left in a hurry, and warn't fixed so as to\ncarry off most of their stuff.\n\nWe got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and a\nbran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow\ncandles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty\nold bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and\nbeeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet\nand some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some\nmonstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,\nand a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label on\nthem; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb, and\nJim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg.  The straps was\nbroke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though it\nwas too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find the\nother one, though we hunted all around.\n\nAnd so, take it all around, we made a good haul.  When we was ready to\nshove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty\nbroad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the\nquilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways\noff.  I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most a half\na mile doing it.  I crept up the dead water under the bank, and hadn't no\naccidents and didn't see nobody.  We got home all safe.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nAFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he\ncome to be killed, but Jim didn't want to.  He said it would fetch bad\nluck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha'nt us; he said a man\nthat warn't buried was more likely to go a-ha'nting around than one that\nwas planted and comfortable.  That sounded pretty reasonable, so I didn't\nsay no more; but I couldn't keep from studying over it and wishing I\nknowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.\n\nWe rummaged the clothes we'd got, and found eight dollars in silver sewed\nup in the lining of an old blanket overcoat.  Jim said he reckoned the\npeople in that house stole the coat, because if they'd a knowed the money\nwas there they wouldn't a left it.  I said I reckoned they killed him,\ntoo; but Jim didn't want to talk about that.  I says:\n\n\"Now you think it's bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the\nsnake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday?\nYou said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin\nwith my hands.  Well, here's your bad luck!  We've raked in all this\ntruck and eight dollars besides.  I wish we could have some bad luck like\nthis every day, Jim.\"\n\n\"Never you mind, honey, never you mind.  Don't you git too peart.  It's\na-comin'.  Mind I tell you, it's a-comin'.\"\n\nIt did come, too.  It was a Tuesday that we had that talk.  Well, after\ndinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the\nridge, and got out of tobacco.  I went to the cavern to get some, and\nfound a rattlesnake in there.  I killed him, and curled him up on the\nfoot of Jim's blanket, ever so natural, thinking there'd be some fun when\nJim found him there.  Well, by night I forgot all about the snake, and\nwhen Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the\nsnake's mate was there, and bit him.\n\nHe jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the\nvarmint curled up and ready for another spring.  I laid him out in a\nsecond with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap's whisky-jug and begun to pour\nit down.\n\nHe was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel.  That all\ncomes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave\na dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it.  Jim told\nme to chop off the snake's head and throw it away, and then skin the body\nand roast a piece of it.  I done it, and he eat it and said it would help\ncure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist,\ntoo.  He said that that would help.  Then I slid out quiet and throwed\nthe snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn't going to let Jim\nfind out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.\n\nJim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head\nand pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went\nto sucking at the jug again.  His foot swelled up pretty big, and so did\nhis leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was\nall right; but I'd druther been bit with a snake than pap's whisky.\n\nJim was laid up for four days and nights.  Then the swelling was all gone\nand he was around again.  I made up my mind I wouldn't ever take a-holt\nof a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it.\nJim said he reckoned I would believe him next time.  And he said that\nhandling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't got to\nthe end of it yet.  He said he druther see the new moon over his left\nshoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his\nhand.  Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I've always\nreckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of\nthe carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.  Old Hank Bunker\ndone it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he got\ndrunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so that he\nwas just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him edgeways\nbetween two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so they say, but\nI didn't see it.  Pap told me.  But anyway it all come of looking at the\nmoon that way, like a fool.\n\nWell, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks\nagain; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks\nwith a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a\nman, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds.\nWe couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois.  We\njust set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded.  We\nfound a brass button in his stomach and a round ball, and lots of\nrubbage.  We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there was a spool\nin it.  Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to coat it over so and\nmake a ball of it.  It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the\nMississippi, I reckon.  Jim said he hadn't ever seen a bigger one.  He\nwould a been worth a good deal over at the village.  They peddle out such\na fish as that by the pound in the market-house there; everybody buys\nsome of him; his meat's as white as snow and makes a good fry.\n\nNext morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a\nstirring up some way.  I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and\nfind out what was going on.  Jim liked that notion; but he said I must go\nin the dark and look sharp.  Then he studied it over and said, couldn't I\nput on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?  That was a good\nnotion, too.  So we shortened up one of the calico gowns, and I turned up\nmy trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.  Jim hitched it behind with\nthe hooks, and it was a fair fit.  I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it\nunder my chin, and then for a body to look in and see my face was like\nlooking down a joint of stove-pipe.  Jim said nobody would know me, even\nin the daytime, hardly.  I practiced around all day to get the hang of\nthe things, and by and by I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said I\ndidn't walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to\nget at my britches-pocket.  I took notice, and done better.\n\nI started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.\n\nI started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and\nthe drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town.  I tied\nup and started along the bank.  There was a light burning in a little\nshanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time, and I wondered who had\ntook up quarters there.  I slipped up and peeped in at the window.  There\nwas a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was\non a pine table.  I didn't know her face; she was a stranger, for you\ncouldn't start a face in that town that I didn't know.  Now this was\nlucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had come; people\nmight know my voice and find me out.  But if this woman had been in such\na little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know; so I\nknocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn't forget I was a girl.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

All the\nother parts are but members, important in themselves, yet more important\nin their relations to this.  Exclusive of the Lake basin and of 300,000\nsquare miles in Texas and New Mexico, which in many aspects form a part\nof it, this basin contains about 1,250,000 square miles.  In extent it\nis the second great valley of the world, being exceeded only by that of\nthe Amazon. The valley of the frozen Obi approaches it in extent; that\nof La Plata comes next in space, and probably in habitable capacity,\nhaving about eight-ninths of its area; then comes that of the Yenisei,\nwith about seven-ninths; the Lena, Amoor, Hoang-ho, Yang-tse-kiang, and\nNile, five-ninths; the Ganges, less than one-half; the Indus, less than\none-third; the Euphrates, one-fifth; the Rhine, one-fifteenth. It\nexceeds in extent the whole of Europe, exclusive of Russia, Norway, and\nSweden. IT WOULD CONTAIN AUSTRIA FOUR TIMES, GERMANY OR SPAIN FIVE\nTIMES, FRANCE SIX TIMES, THE BRITISH ISLANDS OR ITALY TEN TIMES.\nConceptions formed from the river-basins of Western Europe are rudely\nshocked when we consider the extent of the valley of the Mississippi;\nnor are those formed from the sterile basins of the great rivers of\nSiberia, the lofty plateaus of Central Asia, or the mighty sweep of the\nswampy Amazon more adequate. Latitude, elevation, and rainfall all\ncombine to render every part of the Mississippi Valley capable of\nsupporting a dense population. AS A DWELLING-PLACE FOR CIVILIZED MAN IT\nIS BY FAR THE FIRST UPON OUR GLOBE.\n\nEDITOR'S TABLE, HARPER'S MAGAZINE, FEBRUARY 1863\n\n\n\nChapter 1 The River and Its History\n\nTHE Mississippi is well worth reading about.  It is not a commonplace\nriver, but on the contrary is in all ways remarkable. Considering the\nMissouri its main branch, it is the longest river in the world--four\nthousand three hundred miles. It seems safe to say that it is also the\ncrookedest river in the world, since in one part of its journey it uses\nup one thousand three hundred miles to cover the same ground that the\ncrow would fly over in six hundred and seventy-five. It discharges three\ntimes as much water as the St. Lawrence, twenty-five times as much as\nthe Rhine, and three hundred and thirty-eight times as much as the\nThames. No other river has so vast a drainage-basin:  it draws its water\nsupply from twenty-eight States and Territories; from Delaware, on the\nAtlantic seaboard, and from all the country between that and Idaho on\nthe Pacific slope--a spread of forty-five degrees of longitude. The\nMississippi receives and carries to the Gulf water from fifty-four\nsubordinate rivers that are navigable by steamboats, and from some\nhundreds that are navigable by flats and keels. The area of its\ndrainage-basin is as great as the combined areas of England, Wales,\nScotland, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Italy, and\nTurkey; and almost all this wide region is fertile; the Mississippi\nvalley, proper, is exceptionally so.\n\nIt is a remarkable river in this:  that instead of widening toward its\nmouth, it grows narrower; grows narrower and deeper.  From the junction\nof the Ohio to a point half way down to the sea, the width averages a\nmile in high water: thence to the sea the width steadily diminishes,\nuntil, at the 'Passes,' above the mouth, it is but little over half a\nmile.  At the junction of the Ohio the Mississippi's depth is eighty-\nseven feet; the depth increases gradually, reaching one hundred and\ntwenty-nine just above the mouth.\n\nThe difference in rise and fall is also remarkable--not in the upper,\nbut in the lower river.  The rise is tolerably uniform down to Natchez\n(three hundred and sixty miles above the mouth)--about fifty feet. But\nat Bayou La Fourche the river rises only twenty-four feet; at New\nOrleans only fifteen, and just above the mouth only two and one half.\n\nAn article in the New Orleans 'Times-Democrat,' based upon reports of\nable engineers, states that the river annually empties four hundred and\nsix million tons of mud into the Gulf of Mexico--which brings to mind\nCaptain Marryat's rude name for the Mississippi--'the Great Sewer.' This\nmud, solidified, would make a mass a mile square and two hundred and\nforty-one feet high.\n\nThe mud deposit gradually extends the land--but only gradually; it has\nextended it not quite a third of a mile in the two hundred years which\nhave elapsed since the river took its place in history. The belief of\nthe scientific people is, that the mouth used to be at Baton Rouge,\nwhere the hills cease, and that the two hundred miles of land between\nthere and the Gulf was built by the river. This gives us the age of that\npiece of country, without any trouble at all--one hundred and twenty\nthousand years. Yet it is much the youthfullest batch of country that\nlies around there anywhere.\n\nThe Mississippi is remarkable in still another way--its disposition to\nmake prodigious jumps by cutting through narrow necks of land, and thus\nstraightening and shortening itself. More than once it has shortened\nitself thirty miles at a single jump!  These cut-offs have had curious\neffects: they have thrown several river towns out into the rural\ndistricts, and built up sand bars and forests in front of them. The town\nof Delta used to be three miles below Vicksburg: a recent cutoff has\nradically changed the position, and Delta is now TWO MILES ABOVE\nVicksburg.\n\nBoth of these river towns have been retired to the country by that cut-\noff. A cut-off plays havoc with boundary lines and jurisdictions: for\ninstance, a man is living in the State of Mississippi to-day, a cut-off\noccurs to-night, and to-morrow the man finds himself and his land over\non the other side of the river, within the boundaries and subject to the\nlaws of the State of Louisiana! Such a thing, happening in the upper\nriver in the old times, could have transferred a slave from Missouri to\nIllinois and made a free man of him.\n\nThe Mississippi does not alter its locality by cut-offs alone: it is\nalways changing its habitat BODILY--is always moving bodily SIDEWISE. At\nHard Times, La., the river is two miles west of the region it used to\noccupy.  As a result, the original SITE of that settlement is not now in\nLouisiana at all, but on the other side of the river, in the State of\nMississippi.  NEARLY THE WHOLE OF THAT ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED MILES\nOF OLD MISSISSIPPI RIVER WHICH LA SALLE FLOATED DOWN IN HIS CANOES, TWO\nHUNDRED YEARS AGO, IS GOOD SOLID DRY GROUND NOW. The river lies to the\nright of it, in places, and to the left of it in other places.\n\nAlthough the Mississippi's mud builds land but slowly, down at the\nmouth, where the Gulfs billows interfere with its work, it builds fast\nenough in better protected regions higher up: for instance, Prophet's\nIsland contained one thousand five hundred acres of land thirty years\nago; since then the river has added seven hundred acres to it.\n\nBut enough of these examples of the mighty stream's eccentricities for\nthe present--I will give a few more of them further along in the book.\n\nLet us drop the Mississippi's physical history, and say a word about its\nhistorical history--so to speak.  We can glance briefly at its slumbrous\nfirst epoch in a couple of short chapters; at its second and wider-awake\nepoch in a couple more; at its flushest and widest-awake epoch in a good\nmany succeeding chapters; and then talk about its comparatively tranquil\npresent epoch in what shall be left of the book.\n\nThe world and the books are so accustomed to use, and over-use, the word\n'new' in connection with our country, that we early get and permanently\nretain the impression that there is nothing old about it. We do of\ncourse know that there are several comparatively old dates in American\nhistory, but the mere figures convey to our minds no just idea, no\ndistinct realization, of the stretch of time which they represent. To\nsay that De Soto, the first white man who ever saw the Mississippi\nRiver, saw it in 1542, is a remark which states a fact without\ninterpreting it: it is something like giving the dimensions of a sunset\nby astronomical measurements, and cataloguing the colors by their\nscientific names;--as a result, you get the bald fact of the sunset, but\nyou don't see the sunset. It would have been better to paint a picture\nof it.\n\nThe date 1542, standing by itself, means little or nothing to us; but\nwhen one groups a few neighboring historical dates and facts around it,\nhe adds perspective and color, and then realizes that this is one of the\nAmerican dates which is quite respectable for age.\n\nFor instance, when the Mississippi was first seen by a white man, less\nthan a quarter of a century had elapsed since Francis I.'s defeat at\nPavia; the death of Raphael; the death of Bayard, SANS PEUR ET SANS\nREPROCHE; the driving out of the Knights-Hospitallers from Rhodes by the\nTurks; and the placarding of the Ninety-Five Propositions,--the act\nwhich began the Reformation.  When De Soto took his glimpse of the\nriver, Ignatius Loyola was an obscure name; the order of the Jesuits was\nnot yet a year old; Michael Angelo's paint was not yet dry on the Last\nJudgment in the Sistine Chapel; Mary Queen of Scots was not yet born,\nbut would be before the year closed.  Catherine de Medici was a child;\nElizabeth of England was not yet in her teens; Calvin, Benvenuto\nCellini, and the Emperor Charles V. were at the top of their fame, and\neach was manufacturing history after his own peculiar fashion; Margaret\nof Navarre was writing the 'Heptameron' and some religious books,--the\nfirst survives, the others are forgotten, wit and indelicacy being\nsometimes better literature preservers than holiness; lax court morals\nand the absurd chivalry business were in full feather, and the joust and\nthe tournament were the frequent pastime of titled fine gentlemen who\ncould fight better than they could spell, while religion was the passion\nof their ladies, and classifying their offspring into children of full\nrank and children by brevet their pastime. In fact, all around, religion\nwas in a peculiarly blooming condition: the Council of Trent was being\ncalled; the Spanish Inquisition was roasting, and racking, and burning,\nwith a free hand; elsewhere on the continent the nations were being\npersuaded to holy living by the sword and fire; in England, Henry VIII.\nhad suppressed the monasteries, burnt Fisher and another bishop or two,\nand was getting his English reformation and his harem effectively\nstarted.  When De Soto stood on the banks of the Mississippi, it was\nstill two years before Luther's death; eleven years before the burning\nof Servetus; thirty years before the St. Bartholomew slaughter; Rabelais\nwas not yet published; 'Don Quixote' was not yet written; Shakespeare\nwas not yet born; a hundred long years must still elapse before\nEnglishmen would hear the name of Oliver Cromwell.\n\nUnquestionably the discovery of the Mississippi is a datable fact which\nconsiderably mellows and modifies the shiny newness of our country, and\ngives her a most respectable outside-aspect of rustiness and antiquity.\n\nDe Soto merely glimpsed the river, then died and was buried in it by his\npriests and soldiers.  One would expect the priests and the soldiers to\nmultiply the river's dimensions by ten--the Spanish custom of the day--\nand thus move other adventurers to go at once and explore it.  On the\ncontrary, their narratives when they reached home, did not excite that\namount of curiosity. The Mississippi was left unvisited by whites during\na term of years which seems incredible in our energetic days. One may\n'sense' the interval to his mind, after a fashion, by dividing it up in\nthis way:  After De Soto glimpsed the river, a fraction short of a\nquarter of a century elapsed, and then Shakespeare was born; lived a\ntrifle more than half a century, then died; and when he had been in his\ngrave considerably more than half a century, the SECOND white man saw\nthe Mississippi. In our day we don't allow a hundred and thirty years to\nelapse between glimpses of a marvel.  If somebody should discover a\ncreek in the county next to the one that the North Pole is in, Europe\nand America would start fifteen costly expeditions thither: one to\nexplore the creek, and the other fourteen to hunt for each other.\n\nFor more than a hundred and fifty years there had been white settlements\non our Atlantic coasts.  These people were in intimate communication\nwith the Indians:  in the south the Spaniards were robbing,\nslaughtering, enslaving and converting them; higher up, the English were\ntrading beads and blankets to them for a consideration, and throwing in\ncivilization and whiskey, 'for lagniappe;' and in Canada the French were\nschooling them in a rudimentary way, missionarying among them, and\ndrawing whole populations of them at a time to Quebec, and later to\nMontreal, to buy furs of them.  Necessarily, then, these various\nclusters of whites must have heard of the great river of the far west;\nand indeed, they did hear of it vaguely,--so vaguely and indefinitely,\nthat its course, proportions, and locality were hardly even guessable.\nThe mere mysteriousness of the matter ought to have fired curiosity and\ncompelled exploration; but this did not occur. Apparently nobody\nhappened to want such a river, nobody needed it, nobody was curious\nabout it; so, for a century and a half the Mississippi remained out of\nthe market and undisturbed. When De Soto found it, he was not hunting\nfor a river, and had no present occasion for one; consequently he did\nnot value it or even take any particular notice of it.\n\nBut at last La Salle the Frenchman conceived the idea of seeking out\nthat river and exploring it.  It always happens that when a man seizes\nupon a neglected and important idea, people inflamed with the same\nnotion crop up all around. It happened so in this instance.\n\nNaturally the question suggests itself, Why did these people want the\nriver now when nobody had wanted it in the five preceding generations?\nApparently it was because at this late day they thought they had\ndiscovered a way to make it useful; for it had come to be believed that\nthe Mississippi emptied into the Gulf of California, and therefore\nafforded a short cut from Canada to China. Previously the supposition\nhad been that it emptied into the Atlantic, or Sea of Virginia.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2 The River and Its Explorers\n\nLA SALLE himself sued for certain high privileges, and they were\ngraciously accorded him by Louis XIV of inflated memory. Chief among\nthem was the privilege to explore, far and wide, and build forts, and\nstake out continents, and hand the same over to the king, and pay the\nexpenses himself; receiving, in return, some little advantages of one\nsort or another; among them the monopoly of buffalo hides.  He spent\nseveral years and about all of his money, in making perilous and painful\ntrips between Montreal and a fort which he had built on the Illinois,\nbefore he at last succeeded in getting his expedition in such a shape\nthat he could strike for the Mississippi.\n\nAnd meantime other parties had had better fortune. In 1673 Joliet the\nmerchant, and Marquette the priest, crossed the country and reached the\nbanks of the Mississippi. They went by way of the Great Lakes; and from\nGreen Bay, in canoes, by way of Fox River and the Wisconsin.  Marquette\nhad solemnly contracted, on the feast of the Immaculate Conception, that\nif the Virgin would permit him to discover the great river, he would\nname it Conception, in her honor.  He kept his word. In that day, all\nexplorers traveled with an outfit of priests. De Soto had twenty-four\nwith him.  La Salle had several, also. The expeditions were often out of\nmeat, and scant of clothes, but they always had the furniture and other\nrequisites for the mass; they were always prepared, as one of the quaint\nchroniclers of the time phrased it, to 'explain hell to the savages.'\n\nOn the 17th of June, 1673, the canoes of Joliet and Marquette and their\nfive subordinates reached the junction of the Wisconsin with the\nMississippi. Mr. Parkman says:  'Before them a wide and rapid current\ncoursed athwart their way, by the foot of lofty heights wrapped thick in\nforests.' He continues:  'Turning southward, they paddled down the\nstream, through a solitude unrelieved by the faintest trace of man.'\n\nA big cat-fish collided with Marquette's canoe, and startled him; and\nreasonably enough, for he had been warned by the Indians that he was on\na foolhardy journey, and even a fatal one, for the river contained a\ndemon 'whose roar could be heard at a great distance, and who would\nengulf them in the abyss where he dwelt.' I have seen a Mississippi cat-\nfish that was more than six feet long, and weighed two hundred and fifty\npounds; and if Marquette's fish was the fellow to that one, he had a\nfair right to think the river's roaring demon was come.\n\n'At length the buffalo began to appear, grazing in herds on the great\nprairies which then bordered the river; and Marquette describes the\nfierce and stupid look of the old bulls as they stared at the intruders\nthrough the tangled mane which nearly blinded them.'\n\nThe voyagers moved cautiously:  'Landed at night and made a fire to cook\ntheir evening meal; then extinguished it, embarked again, paddled some\nway farther, and anchored in the stream, keeping a man on the watch till\nmorning.'\n\nThey did this day after day and night after night; and at the end of two\nweeks they had not seen a human being. The river was an awful solitude,\nthen.  And it is now, over most of its stretch.\n\nBut at the close of the fortnight they one day came upon the footprints\nof men in the mud of the western bank--a Robinson Crusoe experience\nwhich carries an electric shiver with it yet, when one stumbles on it in\nprint.  They had been warned that the river Indians were as ferocious\nand pitiless as the river demon, and destroyed all comers without\nwaiting for provocation; but no matter, Joliet and Marquette struck into\nthe country to hunt up the proprietors of the tracks.  They found them,\nby and by, and were hospitably received and well treated--if to be\nreceived by an Indian chief who has taken off his last rag in order to\nappear at his level best is to be received hospitably; and if to be\ntreated abundantly to fish, porridge, and other game, including dog, and\nhave these things forked into one's mouth by the ungloved fingers of\nIndians is to be well treated. In the morning the chief and six hundred\nof his tribesmen escorted the Frenchmen to the river and bade them a\nfriendly farewell.\n\nOn the rocks above the present city of Alton they found some rude and\nfantastic Indian paintings, which they describe. A short distance below\n'a torrent of yellow mud rushed furiously athwart the calm blue current\nof the Mississippi, boiling and surging and sweeping in its course logs,\nbranches, and uprooted trees.' This was the mouth of the Missouri, 'that\nsavage river,' which 'descending from its mad career through a vast\nunknown of barbarism, poured its turbid floods into the bosom of its\ngentle sister.'\n\nBy and by they passed the mouth of the Ohio; they passed cane-brakes;\nthey fought mosquitoes; they floated along, day after day, through the\ndeep silence and loneliness of the river, drowsing in the scant shade of\nmakeshift awnings, and broiling with the heat; they encountered and\nexchanged civilities with another party of Indians; and at last they\nreached the mouth of the Arkansas (about a month out from their\nstarting-point), where a tribe of war-whooping savages swarmed out to\nmeet and murder them; but they appealed to the Virgin for help; so in\nplace of a fight there was a feast, and plenty of pleasant palaver and\nfol-de-rol.\n\nThey had proved to their satisfaction, that the Mississippi did not\nempty into the Gulf of California, or into the Atlantic. They believed\nit emptied into the Gulf of Mexico. They turned back, now, and carried\ntheir great news to Canada.\n\nBut belief is not proof.  It was reserved for La Salle to furnish the\nproof. He was provokingly delayed, by one misfortune after another, but\nat last got his expedition under way at the end of the year 1681.  In\nthe dead of winter he and Henri de Tonty, son of Lorenzo Tonty, who\ninvented the tontine, his lieutenant, started down the Illinois, with a\nfollowing of eighteen Indians brought from New England, and twenty-three\nFrenchmen. They moved in procession down the surface of the frozen\nriver, on foot, and dragging their canoes after them on sledges.\n\nAt Peoria Lake they struck open water, and paddled thence to the\nMississippi and turned their prows southward. They plowed through the\nfields of floating ice, past the mouth of the Missouri; past the mouth\nof the Ohio, by-and-by; 'and, gliding by the wastes of bordering swamp,\nlanded on the 24th of February near the Third Chickasaw Bluffs,' where\nthey halted and built Fort Prudhomme.\n\n'Again,' says Mr. Parkman, 'they embarked; and with every stage of their\nadventurous progress, the mystery of this vast new world was more and\nmore unveiled.  More and more they entered the realms of spring. The\nhazy sunlight, the warm and drowsy air, the tender foliage, the opening\nflowers, betokened the reviving life of nature.'\n\nDay by day they floated down the great bends, in the shadow of the dense\nforests, and in time arrived at the mouth of the Arkansas.  First, they\nwere greeted by the natives of this locality as Marquette had before\nbeen greeted by them--with the booming of the war drum and the flourish\nof arms. The Virgin composed the difficulty in Marquette's case; the\npipe of peace did the same office for La Salle.  The white man and the\nred man struck hands and entertained each other during three days.\nThen, to the admiration of the savages, La Salle set up a cross with the\narms of France on it, and took possession of the whole country for the\nking--the cool fashion of the time--while the priest piously consecrated\nthe robbery with a hymn. The priest explained the mysteries of the faith\n'by signs,' for the saving of the savages; thus compensating them with\npossible possessions in Heaven for the certain ones on earth which they\nhad just been robbed of.  And also, by signs, La Salle drew from these\nsimple children of the forest acknowledgments of fealty to Louis the\nPutrid, over the water. Nobody smiled at these colossal ironies.\n\nThese performances took place on the site of the future town of\nNapoleon, Arkansas, and there the first confiscation-cross was raised on\nthe banks of the great river.  Marquette's and Joliet's voyage of\ndiscovery ended at the same spot--the site of the future town of\nNapoleon. When De Soto took his fleeting glimpse of the river, away back\nin the dim early days, he took it from that same spot--the site of the\nfuture town of Napoleon, Arkansas.  Therefore, three out of the four\nmemorable events connected with the discovery and exploration of the\nmighty river, occurred, by accident, in one and the same place.  It is a\nmost curious distinction, when one comes to look at it and think about\nit. France stole that vast country on that spot, the future Napoleon;\nand by and by Napoleon himself was to give the country back again!--make\nrestitution, not to the owners, but to their white American heirs.\n\nThe voyagers journeyed on, touching here and there; 'passed the sites,\nsince become historic, of Vicksburg and Grand Gulf,' and visited an\nimposing Indian monarch in the Teche country, whose capital city was a\nsubstantial one of sun-baked bricks mixed with straw--better houses than\nmany that exist there now. The chiefs house contained an audience room\nforty feet square; and there he received Tonty in State, surrounded by\nsixty old men clothed in white cloaks.  There was a temple in the town,\nwith a mud wall about it ornamented with skulls of enemies sacrificed to\nthe sun.\n\nThe voyagers visited the Natchez Indians, near the site of the present\ncity of that name, where they found a 'religious and political\ndespotism, a privileged class descended from the sun, a temple and a\nsacred fire.' It must have been like getting home again; it was home\nwith an advantage, in fact, for it lacked Louis XIV.\n\nA few more days swept swiftly by, and La Salle stood in the shadow of\nhis confiscating cross, at the meeting of the waters from Delaware, and\nfrom Itaska, and from the mountain ranges close upon the Pacific, with\nthe waters of the Gulf of Mexico, his task finished, his prodigy\nachieved. Mr. Parkman, in closing his fascinating narrative, thus sums\nup:\n\n'On that day, the realm of France received on parchment a stupendous\naccession.  The fertile plains of Texas; the vast basin of the\nMississippi, from its frozen northern springs to the sultry borders of\nthe Gulf; from the woody ridges of the Alleghanies to the bare peaks of\nthe Rocky Mountains--a region of savannas and forests, sun-cracked\ndeserts and grassy prairies, watered by a thousand rivers, ranged by a\nthousand warlike tribes, passed beneath the scepter of the Sultan of\nVersailles; and all by virtue of a feeble human voice, inaudible at half\na mile.'\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3 Frescoes from the Past\n\nAPPARENTLY the river was ready for business, now.  But no, the\ndistribution of a population along its banks was as calm and deliberate\nand time-devouring a process as the discovery and exploration had been.\n\nSeventy years elapsed, after the exploration, before the river's borders\nhad a white population worth considering; and nearly fifty more before\nthe river had a commerce. Between La Salle's opening of the river and\nthe time when it may be said to have become the vehicle of anything like\na regular and active commerce, seven sovereigns had occupied the throne\nof England, America had become an independent nation, Louis XIV. and\nLouis XV. had rotted and died, the French monarchy had gone down in the\nred tempest of the revolution, and Napoleon was a name that was\nbeginning to be talked about.  Truly, there were snails in those days.\n\nThe river's earliest commerce was in great barges--keelboats,\nbroadhorns. They floated and sailed from the upper rivers to New\nOrleans, changed cargoes there, and were tediously warped and poled back\nby hand.  A voyage down and back sometimes occupied nine months. In time\nthis commerce increased until it gave employment to hordes of rough and\nhardy men; rude, uneducated, brave, suffering terrific hardships with\nsailor-like stoicism; heavy drinkers, coarse frolickers in moral sties\nlike the Natchez-under-the-hill of that day, heavy fighters, reckless\nfellows, every one, elephantinely jolly, foul-witted, profane; prodigal\nof their money, bankrupt at the end of the trip, fond of barbaric\nfinery, prodigious braggarts; yet, in the main, honest, trustworthy,\nfaithful to promises and duty, and often picturesquely magnanimous.\n\nBy and by the steamboat intruded.  Then for fifteen or twenty years,\nthese men continued to run their keelboats down-stream, and the steamers\ndid all of the upstream business, the keelboatmen selling their boats in\nNew Orleans, and returning home as deck passengers in the steamers.\n\nBut after a while the steamboats so increased in number and in speed\nthat they were able to absorb the entire commerce; and then keelboating\ndied a permanent death.  The keelboatman became a deck hand, or a mate,\nor a pilot on the steamer; and when steamer-berths were not open to him,\nhe took a berth on a Pittsburgh coal-flat, or on a pine-raft constructed\nin the forests up toward the sources of the Mississippi.\n\nIn the heyday of the steamboating prosperity, the river from end to end\nwas flaked with coal-fleets and timber rafts, all managed by hand, and\nemploying hosts of the rough characters whom I have been trying to\ndescribe.  I remember the annual processions of mighty rafts that used\nto glide by Hannibal when I was a boy,--an acre or so of white, sweet-\nsmelling boards in each raft, a crew of two dozen men or more, three or\nfour wigwams scattered about the raft's vast level space for storm-\nquarters,--and I remember the rude ways and the tremendous talk of their\nbig crews, the ex-keelboatmen and their admiringly patterning\nsuccessors; for we used to swim out a quarter or third of a mile and get\non these rafts and have a ride.\n\nBy way of illustrating keelboat talk and manners, and that now-departed\nand hardly-remembered raft-life, I will throw in, in this place, a\nchapter from a book which I have been working at, by fits and starts,\nduring the past five or six years, and may possibly finish in the course\nof five or six more. The book is a story which details some passages in\nthe life of an ignorant village boy, Huck Finn, son of the town drunkard\nof my time out west, there.  He has run away from his persecuting\nfather, and from a persecuting good widow who wishes to make a nice,\ntruth-telling, respectable boy of him; and with him a slave of the\nwidow's has also escaped. They have found a fragment of a lumber raft\n(it is high water and dead summer time), and are floating down the river\nby night, and hiding in the willows by day,--bound for Cairo,--whence\nthe negro will seek freedom in the heart of the free States. But in a\nfog, they pass Cairo without knowing it. By and by they begin to suspect\nthe truth, and Huck Finn is persuaded to end the dismal suspense by\nswimming down to a huge raft which they have seen in the distance ahead\nof them, creeping aboard under cover of the darkness, and gathering the\nneeded information by eavesdropping:--\n\nBut you know a young person can't wait very well when he is impatient to\nfind a thing out.  We talked it over, and by and by Jim said it was such\na black night, now, that it wouldn't be no risk to swim down to the big\nraft and crawl aboard and listen--they would talk about Cairo, because\nthey would be calculating to go ashore there for a spree, maybe, or\nanyway they would send boats ashore to buy whiskey or fresh meat or\nsomething. Jim had a wonderful level head, for a nigger:  he could most\nalways start a good plan when you wanted one.\n\nI stood up and shook my rags off and jumped into the river, and struck\nout for the raft's light.  By and by, when I got down nearly to her, I\neased up and went slow and cautious. But everything was all right--\nnobody at the sweeps. So I swum down along the raft till I was most\nabreast the camp fire in the middle, then I crawled aboard and inched\nalong and got in amongst some bundles of shingles on the weather side of\nthe fire. There was thirteen men there--they was the watch on deck of\ncourse. And a mighty rough-looking lot, too.  They had a jug, and tin\ncups, and they kept the jug moving.  One man was singing--roaring, you\nmay say; and it wasn't a nice song--for a parlor anyway.  He roared\nthrough his nose, and strung out the last word of every line very long.\nWhen he was done they all fetched a kind of Injun war-whoop, and then\nanother was sung.  It begun:--\n\n'There was a woman in our towdn, In our towdn did dwed'l (dwell,) She\nloved her husband dear-i-lee, But another man twyste as wed'l.\n\nSinging too, riloo, riloo, riloo, Ri-too, riloo, rilay - - - e, She\nloved her husband dear-i-lee, But another man twyste as wed'l.\n\nAnd so on--fourteen verses.  It was kind of poor, and when he was going\nto start on the next verse one of them said it was the tune the old cow\ndied on; and another one said, 'Oh, give us a rest.' And another one\ntold him to take a walk.  They made fun of him till he got mad and\njumped up and begun to cuss the crowd, and said he could lame any thief\nin the lot.\n\nThey was all about to make a break for him, but the biggest man there\njumped up and says--\n\n'Set whar you are, gentlemen.  Leave him to me; he's my meat.'\n\nThen he jumped up in the air three times and cracked his heels together\nevery time.  He flung off a buckskin coat that was all hung with\nfringes, and says, 'You lay thar tell the chawin-up's done;' and flung\nhis hat down, which was all over ribbons, and says, 'You lay thar tell\nhis sufferin's is over.'\n\nThen he jumped up in the air and cracked his heels together again and\nshouted out--\n\n'Whoo-oop! I'm the old original iron-jawed, brass-mounted, copper-\nbellied corpse-maker from the wilds of Arkansaw!--Look at me! I'm the\nman they call Sudden Death and General Desolation! Sired by a hurricane,\ndam'd by an earthquake, half-brother to the cholera, nearly related to\nthe small-pox on the mother's side! Look at me!  I take nineteen\nalligators and a bar'l of whiskey for breakfast when I'm in robust\nhealth, and a bushel of rattlesnakes and a dead body when I'm ailing!  I\nsplit the everlasting rocks with my glance, and I squench the thunder\nwhen I speak! Whoo-oop! Stand back and give me room according to my\nstrength! Blood's my natural drink, and the wails of the dying is music\nto my ear! Cast your eye on me, gentlemen!--and lay low and hold your\nbreath, for I'm bout to turn myself loose!'\n\nAll the time he was getting this off, he was shaking his head and\nlooking fierce, and kind of swelling around in a little circle, tucking\nup his wrist-bands, and now and then straightening up and beating his\nbreast with his fist, saying, 'Look at me, gentlemen!' When he got\nthrough, he jumped up and cracked his heels together three times, and\nlet off a roaring 'Whoo-oop! I'm the bloodiest son of a wildcat that\nlives!'\n\nThen the man that had started the row tilted his old slouch hat down\nover his right eye; then he bent stooping forward, with his back sagged\nand his south end sticking out far, and his fists a-shoving out and\ndrawing in in front of him, and so went around in a little circle about\nthree times, swelling himself up and breathing hard.  Then he\nstraightened, and jumped up and cracked his heels together three times,\nbefore he lit again (that made them cheer), and he begun to shout like\nthis--\n\n'Whoo-oop! bow your neck and spread, for the kingdom of sorrow's a-\ncoming! Hold me down to the earth, for I feel my powers a-working! whoo-\noop! I'm a child of sin, don't let me get a start! Smoked glass, here,\nfor all!  Don't attempt to look at me with the naked eye, gentlemen!\nWhen I'm playful I use the meridians of longitude and parallels of\nlatitude for a seine, and drag the Atlantic Ocean for whales!  I scratch\nmy head with the lightning, and purr myself to sleep with the thunder!\nWhen I'm cold, I bile the Gulf of Mexico and bathe in it; when I'm hot I\nfan myself with an equinoctial storm; when I'm thirsty I reach up and\nsuck a cloud dry like a sponge; when I range the earth hungry, famine\nfollows in my tracks! Whoo-oop! Bow your neck and spread!  I put my hand\non the sun's face and make it night in the earth; I bite a piece out of\nthe moon and hurry the seasons; I shake myself and crumble the\nmountains! Contemplate me through leather--don't use the naked eye! I'm\nthe man with a petrified heart and biler-iron bowels! The massacre of\nisolated communities is the pastime of my idle moments, the destruction\nof nationalities the serious business of my life! The boundless vastness\nof the great American desert is my enclosed property, and I bury my dead\non my own premises!' He jumped up and cracked his heels together three\ntimes before he lit (they cheered him again), and as he come down he\nshouted out: 'Whoo-oop! bow your neck and spread, for the pet child of\ncalamity's a-coming! '\n\nThen the other one went to swelling around and blowing again--the first\none--the one they called Bob; next, the Child of Calamity chipped in\nagain, bigger than ever; then they both got at it at the same time,\nswelling round and round each other and punching their fists most into\neach other's faces, and whooping and jawing like Injuns; then Bob called\nthe Child names, and the Child called him names back again:  next, Bob\ncalled him a heap rougher names and the Child come back at him with the\nvery worst kind of language; next, Bob knocked the Child's hat off, and\nthe Child picked it up and kicked Bob's ribbony hat about six foot; Bob\nwent and got it and said never mind, this warn't going to be the last of\nthis thing, because he was a man that never forgot and never forgive,\nand so the Child better look out, for there was a time a-coming, just as\nsure as he was a living man, that he would have to answer to him with\nthe best blood in his body. The Child said no man was willinger than he\nwas for that time to come, and he would give Bob fair warning, now,\nnever to cross his path again, for he could never rest till he had waded\nin his blood, for such was his nature, though he was sparing him now on\naccount of his family, if he had one.\n\nBoth of them was edging away in different directions, growling and\nshaking their heads and going on about what they was going to do; but a\nlittle black-whiskered chap skipped up and says--\n\n'Come back here, you couple of chicken-livered cowards, and I'll thrash\nthe two of ye!'\n\nAnd he done it, too.  He snatched them, he jerked them this way and\nthat, he booted them around, he knocked them sprawling faster than they\ncould get up.  Why, it warn't two minutes till they begged like dogs--\nand how the other lot did yell and laugh and clap their hands all the\nway through, and shout 'Sail in, Corpse-Maker!' 'Hi! at him again, Child\nof Calamity!' 'Bully for you, little Davy!'  Well, it was a perfect pow-\nwow for a while. Bob and the Child had red noses and black eyes when\nthey got through. Little Davy made them own up that they were sneaks and\ncowards and not fit to eat with a dog or drink with a nigger; then Bob\nand the Child shook hands with each other, very solemn, and said they\nhad always respected each other and was willing to let bygones be\nbygones.  So then they washed their faces in the river; and just then\nthere was a loud order to stand by for a crossing, and some of them went\nforward to man the sweeps there, and the rest went aft to handle the\nafter-sweeps.\n\nI laid still and waited for fifteen minutes, and had a smoke out of a\npipe that one of them left in reach; then the crossing was finished, and\nthey stumped back and had a drink around and went to talking and singing\nagain. Next they got out an old fiddle, and one played and another\npatted juba, and the rest turned themselves loose on a regular old-\nfashioned keel-boat break-down. They couldn't keep that up very long\nwithout getting winded, so by and by they settled around the jug again.\n\nThey sung 'jolly, jolly raftman's the life for me,' with a musing\nchorus, and then they got to talking about differences betwixt hogs, and\ntheir different kind of habits; and next about women and their different\nways:  and next about the best ways to put out houses that was afire;\nand next about what ought to be done with the Injuns; and next about\nwhat a king had to do, and how much he got; and next about how to make\ncats fight; and next about what to do when a man has fits; and next\nabout differences betwixt clear-water rivers and muddy-water ones. The\nman they called Ed said the muddy Mississippi water was wholesomer to\ndrink than the clear water of the Ohio; he said if you let a pint of\nthis yaller Mississippi water settle, you would have about a half to\nthree-quarters of an inch of mud in the bottom, according to the stage\nof the river, and then it warn't no better than Ohio water--what you\nwanted to do was to keep it stirred up--and when the river was low, keep\nmud on hand to put in and thicken the water up the way it ought to be.\n\nThe Child of Calamity said that was so; he said there was nutritiousness\nin the mud, and a man that drunk Mississippi water could grow corn in\nhis stomach if he wanted to.  He says--\n\n'You look at the graveyards; that tells the tale.  Trees won't grow\nworth chucks in a Cincinnati graveyard, but in a Sent Louis graveyard\nthey grow upwards of eight hundred foot high. It's all on account of the\nwater the people drunk before they laid up. A Cincinnati corpse don't\nrichen a soil any.'\n\nAnd they talked about how Ohio water didn't like to mix with Mississippi\nwater.  Ed said if you take the Mississippi on a rise when the Ohio is\nlow, you'll find a wide band of clear water all the way down the east\nside of the Mississippi for a hundred mile or more, and the minute you\nget out a quarter of a mile from shore and pass the line, it is all\nthick and yaller the rest of the way across. Then they talked about how\nto keep tobacco from getting moldy, and from that they went into ghosts\nand told about a lot that other folks had seen; but Ed says--\n\n'Why don't you tell something that you've seen yourselves? Now let me\nhave a say.  Five years ago I was on a raft as big as this, and right\nalong here it was a bright moonshiny night, and I was on watch and boss\nof the stabboard oar forrard, and one of my pards was a man named Dick\nAllbright, and he come along to where I was sitting, forrard--gaping and\nstretching, he was--and stooped down on the edge of the raft and washed\nhis face in the river, and come and set down by me and got out his pipe,\nand had just got it filled, when he looks up and says--\n\n'\"Why looky-here,\" he says, \"ain't that Buck Miller's place, over yander\nin the bend.\"\n\n'\"Yes,\" says I, \"it is--why.\"  He laid his pipe down and leant his head\non his hand, and says--\n\n'\"I thought we'd be furder down.\"  I says--\n\n'\"I thought it too, when I went off watch\"--we was standing six hours on\nand six off--\"but the boys told me,\" I says, \"that the raft didn't seem\nto hardly move, for the last hour,\" says I, \"though she's a slipping\nalong all right, now,\" says I. He give a kind of a groan, and says--\n\n'\"I've seed a raft act so before, along here,\" he says, \"'pears to me\nthe current has most quit above the head of this bend durin' the last\ntwo years,\" he says.\n\n'Well, he raised up two or three times, and looked away off and around\non the water.  That started me at it, too.  A body is always doing what\nhe sees somebody else doing, though there mayn't be no sense in it.\nPretty soon I see a black something floating on the water away off to\nstabboard and quartering behind us. I see he was looking at it, too.  I\nsays--\n\n'\"What's that?\"  He says, sort of pettish,--\n\n'\"Tain't nothing but an old empty bar'l.\"\n\n'\"An empty bar'l!\" says I, \"why,\" says I, \"a spy-glass is a fool to your\neyes.  How can you tell it's an empty bar'l?\" He says--\n\n'\"I don't know; I reckon it ain't a bar'l, but I thought it might be,\"\nsays he.\n\n'\"Yes,\" I says, \"so it might be, and it might be anything else, too; a\nbody can't tell nothing about it, such a distance as that,\" I says.\n\n'We hadn't nothing else to do, so we kept on watching it. By and by I\nsays--\n\n'\"Why looky-here, Dick Allbright, that thing's a-gaining on us, I\nbelieve.\"\n\n'He never said nothing.  The thing gained and gained, and I judged it\nmust be a dog that was about tired out. Well, we swung down into the\ncrossing, and the thing floated across the bright streak of the\nmoonshine, and, by George, it was bar'l. Says I--\n\n'\"Dick Allbright, what made you think that thing was a bar'l, when it\nwas a half a mile off,\" says I. Says he--\n\n'\"I don't know.\"  Says I--\n\n'\"You tell me, Dick Allbright.\"  He says--\n\n'\"Well, I knowed it was a bar'l; I've seen it before; lots has seen it;\nthey says it's a haunted bar'l.\"\n\n'I called the rest of the watch, and they come and stood there, and I\ntold them what Dick said.  It floated right along abreast, now, and\ndidn't gain any more.  It was about twenty foot off. Some was for having\nit aboard, but the rest didn't want to. Dick Allbright said rafts that\nhad fooled with it had got bad luck by it.  The captain of the watch\nsaid he didn't believe in it. He said he reckoned the bar'l gained on us\nbecause it was in a little better current than what we was.  He said it\nwould leave by and by.\n\n'So then we went to talking about other things, and we had a song, and\nthen a breakdown; and after that the captain of the watch called for\nanother song; but it was clouding up, now, and the bar'l stuck right\nthar in the same place, and the song didn't seem to have much warm-up to\nit, somehow, and so they didn't finish it, and there warn't any cheers,\nbut it sort of dropped flat, and nobody said anything for a minute. Then\neverybody tried to talk at once, and one chap got off a joke, but it\nwarn't no use, they didn't laugh, and even the chap that made the joke\ndidn't laugh at it, which ain't usual. We all just settled down glum,\nand watched the bar'l, and was oneasy and oncomfortable.  Well, sir, it\nshut down black and still, and then the wind begin to moan around, and\nnext the lightning begin to play and the thunder to grumble.  And pretty\nsoon there was a regular storm, and in the middle of it a man that was\nrunning aft stumbled and fell and sprained his ankle so that he had to\nlay up. This made the boys shake their heads.  And every time the\nlightning come, there was that bar'l with the blue lights winking around\nit. We was always on the look-out for it.  But by and by, towards dawn,\nshe was gone.  When the day come we couldn't see her anywhere, and we\nwarn't sorry, neither.\n\n'But next night about half-past nine, when there was songs and high\njinks going on, here she comes again, and took her old roost on the\nstabboard side.  There warn't no more high jinks.  Everybody got solemn;\nnobody talked; you couldn't get anybody to do anything but set around\nmoody and look at the bar'l. It begun to cloud up again. When the watch\nchanged, the off watch stayed up, 'stead of turning in. The storm ripped\nand roared around all night, and in the middle of it another man tripped\nand sprained his ankle, and had to knock off. The bar'l left towards\nday, and nobody see it go.\n\n'Everybody was sober and down in the mouth all day.  I don't mean the\nkind of sober that comes of leaving liquor alone--not that. They was\nquiet, but they all drunk more than usual--not together--but each man\nsidled off and took it private, by himself.\n\n'After dark the off watch didn't turn in; nobody sung, nobody talked;\nthe boys didn't scatter around, neither; they sort of huddled together,\nforrard; and for two hours they set there, perfectly still, looking\nsteady in the one direction, and heaving a sigh once in a while.  And\nthen, here comes the bar'l again. She took up her old place.  She staid\nthere all night; nobody turned in.  The storm come on again, after\nmidnight. It got awful dark; the rain poured down; hail, too; the\nthunder boomed and roared and bellowed; the wind blowed a hurricane; and\nthe lightning spread over everything in big sheets of glare, and showed\nthe whole raft as plain as day; and the river lashed up white as milk as\nfar as you could see for miles, and there was that bar'l jiggering\nalong, same as ever. The captain ordered the watch to man the after\nsweeps for a crossing, and nobody would go--no more sprained ankles for\nthem, they said. They wouldn't even walk aft.  Well then, just then the\nsky split wide open, with a crash, and the lightning killed two men of\nthe after watch, and crippled two more.  Crippled them how, says you?\nWhy, sprained their ankles!\n\n'The bar'l left in the dark betwixt lightnings, towards dawn. Well, not\na body eat a bite at breakfast that morning. After that the men loafed\naround, in twos and threes, and talked low together.  But none of them\nherded with Dick Allbright. They all give him the cold shake.  If he\ncome around where any of the men was, they split up and sidled away.\nThey wouldn't man the sweeps with him.  The captain had all the skiffs\nhauled up on the raft, alongside of his wigwam, and wouldn't let the\ndead men be took ashore to be planted; he didn't believe a man that got\nashore would come back; and he was right.\n\n'After night come, you could see pretty plain that there was going to be\ntrouble if that bar'l come again; there was such a muttering going on. A\ngood many wanted to kill Dick Allbright, because he'd seen the bar'l on\nother trips, and that had an ugly look.  Some wanted to put him ashore.\nSome said, let's all go ashore in a pile, if the bar'l comes again.\n\n'This kind of whispers was still going on, the men being bunched\ntogether forrard watching for the bar'l, when, lo and behold you, here\nshe comes again.  Down she comes, slow and steady, and settles into her\nold tracks.  You could a heard a pin drop. Then up comes the captain,\nand says:--\n\n'\"Boys, don't be a pack of children and fools; I don't want this bar'l\nto be dogging us all the way to Orleans, and YOU don't; well, then,\nhow's the best way to stop it? Burn it up,--that's the way.  I'm going\nto fetch it aboard,\" he says. And before anybody could say a word, in he\nwent.\n\n'He swum to it, and as he come pushing it to the raft, the men spread to\none side.  But the old man got it aboard and busted in the head, and\nthere was a baby in it!  Yes, sir, a stark naked baby. It was Dick\nAllbright's baby; he owned up and said so.\n\n'\"Yes,\" he says, a-leaning over it, \"yes, it is my own lamented darling,\nmy poor lost Charles William Allbright deceased,\" says he,--for he could\ncurl his tongue around the bulliest words in the language when he was a\nmind to, and lay them before you without a jint started, anywheres.\nYes, he said he used to live up at the head of this bend, and one night\nhe choked his child, which was crying, not intending to kill it,--which\nwas prob'ly a lie,--and then he was scared, and buried it in a bar'l,\nbefore his wife got home, and off he went, and struck the northern trail\nand went to rafting; and this was the third year that the bar'l had\nchased him. He said the bad luck always begun light, and lasted till\nfour men was killed, and then the bar'l didn't come any more after that.\nHe said if the men would stand it one more night,--and was a-going on\nlike that,--but the men had got enough. They started to get out a boat\nto take him ashore and lynch him, but he grabbed the little child all of\na sudden and jumped overboard with it hugged up to his breast and\nshedding tears, and we never see him again in this life, poor old\nsuffering soul, nor Charles William neither.'\n\n'WHO was shedding tears?' says Bob; 'was it Allbright or the baby?'\n\n'Why, Allbright, of course; didn't I tell you the baby was dead. Been\ndead three years--how could it cry?'\n\n'Well, never mind how it could cry--how could it KEEP all that time?'\nsays Davy.  'You answer me that.'\n\n'I don't know how it done it,' says Ed.  'It done it though--that's all\nI know about it.'\n\n'Say--what did they do with the bar'l?' says the Child of Calamity.\n\n'Why, they hove it overboard, and it sunk like a chunk of lead.'\n\n'Edward, did the child look like it was choked?' says one.\n\n'Did it have its hair parted?' says another.\n\n'What was the brand on that bar'l, Eddy?' says a fellow they called\nBill.\n\n'Have you got the papers for them statistics, Edmund?' says Jimmy.\n\n'Say, Edwin, was you one of the men that was killed by the lightning.'\nsays Davy.\n\n'Him?  O, no, he was both of 'em,' says Bob.  Then they all haw-hawed.\n\n'Say, Edward, don't you reckon you'd better take a pill? You look bad--\ndon't you feel pale?' says the Child of Calamity.\n\n'O, come, now, Eddy,' says Jimmy, 'show up; you must a kept part of that\nbar'l to prove the thing by.  Show us the bunghole--do--and we'll all\nbelieve you.'\n\n'Say, boys,' says Bill, 'less divide it up.  Thar's thirteen of us. I\ncan swaller a thirteenth of the yarn, if you can worry down the rest.'\n\nEd got up mad and said they could all go to some place which he ripped\nout pretty savage, and then walked off aft cussing to himself, and they\nyelling and jeering at him, and roaring and laughing so you could hear\nthem a mile.\n\n'Boys, we'll split a watermelon on that,' says the Child of Calamity;\nand he come rummaging around in the dark amongst the shingle bundles\nwhere I was, and put his hand on me.  I was warm and soft and naked; so\nhe says 'Ouch!' and jumped back.\n\n'Fetch a lantern or a chunk of fire here, boys--there's a snake here as\nbig as a cow!'\n\nSo they run there with a lantern and crowded up and looked in on me.\n\n'Come out of that, you beggar!' says one.\n\n'Who are you?' says another.\n\n'What are you after here?  Speak up prompt, or overboard you go.\n\n'Snake him out, boys.  Snatch him out by the heels.'\n\nI began to beg, and crept out amongst them trembling. They looked me\nover, wondering, and the Child of Calamity says--\n\n'A cussed thief!  Lend a hand and less heave him overboard!'\n\n'No,' says Big Bob, 'less get out the paint-pot and paint him a sky blue\nall over from head to heel, and then heave him over!'\n\n'Good, that 's it.  Go for the paint, Jimmy.'\n\nWhen the paint come, and Bob took the brush and was just going to begin,\nthe others laughing and rubbing their hands, I begun to cry, and that\nsort of worked on Davy, and he says--\n\n''Vast there!  He 's nothing but a cub.  'I'll paint the man that\ntetches him!'\n\nSo I looked around on them, and some of them grumbled and growled, and\nBob put down the paint, and the others didn't take it up.\n\n'Come here to the fire, and less see what you're up to here,' says Davy.\n'Now set down there and give an account of yourself. How long have you\nbeen aboard here?'\n\n'Not over a quarter of a minute, sir,' says I.\n\n'How did you get dry so quick?'\n\n'I don't know, sir.  I'm always that way, mostly.'\n\n'Oh, you are, are you.  What's your name?'\n\nI warn't going to tell my name.  I didn't know what to say, so I just\nsays--\n\n'Charles William Allbright, sir.'\n\nThen they roared--the whole crowd; and I was mighty glad I said that,\nbecause maybe laughing would get them in a better humor.\n\nWhen they got done laughing, Davy says--\n\n'It won't hardly do, Charles William.  You couldn't have growed this\nmuch in five year, and you was a baby when you come out of the bar'l,\nyou know, and dead at that.  Come, now, tell a straight story, and\nnobody'll hurt you, if you ain't up to anything wrong. What IS your\nname?'\n\n'Aleck Hopkins, sir.  Aleck James Hopkins.'\n\n'Well, Aleck, where did you come from, here?'\n\n'From a trading scow.  She lays up the bend yonder. I was born on her.\nPap has traded up and down here all his life; and he told me to swim off\nhere, because when you went by he said he would like to get some of you\nto speak to a Mr. Jonas Turner, in Cairo, and tell him--'\n\n'Oh, come!'\n\n'Yes, sir; it's as true as the world; Pap he says--'\n\n'Oh, your grandmother!'\n\nThey all laughed, and I tried again to talk, but they broke in on me and\nstopped me.\n\n'Now, looky-here,' says Davy; 'you're scared, and so you talk wild.\nHonest, now, do you live in a scow, or is it a lie?'\n\n'Yes, sir, in a trading scow.  She lays up at the head of the bend. But\nI warn't born in her.  It's our first trip.'\n\n'Now you're talking!  What did you come aboard here, for?  To steal?'\n\n'No, sir, I didn't.--It was only to get a ride on the raft. All boys\ndoes that.'\n\n'Well, I know that.  But what did you hide for?'\n\n'Sometimes they drive the boys off.'\n\n'So they do.  They might steal.  Looky-here; if we let you off this\ntime, will you keep out of these kind of scrapes hereafter?'\n\n''Deed I will, boss.  You try me.'\n\n'All right, then.  You ain't but little ways from shore. Overboard with\nyou, and don't you make a fool of yourself another time this way.--Blast\nit, boy, some raftsmen would rawhide you till you were black and blue!'\n\nI didn't wait to kiss good-bye, but went overboard and broke for shore.\nWhen Jim come along by and by, the big raft was away out of sight around\nthe point.  I swum out and got aboard, and was mighty glad to see home\nagain.\n\n\nThe boy did not get the information he was after, but his adventure has\nfurnished the glimpse of the departed raftsman and keelboatman which I\ndesire to offer in this place.\n\nI now come to a phase of the Mississippi River life of the flush times\nof steamboating, which seems to me to warrant full examination--the\nmarvelous science of piloting, as displayed there. I believe there has\nbeen nothing like it elsewhere in the world.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4 The Boys' Ambition\n\nWHEN I was a boy, there was but one permanent ambition among my comrades\nin our village{footnote [1. Hannibal, Missouri]} on the west bank of the\nMississippi River.  That was, to be a steamboatman. We had transient\nambitions of other sorts, but they were only transient. When a circus\ncame and went, it left us all burning to become clowns; the first negro\nminstrel show that came to our section left us all suffering to try that\nkind of life; now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good,\nGod would permit us to be pirates. These ambitions faded out, each in\nits turn; but the ambition to be a steamboatman always remained.\n\nOnce a day a cheap, gaudy packet arrived upward from St. Louis, and\nanother downward from Keokuk.  Before these events, the day was glorious\nwith expectancy; after them, the day was a dead and empty thing.  Not\nonly the boys, but the whole village, felt this. After all these years I\ncan picture that old time to myself now, just as it was then:  the white\ntown drowsing in the sunshine of a summer's morning; the streets empty,\nor pretty nearly so; one or two clerks sitting in front of the Water\nStreet stores, with their splint-bottomed chairs tilted back against the\nwall, chins on breasts, hats slouched over their faces, asleep--with\nshingle-shavings enough around to show what broke them down; a sow and a\nlitter of pigs loafing along the sidewalk, doing a good business in\nwatermelon rinds and seeds; two or three lonely little freight piles\nscattered about the 'levee;' a pile of 'skids' on the slope of the\nstone-paved wharf, and the fragrant town drunkard asleep in the shadow\nof them; two or three wood flats at the head of the wharf, but nobody to\nlisten to the peaceful lapping of the wavelets against them; the great\nMississippi, the majestic, the magnificent Mississippi, rolling its\nmile-wide tide along, shining in the sun; the dense forest away on the\nother side; the 'point' above the town, and the 'point' below, bounding\nthe river-glimpse and turning it into a sort of sea, and withal a very\nstill and brilliant and lonely one.  Presently a film of dark smoke\nappears above one of those remote 'points;' instantly a negro drayman,\nfamous for his quick eye and prodigious voice, lifts up the cry, 'S-t-e-\na-m-boat a-comin'!' and the scene changes! The town drunkard stirs, the\nclerks wake up, a furious clatter of drays follows, every house and\nstore pours out a human contribution, and all in a twinkling the dead\ntown is alive and moving.  Drays, carts, men, boys, all go hurrying from\nmany quarters to a common center, the wharf. Assembled there, the people\nfasten their eyes upon the coming boat as upon a wonder they are seeing\nfor the first time. And the boat IS rather a handsome sight, too.  She\nis long and sharp and trim and pretty; she has two tall, fancy-topped\nchimneys, with a gilded device of some kind swung between them; a\nfanciful pilot-house, a glass and 'gingerbread', perched on top of the\n'texas' deck behind them; the paddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture\nor with gilded rays above the boat's name; the boiler deck, the\nhurricane deck, and the texas deck are fenced and ornamented with clean\nwhite railings; there is a flag gallantly flying from the jack-staff;\nthe furnace doors are open and the fires glaring bravely; the upper\ndecks are black with passengers; the captain stands by the big bell,\ncalm, imposing, the envy of all; great volumes of the blackest smoke are\nrolling and tumbling out of the chimneys--a husbanded grandeur created\nwith a bit of pitch pine just before arriving at a town; the crew are\ngrouped on the forecastle; the broad stage is run far out over the port\nbow, and an envied deckhand stands picturesquely on the end of it with a\ncoil of rope in his hand; the pent steam is screaming through the gauge-\ncocks, the captain lifts his hand, a bell rings, the wheels stop; then\nthey turn back, churning the water to foam, and the steamer is at rest.\nThen such a scramble as there is to get aboard, and to get ashore, and\nto take in freight and to discharge freight, all at one and the same\ntime; and such a yelling and cursing as the mates facilitate it all\nwith! Ten minutes later the steamer is under way again, with no flag on\nthe jack-staff and no black smoke issuing from the chimneys. After ten\nmore minutes the town is dead again, and the town drunkard asleep by the\nskids once more.\n\nMy father was a justice of the peace, and I supposed he possessed the\npower of life and death over all men and could hang anybody that\noffended him.  This was distinction enough for me as a general thing;\nbut the desire to be a steamboatman kept intruding, nevertheless. I\nfirst wanted to be a cabin-boy, so that I could come out with a white\napron on and shake a tablecloth over the side, where all my old comrades\ncould see me; later I thought I would rather be the deckhand who stood\non the end of the stage-plank with the coil of rope in his hand, because\nhe was particularly conspicuous.  But these were only day-dreams,--they\nwere too heavenly to be contemplated as real possibilities. By and by\none of our boys went away.  He was not heard of for a long time. At last\nhe turned up as apprentice engineer or 'striker' on a steamboat. This\nthing shook the bottom out of all my Sunday-school teachings. That boy\nhad been notoriously worldly, and I just the reverse; yet he was exalted\nto this eminence, and I left in obscurity and misery. There was nothing\ngenerous about this fellow in his greatness. He would always manage to\nhave a rusty bolt to scrub while his boat tarried at our town, and he\nwould sit on the inside guard and scrub it, where we could all see him\nand envy him and loathe him. And whenever his boat was laid up he would\ncome home and swell around the town in his blackest and greasiest\nclothes, so that nobody could help remembering that he was a\nsteamboatman; and he used all sorts of steamboat technicalities in his\ntalk, as if he were so used to them that he forgot common people could\nnot understand them. He would speak of the 'labboard' side of a horse in\nan easy, natural way that would make one wish he was dead.  And he was\nalways talking about 'St. Looy' like an old citizen; he would refer\ncasually to occasions when he 'was coming down Fourth Street,' or when\nhe was 'passing by the Planter's House,' or when there was a fire and he\ntook a turn on the brakes of 'the old Big Missouri;' and then he would\ngo on and lie about how many towns the size of ours were burned down\nthere that day. Two or three of the boys had long been persons of\nconsideration among us because they had been to St. Louis once and had a\nvague general knowledge of its wonders, but the day of their glory was\nover now. They lapsed into a humble silence, and learned to disappear\nwhen the ruthless 'cub'-engineer approached.  This fellow had money,\ntoo, and hair oil. Also an ignorant silver watch and a showy brass watch\nchain. He wore a leather belt and used no suspenders.  If ever a youth\nwas cordially admired and hated by his comrades, this one was. No girl\ncould withstand his charms.  He 'cut out' every boy in the village. When\nhis boat blew up at last, it diffused a tranquil contentment among us\nsuch as we had not known for months.  But when he came home the next\nweek, alive, renowned, and appeared in church all battered up and\nbandaged, a shining hero, stared at and wondered over by everybody, it\nseemed to us that the partiality of Providence for an undeserving\nreptile had reached a point where it was open to criticism.\n\nThis creature's career could produce but one result, and it speedily\nfollowed.  Boy after boy managed to get on the river. The minister's son\nbecame an engineer.  The doctor's and the post-master's sons became 'mud\nclerks;' the wholesale liquor dealer's son became a barkeeper on a boat;\nfour sons of the chief merchant, and two sons of the county judge,\nbecame pilots. Pilot was the grandest position of all.  The pilot, even\nin those days of trivial wages, had a princely salary--from a hundred\nand fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars a month, and no board to pay.\nTwo months of his wages would pay a preacher's salary for a year. Now\nsome of us were left disconsolate.  We could not get on the river--at\nleast our parents would not let us.\n\nSo by and by I ran away.  I said I never would come home again till I\nwas a pilot and could come in glory.  But somehow I could not manage it.\nI went meekly aboard a few of the boats that lay packed together like\nsardines at the long St. Louis wharf, and very humbly inquired for the\npilots, but got only a cold shoulder and short words from mates and\nclerks. I had to make the best of this sort of treatment for the time\nbeing, but I had comforting daydreams of a future when I should be a\ngreat and honored pilot, with plenty of money, and could kill some of\nthese mates and clerks and pay for them.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5 I Want to be a Cub-pilot\n\nMONTHS afterward the hope within me struggled to a reluctant death, and\nI found myself without an ambition.  But I was ashamed to go home. I was\nin Cincinnati, and I set to work to map out a new career. I had been\nreading about the recent exploration of the river Amazon by an\nexpedition sent out by our government.  It was said that the expedition,\nowing to difficulties, had not thoroughly explored a part of the country\nlying about the head-waters, some four thousand miles from the mouth of\nthe river.  It was only about fifteen hundred miles from Cincinnati to\nNew Orleans, where I could doubtless get a ship. I had thirty dollars\nleft; I would go and complete the exploration of the Amazon.  This was\nall the thought I gave to the subject. I never was great in matters of\ndetail.  I packed my valise, and took passage on an ancient tub called\nthe 'Paul Jones,' for New Orleans. For the sum of sixteen dollars I had\nthe scarred and tarnished splendors of 'her' main saloon principally to\nmyself, for she was not a creature to attract the eye of wiser\ntravelers.\n\nWhen we presently got under way and went poking down the broad Ohio, I\nbecame a new being, and the subject of my own admiration. I was a\ntraveler!  A word never had tasted so good in my mouth before. I had an\nexultant sense of being bound for mysterious lands and distant climes\nwhich I never have felt in so uplifting a degree since. I was in such a\nglorified condition that all ignoble feelings departed out of me, and I\nwas able to look down and pity the untraveled with a compassion that had\nhardly a trace of contempt in it. Still, when we stopped at villages and\nwood-yards, I could not help lolling carelessly upon the railings of the\nboiler deck to enjoy the envy of the country boys on the bank.  If they\ndid not seem to discover me, I presently sneezed to attract their\nattention, or moved to a position where they could not help seeing me.\nAnd as soon as I knew they saw me I gaped and stretched, and gave other\nsigns of being mightily bored with traveling.\n\nI kept my hat off all the time, and stayed where the wind and the sun\ncould strike me, because I wanted to get the bronzed and weather-beaten\nlook of an old traveler. Before the second day was half gone I\nexperienced a joy which filled me with the purest gratitude; for I saw\nthat the skin had begun to blister and peel off my face and neck. I\nwished that the boys and girls at home could see me now.\n\nWe reached Louisville in time--at least the neighborhood of it. We stuck\nhard and fast on the rocks in the middle of the river, and lay there\nfour days.  I was now beginning to feel a strong sense of being a part\nof the boat's family, a sort of infant son to the captain and younger\nbrother to the officers. There is no estimating the pride I took in this\ngrandeur, or the affection that began to swell and grow in me for those\npeople.  I could not know how the lordly steamboatman scorns that sort\nof presumption in a mere landsman. I particularly longed to acquire the\nleast trifle of notice from the big stormy mate, and I was on the alert\nfor an opportunity to do him a service to that end.  It came at last.\nThe riotous powwow of setting a spar was going on down on the\nforecastle, and I went down there and stood around in the way--or mostly\nskipping out of it--till the mate suddenly roared a general order for\nsomebody to bring him a capstan bar. I sprang to his side and said:\n'Tell me where it is--I'll fetch it!'\n\nIf a rag-picker had offered to do a diplomatic service for the Emperor\nof Russia, the monarch could not have been more astounded than the mate\nwas. He even stopped swearing.  He stood and stared down at me. It took\nhim ten seconds to scrape his disjointed remains together again. Then he\nsaid impressively:  'Well, if this don't beat hell!' and turned to his\nwork with the air of a man who had been confronted with a problem too\nabstruse for solution.\n\nI crept away, and courted solitude for the rest of the day. I did not go\nto dinner; I stayed away from supper until everybody else had finished.\nI did not feel so much like a member of the boat's family now as before.\nHowever, my spirits returned, in installments, as we pursued our way\ndown the river.  I was sorry I hated the mate so, because it was not in\n(young) human nature not to admire him. He was huge and muscular, his\nface was bearded and whiskered all over; he had a red woman and a blue\nwoman tattooed on his right arm,--one on each side of a blue anchor with\na red rope to it; and in the matter of profanity he was sublime.  When\nhe was getting out cargo at a landing, I was always where I could see\nand hear. He felt all the majesty of his great position, and made the\nworld feel it, too.  When he gave even the simplest order, he discharged\nit like a blast of lightning, and sent a long, reverberating peal of\nprofanity thundering after it.  I could not help contrasting the way in\nwhich the average landsman would give an order, with the mate's way of\ndoing it.  If the landsman should wish the gang-plank moved a foot\nfarther forward, he would probably say: 'James, or William, one of you\npush that plank forward, please;' but put the mate in his place and he\nwould roar out:  'Here, now, start that gang-plank for'ard! Lively, now!\nWHAT're you about!  Snatch it! SNATCH it!  There! there!  Aft again! aft\nagain! don't you hear me. Dash it to dash! are you going to SLEEP over\nit!  'VAST heaving. 'Vast heaving, I tell you!  Going to heave it clear\nastern? WHERE're you going with that barrel!  FOR'ARD with it 'fore I\nmake you swallow it, you dash-dash-dash-DASHED split between a tired\nmud-turtle and a crippled hearse-horse!'\n\nI wished I could talk like that.\n\nWhen the soreness of my adventure with the mate had somewhat worn off, I\nbegan timidly to make up to the humblest official connected with the\nboat--the night watchman.  He snubbed my advances at first, but I\npresently ventured to offer him a new chalk pipe; and that softened him.\nSo he allowed me to sit with him by the big bell on the hurricane deck,\nand in time he melted into conversation. He could not well have helped\nit, I hung with such homage on his words and so plainly showed that I\nfelt honored by his notice. He told me the names of dim capes and\nshadowy islands as we glided by them in the solemnity of the night,\nunder the winking stars, and by and by got to talking about himself.  He\nseemed over-sentimental for a man whose salary was six dollars a week--\nor rather he might have seemed so to an older person than I. But I drank\nin his words hungrily, and with a faith that might have moved mountains\nif it had been applied judiciously. What was it to me that he was soiled\nand seedy and fragrant with gin? What was it to me that his grammar was\nbad, his construction worse, and his profanity so void of art that it\nwas an element of weakness rather than strength in his conversation?  He\nwas a wronged man, a man who had seen trouble, and that was enough for\nme. As he mellowed into his plaintive history his tears dripped upon the\nlantern in his lap, and I cried, too, from sympathy. He said he was the\nson of an English nobleman--either an earl or an alderman, he could not\nremember which, but believed was both; his father, the nobleman, loved\nhim, but his mother hated him from the cradle; and so while he was still\na little boy he was sent to 'one of them old, ancient colleges'--he\ncouldn't remember which; and by and by his father died and his mother\nseized the property and 'shook' him as he phrased it.  After his mother\nshook him, members of the nobility with whom he was acquainted used\ntheir influence to get him the position of 'loblolly-boy in a ship;' and\nfrom that point my watchman threw off all trammels of date and locality\nand branched out into a narrative that bristled all along with\nincredible adventures; a narrative that was so reeking with bloodshed\nand so crammed with hair-breadth escapes and the most engaging and\nunconscious personal villainies, that I sat speechless, enjoying,\nshuddering, wondering, worshipping.\n\nIt was a sore blight to find out afterwards that he was a low, vulgar,\nignorant, sentimental, half-witted humbug, an untraveled native of the\nwilds of Illinois, who had absorbed wildcat literature and appropriated\nits marvels, until in time he had woven odds and ends of the mess into\nthis yarn, and then gone on telling it to fledglings like me, until he\nhad come to believe it himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was the morning of\nthe twentieth day.  At noon we would reach Carson City, the capital of\nNevada Territory.  We were not glad, but sorry.  It had been a fine\npleasure trip; we had fed fat on wonders every day; we were now well\naccustomed to stage life, and very fond of it; so the idea of coming to a\nstand-still and settling down to a humdrum existence in a village was not\nagreeable, but on the contrary depressing.\n\nVisibly our new home was a desert, walled in by barren, snow-clad\nmountains.  There was not a tree in sight.  There was no vegetation but\nthe endless sage-brush and greasewood.  All nature was gray with it.  We\nwere plowing through great deeps of powdery alkali dust that rose in\nthick clouds and floated across the plain like smoke from a burning\nhouse.\n\nWe were coated with it like millers; so were the coach, the mules, the\nmail-bags, the driver--we and the sage-brush and the other scenery were\nall one monotonous color.  Long trains of freight wagons in the distance\nenvelope in ascending masses of dust suggested pictures of prairies on\nfire.  These teams and their masters were the only life we saw.\nOtherwise we moved in the midst of solitude, silence and desolation.\nEvery twenty steps we passed the skeleton of some dead beast of burthen,\nwith its dust-coated skin stretched tightly over its empty ribs.\nFrequently a solemn raven sat upon the skull or the hips and contemplated\nthe passing coach with meditative serenity.\n\nBy and by Carson City was pointed out to us.  It nestled in the edge of a\ngreat plain and was a sufficient number of miles away to look like an\nassemblage of mere white spots in the shadow of a grim range of mountains\noverlooking it, whose summits seemed lifted clear out of companionship\nand consciousness of earthly things.\n\nWe arrived, disembarked, and the stage went on.  It was a \"wooden\" town;\nits population two thousand souls.  The main street consisted of four or\nfive blocks of little white frame stores which were too high to sit down\non, but not too high for various other purposes; in fact, hardly high\nenough.  They were packed close together, side by side, as if room were\nscarce in that mighty plain.\n\nThe sidewalk was of boards that were more or less loose and inclined to\nrattle when walked upon.  In the middle of the town, opposite the stores,\nwas the \"plaza\" which is native to all towns beyond the Rocky Mountains\n--a large, unfenced, level vacancy, with a liberty pole in it, and very\nuseful as a place for public auctions, horse trades, and mass meetings,\nand likewise for teamsters to camp in.  Two other sides of the plaza were\nfaced by stores, offices and stables.\n\nThe rest of Carson City was pretty scattering.\n\nWe were introduced to several citizens, at the stage-office and on the\nway up to the Governor's from the hotel--among others, to a Mr. Harris,\nwho was on horseback; he began to say something, but interrupted himself\nwith the remark:\n\n\"I'll have to get you to excuse me a minute; yonder is the witness that\nswore I helped to rob the California coach--a piece of impertinent\nintermeddling, sir, for I am not even acquainted with the man.\"\n\nThen he rode over and began to rebuke the stranger with a six-shooter,\nand the stranger began to explain with another.  When the pistols were\nemptied, the stranger resumed his work (mending a whip-lash), and Mr.\nHarris rode by with a polite nod, homeward bound, with a bullet through\none of his lungs, and several in his hips; and from them issued little\nrivulets of blood that coursed down the horse's sides and made the animal\nlook quite picturesque.  I never saw Harris shoot a man after that but it\nrecalled to mind that first day in Carson.\n\nThis was all we saw that day, for it was two o'clock, now, and according\nto custom the daily \"Washoe Zephyr\" set in; a soaring dust-drift about\nthe size of the United States set up edgewise came with it, and the\ncapital of Nevada Territory disappeared from view.\n\nStill, there were sights to be seen which were not wholly uninteresting\nto new comers; for the vast dust cloud was thickly freckled with things\nstrange to the upper air--things living and dead, that flitted hither and\nthither, going and coming, appearing and disappearing among the rolling\nbillows of dust--hats, chickens and parasols sailing in the remote\nheavens; blankets, tin signs, sage-brush and shingles a shade lower;\ndoor-mats and buffalo robes lower still; shovels and coal scuttles on the\nnext grade; glass doors, cats and little children on the next; disrupted\nlumber yards, light buggies and wheelbarrows on the next; and down only\nthirty or forty feet above ground was a scurrying storm of emigrating\nroofs and vacant lots.\n\nIt was something to see that much.  I could have seen more, if I could\nhave kept the dust out of my eyes.\n\nBut seriously a Washoe wind is by no means a trifling matter.  It blows\nflimsy houses down, lifts shingle roofs occasionally, rolls up tin ones\nlike sheet music, now and then blows a stage coach over and spills the\npassengers; and tradition says the reason there are so many bald people\nthere, is, that the wind blows the hair off their heads while they are\nlooking skyward after their hats.  Carson streets seldom look inactive on\nSummer afternoons, because there are so many citizens skipping around\ntheir escaping hats, like chambermaids trying to head off a spider.\n\nThe \"Washoe Zephyr\" (Washoe is a pet nickname for Nevada) is a peculiar\nScriptural wind, in that no man knoweth \"whence it cometh.\"  That is to\nsay, where it originates.  It comes right over the mountains from the\nWest, but when one crosses the ridge he does not find any of it on the\nother side!  It probably is manufactured on the mountain-top for the\noccasion, and starts from there.  It is a pretty regular wind, in the\nsummer time.  Its office hours are from two in the afternoon till two the\nnext morning; and anybody venturing abroad during those twelve hours\nneeds to allow for the wind or he will bring up a mile or two to leeward\nof the point he is aiming at.  And yet the first complaint a Washoe\nvisitor to San Francisco makes, is that the sea winds blow so, there!\nThere is a good deal of human nature in that.\n\nWe found the state palace of the Governor of Nevada Territory to consist\nof a white frame one-story house with two small rooms in it and a\nstanchion supported shed in front--for grandeur--it compelled the respect\nof the citizen and inspired the Indians with awe.  The newly arrived\nChief and Associate Justices of the Territory, and other machinery of the\ngovernment, were domiciled with less splendor.  They were boarding around\nprivately, and had their offices in their bedrooms.\n\nThe Secretary and I took quarters in the \"ranch\" of a worthy French lady\nby the name of Bridget O'Flannigan, a camp follower of his Excellency the\nGovernor.  She had known him in his prosperity as commander-in-chief of\nthe Metropolitan Police of New York, and she would not desert him in his\nadversity as Governor of Nevada.\n\nOur room was on the lower floor, facing the plaza, and when we had got\nour bed, a small table, two chairs, the government fire-proof safe, and\nthe Unabridged Dictionary into it, there was still room enough left for a\nvisitor--may be two, but not without straining the walls.  But the walls\ncould stand it--at least the partitions could, for they consisted simply\nof one thickness of white \"cotton domestic\" stretched from corner to\ncorner of the room.  This was the rule in Carson--any other kind of\npartition was the rare exception.  And if you stood in a dark room and\nyour neighbors in the next had lights, the shadows on your canvas told\nqueer secrets sometimes!  Very often these partitions were made of old\nflour sacks basted together; and then the difference between the common\nherd and the aristocracy was, that the common herd had unornamented\nsacks, while the walls of the aristocrat were overpowering with\nrudimental fresco--i.e., red and blue mill brands on the flour sacks.\n\nOccasionally, also, the better classes embellished their canvas by\npasting pictures from Harper's Weekly on them.  In many cases, too, the\nwealthy and the cultured rose to spittoons and other evidences of a\nsumptuous and luxurious taste.  [Washoe people take a joke so hard that I\nmust explain that the above description was only the rule; there were\nmany honorable exceptions in Carson--plastered ceilings and houses that\nhad considerable furniture in them.--M. T.]\n\nWe had a carpet and a genuine queen's-ware washbowl.  Consequently we\nwere hated without reserve by the other tenants of the O'Flannigan\n\"ranch.\"  When we added a painted oilcloth window curtain, we simply took\nour lives into our own hands.  To prevent bloodshed I removed up stairs\nand took up quarters with the untitled plebeians in one of the fourteen\nwhite pine cot-bedsteads that stood in two long ranks in the one sole\nroom of which the second story consisted.\n\nIt was a jolly company, the fourteen.  They were principally voluntary\ncamp-followers of the Governor, who had joined his retinue by their own\nelection at New York and San Francisco and came along, feeling that in\nthe scuffle for little territorial crumbs and offices they could not make\ntheir condition more precarious than it was, and might reasonably expect\nto make it better.  They were popularly known as the \"Irish Brigade,\"\nthough there were only four or five Irishmen among all the Governor's\nretainers.\n\nHis good-natured Excellency was much annoyed at the gossip his henchmen\ncreated--especially when there arose a rumor that they were paid\nassassins of his, brought along to quietly reduce the democratic vote\nwhen desirable!\n\nMrs. O'Flannigan was boarding and lodging them at ten dollars a week\napiece, and they were cheerfully giving their notes for it.  They were\nperfectly satisfied, but Bridget presently found that notes that could\nnot be discounted were but a feeble constitution for a Carson\nboarding-house.  So she began to harry the Governor to find employment\nfor the \"Brigade.\"  Her importunities and theirs together drove him to a\ngentle desperation at last, and he finally summoned the Brigade to the\npresence. Then, said he:\n\n\"Gentlemen, I have planned a lucrative and useful service for you\n--a service which will provide you with recreation amid noble landscapes,\nand afford you never ceasing opportunities for enriching your minds by\nobservation and study.  I want you to survey a railroad from Carson City\nwestward to a certain point!  When the legislature meets I will have the\nnecessary bill passed and the remuneration arranged.\"\n\n\"What, a railroad over the Sierra Nevada Mountains?\"\n\n\"Well, then, survey it eastward to a certain point!\"\n\nHe converted them into surveyors, chain-bearers and so on, and turned\nthem loose in the desert.  It was \"recreation\" with a vengeance!\nRecreation on foot, lugging chains through sand and sage-brush, under a\nsultry sun and among cattle bones, cayotes and tarantulas.\n\n\"Romantic adventure\" could go no further.  They surveyed very slowly,\nvery deliberately, very carefully.  They returned every night during the\nfirst week, dusty, footsore, tired, and hungry, but very jolly.  They\nbrought in great store of prodigious hairy spiders--tarantulas--and\nimprisoned them in covered tumblers up stairs in the \"ranch.\"  After the\nfirst week, they had to camp on the field, for they were getting well\neastward.  They made a good many inquiries as to the location of that\nindefinite \"certain point,\" but got no information.  At last, to a\npeculiarly urgent inquiry of \"How far eastward?\"  Governor Nye\ntelegraphed back:\n\n\"To the Atlantic Ocean, blast you!--and then bridge it and go on!\"\n\nThis brought back the dusty toilers, who sent in a report and ceased from\ntheir labors.  The Governor was always comfortable about it; he said Mrs.\nO'Flannigan would hold him for the Brigade's board anyhow, and he\nintended to get what entertainment he could out of the boys; he said,\nwith his old-time pleasant twinkle, that he meant to survey them into\nUtah and then telegraph Brigham to hang them for trespass!\n\nThe surveyors brought back more tarantulas with them, and so we had quite\na menagerie arranged along the shelves of the room.  Some of these\nspiders could straddle over a common saucer with their hairy, muscular\nlegs, and when their feelings were hurt, or their dignity offended, they\nwere the wickedest-looking desperadoes the animal world can furnish.\nIf their glass prison-houses were touched ever so lightly they were up\nand spoiling for a fight in a minute.  Starchy?--proud?  Indeed, they\nwould take up a straw and pick their teeth like a member of Congress.\nThere was as usual a furious \"zephyr\" blowing the first night of the\nbrigade's return, and about midnight the roof of an adjoining stable blew\noff, and a corner of it came crashing through the side of our ranch.\nThere was a simultaneous awakening, and a tumultuous muster of the\nbrigade in the dark, and a general tumbling and sprawling over each other\nin the narrow aisle between the bedrows.  In the midst of the turmoil,\nBob H---- sprung up out of a sound sleep, and knocked down a shelf with\nhis head.  Instantly he shouted:\n\n\"Turn out, boys--the tarantulas is loose!\"\n\nNo warning ever sounded so dreadful.  Nobody tried, any longer, to leave\nthe room, lest he might step on a tarantula.  Every man groped for a\ntrunk or a bed, and jumped on it.  Then followed the strangest silence--a\nsilence of grisly suspense it was, too--waiting, expectancy, fear.  It\nwas as dark as pitch, and one had to imagine the spectacle of those\nfourteen scant-clad men roosting gingerly on trunks and beds, for not a\nthing could be seen.  Then came occasional little interruptions of the\nsilence, and one could recognize a man and tell his locality by his\nvoice, or locate any other sound a sufferer made by his gropings or\nchanges of position.  The occasional voices were not given to much\nspeaking--you simply heard a gentle ejaculation of \"Ow!\" followed by a\nsolid thump, and you knew the gentleman had felt a hairy blanket or\nsomething touch his bare skin and had skipped from a bed to the floor.\nAnother silence.  Presently you would hear a gasping voice say:\n\n\"Su--su--something's crawling up the back of my neck!\"\n\nEvery now and then you could hear a little subdued scramble and a\nsorrowful \"O Lord!\" and then you knew that somebody was getting away from\nsomething he took for a tarantula, and not losing any time about it,\neither.  Directly a voice in the corner rang out wild and clear:\n\n\"I've got him!  I've got him!\" [Pause, and probable change of\ncircumstances.]  \"No, he's got me!  Oh, ain't they never going to fetch a\nlantern!\"\n\nThe lantern came at that moment, in the hands of Mrs. O'Flannigan, whose\nanxiety to know the amount of damage done by the assaulting roof had not\nprevented her waiting a judicious interval, after getting out of bed and\nlighting up, to see if the wind was done, now, up stairs, or had a larger\ncontract.\n\nThe landscape presented when the lantern flashed into the room was\npicturesque, and might have been funny to some people, but was not to us.\nAlthough we were perched so strangely upon boxes, trunks and beds, and so\nstrangely attired, too, we were too earnestly distressed and too\ngenuinely miserable to see any fun about it, and there was not the\nsemblance of a smile anywhere visible.  I know I am not capable of\nsuffering more than I did during those few minutes of suspense in the\ndark, surrounded by those creeping, bloody-minded tarantulas.  I had\nskipped from bed to bed and from box to box in a cold agony, and every\ntime I touched anything that was furzy I fancied I felt the fangs.  I had\nrather go to war than live that episode over again.  Nobody was hurt.\nThe man who thought a tarantula had \"got him\" was mistaken--only a crack\nin a box had caught his finger.  Not one of those escaped tarantulas was\never seen again.  There were ten or twelve of them.  We took candles and\nhunted the place high and low for them, but with no success.  Did we go\nback to bed then?  We did nothing of the kind.  Money could not have\npersuaded us to do it.  We sat up the rest of the night playing cribbage\nand keeping a sharp lookout for the enemy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nIt was the end of August, and the skies were cloudless and the weather\nsuperb.  In two or three weeks I had grown wonderfully fascinated with\nthe curious new country and concluded to put off my return to \"the\nStates\" awhile.  I had grown well accustomed to wearing a damaged slouch\nhat, blue woolen shirt, and pants crammed into boot-tops, and gloried in\nthe absence of coat, vest and braces.  I felt rowdyish and \"bully,\" (as\nthe historian Josephus phrases it, in his fine chapter upon the\ndestruction of the Temple).  It seemed to me that nothing could be so\nfine and so romantic.  I had become an officer of the government, but\nthat was for mere sublimity.  The office was an unique sinecure.  I had\nnothing to do and no salary.  I was private Secretary to his majesty the\nSecretary and there was not yet writing enough for two of us.  So Johnny\nK---- and I devoted our time to amusement.  He was the young son of an\nOhio nabob and was out there for recreation.  He got it.  We had heard a\nworld of talk about the marvellous beauty of Lake Tahoe, and finally\ncuriosity drove us thither to see it.  Three or four members of the\nBrigade had been there and located some timber lands on its shores and\nstored up a quantity of provisions in their camp.  We strapped a couple\nof blankets on our shoulders and took an axe apiece and started--for we\nintended to take up a wood ranch or so ourselves and become wealthy.\nWe were on foot.  The reader will find it advantageous to go horseback.\nWe were told that the distance was eleven miles.  We tramped a long time\non level ground, and then toiled laboriously up a mountain about a\nthousand miles high and looked over.  No lake there.  We descended on the\nother side, crossed the valley and toiled up another mountain three or\nfour thousand miles high, apparently, and looked over again.  No lake\nyet.  We sat down tired and perspiring, and hired a couple of Chinamen to\ncurse those people who had beguiled us.  Thus refreshed, we presently\nresumed the march with renewed vigor and determination.  We plodded on,\ntwo or three hours longer, and at last the Lake burst upon us--a noble\nsheet of blue water lifted six thousand three hundred feet above the\nlevel of the sea, and walled in by a rim of snow-clad mountain peaks that\ntowered aloft full three thousand feet higher still!  It was a vast oval,\nand one would have to use up eighty or a hundred good miles in traveling\naround it.  As it lay there with the shadows of the mountains brilliantly\nphotographed upon its still surface I thought it must surely be the\nfairest picture the whole earth affords.\n\nWe found the small skiff belonging to the Brigade boys, and without loss\nof time set out across a deep bend of the lake toward the landmarks that\nsignified the locality of the camp.  I got Johnny to row--not because I\nmind exertion myself, but because it makes me sick to ride backwards when\nI am at work.  But I steered.  A three-mile pull brought us to the camp\njust as the night fell, and we stepped ashore very tired and wolfishly\nhungry.  In a \"cache\" among the rocks we found the provisions and the\ncooking utensils, and then, all fatigued as I was, I sat down on a\nboulder and superintended while Johnny gathered wood and cooked supper.\nMany a man who had gone through what I had, would have wanted to rest.\n\nIt was a delicious supper--hot bread, fried bacon, and black coffee.\nIt was a delicious solitude we were in, too.  Three miles away was a\nsaw-mill and some workmen, but there were not fifteen other human beings\nthroughout the wide circumference of the lake.  As the darkness closed\ndown and the stars came out and spangled the great mirror with jewels, we\nsmoked meditatively in the solemn hush and forgot our troubles and our\npains.  In due time we spread our blankets in the warm sand between two\nlarge boulders and soon feel asleep, careless of the procession of ants\nthat passed in through rents in our clothing and explored our persons.\nNothing could disturb the sleep that fettered us, for it had been fairly\nearned, and if our consciences had any sins on them they had to adjourn\ncourt for that night, any way.  The wind rose just as we were losing\nconsciousness, and we were lulled to sleep by the beating of the surf\nupon the shore.\n\nIt is always very cold on that lake shore in the night, but we had plenty\nof blankets and were warm enough.  We never moved a muscle all night, but\nwaked at early dawn in the original positions, and got up at once,\nthoroughly refreshed, free from soreness, and brim full of friskiness.\nThere is no end of wholesome medicine in such an experience.  That\nmorning we could have whipped ten such people as we were the day before\n--sick ones at any rate.  But the world is slow, and people will go to\n\"water cures\" and \"movement cures\" and to foreign lands for health.\nThree months of camp life on Lake Tahoe would restore an Egyptian mummy\nto his pristine vigor, and give him an appetite like an alligator.  I do\nnot mean the oldest and driest mummies, of course, but the fresher ones.\nThe air up there in the clouds is very pure and fine, bracing and\ndelicious.  And why shouldn't it be?--it is the same the angels breathe.\nI think that hardly any amount of fatigue can be gathered together that a\nman cannot sleep off in one night on the sand by its side.  Not under a\nroof, but under the sky; it seldom or never rains there in the summer\ntime.  I know a man who went there to die.  But he made a failure of it.\nHe was a skeleton when he came, and could barely stand.  He had no\nappetite, and did nothing but read tracts and reflect on the future.\nThree months later he was sleeping out of doors regularly, eating all he\ncould hold, three times a day, and chasing game over mountains three\nthousand feet high for recreation.  And he was a skeleton no longer, but\nweighed part of a ton.  This is no fancy sketch, but the truth.  His\ndisease was consumption.  I confidently commend his experience to other\nskeletons.\n\nI superintended again, and as soon as we had eaten breakfast we got in\nthe boat and skirted along the lake shore about three miles and\ndisembarked.  We liked the appearance of the place, and so we claimed\nsome three hundred acres of it and stuck our \"notices\" on a tree.  It was\nyellow pine timber land--a dense forest of trees a hundred feet high and\nfrom one to five feet through at the butt.  It was necessary to fence our\nproperty or we could not hold it.  That is to say, it was necessary to\ncut down trees here and there and make them fall in such a way as to form\na sort of enclosure (with pretty wide gaps in it).  We cut down three\ntrees apiece, and found it such heart-breaking work that we decided to\n\"rest our case\" on those; if they held the property, well and good; if\nthey didn't, let the property spill out through the gaps and go; it was\nno use to work ourselves to death merely to save a few acres of land.\nNext day we came back to build a house--for a house was also necessary,\nin order to hold the property.  We decided to build a substantial\nlog-house and excite the envy of the Brigade boys; but by the time we had\ncut and trimmed the first log it seemed unnecessary to be so elaborate,\nand so we concluded to build it of saplings.  However, two saplings, duly\ncut and trimmed, compelled recognition of the fact that a still modester\narchitecture would satisfy the law, and so we concluded to build a\n\"brush\" house.  We devoted the next day to this work, but we did so much\n\"sitting around\" and discussing, that by the middle of the afternoon we\nhad achieved only a half-way sort of affair which one of us had to watch\nwhile the other cut brush, lest if both turned our backs we might not be\nable to find it again, it had such a strong family resemblance to the\nsurrounding vegetation.  But we were satisfied with it.\n\nWe were land owners now, duly seized and possessed, and within the\nprotection of the law.  Therefore we decided to take up our residence on\nour own domain and enjoy that large sense of independence which only such\nan experience can bring.  Late the next afternoon, after a good long\nrest, we sailed away from the Brigade camp with all the provisions and\ncooking utensils we could carry off--borrow is the more accurate word\n--and just as the night was falling we beached the boat at our own landing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nIf there is any life that is happier than the life we led on our timber\nranch for the next two or three weeks, it must be a sort of life which I\nhave not read of in books or experienced in person.  We did not see a\nhuman being but ourselves during the time, or hear any sounds but those\nthat were made by the wind and the waves, the sighing of the pines, and\nnow and then the far-off thunder of an avalanche.  The forest about us\nwas dense and cool, the sky above us was cloudless and brilliant with\nsunshine, the broad lake before us was glassy and clear, or rippled and\nbreezy, or black and storm-tossed, according to Nature's mood; and its\ncircling border of mountain domes, clothed with forests, scarred with\nland-slides, cloven by canons and valleys, and helmeted with glittering\nsnow, fitly framed and finished the noble picture.  The view was always\nfascinating, bewitching, entrancing.  The eye was never tired of gazing,\nnight or day, in calm or storm; it suffered but one grief, and that was\nthat it could not look always, but must close sometimes in sleep.\n\nWe slept in the sand close to the water's edge, between two protecting\nboulders, which took care of the stormy night-winds for us.  We never\ntook any paregoric to make us sleep.  At the first break of dawn we were\nalways up and running foot-races to tone down excess of physical vigor\nand exuberance of spirits.  That is, Johnny was--but I held his hat.\nWhile smoking the pipe of peace after breakfast we watched the sentinel\npeaks put on the glory of the sun, and followed the conquering light as\nit swept down among the shadows, and set the captive crags and forests\nfree.  We watched the tinted pictures grow and brighten upon the water\ntill every little detail of forest, precipice and pinnacle was wrought in\nand finished, and the miracle of the enchanter complete.  Then to\n\"business.\"\n\nThat is, drifting around in the boat.  We were on the north shore.\nThere, the rocks on the bottom are sometimes gray, sometimes white.\nThis gives the marvelous transparency of the water a fuller advantage\nthan it has elsewhere on the lake.  We usually pushed out a hundred yards\nor so from shore, and then lay down on the thwarts, in the sun, and let\nthe boat drift by the hour whither it would.  We seldom talked.\nIt interrupted the Sabbath stillness, and marred the dreams the luxurious\nrest and indolence brought.  The shore all along was indented with deep,\ncurved bays and coves, bordered by narrow sand-beaches; and where the\nsand ended, the steep mountain-sides rose right up aloft into space--rose\nup like a vast wall a little out of the perpendicular, and thickly wooded\nwith tall pines.\n\nSo singularly clear was the water, that where it was only twenty or\nthirty feet deep the bottom was so perfectly distinct that the boat\nseemed floating in the air!  Yes, where it was even eighty feet deep.\nEvery little pebble was distinct, every speckled trout, every\nhand's-breadth of sand.  Often, as we lay on our faces, a granite\nboulder, as large as a village church, would start out of the bottom\napparently, and seem climbing up rapidly to the surface, till presently\nit threatened to touch our faces, and we could not resist the impulse to\nseize an oar and avert the danger.  But the boat would float on, and the\nboulder descend again, and then we could see that when we had been\nexactly above it, it must still have been twenty or thirty feet below the\nsurface.  Down through the transparency of these great depths, the water\nwas not merely transparent, but dazzlingly, brilliantly so.  All objects\nseen through it had a bright, strong vividness, not only of outline, but\nof every minute detail, which they would not have had when seen simply\nthrough the same depth of atmosphere.  So empty and airy did all spaces\nseem below us, and so strong was the sense of floating high aloft in\nmid-nothingness, that we called these boat-excursions \"balloon-voyages.\"\n\nWe fished a good deal, but we did not average one fish a week.  We could\nsee trout by the thousand winging about in the emptiness under us, or\nsleeping in shoals on the bottom, but they would not bite--they could see\nthe line too plainly, perhaps.  We frequently selected the trout we\nwanted, and rested the bait patiently and persistently on the end of his\nnose at a depth of eighty feet, but he would only shake it off with an\nannoyed manner, and shift his position.\n\nWe bathed occasionally, but the water was rather chilly, for all it\nlooked so sunny.  Sometimes we rowed out to the \"blue water,\" a mile or\ntwo from shore.  It was as dead blue as indigo there, because of the\nimmense depth.  By official measurement the lake in its centre is one\nthousand five hundred and twenty-five feet deep!\n\nSometimes, on lazy afternoons, we lolled on the sand in camp, and smoked\npipes and read some old well-worn novels.  At night, by the camp-fire, we\nplayed euchre and seven-up to strengthen the mind--and played them with\ncards so greasy and defaced that only a whole summer's acquaintance with\nthem could enable the student to tell the ace of clubs from the jack of\ndiamonds.\n\nWe never slept in our \"house.\"  It never recurred to us, for one thing;\nand besides, it was built to hold the ground, and that was enough.  We\ndid not wish to strain it.\n\nBy and by our provisions began to run short, and we went back to the old\ncamp and laid in a new supply.  We were gone all day, and reached home\nagain about night-fall, pretty tired and hungry.  While Johnny was\ncarrying the main bulk of the provisions up to our \"house\" for future\nuse, I took the loaf of bread, some slices of bacon, and the coffee-pot,\nashore, set them down by a tree, lit a fire, and went back to the boat to\nget the frying-pan.  While I was at this, I heard a shout from Johnny,\nand looking up I saw that my fire was galloping all over the premises!\nJohnny was on the other side of it.  He had to run through the flames to\nget to the lake shore, and then we stood helpless and watched the\ndevastation.\n\nThe ground was deeply carpeted with dry pine-needles, and the fire\ntouched them off as if they were gunpowder.  It was wonderful to see with\nwhat fierce speed the tall sheet of flame traveled!  My coffee-pot was\ngone, and everything with it.  In a minute and a half the fire seized\nupon a dense growth of dry manzanita chapparal six or eight feet high,\nand then the roaring and popping and crackling was something terrific.\nWe were driven to the boat by the intense heat, and there we remained,\nspell-bound.\n\nWithin half an hour all before us was a tossing, blinding tempest of\nflame!  It went surging up adjacent ridges--surmounted them and\ndisappeared in the canons beyond--burst into view upon higher and farther\nridges, presently--shed a grander illumination abroad, and dove again\n--flamed out again, directly, higher and still higher up the\nmountain-side--threw out skirmishing parties of fire here and there, and\nsent them trailing their crimson spirals away among remote ramparts and\nribs and gorges, till as far as the eye could reach the lofty\nmountain-fronts were webbed as it were with a tangled network of red lava\nstreams. Away across the water the crags and domes were lit with a ruddy\nglare, and the firmament above was a reflected hell!\n\nEvery feature of the spectacle was repeated in the glowing mirror of the\nlake!  Both pictures were sublime, both were beautiful; but that in the\nlake had a bewildering richness about it that enchanted the eye and held\nit with the stronger fascination.\n\nWe sat absorbed and motionless through four long hours.  We never thought\nof supper, and never felt fatigue.  But at eleven o'clock the\nconflagration had traveled beyond our range of vision, and then darkness\nstole down upon the landscape again.\n\nHunger asserted itself now, but there was nothing to eat.  The provisions\nwere all cooked, no doubt, but we did not go to see.  We were homeless\nwanderers again, without any property.  Our fence was gone, our house\nburned down; no insurance.  Our pine forest was well scorched, the dead\ntrees all burned up, and our broad acres of manzanita swept away.  Our\nblankets were on our usual sand-bed, however, and so we lay down and went\nto sleep.  The next morning we started back to the old camp, but while\nout a long way from shore, so great a storm came up that we dared not try\nto land.  So I baled out the seas we shipped, and Johnny pulled heavily\nthrough the billows till we had reached a point three or four miles\nbeyond the camp.  The storm was increasing, and it became evident that it\nwas better to take the hazard of beaching the boat than go down in a\nhundred fathoms of water; so we ran in, with tall white-caps following,\nand I sat down in the stern-sheets and pointed her head-on to the shore.\nThe instant the bow struck, a wave came over the stern that washed crew\nand cargo ashore, and saved a deal of trouble.  We shivered in the lee of\na boulder all the rest of the day, and froze all the night through.  In\nthe morning the tempest had gone down, and we paddled down to the camp\nwithout any unnecessary delay.  We were so starved that we ate up the\nrest of the Brigade's provisions, and then set out to Carson to tell them\nabout it and ask their forgiveness.  It was accorded, upon payment of\ndamages.\n\nWe made many trips to the lake after that, and had many a hair-breadth\nescape and blood-curdling adventure which will never be recorded in any\nhistory.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nI resolved to have a horse to ride.  I had never seen such wild, free,\nmagnificent horsemanship outside of a circus as these picturesquely-clad\nMexicans, Californians and Mexicanized Americans displayed in Carson\nstreets every day.  How they rode!  Leaning just gently forward out of\nthe perpendicular, easy and nonchalant, with broad slouch-hat brim blown\nsquare up in front, and long riata swinging above the head, they swept\nthrough the town like the wind!  The next minute they were only a sailing\npuff of dust on the far desert.  If they trotted, they sat up gallantly\nand gracefully, and seemed part of the horse; did not go jiggering up and\ndown after the silly Miss-Nancy fashion of the riding-schools.  I had\nquickly learned to tell a horse from a cow, and was full of anxiety to\nlearn more.  I was resolved to buy a horse.\n\nWhile the thought was rankling in my mind, the auctioneer came skurrying\nthrough the plaza on a black beast that had as many humps and corners on\nhim as a dromedary, and was necessarily uncomely; but he was \"going,\ngoing, at twenty-two!--horse, saddle and bridle at twenty-two dollars,\ngentlemen!\" and I could hardly resist.\n\nA man whom I did not know (he turned out to be the auctioneer's brother)\nnoticed the wistful look in my eye, and observed that that was a very\nremarkable horse to be going at such a price; and added that the saddle\nalone was worth the money.  It was a Spanish saddle, with ponderous\n'tapidaros', and furnished with the ungainly sole-leather covering with\nthe unspellable name.  I said I had half a notion to bid.  Then this\nkeen-eyed person appeared to me to be \"taking my measure\"; but I\ndismissed the suspicion when he spoke, for his manner was full of\nguileless candor and truthfulness.  Said he:\n\n\"I know that horse--know him well.  You are a stranger, I take it, and so\nyou might think he was an American horse, maybe, but I assure you he is\nnot.  He is nothing of the kind; but--excuse my speaking in a low voice,\nother people being near--he is, without the shadow of a doubt, a Genuine\nMexican Plug!\"\n\nI did not know what a Genuine Mexican Plug was, but there was something\nabout this man's way of saying it, that made me swear inwardly that I\nwould own a Genuine Mexican Plug, or die.\n\n\"Has he any other--er--advantages?\"  I inquired, suppressing what\neagerness I could.\n\nHe hooked his forefinger in the pocket of my army-shirt, led me to one\nside, and breathed in my ear impressively these words:\n\n\"He can out-buck anything in America!\"\n\n\"Going, going, going--at twent--ty--four dollars and a half, gen--\"\n\n\"Twenty-seven!\" I shouted, in a frenzy.\n\n\"And sold!\" said the auctioneer, and passed over the Genuine Mexican Plug\nto me.\n\nI could scarcely contain my exultation.  I paid the money, and put the\nanimal in a neighboring livery-stable to dine and rest himself.\n\nIn the afternoon I brought the creature into the plaza, and certain\ncitizens held him by the head, and others by the tail, while I mounted\nhim.  As soon as they let go, he placed all his feet in a bunch together,\nlowered his back, and then suddenly arched it upward, and shot me\nstraight into the air a matter of three or four feet!  I came as straight\ndown again, lit in the saddle, went instantly up again, came down almost\non the high pommel, shot up again, and came down on the horse's neck--all\nin the space of three or four seconds.  Then he rose and stood almost\nstraight up on his hind feet, and I, clasping his lean neck desperately,\nslid back into the saddle and held on.  He came down, and immediately\nhoisted his heels into the air, delivering a vicious kick at the sky, and\nstood on his forefeet.  And then down he came once more, and began the\noriginal exercise of shooting me straight up again.  The third time I\nwent up I heard a stranger say:\n\n\"Oh, don't he buck, though!\"\n\nWhile I was up, somebody struck the horse a sounding thwack with a\nleathern strap, and when I arrived again the Genuine Mexican Plug was not\nthere.  A California youth chased him up and caught him, and asked if he\nmight have a ride.  I granted him that luxury.  He mounted the Genuine,\ngot lifted into the air once, but sent his spurs home as he descended,\nand the horse darted away like a telegram.  He soared over three fences\nlike a bird, and disappeared down the road toward the Washoe Valley.\n\nI sat down on a stone, with a sigh, and by a natural impulse one of my\nhands sought my forehead, and the other the base of my stomach.  I\nbelieve I never appreciated, till then, the poverty of the human\nmachinery--for I still needed a hand or two to place elsewhere.  Pen\ncannot describe how I was jolted up.  Imagination cannot conceive how\ndisjointed I was--how internally, externally and universally I was\nunsettled, mixed up and ruptured.  There was a sympathetic crowd around\nme, though.\n\nOne elderly-looking comforter said:\n\n\"Stranger, you've been taken in.  Everybody in this camp knows that\nhorse.  Any child, any Injun, could have told you that he'd buck; he is\nthe very worst devil to buck on the continent of America.  You hear me.\nI'm Curry.  Old Curry.  Old Abe Curry.  And moreover, he is a simon-pure,\nout-and-out, genuine d--d Mexican plug, and an uncommon mean one at that,\ntoo.  Why, you turnip, if you had laid low and kept dark, there's chances\nto buy an American horse for mighty little more than you paid for that\nbloody old foreign relic.\"\n\nI gave no sign; but I made up my mind that if the auctioneer's brother's\nfuneral took place while I was in the Territory I would postpone all\nother recreations and attend it.\n\nAfter a gallop of sixteen miles the Californian youth and the Genuine\nMexican Plug came tearing into town again, shedding foam-flakes like the\nspume-spray that drives before a typhoon, and, with one final skip over a\nwheelbarrow and a Chinaman, cast anchor in front of the \"ranch.\"\n\nSuch panting and blowing!  Such spreading and contracting of the red\nequine nostrils, and glaring of the wild equine eye!  But was the\nimperial beast subjugated?  Indeed he was not.\n\nHis lordship the Speaker of the House thought he was, and mounted him to\ngo down to the Capitol; but the first dash the creature made was over a\npile of telegraph poles half as high as a church; and his time to the\nCapitol--one mile and three quarters--remains unbeaten to this day.  But\nthen he took an advantage--he left out the mile, and only did the three\nquarters.  That is to say, he made a straight cut across lots, preferring\nfences and ditches to a crooked road; and when the Speaker got to the\nCapitol he said he had been in the air so much he felt as if he had made\nthe trip on a comet.\n\nIn the evening the Speaker came home afoot for exercise, and got the\nGenuine towed back behind a quartz wagon.  The next day I loaned the\nanimal to the Clerk of the House to go down to the Dana silver mine, six\nmiles, and he walked back for exercise, and got the horse towed.\nEverybody I loaned him to always walked back; they never could get enough\nexercise any other way.\n\nStill, I continued to loan him to anybody who was willing to borrow him,\nmy idea being to get him crippled, and throw him on the borrower's hands,\nor killed, and make the borrower pay for him.  But somehow nothing ever\nhappened to him.  He took chances that no other horse ever took and\nsurvived, but he always came out safe.  It was his daily habit to try\nexperiments that had always before been considered impossible, but he\nalways got through.  Sometimes he miscalculated a little, and did not get\nhis rider through intact, but he always got through himself.  Of course I\nhad tried to sell him; but that was a stretch of simplicity which met\nwith little sympathy.  The auctioneer stormed up and down the streets on\nhim for four days, dispersing the populace, interrupting business, and\ndestroying children, and never got a bid--at least never any but the\neighteen-dollar one he hired a notoriously substanceless bummer to make.\nThe people only smiled pleasantly, and restrained their desire to buy, if\nthey had any.  Then the auctioneer brought in his bill, and I withdrew\nthe horse from the market.  We tried to trade him off at private vendue\nnext, offering him at a sacrifice for second-hand tombstones, old iron,\ntemperance tracts--any kind of property.  But holders were stiff, and we\nretired from the market again.  I never tried to ride the horse any more.\nWalking was good enough exercise for a man like me, that had nothing the\nmatter with him except ruptures, internal injuries, and such things.\nFinally I tried to give him away.  But it was a failure.  Parties said\nearthquakes were handy enough on the Pacific coast--they did not wish to\nown one.  As a last resort I offered him to the Governor for the use of\nthe \"Brigade.\"  His face lit up eagerly at first, but toned down again,\nand he said the thing would be too palpable.\n\nJust then the livery stable man brought in his bill for six weeks'\nkeeping--stall-room for the horse, fifteen dollars; hay for the horse,\ntwo hundred and fifty!  The Genuine Mexican Plug had eaten a ton of the\narticle, and the man said he would have eaten a hundred if he had let\nhim.\n\nI will remark here, in all seriousness, that the regular price of hay\nduring that year and a part of the next was really two hundred and fifty\ndollars a ton.  During a part of the previous year it had sold at five\nhundred a ton, in gold, and during the winter before that there was such\nscarcity of the article that in several instances small quantities had\nbrought eight hundred dollars a ton in coin!  The consequence might be\nguessed without my telling it: peopled turned their stock loose to\nstarve, and before the spring arrived Carson and Eagle valleys were\nalmost literally carpeted with their carcases!  Any old settler there\nwill verify these statements.\n\nI managed to pay the livery bill, and that same day I gave the Genuine\nMexican Plug to a passing Arkansas emigrant whom fortune delivered into\nmy hand.  If this ever meets his eye, he will doubtless remember the\ndonation.\n\nNow whoever has had the luck to ride a real Mexican plug will recognize\nthe animal depicted in this chapter, and hardly consider him exaggerated\n--but the uninitiated will feel justified in regarding his portrait as a\nfancy sketch, perhaps.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nOriginally, Nevada was a part of Utah and was called Carson county; and a\npretty large county it was, too.  Certain of its valleys produced no end\nof hay, and this attracted small colonies of Mormon stock-raisers and\nfarmers to them.  A few orthodox Americans straggled in from California,\nbut no love was lost between the two classes of colonists.  There was\nlittle or no friendly intercourse; each party staid to itself.  The\nMormons were largely in the majority, and had the additional advantage of\nbeing peculiarly under the protection of the Mormon government of the\nTerritory.  Therefore they could afford to be distant, and even\nperemptory toward their neighbors.  One of the traditions of Carson\nValley illustrates the condition of things that prevailed at the time I\nspeak of.  The hired girl of one of the American families was Irish, and\na Catholic; yet it was noted with surprise that she was the only person\noutside of the Mormon ring who could get favors from the Mormons.  She\nasked kindnesses of them often, and always got them.  It was a mystery to\neverybody.  But one day as she was passing out at the door, a large bowie\nknife dropped from under her apron, and when her mistress asked for an\nexplanation she observed that she was going out to \"borry a wash-tub from\nthe Mormons!\"\n\nIn 1858 silver lodes were discovered in \"Carson County,\" and then the\naspect of things changed.  Californians began to flock in, and the\nAmerican element was soon in the majority.  Allegiance to Brigham Young\nand Utah was renounced, and a temporary territorial government for\n\"Washoe\" was instituted by the citizens.  Governor Roop was the first and\nonly chief magistrate of it.  In due course of time Congress passed a\nbill to organize \"Nevada Territory,\" and President Lincoln sent out\nGovernor Nye to supplant Roop.\n\nAt this time the population of the Territory was about twelve or fifteen\nthousand, and rapidly increasing.  Silver mines were being vigorously\ndeveloped and silver mills erected.  Business of all kinds was active and\nprosperous and growing more so day by day.\n\nThe people were glad to have a legitimately constituted government, but\ndid not particularly enjoy having strangers from distant States put in\nauthority over them--a sentiment that was natural enough.  They thought\nthe officials should have been chosen from among themselves from among\nprominent citizens who had earned a right to such promotion, and who\nwould be in sympathy with the populace and likewise thoroughly acquainted\nwith the needs of the Territory.  They were right in viewing the matter\nthus, without doubt.  The new officers were \"emigrants,\" and that was no\ntitle to anybody's affection or admiration either.\n\nThe new government was received with considerable coolness.  It was not\nonly a foreign intruder, but a poor one.  It was not even worth plucking\n--except by the smallest of small fry office-seekers and such.  Everybody\nknew that Congress had appropriated only twenty thousand dollars a year\nin greenbacks for its support--about money enough to run a quartz mill a\nmonth.  And everybody knew, also, that the first year's money was still\nin Washington, and that the getting hold of it would be a tedious and\ndifficult process.  Carson City was too wary and too wise to open up a\ncredit account with the imported bantling with anything like indecent\nhaste.\n\nThere is something solemnly funny about the struggles of a new-born\nTerritorial government to get a start in this world.  Ours had a trying\ntime of it.  The Organic Act and the \"instructions\" from the State\nDepartment commanded that a legislature should be elected at\nsuch-and-such a time, and its sittings inaugurated at such-and-such a\ndate.  It was easy to get legislators, even at three dollars a day,\nalthough board was four dollars and fifty cents, for distinction has its\ncharm in Nevada as well as elsewhere, and there were plenty of patriotic\nsouls out of employment; but to get a legislative hall for them to meet\nin was another matter altogether.  Carson blandly declined to give a room\nrent-free, or let one to the government on credit.\n\nBut when Curry heard of the difficulty, he came forward, solitary and\nalone, and shouldered the Ship of State over the bar and got her afloat\nagain.  I refer to \"Curry--Old Curry--Old Abe Curry.\"  But for him the\nlegislature would have been obliged to sit in the desert.  He offered his\nlarge stone building just outside the capital limits, rent-free, and it\nwas gladly accepted.  Then he built a horse-railroad from town to the\ncapitol, and carried the legislators gratis.\n\nHe also furnished pine benches and chairs for the legislature, and\ncovered the floors with clean saw-dust by way of carpet and spittoon\ncombined.  But for Curry the government would have died in its tender\ninfancy.  A canvas partition to separate the Senate from the House of\nRepresentatives was put up by the Secretary, at a cost of three dollars\nand forty cents, but the United States declined to pay for it.  Upon\nbeing reminded that the \"instructions\" permitted the payment of a liberal\nrent for a legislative hall, and that that money was saved to the country\nby Mr. Curry's generosity, the United States said that did not alter the\nmatter, and the three dollars and forty cents would be subtracted from\nthe Secretary's eighteen hundred dollar salary--and it was!\n\nThe matter of printing was from the beginning an interesting feature of\nthe new government's difficulties.  The Secretary was sworn to obey his\nvolume of written \"instructions,\" and these commanded him to do two\ncertain things without fail, viz.:\n\n1.  Get the House and Senate journals printed; and,\n2.  For this work, pay one dollar and fifty cents per \"thousand\" for\ncomposition, and one dollar and fifty cents per \"token\" for press-work,\nin greenbacks.\n\nIt was easy to swear to do these two things, but it was entirely\nimpossible to do more than one of them.  When greenbacks had gone down to\nforty cents on the dollar, the prices regularly charged everybody by\nprinting establishments were one dollar and fifty cents per \"thousand\"\nand one dollar and fifty cents per \"token,\" in gold.  The \"instructions\"\ncommanded that the Secretary regard a paper dollar issued by the\ngovernment as equal to any other dollar issued by the government.  Hence\nthe printing of the journals was discontinued.  Then the United States\nsternly rebuked the Secretary for disregarding the \"instructions,\" and\nwarned him to correct his ways.  Wherefore he got some printing done,\nforwarded the bill to Washington with full exhibits of the high prices of\nthings in the Territory, and called attention to a printed market report\nwherein it would be observed that even hay was two hundred and fifty\ndollars a ton.  The United States responded by subtracting the\nprinting-bill from the Secretary's suffering salary--and moreover\nremarked with dense gravity that he would find nothing in his\n\"instructions\" requiring him to purchase hay!\n\nNothing in this world is palled in such impenetrable obscurity as a U.S.\nTreasury Comptroller's understanding.  The very fires of the hereafter\ncould get up nothing more than a fitful glimmer in it.  In the days I\nspeak of he never could be made to comprehend why it was that twenty\nthousand dollars would not go as far in Nevada, where all commodities\nranged at an enormous figure, as it would in the other Territories, where\nexceeding cheapness was the rule.  He was an officer who looked out for\nthe little expenses all the time.  The Secretary of the Territory kept\nhis office in his bedroom, as I before remarked; and he charged the\nUnited States no rent, although his \"instructions\" provided for that item\nand he could have justly taken advantage of it (a thing which I would\nhave done with more than lightning promptness if I had been Secretary\nmyself).  But the United States never applauded this devotion.  Indeed, I\nthink my country was ashamed to have so improvident a person in its\nemploy.\n\nThose \"instructions\" (we used to read a chapter from them every morning,\nas intellectual gymnastics, and a couple of chapters in Sunday school\nevery Sabbath, for they treated of all subjects under the sun and had\nmuch valuable religious matter in them along with the other statistics)\nthose \"instructions\" commanded that pen-knives, envelopes, pens and\nwriting-paper be furnished the members of the legislature.  So the\nSecretary made the purchase and the distribution.  The knives cost three\ndollars apiece.  There was one too many, and the Secretary gave it to the\nClerk of the House of Representatives.  The United States said the Clerk\nof the House was not a \"member\" of the legislature, and took that three\ndollars out of the Secretary's salary, as usual.\n\nWhite men charged three or four dollars a \"load\" for sawing up\nstove-wood.  The Secretary was sagacious enough to know that the United\nStates would never pay any such price as that; so he got an Indian to saw\nup a load of office wood at one dollar and a half.  He made out the usual\nvoucher, but signed no name to it--simply appended a note explaining that\nan Indian had done the work, and had done it in a very capable and\nsatisfactory way, but could not sign the voucher owing to lack of ability\nin the necessary direction.  The Secretary had to pay that dollar and a\nhalf.  He thought the United States would admire both his economy and his\nhonesty in getting the work done at half price and not putting a\npretended Indian's signature to the voucher, but the United States did\nnot see it in that light.\n\nThe United States was too much accustomed to employing dollar-and-a-half\nthieves in all manner of official capacities to regard his explanation of\nthe voucher as having any foundation in fact.\n\nBut the next time the Indian sawed wood for us I taught him to make a\ncross at the bottom of the voucher--it looked like a cross that had been\ndrunk a year--and then I \"witnessed\" it and it went through all right.\nThe United States never said a word.  I was sorry I had not made the\nvoucher for a thousand loads of wood instead of one.\n\nThe government of my country snubs honest simplicity but fondles artistic\nvillainy, and I think I might have developed into a very capable\npickpocket if I had remained in the public service a year or two.\n\nThat was a fine collection of sovereigns, that first Nevada legislature.\nThey levied taxes to the amount of thirty or forty thousand dollars and\nordered expenditures to the extent of about a million.  Yet they had\ntheir little periodical explosions of economy like all other bodies of\nthe kind.  A member proposed to save three dollars a day to the nation by\ndispensing with the Chaplain.  And yet that short-sighted man needed the\nChaplain more than any other member, perhaps, for he generally sat with\nhis feet on his desk, eating raw turnips, during the morning prayer.\n\nThe legislature sat sixty days, and passed private tollroad franchises\nall the time.  When they adjourned it was estimated that every citizen\nowned about three franchises, and it was believed that unless Congress\ngave the Territory another degree of longitude there would not be room\nenough to accommodate the toll-roads.  The ends of them were hanging over\nthe boundary line everywhere like a fringe.\n\nThe fact is, the freighting business had grown to such important\nproportions that there was nearly as much excitement over suddenly\nacquired toll-road fortunes as over the wonderful silver mines.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nBy and by I was smitten with the silver fever.  \"Prospecting parties\"\nwere leaving for the mountains every day, and discovering and taking\npossession of rich silver-bearing lodes and ledges of quartz.  Plainly\nthis was the road to fortune.  The great \"Gould and Curry\" mine was held\nat three or four hundred dollars a foot when we arrived; but in two\nmonths it had sprung up to eight hundred.  The \"Ophir\" had been worth\nonly a mere trifle, a year gone by, and now it was selling at nearly four\nthousand dollars a foot!  Not a mine could be named that had not\nexperienced an astonishing advance in value within a short time.\nEverybody was talking about these marvels.  Go where you would, you heard\nnothing else, from morning till far into the night.  Tom So-and-So had\nsold out of the \"Amanda Smith\" for $40,000--hadn't a cent when he \"took\nup\" the ledge six months ago.  John Jones had sold half his interest in\nthe \"Bald Eagle and Mary Ann\" for $65,000, gold coin, and gone to the\nStates for his family.  The widow Brewster had \"struck it rich\" in the\n\"Golden Fleece\" and sold ten feet for $18,000--hadn't money enough to buy\na crape bonnet when Sing-Sing Tommy killed her husband at Baldy Johnson's\nwake last spring.  The \"Last Chance\" had found a \"clay casing\" and knew\nthey were \"right on the ledge\"--consequence, \"feet\" that went begging\nyesterday were worth a brick house apiece to-day, and seedy owners who\ncould not get trusted for a drink at any bar in the country yesterday\nwere roaring drunk on champagne to-day and had hosts of warm personal\nfriends in a town where they had forgotten how to bow or shake hands from\nlong-continued want of practice.  Johnny Morgan, a common loafer, had\ngone to sleep in the gutter and waked up worth a hundred thousand\ndollars, in consequence of the decision in the \"Lady Franklin and Rough\nand Ready\" lawsuit.  And so on--day in and day out the talk pelted our\nears and the excitement waxed hotter and hotter around us.\n\nI would have been more or less than human if I had not gone mad like the\nrest.  Cart-loads of solid silver bricks, as large as pigs of lead, were\narriving from the mills every day, and such sights as that gave substance\nto the wild talk about me.  I succumbed and grew as frenzied as the\ncraziest.\n\nEvery few days news would come of the discovery of a bran-new mining\nregion; immediately the papers would teem with accounts of its richness,\nand away the surplus population would scamper to take possession.  By the\ntime I was fairly inoculated with the disease, \"Esmeralda\" had just had a\nrun and \"Humboldt\" was beginning to shriek for attention.  \"Humboldt!\nHumboldt!\" was the new cry, and straightway Humboldt, the newest of the\nnew, the richest of the rich, the most marvellous of the marvellous\ndiscoveries in silver-land was occupying two columns of the public prints\nto \"Esmeralda's\" one.  I was just on the point of starting to Esmeralda,\nbut turned with the tide and got ready for Humboldt.  That the reader may\nsee what moved me, and what would as surely have moved him had he been\nthere, I insert here one of the newspaper letters of the day.  It and\nseveral other letters from the same calm hand were the main means of\nconverting me.  I shall not garble the extract, but put it in just as it\nappeared in the Daily Territorial Enterprise:\n\n      But what about our mines?  I shall be candid with you.  I shall\n      express an honest opinion, based upon a thorough examination.\n      Humboldt county is the richest mineral region upon God's footstool.\n      Each mountain range is gorged with the precious ores.  Humboldt is\n      the true Golconda.\n\n      The other day an assay of mere croppings yielded exceeding four\n      thousand dollars to the ton.  A week or two ago an assay of just\n      such surface developments made returns of seven thousand dollars to\n      the ton.  Our mountains are full of rambling prospectors.  Each day\n      and almost every hour reveals new and more startling evidences of\n      the profuse and intensified wealth of our favored county.  The metal\n      is not silver alone.  There are distinct ledges of auriferous ore.\n      A late discovery plainly evinces cinnabar.  The coarser metals are\n      in gross abundance.  Lately evidences of bituminous coal have been\n      detected.  My theory has ever been that coal is a ligneous\n      formation.  I told Col.  Whitman, in times past, that the\n      neighborhood of Dayton (Nevada) betrayed no present or previous\n      manifestations of a ligneous foundation, and that hence I had no\n      confidence in his lauded coal mines.  I repeated the same doctrine\n      to the exultant coal discoverers of Humboldt.  I talked with my\n      friend Captain Burch on the subject.  My pyrhanism vanished upon his\n      statement that in the very region referred to he had seen petrified\n      trees of the length of two hundred feet.  Then is the fact\n      established that huge forests once cast their grim shadows over this\n      remote section.  I am firm in the coal faith.\n\n      Have no fears of the mineral resources of Humboldt county.  They are\n      immense--incalculable.\n\nLet me state one or two things which will help the reader to better\ncomprehend certain items in the above.  At this time, our near neighbor,\nGold Hill, was the most successful silver mining locality in Nevada.  It\nwas from there that more than half the daily shipments of silver bricks\ncame.  \"Very rich\" (and scarce) Gold Hill ore yielded from $100 to $400\nto the ton; but the usual yield was only $20 to $40 per ton--that is to\nsay, each hundred pounds of ore yielded from one dollar to two dollars.\nBut the reader will perceive by the above extract, that in Humboldt from\none fourth to nearly half the mass was silver!  That is to say, every one\nhundred pounds of the ore had from two hundred dollars up to about three\nhundred and fifty in it.  Some days later this same correspondent wrote:\n\n      I have spoken of the vast and almost fabulous wealth of this\n      region--it is incredible.  The intestines of our mountains are\n      gorged with precious ore to plethora.  I have said that nature\n      has so shaped our mountains as to furnish most excellent\n      facilities for the working of our mines.  I have also told you\n      that the country about here is pregnant with the finest mill\n      sites in the world.  But what is the mining history of Humboldt?\n      The Sheba mine is in the hands of energetic San Francisco\n      capitalists.  It would seem that the ore is combined with metals\n      that render it difficult of reduction with our imperfect mountain\n      machinery.  The proprietors have combined the capital and labor\n      hinted at in my exordium.  They are toiling and probing.  Their\n      tunnel has reached the length of one hundred feet.  From primal\n      assays alone, coupled with the development of the mine and public\n      confidence in the continuance of effort, the stock had reared\n      itself to eight hundred dollars market value.  I do not know that\n      one ton of the ore has been converted into current metal.  I do\n      know that there are many lodes in this section that surpass the\n      Sheba in primal assay value.  Listen a moment to the calculations\n      of the Sheba operators.  They purpose transporting the ore\n      concentrated to Europe.  The conveyance from Star City (its\n      locality) to Virginia City will cost seventy dollars per ton;\n      from Virginia to San Francisco, forty dollars per ton; from\n      thence to Liverpool, its destination, ten dollars per ton.  Their\n      idea is that its conglomerate metals will reimburse them their\n      cost of original extraction, the price of transportation, and the\n      expense of reduction, and that then a ton of the raw ore will net\n      them twelve hundred dollars.  The estimate may be extravagant.\n      Cut it in twain, and the product is enormous, far transcending\n      any previous developments of our racy Territory.\n\n      A very common calculation is that many of our mines will yield\n      five hundred dollars to the ton.  Such fecundity throws the Gould\n      & Curry, the Ophir and the Mexican, of your neighborhood, in the\n      darkest shadow.  I have given you the estimate of the value of a\n      single developed mine.  Its richness is indexed by its market\n      valuation.  The people of Humboldt county are feet crazy.  As I\n      write, our towns are near deserted.  They look as languid as a\n      consumptive girl.  What has become of our sinewy and athletic\n      fellow-citizens?  They are coursing through ravines and over\n      mountain tops.  Their tracks are visible in every direction.\n      Occasionally a horseman will dash among us.  His steed betrays\n      hard usage.  He alights before his adobe dwelling, hastily\n      exchanges courtesies with his townsmen, hurries to an assay\n      office and from thence to the District Recorder's.  In the\n      morning, having renewed his provisional supplies, he is off again\n      on his wild and unbeaten route.  Why, the fellow numbers already\n      his feet by the thousands.  He is the horse-leech.  He has the\n      craving stomach of the shark or anaconda.  He would conquer\n      metallic worlds.\n\nThis was enough.  The instant we had finished reading the above article,\nfour of us decided to go to Humboldt.  We commenced getting ready at\nonce.  And we also commenced upbraiding ourselves for not deciding\nsooner--for we were in terror lest all the rich mines would be found and\nsecured before we got there, and we might have to put up with ledges that\nwould not yield more than two or three hundred dollars a ton, maybe.  An\nhour before, I would have felt opulent if I had owned ten feet in a Gold\nHill mine whose ore produced twenty-five dollars to the ton; now I was\nalready annoyed at the prospect of having to put up with mines the\npoorest of which would be a marvel in Gold Hill.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nHurry, was the word!  We wasted no time.  Our party consisted of four\npersons--a blacksmith sixty years of age, two young lawyers, and myself.\nWe bought a wagon and two miserable old horses.  We put eighteen hundred\npounds of provisions and mining tools in the wagon and drove out of\nCarson on a chilly December afternoon.  The horses were so weak and old\nthat we soon found that it would be better if one or two of us got out\nand walked.  It was an improvement.  Next, we found that it would be\nbetter if a third man got out.  That was an improvement also.  It was at\nthis time that I volunteered to drive, although I had never driven a\nharnessed horse before and many a man in such a position would have felt\nfairly excused from such a responsibility.  But in a little while it was\nfound that it would be a fine thing if the drive got out and walked also.\nIt was at this time that I resigned the position of driver, and never\nresumed it again.  Within the hour, we found that it would not only be\nbetter, but was absolutely necessary, that we four, taking turns, two at\na time, should put our hands against the end of the wagon and push it\nthrough the sand, leaving the feeble horses little to do but keep out of\nthe way and hold up the tongue.  Perhaps it is well for one to know his\nfate at first, and get reconciled to it.  We had learned ours in one\nafternoon.  It was plain that we had to walk through the sand and shove\nthat wagon and those horses two hundred miles.  So we accepted the\nsituation, and from that time forth we never rode.  More than that, we\nstood regular and nearly constant watches pushing up behind.\n\nWe made seven miles, and camped in the desert.  Young Clagett (now member\nof Congress from Montana) unharnessed and fed and watered the horses;\nOliphant and I cut sagebrush, built the fire and brought water to cook\nwith; and old Mr. Ballou the blacksmith did the cooking.  This division\nof labor, and this appointment, was adhered to throughout the journey.\nWe had no tent, and so we slept under our blankets in the open plain.  We\nwere so tired that we slept soundly.\n\nWe were fifteen days making the trip--two hundred miles; thirteen,\nrather, for we lay by a couple of days, in one place, to let the horses\nrest.\n\nWe could really have accomplished the journey in ten days if we had towed\nthe horses behind the wagon, but we did not think of that until it was\ntoo late, and so went on shoving the horses and the wagon too when we\nmight have saved half the labor.  Parties who met us, occasionally,\nadvised us to put the horses in the wagon, but Mr. Ballou, through whose\niron-clad earnestness no sarcasm could pierce, said that that would not\ndo, because the provisions were exposed and would suffer, the horses\nbeing \"bituminous from long deprivation.\"  The reader will excuse me from\ntranslating.  What Mr. Ballou customarily meant, when he used a long\nword, was a secret between himself and his Maker.  He was one of the best\nand kindest hearted men that ever graced a humble sphere of life.  He was\ngentleness and simplicity itself--and unselfishness, too.  Although he\nwas more than twice as old as the eldest of us, he never gave himself any\nairs, privileges, or exemptions on that account.  He did a young man's\nshare of the work; and did his share of conversing and entertaining from\nthe general stand-point of any age--not from the arrogant, overawing\nsummit-height of sixty years.  His one striking peculiarity was his\nPartingtonian fashion of loving and using big words for their own sakes,\nand independent of any bearing they might have upon the thought he was\npurposing to convey.  He always let his ponderous syllables fall with an\neasy unconsciousness that left them wholly without offensiveness.\nIn truth his air was so natural and so simple that one was always\ncatching himself accepting his stately sentences as meaning something,\nwhen they really meant nothing in the world.  If a word was long and\ngrand and resonant, that was sufficient to win the old man's love, and he\nwould drop that word into the most out-of-the-way place in a sentence or\na subject, and be as pleased with it as if it were perfectly luminous\nwith meaning.\n\nWe four always spread our common stock of blankets together on the frozen\nground, and slept side by side; and finding that our foolish, long-legged\nhound pup had a deal of animal heat in him, Oliphant got to admitting him\nto the bed, between himself and Mr. Ballou, hugging the dog's warm back\nto his breast and finding great comfort in it.  But in the night the pup\nwould get stretchy and brace his feet against the old man's back and\nshove, grunting complacently the while; and now and then, being warm and\nsnug, grateful and happy, he would paw the old man's back simply in\nexcess of comfort; and at yet other times he would dream of the chase and\nin his sleep tug at the old man's back hair and bark in his ear.  The old\ngentleman complained mildly about these familiarities, at last, and when\nhe got through with his statement he said that such a dog as that was not\na proper animal to admit to bed with tired men, because he was \"so\nmeretricious in his movements and so organic in his emotions.\"  We turned\nthe dog out.\n\nIt was a hard, wearing, toilsome journey, but it had its bright side; for\nafter each day was done and our wolfish hunger appeased with a hot supper\nof fried bacon, bread, molasses and black coffee, the pipe-smoking,\nsong-singing and yarn-spinning around the evening camp-fire in the still\nsolitudes of the desert was a happy, care-free sort of recreation that\nseemed the very summit and culmination of earthly luxury.\n\nIt is a kind of life that has a potent charm for all men, whether city or\ncountry-bred.  We are descended from desert-lounging Arabs, and countless\nages of growth toward perfect civilization have failed to root out of us\nthe nomadic instinct.  We all confess to a gratified thrill at the\nthought of \"camping out.\"\n\nOnce we made twenty-five miles in a day, and once we made forty miles\n(through the Great American Desert), and ten miles beyond--fifty in all\n--in twenty-three hours, without halting to eat, drink or rest.  To stretch\nout and go to sleep, even on stony and frozen ground, after pushing a\nwagon and two horses fifty miles, is a delight so supreme that for the\nmoment it almost seems cheap at the price.\n\nWe camped two days in the neighborhood of the \"Sink of the Humboldt.\"\nWe tried to use the strong alkaline water of the Sink, but it would not\nanswer.  It was like drinking lye, and not weak lye, either.  It left a\ntaste in the mouth, bitter and every way execrable, and a burning in the\nstomach that was very uncomfortable.  We put molasses in it, but that\nhelped it very little; we added a pickle, yet the alkali was the\nprominent taste and so it was unfit for drinking.\n\nThe coffee we made of this water was the meanest compound man has yet\ninvented.  It was really viler to the taste than the unameliorated water\nitself.  Mr. Ballou, being the architect and builder of the beverage felt\nconstrained to endorse and uphold it, and so drank half a cup, by little\nsips, making shift to praise it faintly the while, but finally threw out\nthe remainder, and said frankly it was \"too technical for him.\"\n\nBut presently we found a spring of fresh water, convenient, and then,\nwith nothing to mar our enjoyment, and no stragglers to interrupt it, we\nentered into our rest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nAfter leaving the Sink, we traveled along the Humboldt river a little\nway.  People accustomed to the monster mile-wide Mississippi, grow\naccustomed to associating the term \"river\" with a high degree of watery\ngrandeur.  Consequently, such people feel rather disappointed when they\nstand on the shores of the Humboldt or the Carson and find that a \"river\"\nin Nevada is a sickly rivulet which is just the counterpart of the Erie\ncanal in all respects save that the canal is twice as long and four times\nas deep.  One of the pleasantest and most invigorating exercises one can\ncontrive is to run and jump across the Humboldt river till he is\noverheated, and then drink it dry.\n\nOn the fifteenth day we completed our march of two hundred miles and\nentered Unionville, Humboldt county, in the midst of a driving\nsnow-storm.  Unionville consisted of eleven cabins and a liberty-pole.\nSix of the cabins were strung along one side of a deep canyon, and the\nother five faced them.  The rest of the landscape was made up of bleak\nmountain walls that rose so high into the sky from both sides of the\ncanyon that the village was left, as it were, far down in the bottom of a\ncrevice. It was always daylight on the mountain tops a long time before\nthe darkness lifted and revealed Unionville.\n\nWe built a small, rude cabin in the side of the crevice and roofed it\nwith canvas, leaving a corner open to serve as a chimney, through which\nthe cattle used to tumble occasionally, at night, and mash our furniture\nand interrupt our sleep.  It was very cold weather and fuel was scarce.\nIndians brought brush and bushes several miles on their backs; and when\nwe could catch a laden Indian it was well--and when we could not (which\nwas the rule, not the exception), we shivered and bore it.\n\nI confess, without shame, that I expected to find masses of silver lying\nall about the ground.  I expected to see it glittering in the sun on the\nmountain summits.  I said nothing about this, for some instinct told me\nthat I might possibly have an exaggerated idea about it, and so if I\nbetrayed my thought I might bring derision upon myself.  Yet I was as\nperfectly satisfied in my own mind as I could be of anything, that I was\ngoing to gather up, in a day or two, or at furthest a week or two, silver\nenough to make me satisfactorily wealthy--and so my fancy was already\nbusy with plans for spending this money.  The first opportunity that\noffered, I sauntered carelessly away from the cabin, keeping an eye on\nthe other boys, and stopping and contemplating the sky when they seemed\nto be observing me; but as soon as the coast was manifestly clear, I fled\naway as guiltily as a thief might have done and never halted till I was\nfar beyond sight and call.  Then I began my search with a feverish\nexcitement that was brimful of expectation--almost of certainty.\nI crawled about the ground, seizing and examining bits of stone, blowing\nthe dust from them or rubbing them on my clothes, and then peering at\nthem with anxious hope.  Presently I found a bright fragment and my heart\nbounded!  I hid behind a boulder and polished it and scrutinized it with\na nervous eagerness and a delight that was more pronounced than absolute\ncertainty itself could have afforded.  The more I examined the fragment\nthe more I was convinced that I had found the door to fortune.  I marked\nthe spot and carried away my specimen.  Up and down the rugged mountain\nside I searched, with always increasing interest and always augmenting\ngratitude that I had come to Humboldt and come in time.  Of all the\nexperiences of my life, this secret search among the hidden treasures of\nsilver-land was the nearest to unmarred ecstasy.  It was a delirious\nrevel.\n\nBy and by, in the bed of a shallow rivulet, I found a deposit of shining\nyellow scales, and my breath almost forsook me!  A gold mine, and in my\nsimplicity I had been content with vulgar silver!  I was so excited that\nI half believed my overwrought imagination was deceiving me.  Then a fear\ncame upon me that people might be observing me and would guess my secret.\nMoved by this thought, I made a circuit of the place, and ascended a\nknoll to reconnoiter.  Solitude.  No creature was near.  Then I returned\nto my mine, fortifying myself against possible disappointment, but my\nfears were groundless--the shining scales were still there.  I set about\nscooping them out, and for an hour I toiled down the windings of the\nstream and robbed its bed.  But at last the descending sun warned me to\ngive up the quest, and I turned homeward laden with wealth.  As I walked\nalong I could not help smiling at the thought of my being so excited over\nmy fragment of silver when a nobler metal was almost under my nose.  In\nthis little time the former had so fallen in my estimation that once or\ntwice I was on the point of throwing it away.\n\nThe boys were as hungry as usual, but I could eat nothing.  Neither could\nI talk.  I was full of dreams and far away.  Their conversation\ninterrupted the flow of my fancy somewhat, and annoyed me a little, too.\nI despised the sordid and commonplace things they talked about.  But as\nthey proceeded, it began to amuse me.  It grew to be rare fun to hear\nthem planning their poor little economies and sighing over possible\nprivations and distresses when a gold mine, all our own, lay within sight\nof the cabin and I could point it out at any moment.  Smothered hilarity\nbegan to oppress me, presently.  It was hard to resist the impulse to\nburst out with exultation and reveal everything; but I did resist.  I\nsaid within myself that I would filter the great news through my lips\ncalmly and be serene as a summer morning while I watched its effect in\ntheir faces.  I said:\n\n\"Where have you all been?\"\n\n\"Prospecting.\"\n\n\"What did you find?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Nothing?  What do you think of the country?\"\n\n\"Can't tell, yet,\" said Mr. Ballou, who was an old gold miner, and had\nlikewise had considerable experience among the silver mines.\n\n\"Well, haven't you formed any sort of opinion?\"\n\n\"Yes, a sort of a one.  It's fair enough here, may be, but overrated.\nSeven thousand dollar ledges are scarce, though.\n\n\"That Sheba may be rich enough, but we don't own it; and besides, the rock\nis so full of base metals that all the science in the world can't work\nit.  We'll not starve, here, but we'll not get rich, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"So you think the prospect is pretty poor?\"\n\n\"No name for it!\"\n\n\"Well, we'd better go back, hadn't we?\"\n\n\"Oh, not yet--of course not.  We'll try it a riffle, first.\"\n\n\"Suppose, now--this is merely a supposition, you know--suppose you could\nfind a ledge that would yield, say, a hundred and fifty dollars a ton\n--would that satisfy you?\"\n\n\"Try us once!\" from the whole party.\n\n\"Or suppose--merely a supposition, of course--suppose you were to find a\nledge that would yield two thousand dollars a ton--would that satisfy\nyou?\"\n\n\"Here--what do you mean?  What are you coming at?  Is there some mystery\nbehind all this?\"\n\n\"Never mind.  I am not saying anything.  You know perfectly well there\nare no rich mines here--of course you do.  Because you have been around\nand examined for yourselves.  Anybody would know that, that had been\naround.  But just for the sake of argument, suppose--in a kind of general\nway--suppose some person were to tell you that two-thousand-dollar ledges\nwere simply contemptible--contemptible, understand--and that right yonder\nin sight of this very cabin there were piles of pure gold and pure\nsilver--oceans of it--enough to make you all rich in twenty-four hours!\nCome!\"\n\n\"I should say he was as crazy as a loon!\" said old Ballou, but wild with\nexcitement, nevertheless.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said I, \"I don't say anything--I haven't been around, you\nknow, and of course don't know anything--but all I ask of you is to cast\nyour eye on that, for instance, and tell me what you think of it!\" and I\ntossed my treasure before them.\n\nThere was an eager scramble for it, and a closing of heads together over\nit under the candle-light.  Then old Ballou said:\n\n\"Think of it?  I think it is nothing but a lot of granite rubbish and\nnasty glittering mica that isn't worth ten cents an acre!\"\n\nSo vanished my dream.  So melted my wealth away.  So toppled my airy\ncastle to the earth and left me stricken and forlorn.\n\nMoralizing, I observed, then, that \"all that glitters is not gold.\"\n\nMr. Ballou said I could go further than that, and lay it up among my\ntreasures of knowledge, that nothing that glitters is gold.  So I learned\nthen, once for all, that gold in its native state is but dull,\nunornamental stuff, and that only low-born metals excite the admiration\nof the ignorant with an ostentatious glitter.  However, like the rest of\nthe world, I still go on underrating men of gold and glorifying men of\nmica.  Commonplace human nature cannot rise above that.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nTrue knowledge of the nature of silver mining came fast enough.  We went\nout \"prospecting\" with Mr. Ballou.  We climbed the mountain sides, and\nclambered among sage-brush, rocks and snow till we were ready to drop\nwith exhaustion, but found no silver--nor yet any gold.  Day after day we\ndid this.  Now and then we came upon holes burrowed a few feet into the\ndeclivities and apparently abandoned; and now and then we found one or\ntwo listless men still burrowing.  But there was no appearance of silver.\nThese holes were the beginnings of tunnels, and the purpose was to drive\nthem hundreds of feet into the mountain, and some day tap the hidden\nledge where the silver was.  Some day!  It seemed far enough away, and\nvery hopeless and dreary.  Day after day we toiled, and climbed and\nsearched, and we younger partners grew sicker and still sicker of the\npromiseless toil.  At last we halted under a beetling rampart of rock\nwhich projected from the earth high upon the mountain.  Mr. Ballou broke\noff some fragments with a hammer, and examined them long and attentively\nwith a small eye-glass; threw them away and broke off more; said this\nrock was quartz, and quartz was the sort of rock that contained silver.\nContained it!  I had thought that at least it would be caked on the\noutside of it like a kind of veneering.  He still broke off pieces and\ncritically examined them, now and then wetting the piece with his tongue\nand applying the glass.  At last he exclaimed:\n\n\"We've got it!\"\n\nWe were full of anxiety in a moment.  The rock was clean and white, where\nit was broken, and across it ran a ragged thread of blue.  He said that\nthat little thread had silver in it, mixed with base metal, such as lead\nand antimony, and other rubbish, and that there was a speck or two of\ngold visible.  After a great deal of effort we managed to discern some\nlittle fine yellow specks, and judged that a couple of tons of them\nmassed together might make a gold dollar, possibly.  We were not\njubilant, but Mr. Ballou said there were worse ledges in the world than\nthat.  He saved what he called the \"richest\" piece of the rock, in order\nto determine its value by the process called the \"fire-assay.\"  Then we\nnamed the mine \"Monarch of the Mountains\" (modesty of nomenclature is not\na prominent feature in the mines), and Mr. Ballou wrote out and stuck up\nthe following \"notice,\" preserving a copy to be entered upon the books in\nthe mining recorder's office in the town.\n\n      \"NOTICE.\"\n\n      \"We the undersigned claim three claims, of three hundred feet each\n      (and one for discovery), on this silver-bearing quartz lead or lode,\n      extending north and south from this notice, with all its dips,\n      spurs, and angles, variations and sinuosities, together with fifty\n      feet of ground on either side for working the same.\"\n\nWe put our names to it and tried to feel that our fortunes were made.\nBut when we talked the matter all over with Mr. Ballou, we felt depressed\nand dubious.  He said that this surface quartz was not all there was of\nour mine; but that the wall or ledge of rock called the \"Monarch of the\nMountains,\" extended down hundreds and hundreds of feet into the earth\n--he illustrated by saying it was like a curb-stone, and maintained a\nnearly uniform thickness-say twenty feet--away down into the bowels of\nthe earth, and was perfectly distinct from the casing rock on each side\nof it; and that it kept to itself, and maintained its distinctive\ncharacter always, no matter how deep it extended into the earth or how\nfar it stretched itself through and across the hills and valleys.  He\nsaid it might be a mile deep and ten miles long, for all we knew; and\nthat wherever we bored into it above ground or below, we would find gold\nand silver in it, but no gold or silver in the meaner rock it was cased\nbetween.  And he said that down in the great depths of the ledge was its\nrichness, and the deeper it went the richer it grew.  Therefore, instead\nof working here on the surface, we must either bore down into the rock\nwith a shaft till we came to where it was rich--say a hundred feet or so\n--or else we must go down into the valley and bore a long tunnel into the\nmountain side and tap the ledge far under the earth.  To do either was\nplainly the labor of months; for we could blast and bore only a few feet\na day--some five or six.  But this was not all.  He said that after we\ngot the ore out it must be hauled in wagons to a distant silver-mill,\nground up, and the silver extracted by a tedious and costly process.  Our\nfortune seemed a century away!\n\nBut we went to work.  We decided to sink a shaft.  So, for a week we\nclimbed the mountain, laden with picks, drills, gads, crowbars, shovels,\ncans of blasting powder and coils of fuse and strove with might and main.\nAt first the rock was broken and loose and we dug it up with picks and\nthrew it out with shovels, and the hole progressed very well.  But the\nrock became more compact, presently, and gads and crowbars came into\nplay.  But shortly nothing could make an impression but blasting powder.\n\nThat was the weariest work!  One of us held the iron drill in its place\nand another would strike with an eight-pound sledge--it was like driving\nnails on a large scale.  In the course of an hour or two the drill would\nreach a depth of two or three feet, making a hole a couple of inches in\ndiameter.  We would put in a charge of powder, insert half a yard of\nfuse, pour in sand and gravel and ram it down, then light the fuse and\nrun.  When the explosion came and the rocks and smoke shot into the air,\nwe would go back and find about a bushel of that hard, rebellious quartz\njolted out.  Nothing more.  One week of this satisfied me.  I resigned.\nClagget and Oliphant followed.  Our shaft was only twelve feet deep.  We\ndecided that a tunnel was the thing we wanted.\n\nSo we went down the mountain side and worked a week; at the end of which\ntime we had blasted a tunnel about deep enough to hide a hogshead in, and\njudged that about nine hundred feet more of it would reach the ledge.\nI resigned again, and the other boys only held out one day longer.\nWe decided that a tunnel was not what we wanted.  We wanted a ledge that\nwas already \"developed.\"  There were none in the camp.\n\nWe dropped the \"Monarch\" for the time being.\n\nMeantime the camp was filling up with people, and there was a constantly\ngrowing excitement about our Humboldt mines.  We fell victims to the\nepidemic and strained every nerve to acquire more \"feet.\"  We prospected\nand took up new claims, put \"notices\" on them and gave them grandiloquent\nnames.  We traded some of our \"feet\" for \"feet\" in other people's claims.\nIn a little while we owned largely in the \"Gray Eagle,\" the \"Columbiana,\"\nthe \"Branch Mint,\" the \"Maria Jane,\" the \"Universe,\" the\n\"Root-Hog-or-Die,\" the \"Samson and Delilah,\" the \"Treasure Trove,\" the\n\"Golconda,\" the \"Sultana,\" the \"Boomerang,\" the \"Great Republic,\" the\n\"Grand Mogul,\" and fifty other \"mines\" that had never been molested by a\nshovel or scratched with a pick.  We had not less than thirty thousand\n\"feet\" apiece in the \"richest mines on earth\" as the frenzied cant\nphrased it--and were in debt to the butcher.  We were stark mad with\nexcitement--drunk with happiness--smothered under mountains of\nprospective wealth--arrogantly compassionate toward the plodding millions\nwho knew not our marvellous canyon--but our credit was not good at the\ngrocer's.\n\nIt was the strangest phase of life one can imagine.  It was a beggars'\nrevel.  There was nothing doing in the district--no mining--no milling\n--no productive effort--no income--and not enough money in the entire camp\nto buy a corner lot in an eastern village, hardly; and yet a stranger\nwould have supposed he was walking among bloated millionaires.\nProspecting parties swarmed out of town with the first flush of dawn, and\nswarmed in again at nightfall laden with spoil--rocks.  Nothing but\nrocks.  Every man's pockets were full of them; the floor of his cabin was\nlittered with them; they were disposed in labeled rows on his shelves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nI met men at every turn who owned from one thousand to thirty thousand\n\"feet\" in undeveloped silver mines, every single foot of which they\nbelieved would shortly be worth from fifty to a thousand dollars--and as\noften as any other way they were men who had not twenty-five dollars in\nthe world.  Every man you met had his new mine to boast of, and his\n\"specimens\" ready; and if the opportunity offered, he would infallibly\nback you into a corner and offer as a favor to you, not to him, to part\nwith just a few feet in the \"Golden Age,\" or the \"Sarah Jane,\" or some\nother unknown stack of croppings, for money enough to get a \"square meal\"\nwith, as the phrase went.  And you were never to reveal that he had made\nyou the offer at such a ruinous price, for it was only out of friendship\nfor you that he was willing to make the sacrifice.  Then he would fish a\npiece of rock out of his pocket, and after looking mysteriously around as\nif he feared he might be waylaid and robbed if caught with such wealth in\nhis possession, he would dab the rock against his tongue, clap an\neyeglass to it, and exclaim:\n\n\"Look at that!  Right there in that red dirt!  See it?  See the specks of\ngold?  And the streak of silver?  That's from the Uncle Abe.  There's a\nhundred thousand tons like that in sight!  Right in sight, mind you!\nAnd when we get down on it and the ledge comes in solid, it will be the\nrichest thing in the world!  Look at the assay!  I don't want you to\nbelieve me--look at the assay!\"\n\nThen he would get out a greasy sheet of paper which showed that the\nportion of rock assayed had given evidence of containing silver and gold\nin the proportion of so many hundreds or thousands of dollars to the ton.\n\n\nI little knew, then, that the custom was to hunt out the richest piece of\nrock and get it assayed!  Very often, that piece, the size of a filbert,\nwas the only fragment in a ton that had a particle of metal in it--and\nyet the assay made it pretend to represent the average value of the ton\nof rubbish it came from!\n\nOn such a system of assaying as that, the Humboldt world had gone crazy.\nOn the authority of such assays its newspaper correspondents were\nfrothing about rock worth four and seven thousand dollars a ton!\n\nAnd does the reader remember, a few pages back, the calculations, of a\nquoted correspondent, whereby the ore is to be mined and shipped all the\nway to England, the metals extracted, and the gold and silver contents\nreceived back by the miners as clear profit, the copper, antimony and\nother things in the ore being sufficient to pay all the expenses\nincurred?  Everybody's head was full of such \"calculations\" as those\n--such raving insanity, rather.  Few people took work into their\ncalculations--or outlay of money either; except the work and expenditures\nof other people.\n\nWe never touched our tunnel or our shaft again.  Why?  Because we judged\nthat we had learned the real secret of success in silver mining--which\nwas, not to mine the silver ourselves by the sweat of our brows and the\nlabor of our hands, but to sell the ledges to the dull slaves of toil and\nlet them do the mining!\n\nBefore leaving Carson, the Secretary and I had purchased \"feet\" from\nvarious Esmeralda stragglers.  We had expected immediate returns of\nbullion, but were only afflicted with regular and constant \"assessments\"\ninstead--demands for money wherewith to develop the said mines.  These\nassessments had grown so oppressive that it seemed necessary to look into\nthe matter personally.  Therefore I projected a pilgrimage to Carson and\nthence to Esmeralda.  I bought a horse and started, in company with\nMr. Ballou and a gentleman named Ollendorff, a Prussian--not the party\nwho has inflicted so much suffering on the world with his wretched\nforeign grammars, with their interminable repetitions of questions which\nnever have occurred and are never likely to occur in any conversation\namong human beings.  We rode through a snow-storm for two or three days,\nand arrived at \"Honey Lake Smith's,\" a sort of isolated inn on the Carson\nriver.  It was a two-story log house situated on a small knoll in the\nmidst of the vast basin or desert through which the sickly Carson winds\nits melancholy way.  Close to the house were the Overland stage stables,\nbuilt of sun-dried bricks.  There was not another building within several\nleagues of the place.  Towards sunset about twenty hay-wagons arrived and\ncamped around the house and all the teamsters came in to supper--a very,\nvery rough set.  There were one or two Overland stage drivers there,\nalso, and half a dozen vagabonds and stragglers; consequently the house\nwas well crowded.\n\nWe walked out, after supper, and visited a small Indian camp in the\nvicinity.  The Indians were in a great hurry about something, and were\npacking up and getting away as fast as they could.  In their broken\nEnglish they said, \"By'm-by, heap water!\" and by the help of signs made\nus understand that in their opinion a flood was coming.  The weather was\nperfectly clear, and this was not the rainy season.  There was about a\nfoot of water in the insignificant river--or maybe two feet; the stream\nwas not wider than a back alley in a village, and its banks were scarcely\nhigher than a man's head.\n\nSo, where was the flood to come from?  We canvassed the subject awhile\nand then concluded it was a ruse, and that the Indians had some better\nreason for leaving in a hurry than fears of a flood in such an\nexceedingly dry time.\n\nAt seven in the evening we went to bed in the second story--with our\nclothes on, as usual, and all three in the same bed, for every available\nspace on the floors, chairs, etc., was in request, and even then there\nwas barely room for the housing of the inn's guests.  An hour later we\nwere awakened by a great turmoil, and springing out of bed we picked our\nway nimbly among the ranks of snoring teamsters on the floor and got to\nthe front windows of the long room.  A glance revealed a strange\nspectacle, under the moonlight.  The crooked Carson was full to the brim,\nand its waters were raging and foaming in the wildest way--sweeping\naround the sharp bends at a furious speed, and bearing on their surface a\nchaos of logs, brush and all sorts of rubbish.  A depression, where its\nbed had once been, in other times, was already filling, and in one or two\nplaces the water was beginning to wash over the main bank.  Men were\nflying hither and thither, bringing cattle and wagons close up to the\nhouse, for the spot of high ground on which it stood extended only some\nthirty feet in front and about a hundred in the rear.  Close to the old\nriver bed just spoken of, stood a little log stable, and in this our\nhorses were lodged.\n\nWhile we looked, the waters increased so fast in this place that in a few\nminutes a torrent was roaring by the little stable and its margin\nencroaching steadily on the logs.  We suddenly realized that this flood\nwas not a mere holiday spectacle, but meant damage--and not only to the\nsmall log stable but to the Overland buildings close to the main river,\nfor the waves had now come ashore and were creeping about the foundations\nand invading the great hay-corral adjoining.  We ran down and joined the\ncrowd of excited men and frightened animals.  We waded knee-deep into the\nlog stable, unfastened the horses and waded out almost waist-deep, so\nfast the waters increased.  Then the crowd rushed in a body to the\nhay-corral and began to tumble down the huge stacks of baled hay and roll\nthe bales up on the high ground by the house.  Meantime it was discovered\nthat Owens, an overland driver, was missing, and a man ran to the large\nstable, and wading in, boot-top deep, discovered him asleep in his bed,\nawoke him, and waded out again.  But Owens was drowsy and resumed his\nnap; but only for a minute or two, for presently he turned in his bed,\nhis hand dropped over the side and came in contact with the cold water!\nIt was up level with the mattress!  He waded out, breast-deep, almost,\nand the next moment the sun-burned bricks melted down like sugar and the\nbig building crumbled to a ruin and was washed away in a twinkling.\n\nAt eleven o'clock only the roof of the little log stable was out of\nwater, and our inn was on an island in mid-ocean.  As far as the eye\ncould reach, in the moonlight, there was no desert visible, but only a\nlevel waste of shining water.  The Indians were true prophets, but how\ndid they get their information?  I am not able to answer the question.\nWe remained cooped up eight days and nights with that curious crew.\nSwearing, drinking and card playing were the order of the day, and\noccasionally a fight was thrown in for variety.  Dirt and vermin--but let\nus forget those features; their profusion is simply inconceivable--it is\nbetter that they remain so.\n\nThere were two men----however, this chapter is long enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It had seemed to deliver all power into the hands of the ignorant and non-tax-paying classes; and of a necessity the responsible offices were filled from these classes also.\n\nA remedy was sought. The people believed they had found it; not in the destruction of universal suffrage, but in the enlargement of it. It was an odd idea, and ingenious. You must understand, the constitution gave every man a vote; therefore that vote was a vested right, and could not be taken away. But the constitution did not say that certain individuals might not be given two votes, or ten! So an amendatory clause was inserted in a quiet way; a clause which authorised the enlargement of the suffrage in certain cases to be specified by statute. To offer to \u201climit\u201d the suffrage might have made instant trouble; the offer to \u201cenlarge\u201d it had a pleasant aspect. But of course the newspapers soon began to suspect; and then out they came! It was found, however, that for once--and for the first time in the history of the republic--property, character, and intellect were able to wield a political influence; for once, money, virtue, and intelligence took a vital and a united interest in a political question; for once these powers went to the \u201cprimaries\u201d in strong force; for once the best men in the nation were put forward as candidates for that parliament whose business it should be to enlarge the suffrage. The weightiest half of the press quickly joined forces with the new movement, and left the other half to rail about the proposed \u201cdestruction of the liberties\u201d of the bottom layer of society, the hitherto governing class of the community.\n\nThe victory was complete. The new law was framed and passed. Under it every citizen, howsoever poor or ignorant, possessed one vote, so universal suffrage still reigned; but if a man possessed a good common-school education and no money, he had two votes; a high-school education gave him four; if he had property likewise, to the value of three thousand 'sacos,' he wielded one more vote; for every fifty thousand 'sacos' a man added to his property, he was entitled to another vote; a university education entitled a man to nine votes, even though he owned no property. Therefore, learning being more prevalent and more easily acquired than riches, educated men became a wholesome check upon wealthy men, since they could outvote them. Learning goes usually with uprightness, broad views, and humanity; so the learned voters, possessing the balance of power, became the vigilant and efficient protectors of the great lower rank of society.\n\nAnd now a curious thing developed itself--a sort of emulation, whose object was voting power! Whereas formerly a man was honored only according to the amount of money he possessed, his grandeur was measured now by the number of votes he wielded. A man with only one vote was conspicuously respectful to his neighbor who possessed three. And if he was a man above the common-place, he was as conspicuously energetic in his determination to acquire three for himself. This spirit of emulation invaded all ranks. Votes based upon capital were commonly called \u201cmortal\u201d votes, because they could be lost; those based upon learning were called \u201cimmortal,\u201d because they were permanent, and because of their customarily imperishable character they were naturally more valued than the other sort. I say \u201ccustomarily\u201d for the reason that these votes were not absolutely imperishable, since insanity could suspend them.\n\nUnder this system, gambling and speculation almost ceased in the republic. A man honoured as the possessor of great voting power could not afford to risk the loss of it upon a doubtful chance.\n\nIt was curious to observe the manners and customs which the enlargement plan produced. Walking the street with a friend one day he delivered a careless bow to a passer-by, and then remarked that that person possessed only one vote and would probably never earn another; he was more respectful to the next acquaintance he met; he explained that this salute was a four-vote bow. I tried to \u201caverage\u201d the importance of the people he accosted after that, by the nature of his bows, but my success was only partial, because of the somewhat greater homage paid to the immortals than to the mortals. My friend explained. He said there was no law to regulate this thing, except that most powerful of all laws, custom. Custom had created these varying bows, and in time they had become easy and natural. At this moment he delivered himself of a very profound salute, and then said, \u201cNow there's a man who began life as a shoemaker's apprentice, and without education; now he swings twenty-two mortal votes and two immortal ones; he expects to pass a high-school examination this year and climb a couple of votes higher among the immortals; mighty valuable citizen.\u201d\n\nBy and by my friend met a venerable personage, and not only made him a most elaborate bow, but also took off his hat. I took off mine, too, with a mysterious awe. I was beginning to be infected.\n\n\u201cWhat grandee is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is our most illustrious astronomer. He hasn't any money, but is fearfully learned. Nine immortals is his political weight! He would swing a hundred and fifty votes if our system were perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there any altitude of mere moneyed grandeur that you take off your hat to?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Nine immortal votes is the only power we uncover for--that is, in civil life. Very great officials receive that mark of homage, of course.\u201d\n\nIt was common to hear people admiringly mention men who had begun life on the lower levels and in time achieved great voting-power. It was also common to hear youths planning a future of ever so many votes for themselves. I heard shrewd mammas speak of certain young men as good \u201ccatches\u201d because they possessed such-and-such a number of votes. I knew of more than one case where an heiress was married to a youngster who had but one vote; the argument being that he was gifted with such excellent parts that in time he would acquire a good voting strength, and perhaps in the long run be able to outvote his wife, if he had luck.\n\nCompetitive examinations were the rule and in all official grades. I remarked that the questions asked the candidates were wild, intricate, and often required a sort of knowledge not needed in the office sought.\n\n\u201cCan a fool or an ignoramus answer them?\u201d asked the person I was talking with.\n\n\u201cCertainly not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you will not find any fools or ignoramuses among our officials.\u201d\n\nI felt rather cornered, but made shift to say:--\n\n\u201cBut these questions cover a good deal more ground than is necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter; if candidates can answer these it is tolerably fair evidence that they can answer nearly any other question you choose to ask them.\u201d\n\nThere were some things in Gondour which one could not shut his eyes to. One was, that ignorance and incompetence had no place in the government. Brains and property managed the state. A candidate for office must have marked ability, education, and high character, or he stood no sort of chance of election. If a hod-carrier possessed these, he could succeed; but the mere fact that he was a hod-carrier could not elect him, as in previous times.\n\nIt was now a very great honour to be in the parliament or in office; under the old system such distinction had only brought suspicion upon a man and made him a helpless mark for newspaper contempt and scurrility. Officials did not need to steal now, their salaries being vast in comparison with the pittances paid in the days when parliaments were created by hod-carriers, who viewed official salaries from a hod-carrying point of view and compelled that view to be respected by their obsequious servants. Justice was wisely and rigidly administered; for a judge, after once reaching his place through the specified line of promotions, was a permanency during good behaviour. He was not obliged to modify his judgments according to the effect they might have upon the temper of a reigning political party.\n\nThe country was mainly governed by a ministry which went out with the administration that created it. This was also the case with the chiefs of the great departments. Minor officials ascended to their several positions through well-earned promotions, and not by a jump from gin-mills or the needy families and friends of members of parliament. Good behaviour measured their terms of office.\n\nThe head of the government, the Grand Caliph, was elected for a term of twenty years. I questioned the wisdom of this. I was answered that he could do no harm, since the ministry and the parliament governed the land, and he was liable to impeachment for misconduct. This great office had twice been ably filled by women, women as aptly fitted for it as some of the sceptred queens of history. Members of the cabinet, under many administrations, had been women.\n\nI found that the pardoning power was lodged in a court of pardons, consisting of several great judges. Under the old regime, this important power was vested in a single official, and he usually took care to have a general jail delivery in time for the next election.\n\nI inquired about public schools. There were plenty of them, and of free colleges too. I inquired about compulsory education. This was received with a smile, and the remark:--\n\n\u201cWhen a man's child is able to make himself powerful and honoured according to the amount of education he acquires, don't you suppose that that parent will apply the compulsion himself? Our free schools and free colleges require no law to fill them.\u201d\n\nThere was a loving pride of country about this person's way of speaking which annoyed me. I had long been unused to the sound of it in my own. The Gondour national airs were forever dinning in my ears; therefore I was glad to leave that country and come back to my dear native land, where one never hears that sort of music.\n\n\n\n\n\nA MEMORY\n\nWhen I say that I never knew my austere father to be enamoured of but one poem in all the long half century that he lived, persons who knew him will easily believe me; when I say that I have never composed but one poem in all the long third of a century that I have lived, persons who know me will be sincerely grateful; and finally, when I say that the poem which I composed was not the one which my father was enamoured of, persons who may have known us both will not need to have this truth shot into them with a mountain howitzer before they can receive it. My father and I were always on the most distant terms when I was a boy--a sort of armed neutrality so to speak. At irregular intervals this neutrality was broken, and suffering ensued; but I will be candid enough to say that the breaking and the suffering were always divided up with strict impartiality between us--which is to say, my father did the breaking, and I did the suffering. As a general thing I was a backward, cautious, unadventurous boy; but I once jumped off a two-story table; another time I gave an elephant a \u201cplug\u201d of tobacco and retired without waiting for an answer; and still another time I pretended to be talking in my sleep, and got off a portion of a very wretched original conundrum in the hearing of my father. Let us not pry into the result; it was of no consequence to any one but me.\n\nBut the poem I have referred to as attracting my father's attention and achieving his favour was \u201cHiawatha.\u201d Some man who courted a sudden and awful death presented him an early copy, and I never lost faith in my own senses until I saw him sit down and go to reading it in cold blood--saw him open the book, and heard him read these following lines, with the same inflectionless judicial frigidity with which he always read his charge to the jury, or administered an oath to a witness:\n\n\n                   \u201cTake your bow,\n                    O Hiawatha,\n                    Take your arrows, jasper-headed,\n                    Take your war-club, Puggawaugun,\n                    And your mittens, Minjekahwan,\n                    And your birch canoe for sailing,\n                    And the oil of Mishe-Nama.\u201d\n\nPresently my father took out of his breast pocket an imposing \u201cWarranty Deed,\u201d and fixed his eyes upon it and dropped into meditation. I knew what it was. A Texan lady and gentleman had given my half-brother, Orrin Johnson, a handsome property in a town in the North, in gratitude to him for having saved their lives by an act of brilliant heroism.\n\nBy and by my father looked towards me and sighed. Then he said:\n\n\u201cIf I had such a son as this poet, here were a subject worthier than the traditions of these Indians.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you please, sir, where?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this deed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes--in this very deed,\u201d said my father, throwing it on the table. \u201cThere is more poetry, more romance, more sublimity, more splendid imagery hidden away in that homely document than could be found in all the traditions of all the savages that live.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, sir? Could I--could I get it out, sir? Could I compose the poem, sir, do you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou?\u201d\n\nI wilted.\n\nPresently my father's face softened somewhat, and he said:\n\n\u201cGo and try. But mind, curb folly. No poetry at the expense of truth. Keep strictly to the facts.\u201d\n\nI said I would, and bowed myself out, and went upstairs.\n\n\u201cHiawatha\u201d kept droning in my head--and so did my father's remarks about the sublimity and romance hidden in my subject, and also his injunction to beware of wasteful and exuberant fancy. I noticed, just here, that I had heedlessly brought the deed away with me; now at this moment came to me one of those rare moods of daring recklessness, such as I referred to a while ago. Without another thought, and in plain defiance of the fact that I knew my father meant me to write the romantic story of my half-brother's adventure and subsequent good fortune, I ventured to heed merely the letter of his remarks and ignore their spirit. I took the stupid \u201cWarranty Deed\u201d itself and chopped it up into Hiawathian blank verse without altering or leaving out three words, and without transposing six. It required loads of courage to go downstairs and face my father with my performance. I started three or four times before I finally got my pluck to where it would stick. But at last I said I would go down and read it to him if he threw me over the church for it. I stood up to begin, and he told me to come closer. I edged up a little, but still left as much neutral ground between us as I thought he would stand. Then I began. It would be useless for me to try to tell what conflicting emotions expressed themselves upon his face, nor how they grew more and more intense, as I proceeded; nor how a fell darkness descended upon his countenance, and he began to gag and swallow, and his hands began to work and twitch, as I reeled off line after line, with the strength ebbing out of me, and my legs trembling under me:\n\n\n                    THE STORY OF A GALLANT DEED\n\n                    THIS INDENTURE, made the tenth\n                    Day of November, in the year\n                    Of our Lord one thousand eight\n                    Hundred six-and-fifty,\n\n                    Between Joanna S.

I could have waited to see what became of the other missiles if I had wanted to, but I took no interest in such things.\n\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTORY TO \u201cMEMORANDA\u201d\n\nIn taking upon myself the burden of editing a department in THE GALAXY magazine, I have been actuated by a conviction that I was needed, almost imperatively, in this particular field of literature. I have long felt that while the magazine literature of the day had much to recommend it, it yet lacked stability, solidity, weight. It seemed plain to me that too much space was given to poetry and romance, and not enough to statistics and agriculture. This defect it shall be my earnest endeavour to remedy. If I succeed, the simple consciousness that I have done a good deed will be a sufficient reward.**--[**Together with salary.]\n\nIn this department of mine the public may always rely upon finding exhaustive statistical tables concerning the finances of the country, the ratio of births and deaths; the percentage of increase of population, etc., etc.--in a word, everything in the realm of statistics that can make existence bright and beautiful.\n\nAlso, in my department will always be found elaborate condensations of the Patent Office Reports, wherein a faithful endeavour will at all times be made to strip the nutritious facts bare of that effulgence of imagination and sublimity of diction which too often mar the excellence of those great works.**\n\n\n     [** N. B.--No other magazine in the country makes a\n     specialty of the Patent Office Reports.]\n\nIn my department will always be found ample excerpts from those able dissertations upon Political Economy which I have for a long time been contributing to a great metropolitan journal, and which, for reasons utterly incomprehensible to me, another party has chosen to usurp the credit of composing.\n\nAnd, finally, I call attention with pride to the fact that in my department of the magazine the farmer will always find full market reports, and also complete instructions about farming, even from the grafting of the seed to the harrowing of the matured crop. I shall throw a pathos into the subject of Agriculture that will surprise and delight the world.\n\nSuch is my programme; and I am persuaded that by adhering to it with fidelity I shall succeed in materially changing the character of this magazine. Therefore I am emboldened to ask the assistance and encouragement of all whose sympathies are with Progress and Reform.\n\nIn the other departments of the magazine will be found poetry, tales, and other frothy trifles, and to these the reader can turn for relaxation from time to time, and thus guard against overstraining the powers of his mind. M. T.\n\nP. S.--1. I have not sold out of the \u201cBuffalo Express,\u201d and shall not; neither shall I stop writing for it. This remark seems necessary in a business point of view.\n\n2. These MEMORANDA are not a \u201chumorous\u201d department. I would not conduct an exclusively and professedly humorous department for any one. I would always prefer to have the privilege of printing a serious and sensible remark, in case one occurred to me, without the reader's feeling obliged to consider himself outraged. We cannot keep the same mood day after day. I am liable, some day, to want to print my opinion on jurisprudence, or Homeric poetry, or international law, and I shall do it. It will be of small consequence to me whether the reader survive or not. I shall never go straining after jokes when in a cheerless mood, so long as the unhackneyed subject of international law is open to me. I will leave all that straining to people who edit professedly and inexorably \u201chumorous\u201d departments and publications.\n\n3. I have chosen the general title of MEMORANDA for this department because it is plain and simple, and makes no fraudulent promises. I can print under it statistics, hotel arrivals, or anything that comes handy, without violating faith with the reader.\n\n4. Puns cannot be allowed a place in this department. Inoffensive ignorance, benignant stupidity, and unostentatious imbecility will always be welcomed and cheerfully accorded a corner, and even the feeblest humour will be admitted, when we can do no better; but no circumstances, however dismal, will ever be considered a sufficient excuse for the admission of that last--and saddest evidence of intellectual poverty, the Pun.\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT SMELLS\n\nIn a recent issue of the \u201cIndependent,\u201d the Rev. T. De Witt Talmage, of Brooklyn, has the following utterance on the subject of \u201cSmells\u201d:\n\n\n     I have a good Christian friend who, if he sat in the front pew in\n     church, and a working man should enter the door at the other end,\n     would smell him instantly.  My friend is not to blame for the\n     sensitiveness of his nose, any more than you would flog a pointer\n     for being keener on the scent than a stupid watch dog.  The fact is,\n     if you had all the churches free, by reason of the mixing up of the\n     common people with the uncommon, you would keep one-half of\n     Christendom sick at their stomach.  If you are going to kill the\n     church thus with bad smells, I will have nothing to do with this\n     work of evangelization.\n\nWe have reason to believe that there will be labouring men in heaven; and also a number of negroes, and Esquimaux, and Terra del Fuegans, and Arabs, and a few Indians, and possibly even some Spaniards and Portuguese. All things are possible with God. We shall have all these sorts of people in heaven; but, alas! in getting them we shall lose the society of Dr. Talmage. Which is to say, we shall lose the company of one who could give more real \u201ctone\u201d to celestial society than any other contribution Brooklyn could furnish. And what would eternal happiness be without the Doctor? Blissful, unquestionably--we know that well enough--but would it be 'distingue,' would it be 'recherche' without him? St. Matthew without stockings or sandals; St. Jerome bare headed, and with a coarse brown blanket robe dragging the ground; St. Sebastian with scarcely any raiment at all--these we should see, and should enjoy seeing them; but would we not miss a spike-tailed coat and kids, and turn away regretfully, and say to parties from the Orient: \u201cThese are well enough, but you ought to see Talmage of Brooklyn.\u201d I fear me that in the better world we shall not even have Dr. Talmage's \u201cgood Christian friend.\u201d\n\nFor if he were sitting under the glory of the Throne, and the keeper of the keys admitted a Benjamin Franklin or other labouring man, that \u201cfriend,\u201d with his fine natural powers infinitely augmented by emancipation from hampering flesh, would detect him with a single sniff, and immediately take his hat and ask to be excused.\n\nTo all outward seeming, the Rev. T. De Witt Talmage is of the same material as that used in the construction of his early predecessors in the ministry; and yet one feels that there must be a difference somewhere between him and the Saviour's first disciples. It may be because here, in the nineteenth century, Dr. T. has had advantages which Paul and Peter and the others could not and did not have. There was a lack of polish about them, and a looseness of etiquette, and a want of exclusiveness, which one cannot help noticing. They healed the very beggars, and held intercourse with people of a villainous odour every day. If the subject of these remarks had been chosen among the original Twelve Apostles, he would not have associated with the rest, because he could not have stood the fishy smell of some of his comrades who came from around the Sea of Galilee. He would have resigned his commission with some such remark as he makes in the extract quoted above: \u201cMaster, if thou art going to kill the church thus with bad smells, I will have nothing to do with this work of evangelization.\u201d He is a disciple, and makes that remark to the Master; the only difference is, that he makes it in the nineteenth instead of the first century.\n\nIs there a choir in Mr. T.'s church? And does it ever occur that they have no better manners than to sing that hymn which is so suggestive of labourers and mechanics:\n\n\n          \u201cSon of the Carpenter! receive\n          This humble work of mine?\u201d\n\nNow, can it be possible that in a handful of centuries the Christian character has fallen away from an imposing heroism that scorned even the stake, the cross, and the axe, to a poor little effeminacy that withers and wilts under an unsavoury smell? We are not prepared to believe so, the reverend Doctor and his friend to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nA COUPLE OF SAD EXPERIENCES\n\nWhen I published a squib recently in which I said I was going to edit an Agricultural Department in this magazine, I certainly did not desire to deceive anybody. I had not the remotest desire to play upon any one's confidence with a practical joke, for he is a pitiful creature indeed who will degrade the dignity of his humanity to the contriving of the witless inventions that go by that name. I purposely wrote the thing as absurdly and as extravagantly as it could be written, in order to be sure and not mislead hurried or heedless readers: for I spoke of launching a triumphal barge upon a desert, and planting a tree of prosperity in a mine--a tree whose fragrance should slake the thirst of the naked, and whose branches should spread abroad till they washed the chorea of, etc., etc. I thought that manifest lunacy like that would protect the reader. But to make assurance absolute, and show that I did not and could not seriously mean to attempt an Agricultural Department, I stated distinctly in my postscript that I did not know anything about Agriculture. But alas! right there is where I made my worst mistake--for that remark seems to have recommended my proposed Agriculture more than anything else. It lets a little light in on me, and I fancy I perceive that the farmers feel a little bored, sometimes, by the oracular profundity of agricultural editors who \u201cknow it all.\u201d In fact, one of my correspondents suggests this (for that unhappy squib has deluged me with letters about potatoes, and cabbages, and hominy, and vermicelli, and maccaroni, and all the other fruits, cereals, and vegetables that ever grew on earth; and if I get done answering questions about the best way of raising these things before I go raving crazy, I shall be thankful, and shall never write obscurely for fun any more).\n\nShall I tell the real reason why I have unintentionally succeeded in fooling so many people? It is because some of them only read a little of the squib I wrote and jumped to the conclusion that it was serious, and the rest did not read it at all, but heard of my agricultural venture at second-hand. Those cases I could not guard against, of course. To write a burlesque so wild that its pretended facts will not be accepted in perfect good faith by somebody, is very nearly an impossible thing to do. It is because, in some instances, the reader is a person who never tries to deceive anybody himself, and therefore is not expecting any one to wantonly practise a deception upon him; and in this case the only person dishonoured is the man who wrote the burlesque. In other instances the \u201cnub\u201d or moral of the burlesque--if its object be to enforce a truth--escapes notice in the superior glare of something in the body of the burlesque itself. And very often this \u201cmoral\u201d is tagged on at the bottom, and the reader, not knowing that it is the key of the whole thing and the only important paragraph in the article, tranquilly turns up his nose at it and leaves it unread. One can deliver a satire with telling force through the insidious medium of a travesty, if he is careful not to overwhelm the satire with the extraneous interest of the travesty, and so bury it from the reader's sight and leave him a joked and defrauded victim, when the honest intent was to add to either his knowledge or his wisdom. I have had a deal of experience in burlesques and their unfortunate aptness to deceive the public, and this is why I tried hard to make that agricultural one so broad and so perfectly palpable that even a one-eyed potato could see it; and yet, as I speak the solemn truth, it fooled one of the ablest agricultural editors in America!\n\n\n\n\n\nDAN MURPHY\n\nOne of the saddest things that ever came under my notice (said the banker's clerk) was there in Corning, during the war. Dan Murphy enlisted as a private, and fought very bravely. The boys all liked him, and when a wound by and by weakened him down till carrying a musket was too heavy work for him, they clubbed together and fixed him up as a sutler. He made money then, and sent it always to his wife to bank for him. She was a washer and ironer, and knew enough by hard experience to keep money when she got it. She didn't waste a penny. On the contrary, she began to get miserly as her bank account grew. She grieved to part with a cent, poor creature, for twice in her hard-working life she had known what it was to be hungry, cold, friendless, sick, and without a dollar in the world, and she had a haunting dread of suffering so again. Well, at last Dan died; and the boys, in testimony of their esteem and respect for him, telegraphed to Mrs. Murphy to know if she would like to have him embalmed and sent home, when you know the usual custom was to dump a poor devil like him into a shallow hole, and then inform his friends what had become of him. Mrs. Murphy jumped to the conclusion that it would only cost two or three dollars to embalm her dead husband, and so she telegraphed \u201cYes.\u201d It was at the \u201cwake\u201d that the bill for embalming arrived and was presented to the widow. She uttered a wild, sad wail, that pierced every heart, and said: \u201cSivinty-foive dollars for stoofhn' Dan, blister their sowls! Did thim divils suppose I was goin' to stairt a Museim, that I'd be dalin' in such expinsive curiassities!\u201d\n\nThe banker's clerk said there was not a dry eye in the house.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE \u201cTOURNAMENT\u201d IN A. D. 1870\n\nLately there appeared an item to this effect, and the same went the customary universal round of the press:\n\n\n     A telegraph station has just been established upon the traditional\n     site of the Garden of Eden.\n\n As a companion to that, nothing fits so aptly and so perfectly as this:\n\n\n     Brooklyn has revived the knightly tournament of the Middle Ages.\n\nIt is hard to tell which is the most startling, the idea of that highest achievement of human genius and intelligence, the telegraph, prating away about the practical concerns of the world's daily life in the heart and home of ancient indolence, ignorance, and savagery, or the idea of that happiest expression of the brag, vanity, and mock-heroics of our ancestors, the \u201ctournament,\u201d coming out of its grave to flaunt its tinsel trumpery and perform its \u201cchivalrous\u201d absurdities in the high noon of the nineteenth century, and under the patronage of a great, broad-awake city and an advanced civilisation.\n\nA \u201ctournament\u201d in Lynchburg is a thing easily within the comprehension of the average mind; but no commonly gifted person can conceive of such a spectacle in Brooklyn without straining his powers. Brooklyn is part and parcel of the city of New York, and there is hardly romance enough in the entire metropolis to re-supply a Virginia \u201cknight\u201d with \u201cchivalry,\u201d in case he happened to run out of it. Let the reader calmly and dispassionately picture to himself \u201clists\u201d--in Brooklyn; heralds, pursuivants, pages, garter king-at-arms--in Brooklyn; the marshalling of the fantastic hosts of \u201cchivalry\u201d in slashed doublets, velvet trunks, ruffles, and plumes--in Brooklyn; mounted on omnibus and livery-stable patriarchs, promoted, and referred to in cold blood as \u201csteeds,\u201d \u201cdestriers,\u201d and \u201cchargers,\u201d and divested of their friendly, humble names--these meek old \u201cJims\u201d and \u201cBobs\u201d and \u201cCharleys,\u201d and renamed \u201cMohammed,\u201d \u201cBucephalus,\u201d and \u201cSaladin\u201d--in Brooklyn; mounted thus, and armed with swords and shields and wooden lances, and cased in paste board hauberks, morions, greaves, and gauntlets, and addressed as \u201cSir\u201d Smith, and \u201cSir\u201d Jones, and bearing such titled grandeurs as \u201cThe Disinherited Knight,\u201d the \u201cKnight of Shenandoah,\u201d the \u201cKnight of the Blue Ridge,\u201d the \u201cKnight of Maryland,\u201d and the \u201cKnight of the Secret Sorrow\u201d--in Brooklyn; and at the toot of the horn charging fiercely upon a helpless ring hung on a post, and prodding at it intrepidly with their wooden sticks, and by and by skewering it and cavorting back to the judges' stand covered with glory--this in Brooklyn; and each noble success like this duly and promptly announced by an applauding toot from the herald's horn, and \u201cthe band playing three bars of an old circus tune\u201d--all in Brooklyn, in broad daylight. And let the reader remember, and also add to his picture, as follows, to wit: when the show was all over, the party who had shed the most blood and overturned and hacked to pieces the most knights, or at least had prodded the most muffin-rings, was accorded the ancient privilege of naming and crowning the Queen of Love and Beauty--which naming had in reality been done for him by the \u201ccut-and-dried\u201d process, and long in advance, by a committee of ladies, but the crowning he did in person, though suffering from loss of blood, and then was taken to the county hospital on a shutter to have his wounds dressed--these curious things all occurring in Brooklyn, and no longer ago than one or two yesterdays. It seems impossible, and yet it is true.\n\nThis was doubtless the first appearance of the \u201ctournament\u201d up here among the rolling-mills and factories, and will probably be the last. It will be well to let it retire permanently to the rural districts of Virginia, where, it is said, the fine mailed and plumed, noble-natured, maiden-rescuing, wrong-redressing, adventure-seeking knight of romance is accepted and believed in by the peasantry with pleasing simplicity, while they reject with scorn the plain, unpolished verdict whereby history exposes him as a braggart, a ruffian, a fantastic vagabond; and an ignoramus.\n\nAll romance aside, what shape would our admiration of the heroes of Ashby de la Zouch be likely to take, in this practical age, if those worthies were to rise up and come here and perform again the chivalrous deeds of that famous passage of arms? Nothing but a New York jury and the insanity plea could save them from hanging, from the amiable Bois-Guilbert and the pleasant Front-de-Boeuf clear down to the nameless ruffians that entered the riot with unpictured shields and did their first murder and acquired their first claim to respect that day. The doings of the so-called \u201cchivalry\u201d of the Middle Ages were absurd enough, even when they were brutally and bloodily in earnest, and when their surroundings of castles and donjons, savage landscapes and half-savage peoples, were in keeping; but those doings gravely reproduced with tinsel decorations and mock pageantry, by bucolic gentlemen with broomstick lances, and with muffin-rings to represent the foe, and all in the midst of the refinement and dignity of a carefully-developed modern civilisation, is absurdity gone crazy.\n\nNow, for next exhibition, let us have a fine representation of one of those chivalrous wholesale butcheries and burnings of Jewish women and children, which the crusading heroes of romance used to indulge in in their European homes, just before starting to the Holy Land, to seize and take to their protection the Sepulchre and defend it from \u201cpollution.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nCURIOUS RELIC FOR SALE\n\n\n     \u201cFor sale, for the benefit of the Fund for the Relief of the Widows\n     and Orphans of Deceased Firemen, a Curious Ancient Bedouin Pipe,\n     procured at the city of Endor in Palestine, and believed to have\n     once belonged to the justly-renowned Witch of Endor.  Parties\n     desiring to examine this singular relic with a view to purchasing,\n     can do so by calling upon Daniel S., 119 and 121 William street, New\n     York\u201d\n\nAs per advertisement in the \u201cHerald.\u201d A curious old relic indeed, as I had a good personal right to know. In a single instant of time, a long drawn panorama of sights and scenes in the Holy Land flashed through my memory--town and grove, desert, camp, and caravan clattering after each other and disappearing, leaving me with a little of the surprised and dizzy feeling which I have experienced at sundry times when a long express train has overtaken me at some quiet curve and gone whizzing, car by car, around the corner and out of sight. In that prolific instant I saw again all the country from the Sea of Galilee and Nazareth clear to Jerusalem, and thence over the hills of Judea and through the Vale of Sharon to Joppa, down by the ocean. Leaving out unimportant stretches of country and details of incident, I saw and experienced the following described matters and things. Immediately three years fell away from my age, and a vanished time was restored to me--September, 1867. It was a flaming Oriental day--this one that had come up out of the past and brought along its actors, its stage-properties, and scenic effects--and our party had just ridden through the squalid hive of human vermin which still holds the ancient Biblical name of Endor; I was bringing up the rear on my grave four-dollar steed, who was about beginning to compose himself for his usual noon nap. My! only fifteen minutes before how the black, mangy, nine-tenths naked, ten-tenths filthy, ignorant, bigoted, besotted, hungry, lazy, malignant, screeching, crowding, struggling, wailing, begging, cursing, hateful spawn of the original Witch had swarmed out of the caves in the rocks and the holes and crevices in the earth, and blocked our horses' way, besieged us, threw themselves in the animals' path, clung to their manes, saddle-furniture, and tails, asking, beseeching, demanding \u201cbucksheesh! bucksheesh! BUCKSHEESH!\u201d We had rained small copper Turkish coins among them, as fugitives fling coats and hats to pursuing wolves, and then had spurred our way through as they stopped to scramble for the largess. I was fervently thankful when we had gotten well up on the desolate hillside and outstripped them and left them jawing and gesticulating in the rear. What a tempest had seemingly gone roaring and crashing by me and left its dull thunders pulsing in my ears!\n\nI was in the rear, as I was saying. Our pack-mules and Arabs were far ahead, and Dan, Jack, Moult, Davis, Denny, Church, and Birch (these names will do as well as any to represent the boys) were following close after them. As my horse nodded to rest, I heard a sort of panting behind me, and turned and saw that a tawny youth from the village had overtaken me--a true remnant and representative of his ancestress the Witch--a galvanised scurvy, wrought into the human shape and garnished with ophthalmia and leprous scars--an airy creature with an invisible shirt-front that reached below the pit of his stomach, and no other clothing to speak of except a tobacco-pouch, an ammunition-pocket, and a venerable gun, which was long enough to club any game with that came within shooting distance, but far from efficient as an article of dress.\n\nI thought to myself, \u201cNow this disease with a human heart in it is going to shoot me.\u201d I smiled in derision at the idea of a Bedouin daring to touch off his great-grandfather's rusty gun and getting his head blown off for his pains. But then it occurred to me, in simple school-boy language, \u201cSuppose he should take deliberate aim and 'haul off' and fetch me with the butt-end of it?\u201d There was wisdom in that view of it, and I stopped to parley. I found he was only a friendly villain who wanted a trifle of bucksheesh, and after begging what he could get in that way, was perfectly willing to trade off everything he had for more. I believe he would have parted with his last shirt for bucksheesh if he had had one. He was smoking the \u201chumbliest\u201d pipe I ever saw--a dingy, funnel-shaped, red-clay thing, streaked and grimed with oil and tears of tobacco, and with all the different kinds of dirt there are, and thirty per cent. of them peculiar and indigenous to Endor and perdition. And rank? I never smelt anything like it. It withered a cactus that stood lifting its prickly hands aloft beside the trail. It even woke up my horse. I said I would take that. It cost me a franc, a Russian kopek, a brass button, and a slate pencil; and my spendthrift lavishness so won upon the son of the desert that he passed over his pouch of most unspeakably villainous tobacco to me as a free gift. What a pipe it was, to be sure! It had a rude brass-wire cover to it, and a little coarse iron chain suspended from the bowl, with an iron splinter attached to loosen up the tobacco and pick your teeth with. The stem looked like the half of a slender walking-stick with the bark on.\n\nI felt that this pipe had belonged to the original Witch of Endor as soon as I saw it; and as soon as I smelt it, I knew it. Moreover, I asked the Arab cub in good English if it was not so, and he answered in good Arabic that it was. I woke up my horse and went my way, smoking. And presently I said to myself reflectively, \u201cIf there is anything that could make a man deliberately assault a dying cripple, I reckon may be an unexpected whiff from this pipe would do it.\u201d I smoked along till I found I was beginning to lie, and project murder, and steal my own things out of one pocket and hide them in another; and then I put up my treasure, took off my spurs and put them under my horse's tail, and shortly came tearing through our caravan like a hurricane.\n\nFrom that time forward, going to Jerusalem, the Dead Sea, and the Jordan, Bethany, Bethlehem, and everywhere, I loafed contentedly in the rear and enjoyed my infamous pipe and revelled in imaginary villany. But at the end of two weeks we turned our faces toward the sea and journeyed over the Judean hills, and through rocky defiles, and among the scenes that Samson knew in his youth, and by and by we touched level ground just at night, and trotted off cheerily over the plain of Sharon. It was perfectly jolly for three hours, and we whites crowded along together, close after the chief Arab muleteer (all the pack-animals and the other Arabs were miles in the rear), and we laughed, and chatted, and argued hotly about Samson, and whether suicide was a sin or not, since Paul speaks of Samson distinctly as being saved and in heaven. But by and by the night air, and the duskiness, and the weariness of eight hours in the saddle, began to tell, and conversation flagged and finally died out utterly. The squeak-squeaking of the saddles grew very distinct; occasionally somebody sighed, or started to hum a tune and gave it up; now and then a horse sneezed. These things only emphasised the solemnity and the stillness. Everybody got so listless that for once I and my dreamer found ourselves in the lead. It was a glad, new sensation, and I longed to keep the place forevermore. Every little stir in the dingy cavalcade behind made me nervous. Davis and I were riding side by side, right after the Arab. About 11 o'clock it had become really chilly, and the dozing boys roused up and began to inquire how far it was to Ramlah yet, and to demand that the Arab hurry along faster. I gave it up then, and my heart sank within me, because of course they would come up to scold the Arab. I knew I had to take the rear again. In my sorrow I unconsciously took to my pipe, my only comfort. As I touched the match to it the whole company came lumbering up and crowding my horse's rump and flanks. A whiff of smoke drifted back over my shoulder, and--\n\n\u201cThe suffering Moses!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhew!\u201d\n\n\u201cBy George, who opened that graveyard?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoys, that Arab's been swallowing something dead!\u201d\n\nRight away there was a gap behind us. Whiff after whiff sailed airily back, and each one widened the breach. Within fifteen seconds the barking, and gasping, and sneezing, and coughing of the boys, and their angry abuse of the Arab guide, had dwindled to a murmur, and Davis and I were alone with the leader. Davis did not know what the matter was, and don't to this day. Occasionally he caught a faint film of the smoke and fell to scolding at the Arab and wondering how long he had been decaying in that way. Our boys kept on dropping back further and further, till at last they were only in hearing, not in sight. And every time they started gingerly forward to reconnoitre--or shoot the Arab, as they proposed to do--I let them get within good fair range of my relic (she would carry seventy yards with wonderful precision), and then wafted a whiff among them that sent them gasping and strangling to the rear again. I kept my gun well charged and ready, and twice within the hour I decoyed the boys right up to my horse's tail, and then with one malarious blast emptied the saddles, almost. I never heard an Arab abused so in my life. He really owed his preservation to me, because for one entire hour I stood between him and certain death. The boys would have killed him if they could have got by me.\n\nBy and by, when the company were far in the rear, I put away my pipe--I was getting fearfully dry and crisp about the gills and rather blown with good diligent work--and spurred my animated trance up alongside the Arab and stopped him and asked for water. He unslung his little gourd-shaped earthenware jug, and I put it under my moustache and took a long, glorious, satisfying draught. I was going to scour the mouth of the jug a little, but I saw that I had brought the whole train together once more by my delay, and that they were all anxious to drink too--and would have been long ago if the Arab had not pretended that he was out of water. So I hastened to pass the vessel to Davis. He took a mouthful, and never said a word, but climbed off his horse and lay down calmly in the road. I felt sorry for Davis. It was too late now, though, and Dan was drinking. Dan got down too, and hunted for a soft place. I thought I heard Dan say, \u201cThat Arab's friends ought to keep him in alcohol or else take him out and bury him somewhere.\u201d All the boys took a drink and climbed down. It is not well to go into further particulars. Let us draw the curtain upon this act.\n\n\n            ..............................\n\nWell, now, to think that after three changing years I should hear from that curious old relic again, and see Dan advertising it for sale for the benefit of a benevolent object. Dan is not treating that present right. I gave that pipe to him for a keepsake. However, he probably finds that it keeps away custom and interferes with business. It is the most convincing inanimate object in all this part of the world, perhaps. Dan and I were room-mates in all that long \u201cQuaker City\u201d voyage, and whenever I desired to have a little season of privacy I used to fire up on that pipe and persuade Dan to go out; and he seldom waited to change his clothes, either. In about a quarter, or from that to three-quarters of a minute, he would be propping up the smoke-stack on the upper deck and cursing. I wonder how the faithful old relic is going to sell?\n\n\n\n\n\nA REMINISCENCE OF THE BACK SETTLEMENTS\n\n\u201cNow that corpse [said the undertaker, patting the folded hands of the deceased approvingly] was a brick--every way you took him he was a brick. He was so real accommodating, and so modest-like and simple in his last moments. Friends wanted metallic burial case--nothing else would do. I couldn't get it. There warn't going to be time--anybody could see that. Corpse said never mind, shake him up some kind of a box he could stretch out in comfortable, he warn't particular 'bout the general style of it. Said he went more on room than style, any way, in the last final container. Friends wanted a silver door-plate on the coffin, signifying who he was and wher' he was from. Now you know a fellow couldn't roust out such a gaily thing as that in a little country town like this. What did corpse say? Corpse said, whitewash his old canoe and dob his address and general destination onto it with a blacking brush and a stencil plate, long with a verse from some likely hymn or other, and p'int him for the tomb, and mark him C. O. D., and just let him skip along. He warn't distressed any more than you be--on the contrary just as carm and collected as a hearse-horse; said he judged that wher' he was going to, a body would find it considerable better to attract attention by a picturesque moral character than a natty burial case with a swell doorplate on it. Splendid man, he was. I'd druther do for a corpse like that 'n any I've tackled in seven year. There's some satisfaction in buryin' a man like that. You feel that what you're doing is appreciated. Lord bless you, so's he got planted before he sp'iled, he was perfectly satisfied; said his relations meant well, perfectly well, but all them preparations was bound to delay the thing more or less, and he didn't wish to be kept layin' round. You never see such a clear head as what he had--and so carm and so cool. Just a hunk of brains that is what he was. Perfectly awful. It was a ripping distance from one end of that man's head to t'other. Often and over again he's had brain fever a-raging in one place, and the rest of the pile didn't know anything about it--didn't affect it any more than an Injun insurrection in Arizona affects the Atlantic States. Well, the relations they wanted a big funeral, but corpse said he was down on flummery--didn't want any procession--fill the hearse full of mourners, and get out a stern line and tow him behind. He was the most down on style of any remains I ever struck. A beautiful, simple-minded creature--it was what he was, you can depend on that. He was just set on having things the way he wanted them, and he took a solid comfort in laying his little plans. He had me measure him and take a whole raft of directions; then he had a minister stand up behind a long box with a tablecloth over it and read his funeral sermon, saying 'Angcore, angcore!' at the good places, and making him scratch out every bit of brag about him, and all the hifalutin; and then he made them trot out the choir so's he could help them pick out the tunes for the occasion, and he got them to sing 'Pop Goes the Weasel,' because he'd always liked that tune when he was downhearted, and solemn music made him sad; and when they sung that with tears in their eyes (because they all loved him), and his relations grieving around, he just laid there as happy as a bug, and trying to beat time and showing all over how much he enjoyed it; and presently he got worked up and excited; and tried to join in, for mind you he was pretty proud of his abilities in the singing line; but the first time he opened his mouth and was just going to spread himself, his breath took a walk. I never see a man snuffed out so sudden. Ah, it was a great loss--it was a powerful loss to this poor little one-horse town. Well, well, well, I hain't got time to be palavering along here--got to nail on the lid and mosey along with' him; and if you'll just give me a lift we'll skeet him into the hearse and meander along. Relations bound to have it so--don't pay no attention to dying injunctions, minute a corpse's gone; but if I had my way, if I didn't respect his last wishes and tow him behind the hearse, I'll be cuss'd. I consider that whatever a corpse wants done for his comfort is a little enough matter, and a man hain't got no right to deceive him or take advantage of him--and whatever a corpse trusts me to do I'm a-going to do, you know, even if it's to stuff him and paint him yaller and keep him for a keepsake--you hear me!\u201d\n\nHe cracked his whip and went lumbering away with his ancient ruin of a hearse, and I continued my walk with a valuable lesson learned--that a healthy and wholesome cheerfulness is not necessarily impossible to any occupation. The lesson is likely to be lasting, for it will take many months to obliterate the memory of the remarks and circumstances that impressed it.\n\n\n\n\n\nA ROYAL COMPLIMENT\n\n\n     The latest report about the Spanish crown is, that it will now be\n     offered to Prince Alfonso, the second son of the King of Portugal,\n     who is but five years of age.  The Spaniards have hunted through all\n     the nations of Europe for a King.  They tried to get a Portuguese in\n     the person of Dom-Luis, who is an old ex-monarch; they tried to get\n     an Italian, in the person of Victor Emanuel's young son, the Duke of\n     Genoa; they tried to get a Spaniard, in the person of Espartero, who\n     is an octogenarian.  Some of them desired a French Bourbon,\n     Montpensier; some of them a Spanish Bourbon, the Prince of Asturias;\n     some of them an English prince, one of the sons of Queen Victoria.\n     They have just tried to get the German Prince Leopold; but they have\n     thought it better to give him up than take a war along with him.\n     It is a long time since we first suggested to them to try an\n     American ruler.  We can offer them a large number of able and\n     experienced sovereigns to pick from--men skilled in statesmanship,\n     versed in the science of government, and adepts in all the arts of\n     administration--men who could wear the crown with dignity and rule\n     the kingdom at a reasonable expense.\n\n     There is not the least danger of Napoleon threatening them if they\n     take an American sovereign; in fact, we have no doubt he would be\n     pleased to support such a candidature.  We are unwilling to mention\n     names--though we have a man in our eye whom we wish they had in\n     theirs.--New York Tribune.\n\nIt would be but an ostentation of modesty to permit such a pointed reference to myself to pass unnoticed. This is the second time that 'The Tribune' (no doubt sincerely looking to the best interests of Spain and the world at large) has done me the great and unusual honour to propose me as a fit person to fill the Spanish throne. Why 'The Tribune' should single me out in this way from the midst of a dozen Americans of higher political prominence, is a problem which I cannot solve. Beyond a somewhat intimate knowledge of Spanish history and a profound veneration for its great names and illustrious deeds, I feel that I possess no merit that should peculiarly recommend me to this royal distinction. I cannot deny that Spanish history has always been mother's milk to me. I am proud of every Spanish achievement, from Hernando Cortes's victory at Thermopylae down to Vasco Nunez de Balboa's discovery of the Atlantic ocean; and of every splendid Spanish name, from Don Quixote and the Duke of Wellington down to Don Caesar de Bazan. However, these little graces of erudition are of small consequence, being more showy than serviceable.\n\nIn case the Spanish sceptre is pressed upon me--and the indications unquestionably are that it will be--I shall feel it necessary to have certain things set down and distinctly understood beforehand. For instance: My salary must be paid quarterly in advance. In these unsettled times it will not do to trust. If Isabella had adopted this plan, she would be roosting on her ancestral throne to-day, for the simple reason that her subjects never could have raised three months of a royal salary in advance, and of course they could not have discharged her until they had squared up with her. My salary must be paid in gold; when greenbacks are fresh in a country, they are too fluctuating. My salary has got to be put at the ruling market rate; I am not going to cut under on the trade, and they are not going to trail me a long way from home and then practise on my ignorance and play me for a royal North Adams Chinaman, by any means. As I understand it, imported kings generally get five millions a year and house-rent free. Young George of Greece gets that. As the revenues only yield two millions, he has to take the national note for considerable; but even with things in that sort of shape he is better fixed than he was in Denmark, where he had to eternally stand up because he had no throne to sit on, and had to give bail for his board, because a royal apprentice gets no salary there while he is learning his trade. England is the place for that. Fifty thousand dollars a year Great Britain pays on each royal child that is born, and this is increased from year to year as the child becomes more and more indispensable to his country. Look at Prince Arthur. At first he only got the usual birth-bounty; but now that he has got so that he can dance, there is simply no telling what wages he gets.\n\nI should have to stipulate that the Spanish people wash more and endeavour to get along with less quarantine. Do you know, Spain keeps her ports fast locked against foreign traffic three-fourths of each year, because one day she is scared about the cholera, and the next about the plague, and next the measles, next the hooping cough, the hives, and the rash? but she does not mind leonine leprosy and elephantiasis any more than a great and enlightened civilisation minds freckles. Soap would soon remove her anxious distress about foreign distempers. The reason arable land is so scarce in Spain is because the people squander so much of it on their persons, and then when they die it is improvidently buried with them.\n\nI should feel obliged to stipulate that Marshal Serrano be reduced to the rank of constable, or even roundsman. He is no longer fit to be City Marshal. A man who refused to be king because he was too old and feeble, is ill qualified to help sick people to the station-house when they are armed and their form of delirium tremens is of the exuberant and demonstrative kind.\n\nI should also require that a force be sent to chase the late Queen Isabella out of France. Her presence there can work no advantage to Spain, and she ought to be made to move at once; though, poor thing, she has been chaste enough heretofore--for a Spanish woman.\n\nI should also require that--\n\nI am at this moment authoritatively informed that \u201cThe Tribune\u201d did not mean me, after all. Very well, I do not care two cents.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE APPROACHING EPIDEMIC\n\nOne calamity to which the death of Mr. Dickens dooms this country has not awakened the concern to which its gravity entitles it. We refer to the fact that the nation is to be lectured to death and read to death all next winter, by Tom, Dick, and Harry, with poor lamented Dickens for a pretext. All the vagabonds who can spell will afflict the people with \u201creadings\u201d from Pickwick and Copperfield, and all the insignificants who have been ennobled by the notice of the great novelist or transfigured by his smile will make a marketable commodity of it now, and turn the sacred reminiscence to the practical use of procuring bread and butter. The lecture rostrums will fairly swarm with these fortunates. Already the signs of it are perceptible. Behold how the unclean creatures are wending toward the dead lion and gathering to the feast:\n\n\u201cReminiscences of Dickens.\u201d A lecture. By John Smith, who heard him read eight times.\n\n\u201cRemembrances of Charles Dickens.\u201d A lecture. By John Jones, who saw him once in a street car and twice in a barber shop.\n\n\u201cRecollections of Mr. Dickens.\u201d A lecture. By John Brown, who gained a wide fame by writing deliriously appreciative critiques and rhapsodies upon the great author's public readings; and who shook hands with the great author upon various occasions, and held converse with him several times.\n\n\u201cReadings from Dickens.\u201d By John White, who has the great delineator's style and manner perfectly, having attended all his readings in this country and made these things a study, always practising each reading before retiring, and while it was hot from the great delineator's lips. Upon this occasion Mr. W. will exhibit the remains of a cigar which he saw Mr. Dickens smoke. This Relic is kept in a solid silver box made purposely for it.\n\n\u201cSights and Sounds of the Great Novelist.\u201d A popular lecture. By John Gray, who waited on his table all the time he was at the Grand Hotel, New York, and still has in his possession and will exhibit to the audience a fragment of the Last Piece of Bread which the lamented author tasted in this country.\n\n\u201cHeart Treasures of Precious Moments with Literature's Departed Monarch.\u201d A lecture. By Miss Serena Amelia Tryphenia McSpadden, who still wears, and will always wear, a glove upon the hand made sacred by the clasp of Dickens. Only Death shall remove it.\n\n\u201cReadings from Dickens.\u201d By Mrs. J. O'Hooligan Murphy, who washed for him.\n\n\u201cFamiliar Talks with the Great Author.\u201d A narrative lecture. By John Thomas, for two weeks his valet in America.\n\nAnd so forth, and so on. This isn't half the list. The man who has a \u201cToothpick once used by Charles Dickens\u201d will have to have a hearing; and the man who \u201conce rode in an omnibus with Charles Dickens;\u201d and the lady to whom Charles Dickens \u201cgranted the hospitalities of his umbrella during a storm;\u201d and the person who \u201cpossesses a hole which once belonged in a handkerchief owned by Charles Dickens.\u201d Be patient and long-suffering, good people, for even this does not fill up the measure of what you must endure next winter. There is no creature in all this land who has had any personal relations with the late Mr. Dickens, however slight or trivial, but will shoulder his way to the rostrum and inflict his testimony upon his helpless countrymen. To some people it is fatal to be noticed by greatness.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE TONE-IMPARTING COMMITTEE\n\nWhen I get old and ponderously respectable, only one thing will be able to make me truly happy, and that will be to be put on the Venerable Tone-Imparting committee of the city of New York, and have nothing to do but sit on the platform, solemn and imposing, along with Peter Cooper, Horace Greeley, etc., etc., and shed momentary fame at second hand on obscure lecturers, draw public attention to lectures which would otherwise clack eloquently to sounding emptiness, and subdue audiences into respectful hearing of all sorts of unpopular and outlandish dogmas and isms. That is what I desire for the cheer and gratification of my gray hairs. Let me but sit up there with those fine relics of the Old Red Sandstone Period and give Tone to an intellectual entertainment twice a week, and be so reported, and my happiness will be complete. Those men have been my envy for a long, long time. And no memories of my life are so pleasant as my reminiscence of their long and honorable career in the Tone-imparting service. I can recollect that first time I ever saw them on the platforms just as well as I can remember the events of yesterday. Horace Greeley sat on the right, Peter Cooper on the left, and Thomas Jefferson, Red Jacket, Benjamin Franklin, and John Hancock sat between them. This was on the 22d of December, 1799, on the occasion of the state' funeral of George Washington in New York. It was a great day, that--a great day, and a very, very sad one. I remember that Broadway was one mass of black crape from Castle Garden nearly up to where the City Hall now stands. The next time I saw these gentlemen officiate was at a ball given for the purpose of procuring money and medicines for the sick and wounded soldiers and sailors. Horace Greeley occupied one side of the platform on which the musicians were exalted, and Peter Cooper the other. There were other Tone-imparters attendant upon the two chiefs, but I have forgotten their names now. Horace Greeley, gray-haired and beaming, was in sailor costume--white duck pants, blue shirt, open at the breast, large neckerchief, loose as an ox-bow, and tied with a jaunty sailor knot, broad turnover collar with star in the corner, shiny black little tarpaulin hat roosting daintily far back on head, and flying two gallant long ribbons. Slippers on ample feet, round spectacles on benignant nose, and pitchfork in hand, completed Mr. Greeley, and made him, in my boyish admiration, every inch a sailor, and worthy to be the honored great-grandfather of the Neptune he was so ingeniously representing. I shall never forget him. Mr. Cooper was dressed as a general of militia, and was dismally and oppressively warlike. I neglected to remark, in the proper place, that the soldiers and sailors in whose aid the ball was given had just been sent in from Boston--this was during the war of 1812. At the grand national reception of Lafayette, in 1824, Horace Greeley sat on the right and Peter Cooper to the left. The other Tone-imparters of the day are sleeping the sleep of the just now. I was in the audience when Horace Greeley, Peter Cooper, and other chief citizens imparted tone to the great meetings in favor of French liberty, in 1848. Then I never saw them any more until here lately; but now that I am living tolerably near the city, I run down every time I see it announced that \u201cHorace Greeley, Peter Cooper, and several other distinguished citizens will occupy seats on the platform;\u201d and next morning, when I read in the first paragraph of the phonographic report that \u201cHorace Greeley, Peter Cooper, and several other distinguished citizens occupied seats on the platform,\u201d I say to myself, \u201cThank God, I was present.\u201d Thus I have been enabled to see these substantial old friends of mine sit on the platform and give tone to lectures on anatomy, and lectures on agriculture, and lectures on stirpiculture, and lectures on astronomy, on chemistry, on miscegenation, on \u201cIs Man Descended from the Kangaroo?\u201d on veterinary matters, on all kinds of religion, and several kinds of politics; and have seen them give tone and grandeur to the Four-legged Girl, the Siamese Twins, the Great Egyptian Sword Swallower, and the Old Original Jacobs. Whenever somebody is to lecture on a subject not of general interest, I know that my venerated Remains of the Old Red Sandstone Period will be on the platform; whenever a lecturer is to appear whom nobody has heard of before, nor will be likely to seek to see, I know that the real benevolence of my old friends will be taken advantage of, and that they will be on the platform (and in the bills) as an advertisement; and whenever any new and obnoxious deviltry in philosophy, morals, or politics is to be sprung upon the people, I know perfectly well that these intrepid old heroes will be on the platform too, in the interest of full and free discussion, and to crush down all narrower and less generous souls with the solid dead weight of their awful respectability. And let us all remember that while these inveterate and imperishable presiders (if you please) appear on the platform every night in the year as regularly as the volunteered piano from Steinway's or Chickering's, and have bolstered up and given tone to a deal of questionable merit and obscure emptiness in their time, they have also diversified this inconsequential service by occasional powerful uplifting and upholding of great progressive ideas which smaller men feared to meddle with or countenance.\n\n\n\n\n\nOUR PRECIOUS LUNATIC\n\n [From the Buffalo Express, Saturday, May 14, 1870.]\n\n\n                                             New YORK, May 10.\n\nThe Richardson-McFarland jury had been out one hour and fifty minutes. A breathless silence brooded over court and auditory--a silence and a stillness so absolute, notwithstanding the vast multitude of human beings packed together there, that when some one far away among the throng under the northeast balcony cleared his throat with a smothered little cough it startled everybody uncomfortably, so distinctly did it grate upon the pulseless air. At that imposing moment the bang of a door was heard, then the shuffle of approaching feet, and then a sort of surging and swaying disorder among the heads at the entrance from the jury-room told them that the Twelve were coming. Presently all was silent again, and the foreman of the jury rose and said:\n\n\u201cYour Honor and Gentleman: We, the jury charged with the duty of determining whether the prisoner at the bar, Daniel McFarland, has been guilty of murder, in taking by surprise an unarmed man and shooting him to death, or whether the prisoner is afflicted with a sad but irresponsible insanity which at times can be cheered only by violent entertainment with firearms, do find as follows, namely:\n\n\u201cThat the prisoner, Daniel McFarland, is insane as above described. Because:\n\n\u201c1. His great grandfather's stepfather was tainted with insanity, and frequently killed people who were distasteful to him. Hence, insanity is hereditary in the family.\n\n\u201c2. For nine years the prisoner at the bar did not adequately support his family. Strong circumstantial evidence of insanity.\n\n\u201c3. For nine years he made of his home, as a general thing, a poor-house; sometimes (but very rarely) a cheery, happy habitation; frequently the den of a beery, drivelling, stupefied animal; but never, as far as ascertained, the abiding place of a gentleman. These be evidences of insanity.\n\n\u201c4. He once took his young unmarried sister-in-law to the museum; while there his hereditary insanity came upon him to such a degree that he hiccupped and staggered; and afterward, on the way home, even made love to the young girl he was protecting. These are the acts of a person not in his right mind.\n\n\u201c5. For a good while his sufferings were so great that he had to submit to the inconvenience of having his wife give public readings for the family support; and at times, when he handed these shameful earnings to the barkeeper, his haughty soul was so torn with anguish that he could hardly stand without leaning against something. At such times he has been known to shed tears into his sustenance till it diluted to utter inefficiency. Inattention of this nature is not the act of a Democrat unafflicted in mind.\n\n\u201c6. He never spared expense in making his wife comfortable during her occasional confinements. Her father is able to testify to this. There was always an element of unsoundness about the prisoner's generosities that is very suggestive at this time and before this court.\n\n\u201c7. Two years ago the prisoner came fearlessly up behind Richardson in the dark, and shot him in the leg. The prisoner's brave and protracted defiance of an adversity that for years had left him little to depend upon for support but a wife who sometimes earned scarcely anything for weeks at a time, is evidence that he would have appeared in front of Richardson and shot him in the stomach if he had not been insane at the time of the shooting.\n\n\u201c8. Fourteen months ago the prisoner told Archibald Smith that he was going to kill Richardson. This is insanity.\n\n\u201c9. Twelve months ago he told Marshall P. Jones that he was going to kill Richardson. Insanity.\n\n\u201c10. Nine months ago he was lurking about Richardson's home in New Jersey, and said he was going to kill Richardson. Insanity.\n\n\u201c11. Seven months ago he showed a pistol to Seth Brown and said that that was for Richardson. He said Brown testified that at that time it seemed plain that something was the matter with McFarland, for he crossed the street diagonally nine times in fifty yards, apparently without any settled reason for doing so, and finally fell in the gutter and went to sleep. He remarked at the time that McFarland acted strange--believed he was insane. Upon hearing Brown's evidence, John W. Galen, M.D., affirmed at once that McFarland was insane.\n\n\u201c12. Five months ago, McFarland showed his customary pistol, in his customary way, to his bed-fellow, Charles A. Dana, and told him he was going to kill Richardson the first time an opportunity offered. Evidence of insanity.\n\n\u201c13. Five months and two weeks ago McFarland asked John Morgan the time of day, and turned and walked rapidly away without waiting for an answer. Almost indubitable evidence of insanity. And--\n\n\u201c14. It is remarkable that exactly one week after this circumstance, the prisoner, Daniel McFarland, confronted Albert D. Richardson suddenly and without warning, and shot him dead. This is manifest insanity. Everything we know of the prisoner goes to show that if he had been sane at the time, he would have shot his victim from behind.\n\n\u201c15. There is an absolutely overwhelming mass of testimony to show that an hour before the shooting, McFarland was ANXIOUS AND UNEASY, and that five minutes after it he was EXCITED. Thus the accumulating conjectures and evidences of insanity culminate in this sublime and unimpeachable proof of it. Therefore--\n\n\u201cYour Honor and Gentlemen--We the jury pronounce the said Daniel McFarland INNOCENT OF MURDER, BUT CALAMITOUSLY INSANE.\u201d\n\nThe scene that ensued almost defies description. Hats, handkerchiefs and bonnets were frantically waved above the massed heads in the courtroom, and three tremendous cheers and a tiger told where the sympathies of the court and people were. Then a hundred pursed lips were advanced to kiss the liberated prisoner, and many a hand thrust out to give him a congratulatory shake--but presto! with a maniac's own quickness and a maniac's own fury the lunatic assassin of Richardson fell upon his friends with teeth and nails, boots and office furniture, and the amazing rapidity with which he broke heads and limbs, and rent and sundered bodies, till nearly a hundred citizens were reduced to mere quivering heaps of fleshy odds and ends and crimson rags, was like nothing in this world but the exultant frenzy of a plunging, tearing, roaring devil of a steam machine when it snatches a human being and spins him and whirls him till he shreds away to nothingness like a \u201cFour o'clock\u201d before the breath of a child.\n\nThe destruction was awful. It is said that within the space of eight minutes McFarland killed and crippled some six score persons and tore down a large portion of the City Hall building, carrying away and casting into Broadway six or seven marble columns fifty-four feet long and weighing nearly two tons each. But he was finally captured and sent in chains to the lunatic asylum for life.\n\n(By late telegrams it appears that this is a mistake.--Editor Express.)\n\nBut the really curious part of this whole matter is yet to be told. And that is, that McFarland's most intimate friends believe that the very next time that it ever occurred to him that the insanity plea was not a mere politic pretense, was when the verdict came in. They think that the startling thought burst upon him then, that if twelve good and true men, able to comprehend all the baseness of perjury, proclaimed under oath that he was a lunatic, there was no gainsaying such evidence and that he UNQUESTIONABLY WAS INSANE!\n\nPossibly that was really the way of it. It is dreadful to think that maybe the most awful calamity that can befall a man, namely, loss of reason, was precipitated upon this poor prisoner's head by a jury that could have hanged him instead, and so done him a mercy and his country a service.\n\n\n                             POSTSCRIPT-LATER\n\nMay 11--I do not expect anybody to believe so astounding a thing, and yet it is the solemn truth that instead of instantly sending the dangerous lunatic to the insane asylum (which I naturally supposed they would do, and so I prematurely said they had) the court has actually SET HIM AT LIBERTY. Comment is unnecessary. M.

T.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WILD MAN INTERVIEWED [From the Buffalo Express, September 18, 1869.]\n\nThere has been so much talk about the mysterious \u201cwild man\u201d out there in the West for some time, that I finally felt it was my duty to go out and interview him. There was something peculiarly and touchingly romantic about the creature and his strange actions, according to the newspaper reports. He was represented as being hairy, long-armed, and of great strength and stature; ugly and cumbrous; avoiding men, but appearing suddenly and unexpectedly to women and children; going armed with a club, but never molesting any creature, except sheep, or other prey; fond of eating and drinking, and not particular about the quality, quantity, or character of the beverages and edibles; living in the woods like a wild beast, but never angry; moaning, and sometimes howling, but never uttering articulate sounds.\n\nSuch was \u201cOld Shep\u201d as the papers painted him. I felt that the story of his life must be a sad one--a story of suffering, disappointment, and exile--a story of man's inhumanity to man in some shape or other--and I longed to persuade the secret from him.\n\n\n                      .....................\n\n\u201cSince you say you are a member of the press,\u201d said the wild man, \u201cI am willing to tell you all you wish to know. Bye and bye you will comprehend why it is that I wish to unbosom myself to a newspaper man when I have so studiously avoided conversation with other people. I will now unfold my strange story. I was born with the world we live upon, almost. I am the son of Cain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was present when the flood was announced.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the father of the Wandering Jew.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d\n\nI moved out of range of his club, and went on taking notes, but keeping a wary eye on him all the while. He smiled a melancholy smile and resumed:\n\n\u201cWhen I glance back over the dreary waste of ages, I see many a glimmering and mark that is familiar to my memory. And oh, the leagues I have travelled! the things I have seen! the events I have helped to emphasise! I was at the assassination of Caesar. I marched upon Mecca with Mahomet. I was in the Crusades, and stood with Godfrey when he planted the banner of the cross on the battlements of Jerusalem. I--\u201d\n\n\u201cOne moment, please. Have you given these items to any other journal? Can I--\u201d\n\n\u201cSilence. I was in the Pinta's shrouds with Columbus when America burst upon his vision. I saw Charles I beheaded. I was in London when the Gunpowder Plot was discovered. I was present at the trial of Warren Hastings. I was on American soil when the battle of Lexington was fought when the declaration was promulgated--when Cornwallis surrendered--When Washington died. I entered Paris with Napoleon after Elba. I was present when you mounted your guns and manned your fleets for the war of 1812--when the South fired upon Sumter--when Richmond fell--when the President's life was taken. In all the ages I have helped to celebrate the triumphs of genius, the achievements of arms, the havoc of storm, fire, pestilence, famine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour career has been a stirring one. Might I ask how you came to locate in these dull Kansas woods, when you have been so accustomed to excitement during what I might term so protracted a period, not to put too fine a point on it?\u201d\n\n\u201cListen. Once I was the honoured servitor of the noble and illustrious\u201d (here he heaved a sigh, and passed his hairy hand across his eyes) \u201cbut in these degenerate days I am become the slave of quack doctors and newspapers. I am driven from pillar to post and hurried up and down, sometimes with stencil-plate and paste-brush to defile the fences with cabalistic legends, and sometimes in grotesque and extravagant character at the behest of some driving journal. I attended to that Ocean Bank robbery some weeks ago, when I was hardly rested from finishing up the pow-wow about the completion of the Pacific Railroad; immediately I was spirited off to do an atrocious, murder for the benefit of the New York papers; next to attend the wedding of a patriarchal millionaire; next to raise a hurrah about the great boat race; and then, just when I had begun to hope that my old bones would have a rest, I am bundled off to this howling wilderness to strip, and jibber, and be ugly and hairy, and pull down fences and waylay sheep, and waltz around with a club, and play 'Wild Man' generally--and all to gratify the whim of a bedlam of crazy newspaper scribblers? From one end of the continent to the other, I am described as a gorilla, with a sort of human seeming about me--and all to gratify this quill-driving scum of the earth!\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor old carpet bagger!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been served infamously, often, in modern and semi-modern times. I have been compelled by base men to create fraudulent history, and to perpetrate all sorts of humbugs. I wrote those crazy Junius letters, I moped in a French dungeon for fifteen years, and wore a ridiculous Iron Mask; I poked around your Northern forests, among your vagabond Indians, a solemn French idiot, personating the ghost of a dead Dauphin, that the gaping world might wonder if we had 'a Bourbon among us'; I have played sea-serpent off Nahant, and Woolly-Horse and What-is-it for the museums; I have interviewed politicians for the Sun, worked up all manner of miracles for the Herald, ciphered up election returns for the World, and thundered Political Economy through the Tribune. I have done all the extravagant things that the wildest invention could contrive, and done them well, and this is my reward--playing Wild Man in Kansas without a shirt!\u201d\n\n\u201cMysterious being, a light dawns vaguely upon me--it grows apace--what--what is your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cSENSATION!\u201d\n  \u201cHence, horrible shape!\u201d\n\nIt spoke again:\n\n\u201cOh pitiless fate, my destiny hounds me once more. I am called. I go. Alas, is there no rest for me?\u201d\n\nIn a moment the Wild Man's features seemed to soften and refine, and his form to assume a more human grace and symmetry. His club changed to a spade, and he shouldered it and started away sighing profoundly and shedding tears.\n\n\u201cWhither, poor shade?\u201d\n\n\u201cTO DIG UP THE BYRON FAMILY!\u201d\n  Such was the response that floated back upon the wind as the sad spirit shook its ringlets to the breeze, flourished its shovel aloft, and disappeared beyond the brow of the hill.\n\nAll of which is in strict accordance with the facts.\n\n\n                                                            M. T.\n\n\n\n\nLAST WORDS OF GREAT MEN--[From the Buffalo Express, September 11, 1889.]\n\n\n     Marshal Neil's last words were: \u201cL'armee fran-caise!\u201d (The French\n     army.)--Exchange.\n\nWhat a sad thing it is to see a man close a grand career with a plagiarism in his mouth. Napoleon's last words were: \u201cTete d'armee.\u201d (Head of the army.) Neither of those remarks amounts to anything as \u201clast words,\u201d and reflect little credit upon the utterers.\n\nA distinguished man should be as particular about his last words as he is about his last breath. He should write them out on a slip of paper and take the judgment of his friends on them. He should never leave such a thing to the last hour of his life, and trust to an intellectual spirit at the last moment to enable him to say something smart with his latest gasp and launch into eternity with grandeur. No--a man is apt to be too much fagged and exhausted, both in body and mind, at such a time, to be reliable; and maybe the very thing he wants to say, he cannot think of to save him; and besides there are his weeping friends bothering around; and worse than all as likely as not he may have to deliver his last gasp before he is expecting to. A man cannot always expect to think of a natty thing to say under such circumstances, and so it is pure egotistic ostentation to put it off. There is hardly a case on record where a man came to his last moment unprepared and said a good thing--hardly a case where a man trusted to that last moment and did not make a solemn botch of it and go out of the world feeling absurd.\n\nNow there was Daniel Webster. Nobody could tell him anything. He was not afraid. He could do something neat when the time came. And how did it turn out? Why, his will had to be fixed over; and then all the relations came; and first one thing and then another interfered, till at last he only had a chance to say, \u201cI still live,\u201d and up he went.\n\nOf course he didn't still live, because he died--and so he might as well have kept his last words to himself as to have gone and made such a failure of it as that. A week before that fifteen minutes of calm reflection would have enabled that man to contrive some last words that would have been a credit to himself and a comfort to his family for generations to come.\n\nAnd there was John Quincy Adams. Relying on his splendid abilities and his coolness in emergencies, he trusted to a happy hit at the last moment to carry him through, and what was the result? Death smote him in the House of Representatives, and he observed, casually, \u201cThis is the last of earth.\u201d The last of earth! Why \u201cthe last of earth\u201d when there was so much more left? If he had said it was the last rose of summer or the last run of shad, it would have had as much point in it. What he meant to say was, \u201cAdam was the first and Adams is the last of earth,\u201d but he put it off a trifle too long, and so he had to go with that unmeaning observation on his lips.\n\nAnd there we have Napoleon's \u201cTete d'armee.\u201d That don't mean anything. Taken by itself, \u201cHead of the army,\u201d is no more important than \u201cHead of the police.\u201d And yet that was a man who could have said a good thing if he had barred out the doctor and studied over it a while. Marshal Neil, with half a century at his disposal, could not dash off anything better in his last moments than a poor plagiarism of another man's words, which were not worth plagiarizing in the first place. \u201cThe French army.\u201d Perfectly irrelevant--perfectly flat--utterly pointless. But if he had closed one eye significantly, and said, \u201cThe subscriber has made it lively for the French army,\u201d and then thrown a little of the comic into his last gasp, it would have been a thing to remember with satisfaction all the rest of his life. I do wish our great men would quit saying these flat things just at the moment they die. Let us have their next-to-the-last words for a while, and see if we cannot patch up from them something that will be more satisfactory.\n\nThe public does not wish to be outraged in this way all the time.\n\nBut when we come to call to mind the last words of parties who took the trouble to make the proper preparation for the occasion, we immediately notice a happy difference in the result.\n\nThere was Chesterfield. Lord Chesterfield had laboured all his life to build up the most shining reputation for affability and elegance of speech and manners the world has ever seen. And could you suppose he failed to appreciate the efficiency of characteristic \u201clast words,\u201d in the matter of seizing the successfully driven nail of such a reputation and clinching on the other side for ever? Not he. He prepared himself. He kept his eye on the clock and his finger on his pulse. He awaited his chance. And at last, when he knew his time was come, he pretended to think a new visitor had entered, and so, with the rattle in his throat emphasised for dramatic effect, he said to the servant, \u201cShin around, John, and get the gentleman a chair.\u201d And so he died, amid thunders of applause.\n\nNext we have Benjamin Franklin. Franklin, the author of Poor Richard's quaint sayings; Franklin the immortal axiom-builder, who used to sit up at nights reducing the rankest old threadbare platitudes to crisp and snappy maxims that had a nice, varnished, original look in their regimentals; who said, \u201cVirtue is its own reward;\u201d who said, \u201cProcrastination is the thief of time;\u201d who said, \u201cTime and tide wait for no man\u201d and \u201cNecessity is the mother of invention;\u201d good old Franklin, the Josh Billings of the eighteenth century--though, sooth to say, the latter transcends him in proverbial originality as much as he falls short of him in correctness of orthography. What sort of tactics did Franklin pursue? He pondered over his last words for as much as two weeks, and then when the time came, he said, \u201cNone but the brave deserve the fair,\u201d and died happy. He could not have said a sweeter thing if he had lived till he was an idiot.\n\nByron made a poor business of it, and could not think of anything to say, at the last moment but, \u201cAugusta--sister--Lady Byron--tell Harriet Beecher Stowe\u201d--etc., etc.,--but Shakespeare was ready and said, \u201cEngland expects every man to do his duty!\u201d and went off with splendid eclat.\n\nAnd there are other instances of sagacious preparation for a felicitous closing remark. For instance:\n\nJoan of Arc said, \u201cTramp, tramp, tramp the boys are marching.\u201d\n\nAlexander the Great said, \u201cAnother of those Santa Cruz punches, if you please.\u201d\n\nThe Empress Josephine said, \u201cNot for Jo-\u201d and could get no further.\n\nCleopatra said, \u201cThe Old Guard dies, but never surrenders.\u201d\n\nSir Walter Raleigh said, \u201cExecutioner, can I take your whetstone a moment, please?\u201d though what for is not clear.\n\nJohn Smith said, \u201cAlas, I am the last of my race.\u201d\n\nQueen Elizabeth said, \u201cOh, I would give my kingdom for one moment more--I have forgotten my last words.\u201d\n\nAnd Red Jacket, the noblest Indian brave that ever wielded a tomahawk in defence of a friendless and persecuted race, expired with these touching words upon his lips,\n\n\u201cWawkawampanoosucwinnebayowallazvsagamoresa-skatchewan.\u201d\n\nThere was not a dry eye in the wigwam.\n\nLet not this lesson be lost upon our public men. Let them take a healthy moment for preparation, and contrive some last words that shall be neat and to the point. Let Louis Napoleon say,\n\n\u201cI am content to follow my uncle--still, I do not wish to improve upon his last word. Put me down for 'Tete d'armee.'\u201d\n\nAnd Garret Davis, \u201cLet me recite the unabridged dictionary.\u201d\n\nAnd H. G., \u201cI desire, now, to say a few words on political economy.\u201d\n\nAnd Mr. Bergh, \u201cOnly take part of me at a time, if the load will be fatiguing to the hearse horses.\u201d\n\nAnd Andrew Johnson, \u201cI have been an alderman, Member of Congress, Governor, Senator, Pres--adieu, you know the rest.\u201d\n\nAnd Seward., \u201cAlas!-ka.\u201d\n\nAnd Grant, \u201cO.\u201d\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted, with the most honorable intentions. M. T.\n\nP. S.--I am obliged to leave out the illustrations. The artist finds it impossible to make a picture of people's last words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

THE SECRET REVEALED.\n\nCHAPTER II. FESTIVITY AND TEARS\n\nCHAPTER III. THE PLOT THICKENS.\n\nCHAPTER IV. THE AWFUL REVELATION.\n\nCHAPTER V. THE FRIGHTFUL CATASTROPHE.\n\n\n\n\n\nBURLESQUE AUTOBIOGRAPHY.\n\nTwo or three persons having at different times intimated that if I would\nwrite an autobiography they would read it, when they got leisure, I\nyield at last to this frenzied public demand, and herewith tender my\nhistory:\n\nOurs is a noble old house, and stretches a long way back into antiquity.\nThe earliest ancestor the Twains have any record of was a friend of the\nfamily by the name of Higgins. This was in the eleventh century, when\nour people were living in Aberdeen, county of Cork, England. Why it is\nthat our long line has ever since borne the maternal name (except when\none of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert\nfoolishness), instead of Higgins, is a mystery which none of us has ever\nfelt much desire to stir. It is a kind of vague, pretty romance, and we\nleave it alone. All the old families do that way.\n\nArthour Twain was a man of considerable note--a solicitor on the highway\nin William Rufus' time. At about the age of thirty he went to one of\nthose fine old English places of resort called Newgate, to see about\nsomething, and never returned again. While there he died suddenly.\n\nAugustus Twain, seems to have made something of a stir about the year\n1160. He was as full of fun as he could be, and used to take his old\nsabre and sharpen it up, and get in a convenient place on a dark night,\nand stick it through people as they went by, to see them jump. He was a\nborn humorist. But he got to going too far with it; and the first time\nhe was found stripping one of these parties, the authorities removed one\nend of him, and put it up on a nice high place on Temple Bar, where it\ncould contemplate the people and have a good time. He never liked any\nsituation so much or stuck to it so long.\n\nThen for the next two hundred years the family tree shows a succession\nof soldiers--noble, high-spirited fellows, who always went into battle\nsinging; right behind the army, and always went out a-whooping, right\nahead of it.\n\nThis is a scathing rebuke to old dead Froissart's poor witticism that\nour family tree never had but one limb to it, and that that one stuck\nout at right angles, and bore fruit winter, and summer.\n\n\n                         ||=======|====\n                         ||       |\n                         ||       |\n                         ||       O\n                         ||     / || \\\n                         ||       ||\n                         ||       ||\n                         ||\n                         ||\n                         ||\n                         OUR FAMILY TREE\n\nEarly in the fifteenth century we have Beau Twain, called \u201cthe Scholar.\u201d\n He wrote a beautiful, beautiful hand. And he could imitate anybody's\nhand so closely that it was enough to make a person laugh his head off\nto see it. He had infinite sport with his talent. But by and by he took\na contract to break stone for a road, and the roughness of the work\nspoiled his hand. Still, he enjoyed life all the time he was in the\nstone business, which, with inconsiderable intervals, was some forty-two\nyears. In fact, he died in harness. During all those long years he gave\nsuch satisfaction that he never was through with one contract a week\ntill government gave him another. He was a perfect pet. And he was\nalways a favorite with his fellow-artists, and was a conspicuous member\nof their benevolent secret society, called the Chain Gang. He always\nwore his hair short, had a preference for striped clothes, and died\nlamented by the government. He was a sore loss to his country. For he\nwas so regular.\n\nSome years later we have the illustrious John Morgan Twain. He came over\nto this country with Columbus in 1492, as a passenger. He appears to\nhave been of a crusty, uncomfortable disposition. He complained of the\nfood all the way over, and was always threatening to go ashore unless\nthere was a change. He wanted fresh shad. Hardly a day passed over his\nhead that he did not go idling about the ship with his nose in the air,\nsneering about the commander, and saying he did not believe Columbus\nknew where he was going to or had ever been there before. The memorable\ncry of \u201cLand ho!\u201d thrilled every heart in the ship but his. He gazed a\nwhile through a piece of smoked glass at the penciled line lying on the\ndistant water, and then said: \u201cLand be hanged,--it's a raft!\u201d\n\nWhen this questionable passenger came on board the ship, he brought\nnothing with him but an old newspaper containing a handkerchief marked\n\u201cB. G.,\u201d one cotton sock marked \u201cL. W. C.\u201d one woollen one marked \u201cD.\nF.\u201d and a night-shirt marked \u201cO. M. R.\u201d And yet during the voyage he\nworried more about his \u201ctrunk,\u201d and gave himself more airs about it,\nthan all the rest of the passengers put together.\n\nIf the ship was \u201cdown by the head,\u201d and would not steer, he would go and\nmove his \u201ctrunk\u201d farther aft, and then watch the effect. If the ship\nwas \u201cby the stern,\u201d he would suggest to Columbus to detail some men\nto \u201cshift that baggage.\u201d In storms he had to be gagged, because his\nwailings about his \u201ctrunk\u201d made it impossible for the men to hear the\norders. The man does not appear to have been openly charged with\nany gravely unbecoming thing, but it is noted in the ship's log as a\n\u201ccurious circumstance\u201d that albeit he brought his baggage on board the\nship in a newspaper, he took it ashore in four trunks, a queensware\ncrate, and a couple of champagne baskets. But when he came back\ninsinuating in an insolent, swaggering way, that some of his things were\nmissing, and was going to search the other passengers' baggage, it\nwas too much, and they threw him overboard. They watched long and\nwonderingly for him to come up, but not even a bubble rose on the\nquietly ebbing tide. But while every one was most absorbed in gazing\nover the side, and the interest was momentarily increasing, it was\nobserved with consternation that the vessel was adrift and the anchor\ncable hanging limp from the bow. Then in the ship's dimmed and ancient\nlog we find this quaint note:\n\n\n          \u201cIn time it was discouvered yt ye troblesome passenger hadde\n          gonne downe and got ye anchor, and toke ye same and solde it to\n          ye dam sauvages from ye interior, saying yt he hadde founde it,\n          ye sonne of a ghun!\u201d\n\nYet this ancestor had good and noble instincts, and it is with pride\nthat we call to mind the fact that he was the first white person who\never interested himself in the work of elevating and civilizing our\nIndians. He built a commodious jail and put up a gallows, and to\nhis dying day he claimed with satisfaction that he had had a more\nrestraining and elevating influence on the Indians than any other\nreformer that ever labored among them. At this point the chronicle\nbecomes less frank and chatty, and closes abruptly by saying that the\nold voyager went to see his gallows perform on the first white man ever\nhanged in America, and while there received injuries which terminated in\nhis death.\n\nThe great grandson of the \u201cReformer\u201d flourished in sixteen hundred and\nsomething, and was known in our annals as, \u201cthe old Admiral,\u201d though in\nhistory he had other titles. He was long in command of fleets of swift\nvessels, well armed and manned, and did great service in hurrying up\nmerchantmen. Vessels which he followed and kept his eagle eye on, always\nmade good fair time across the ocean. But if a ship still loitered\nin spite of all he could do, his indignation would grow till he could\ncontain himself no longer--and then he would take that ship home where\nhe lived and, keep it there carefully, expecting the owners to come for\nit, but they never did. And he would try to get the idleness and sloth\nout of the sailors of that ship by compelling them to take invigorating\nexercise and a bath. He called it \u201cwalking a plank.\u201d All the pupils\nliked it. At any rate, they never found any fault with it after trying\nit. When the owners were late coming for their ships, the Admiral always\nburned them, so that the insurance money should not be lost. At last\nthis fine old tar was cut down in the fulness of his years and honors.\nAnd to her dying day, his poor heart-broken widow believed that if\nhe had been cut down fifteen minutes sooner he might have been\nresuscitated.\n\nCharles Henry Twain lived during the latter part of the seventeenth\ncentury, and was a zealous and distinguished missionary. He converted\nsixteen thousand South Sea islanders, and taught them that a dog-tooth\nnecklace and a pair of spectacles was not enough clothing to come to\ndivine service in. His poor flock loved him very, very dearly; and\nwhen his funeral was over, they got up in a body (and came out of the\nrestaurant) with tears in their eyes, and saying, one to another, that\nhe was a good tender missionary, and they wished they had some more of\nhim.\n\nPAH-GO-TO-WAH-WAH-PUKKETEKEEWIS (Mighty-Hunter-with-a-Hog-Eye) TWAIN\nadorned the middle of the eighteenth century, and aided Gen. Braddock\nwith all his heart to resist the oppressor Washington. It was this\nancestor who fired seventeen times at our Washington from behind a tree.\nSo far the beautiful romantic narrative in the moral story-books is\ncorrect; but when that narrative goes on to say that at the seventeenth\nround the awe-stricken savage said solemnly that that man was being\nreserved by the Great Spirit for some mighty mission, and he dared not\nlift his sacrilegious rifle against him again, the narrative seriously\nimpairs the integrity of history. What he did say was:\n\n\u201cIt ain't no (hic!) no use. 'At man's so drunk he can't stan' still long\nenough for a man to hit him. I (hic!) I can't 'ford to fool away any\nmore am'nition on him!\u201d\n\nThat was why he stopped at the seventeenth round, and it was, a good\nplain matter-of-fact reason, too, and one that easily commends itself to\nus by the eloquent, persuasive flavor of probability there is about it.\n\nI always enjoyed the story-book narrative, but I felt a marring\nmisgiving that every Indian at Braddock's Defeat who fired at a soldier\na couple of times (two easily grows to seventeen in a century), and\nmissed him, jumped to the conclusion that the Great Spirit was reserving\nthat soldier for some grand mission; and so I somehow feared that the\nonly reason why Washington's case is remembered and the others forgotten\nis, that in his the prophecy came true, and in that of the others it\ndidn't. There are not books enough on earth to contain the record of the\nprophecies Indians and other unauthorized parties have made; but one may\ncarry in his overcoat pockets the record of all the prophecies that have\nbeen fulfilled.\n\nI will remark here, in passing, that certain ancestors of mine are so\nthoroughly well known in history by their aliases, that I have not felt\nit to be worth while to dwell upon them, or even mention them in the\norder of their birth. Among these may be mentioned RICHARD BRINSLEY\nTWAIN, alias Guy Fawkes; JOHN WENTWORTH TWAIN, alias Sixteen-String\nJack; WILLIAM HOGARTH TWAIN, alias Jack Sheppard; ANANIAS TWAIN, alias\nBaron Munchausen; JOHN GEORGE TWAIN, alias Capt. Kydd; and then there\nare George Francis Train, Tom Pepper, Nebuchadnezzar and Baalam's\nAss--they all belong to our family, but to a branch of it somewhat\ndistantly removed from the honorable direct line--in fact, a collateral\nbranch, whose members chiefly differ from the ancient stock in that, in\norder to acquire the notoriety we have always yearned and hungered for,\nthey have got into a low way of going to jail instead of getting hanged.\n\nIt is not well, when writing an autobiography, to follow your ancestry\ndown too close to your own time--it is safest to speak only vaguely of\nyour great-grandfather, and then skip from there to yourself, which I\nnow do.\n\nI was born without teeth--and there Richard III had the advantage of\nme; but I was born without a humpback, likewise, and there I had the\nadvantage of him. My parents were neither very poor nor conspicuously\nhonest.\n\nBut now a thought occurs to me. My own history would really seem so tame\ncontrasted with that of my ancestors, that it is simply wisdom to leave\nit unwritten until I am hanged. If some other biographies I have read\nhad stopped with the ancestry until a like event occurred, it would have\nbeen a felicitous thing, for the reading public. How does it strike you?\n\n\n\n\n\nAWFUL, TERRIBLE MEDIEVAL ROMANCE\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. THE SECRET REVEALED.\n\nIt was night. Stillness reigned in the grand old feudal castle of\nKlugenstein. The year 1222 was drawing to a close. Far away up in\nthe tallest of the castle's towers a single light glimmered. A secret\ncouncil was being held there. The stern old lord of Klugenstein sat in a\nchair of state meditating. Presently he said, with a tender accent:\n\n\u201cMy daughter!\u201d\n\nA young man of noble presence, clad from head to heel in knightly mail,\nanswered:\n\n\u201cSpeak, father!\u201d\n\n\u201cMy daughter, the time is come for the revealing of the mystery that\nhath puzzled all your young life. Know, then, that it had its birth in\nthe matters which I shall now unfold. My brother Ulrich is the great\nDuke of Brandenburgh. Our father, on his deathbed, decreed that if\nno son were born to Ulrich, the succession should pass to my house,\nprovided a son were born to me. And further, in case no son were born to\neither, but only daughters, then the succession should pass to Ulrich's\ndaughter, if she proved stainless; if she did not, my daughter should\nsucceed, if she retained a blameless name. And so I, and my old wife\nhere, prayed fervently for the good boon of a son, but the prayer was\nvain. You were born to us. I was in despair. I saw the mighty prize\nslipping from my grasp, the splendid dream vanishing away. And I had\nbeen so hopeful! Five years had Ulrich lived in wedlock, and yet his\nwife had borne no heir of either sex.\n\n\u201c'But hold,' I said, 'all is not lost.' A saving scheme had shot athwart\nmy brain. You were born at midnight. Only the leech, the nurse, and six\nwaiting-women knew your sex. I hanged them every one before an hour\nhad sped. Next morning all the barony went mad with rejoicing over\nthe proclamation that a son was born to Klugenstein, an heir to mighty\nBrandenburgh! And well the secret has been kept. Your mother's own\nsister nursed your infancy, and from that time forward we feared\nnothing.\n\n\u201cWhen you were ten years old, a daughter was born to Ulrich. We grieved,\nbut hoped for good results from measles, or physicians, or other\nnatural enemies of infancy, but were always disappointed. She lived, she\nthrove--Heaven's malison upon her! But it is nothing. We are safe.\nFor, Ha-ha! have we not a son? And is not our son the future Duke?\nOur well-beloved Conrad, is it not so?--for, woman of eight-and-twenty\nyears--as you are, my child, none other name than that hath ever fallen\nto you!\n\n\u201cNow it hath come to pass that age hath laid its hand upon my brother,\nand he waxes feeble. The cares of state do tax him sore. Therefore he\nwills that you shall come to him and be already Duke--in act, though not\nyet in name. Your servitors are ready--you journey forth to-night.\n\n\u201cNow listen well. Remember every word I say. There is a law as old as\nGermany that if any woman sit for a single instant in the great ducal\nchair before she hath been absolutely crowned in presence of the people,\nSHE SHALL DIE! So heed my words. Pretend humility. Pronounce your\njudgments from the Premier's chair, which stands at the foot of the\nthrone. Do this until you are crowned and safe. It is not likely that\nyour sex will ever be discovered; but still it is the part of wisdom to\nmake all things as safe as may be in this treacherous earthly life.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh; my father, is it for this my life hath been a lie! Was it that I\nmight cheat my unoffending cousin of her rights? Spare me, father, spare\nyour child!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, huzzy! Is this my reward for the august fortune my brain has\nwrought for thee? By the bones of my father, this puling sentiment of\nthine but ill accords with my humor.\n\n\u201cBetake thee to the Duke, instantly! And beware how thou meddlest with\nmy purpose!\u201d\n\nLet this suffice, of the conversation. It is enough for us to know that\nthe prayers, the entreaties and the tears of the gentle-natured girl\navailed nothing. They nor anything could move the stout old lord of\nKlugenstein. And so, at last, with a heavy heart, the daughter saw the\ncastle gates close behind her, and found herself riding away in the\ndarkness surrounded by a knightly array of armed vassals and a brave\nfollowing of servants.\n\nThe old baron sat silent for many minutes after his daughter's\ndeparture, and then he turned to his sad wife and said:\n\n\u201cDame, our matters seem speeding fairly. It is full three months since I\nsent the shrewd and handsome Count Detzin on his devilish mission to my\nbrother's daughter Constance. If he fail, we are not wholly safe; but if\nhe do succeed, no power can bar our girl from being Duchess e'en though\nill-fortune should decree she never should be Duke!\u201d\n\n\u201cMy heart is full of bodings, yet all may still be well.\u201d\n\n\u201cTush, woman! Leave the owls to croak. To bed with ye, and dream of\nBrandenburgh and grandeur!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. FESTIVITY AND TEARS\n\nSix days after the occurrences related in the above chapter, the\nbrilliant capital of the Duchy of Brandenburgh was resplendent with\nmilitary pageantry, and noisy with the rejoicings of loyal multitudes;\nfor Conrad, the young heir to the crown, was come. The old Duke's heart\nwas full of happiness, for Conrad's handsome person and graceful bearing\nhad won his love at once. The great halls of the palace were thronged\nwith nobles, who welcomed Conrad bravely; and so bright and happy did\nall things seem, that he felt his fears and sorrows passing away and\ngiving place to a comforting contentment.\n\nBut in a remote apartment of the palace a scene of a different nature\nwas transpiring. By a window stood the Duke's only child, the Lady\nConstance. Her eyes were red and swollen, and full of tears. She was\nalone. Presently she fell to weeping anew, and said aloud:\n\n\u201cThe villain Detzin is gone--has fled the dukedom! I could not believe\nit at first, but alas! it is too true. And I loved him so. I dared to\nlove him though I knew the Duke my father would never let me wed him. I\nloved him--but now I hate him! With all my soul I hate him! Oh, what is\nto become of me! I am lost, lost, lost! I shall go mad!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE PLOT THICKENS.\n\nA few months drifted by. All men published the praises of the young\nConrad's government and extolled the wisdom of his judgments, the\nmercifulness of his sentences, and the modesty with which he bore\nhimself in his great office. The old Duke soon gave everything into his\nhands, and sat apart and listened with proud satisfaction while his\nheir delivered the decrees of the crown from the seat of the premier.\nIt seemed plain that one so loved and praised and honored of all men as\nConrad was, could not be otherwise than happy. But strange enough, he\nwas not. For he saw with dismay that the Princess Constance had begun to\nlove him! The love of the rest of the world was happy fortune for him,\nbut this was freighted with danger! And he saw, moreover, that the\ndelighted Duke had discovered his daughter's passion likewise, and was\nalready dreaming of a marriage. Every day somewhat of the deep sadness\nthat had been in the princess' face faded away; every day hope and\nanimation beamed brighter from her eye; and by and by even vagrant\nsmiles visited the face that had been so troubled.\n\nConrad was appalled. He bitterly cursed himself for having yielded to\nthe instinct that had made him seek the companionship of one of his own\nsex when he was new and a stranger in the palace--when he was sorrowful\nand yearned for a sympathy such as only women can give or feel. He\nnow began to avoid, his cousin. But this only made matters worse, for,\nnaturally enough, the more he avoided her, the more she cast herself in\nhis way. He marvelled at this at first; and next it startled him. The\ngirl haunted him; she hunted him; she happened upon him at all times and\nin all places, in the night as well as in the day. She seemed singularly\nanxious. There was surely a mystery somewhere.\n\nThis could not go on forever. All the world was talking about it. The\nDuke was beginning to look perplexed. Poor Conrad was becoming a very\nghost through dread and dire distress. One day as he was emerging from a\nprivate ante-room attached to the picture gallery, Constance confronted\nhim, and seizing both his hands, in hers, exclaimed:\n\n\u201cOh, why, do you avoid me? What have I done--what have I said, to lose\nyour kind opinion of me--for, surely I had it once? Conrad, do not\ndespise me, but pity a tortured heart? I cannot--cannot hold the words\nunspoken longer, lest they kill me--I LOVE you, CONRAD! There, despise\nme if you must, but they would be uttered!\u201d\n\nConrad was speechless. Constance hesitated a moment, and then,\nmisinterpreting his silence, a wild gladness flamed in her eyes, and she\nflung her arms about his neck and said:\n\n\u201cYou relent! you relent! You can love me--you will love me! Oh, say you\nwill, my own, my worshipped Conrad!\u201d\n\nConrad groaned aloud. A sickly pallor overspread his countenance, and\nhe trembled like an aspen. Presently, in desperation, he thrust the poor\ngirl from him, and cried:\n\n\u201cYou know not what you ask! It is forever and ever impossible!\u201d And then\nhe fled like a criminal and left the princess stupefied with amazement.\nA minute afterward she was crying and sobbing there, and Conrad was\ncrying and sobbing in his chamber. Both were in despair. Both saw ruin\nstaring them in the face.\n\nBy and by Constance rose slowly to her feet and moved away, saying:\n\n\u201cTo think that he was despising my love at the very moment that I\nthought it was melting his cruel heart! I hate him! He spurned me--did\nthis man--he spurned me from him like a dog!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. THE AWFUL REVELATION.\n\nTime passed on. A settled sadness rested once more upon the countenance\nof the good Duke's daughter. She and Conrad were seen together no more\nnow. The Duke grieved at this. But as the weeks wore away, Conrad's\ncolor came back to his cheeks and his old-time vivacity to his eye,\nand he administered the government with a clear and steadily ripening\nwisdom.\n\nPresently a strange whisper began to be heard about the palace. It grew\nlouder; it spread farther. The gossips of the city got hold of it. It\nswept the dukedom. And this is what the whisper said:\n\n\u201cThe Lady Constance hath given birth to a child!\u201d\n\nWhen the lord of Klugenstein heard it, he swung his plumed helmet thrice\naround his head and shouted:\n\n\u201cLong live Duke Conrad!--for lo, his crown is sure, from this day\nforward! Detzin has done his errand well, and the good scoundrel shall\nbe rewarded!\u201d\n\nAnd he spread the tidings far and wide, and for eight-and-forty hours no\nsoul in all the barony but did dance and sing, carouse and illuminate,\nto celebrate the great event, and all at proud and happy old\nKlugenstein's expense.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE FRIGHTFUL CATASTROPHE.\n\nThe trial was at hand. All the great lords and barons of Brandenburgh\nwere assembled in the Hall of Justice in the ducal palace. No space was\nleft unoccupied where there was room for a spectator to stand or sit.\nConrad, clad in purple and ermine, sat in the premier's chair, and on\neither side sat the great judges of the realm. The old Duke had sternly\ncommanded that the trial of his daughter should proceed, without favor,\nand then had taken to his bed broken-hearted. His days were numbered.\nPoor Conrad had begged, as for his very life, that he might be spared\nthe misery of sitting in judgment upon his cousin's crime, but it did\nnot avail.\n\nThe saddest heart in all that great assemblage was in Conrad's breast.\n\nThe gladdest was in his father's. For, unknown to his daughter \u201cConrad,\u201d\n the old Baron Klugenstein was come, and was among the crowd of nobles,\ntriumphant in the swelling fortunes of his house.\n\nAfter the heralds had made due proclamation and the other preliminaries\nhad followed, the venerable Lord Chief justice said:\n\n\u201cPrisoner, stand forth!\u201d\n\nThe unhappy princess rose and stood unveiled before the vast multitude.\nThe Lord Chief Justice continued:\n\n\u201cMost noble lady, before the great judges of this realm it hath been\ncharged and proven that out of holy wedlock your Grace hath given birth\nunto a child; and by our ancient law the penalty is death, excepting in\none sole contingency, whereof his Grace the acting Duke, our good Lord\nConrad, will advertise you in his solemn sentence now; wherefore, give\nheed.\u201d\n\nConrad stretched forth the reluctant sceptre, and in the self-same\nmoment the womanly heart beneath his robe yearned pityingly toward the\ndoomed prisoner, and the tears came into his eyes. He opened his lips to\nspeak, but the Lord Chief Justice said quickly:\n\n\u201cNot there, your Grace, not there! It is not lawful to pronounce\njudgment upon any of the ducal line SAVE FROM THE DUCAL THRONE!\u201d\n\nA shudder went to the heart of poor Conrad, and a tremor shook the iron\nframe of his old father likewise. CONRAD HAD NOT BEEN CROWNED--dared he\nprofane the throne? He hesitated and turned pale with fear. But it must\nbe done. Wondering eyes were already upon him. They would be suspicious\neyes if he hesitated longer. He ascended the throne. Presently he\nstretched forth the sceptre again, and said:\n\n\u201cPrisoner, in the name of our sovereign lord, Ulrich, Duke of\nBrandenburgh, I proceed to the solemn duty that hath devolved upon\nme. Give heed to my words. By the ancient law of the land, except you\nproduce the partner of your guilt and deliver him up to the executioner,\nyou must surely die. Embrace this opportunity--save yourself while yet\nyou may. Name the father of your child!\u201d\n\nA solemn hush fell upon the great court--a silence so profound that men\ncould hear their own hearts beat. Then the princess slowly turned, with\neyes gleaming with hate, and pointing her finger straight at Conrad,\nsaid:\n\n\u201cThou art the man!\u201d\n\nAn appalling conviction of his helpless, hopeless peril struck a chill\nto Conrad's heart like the chill of death itself. What power on earth\ncould save him! To disprove the charge, he must reveal that he was a\nwoman; and for an uncrowned woman to sit in the ducal chair was death!\nAt one and the same moment, he and his grim old father swooned and fell\nto, the ground.\n\n[The remainder of this thrilling and eventful story will NOT be found in\nthis or any other publication, either now or at any future time.]\n\nThe truth is, I have got my hero (or heroine) into such a particularly\nclose place, that I do not see how I am ever going to get him (or\nher) out of it again--and therefore I will wash my hands of the whole\nbusiness, and leave that person to get out the best way that offers--or\nelse stay there.

The village of St.\nPetersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public\nprayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private\nprayer that had the petitioner's whole heart in it; but still no good\nnews came from the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the\nquest and gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain\nthe children could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a\ngreat part of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to\nhear her call her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute\nat a time, then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had\ndrooped into a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost\nwhite. The village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.\n\nAway in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village\nbells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad\npeople, who shouted, \"Turn out! turn out! they're found! they're\nfound!\" Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed\nitself and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open\ncarriage drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its\nhomeward march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring\nhuzzah after huzzah!\n\nThe village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the\ngreatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour\na procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher's house, seized\nthe saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher's hand, tried to\nspeak but couldn't--and drifted out raining tears all over the place.\n\nAunt Polly's happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's nearly so. It\nwould be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with\nthe great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay\nupon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of\nthe wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it\nwithal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went on\nan exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his\nkite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of\nthe kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off\nspeck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,\npushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad\nMississippi rolling by! And if it had only happened to be night he would\nnot have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that\npassage any more! He told how he went back for Becky and broke the good\nnews and she told him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was\ntired, and knew she was going to die, and wanted to. He described how he\nlabored with her and convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when\nshe had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how\nhe pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat\nthere and cried for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom\nhailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition;\nhow the men didn't believe the wild tale at first, \"because,\" said they,\n\"you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in\"\n--then took them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them\nrest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home.\n\nBefore day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him\nwere tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung\nbehind them, and informed of the great news.\n\nThree days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be\nshaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were\nbedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and\nmore tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on\nThursday, was down-town Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday;\nbut Becky did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as\nif she had passed through a wasting illness.\n\nTom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday, but\ncould not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or\nSunday. He was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still\nabout his adventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas\nstayed by to see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff\nHill event; also that the \"ragged man's\" body had eventually been found\nin the river near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying\nto escape, perhaps.\n\nAbout a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave, he started off to\nvisit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting\ntalk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge\nThatcher's house was on Tom's way, and he stopped to see Becky. The\nJudge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him\nironically if he wouldn't like to go to the cave again. Tom said he\nthought he wouldn't mind it. The Judge said:\n\n\"Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least doubt.\nBut we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any\nmore.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago,\nand triple-locked--and I've got the keys.\"\n\nTom turned as white as a sheet.\n\n\"What's the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!\"\n\nThe water was brought and thrown into Tom's face.\n\n\"Ah, now you're all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?\"\n\n\"Oh, Judge, Injun Joe's in the cave!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nWITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of\nmen were on their way to McDougal's cave, and the ferryboat, well\nfilled with passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that\nbore Judge Thatcher.\n\nWhen the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in\nthe dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,\ndead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing\neyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer\nof the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own\nexperience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but\nnevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,\nwhich revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated\nbefore how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day\nhe lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.\n\nInjun Joe's bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The\ngreat foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through,\nwith tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock\nformed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had\nwrought no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if\nthere had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been\nuseless still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could\nnot have squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had\nonly hacked that place in order to be doing something--in order to pass\nthe weary time--in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily\none could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices\nof this vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The\nprisoner had searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to\ncatch a few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their\nclaws. The poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at\nhand, a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages,\nbuilded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had\nbroken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone,\nwherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop\nthat fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a\nclock-tick--a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop\nwas falling when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the\nfoundations of Rome were laid when Christ was crucified; when the\nConqueror created the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the\nmassacre at Lexington was \"news.\" It is falling now; it will still be\nfalling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of\nhistory, and the twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in the\nthick night of oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a mission? Did\nthis drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for\nthis flitting human insect's need? and has it another important object\nto accomplish ten thousand years to come? No matter. It is many and\nmany a year since the hapless half-breed scooped out the stone to catch\nthe priceless drops, but to this day the tourist stares longest at that\npathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when he comes to see the\nwonders of McDougal's cave. Injun Joe's cup stands first in the list of\nthe cavern's marvels; even \"Aladdin's Palace\" cannot rival it.\n\nInjun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked\nthere in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and\nhamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and all\nsorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as\nsatisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the\nhanging.\n\nThis funeral stopped the further growth of one thing--the petition to\nthe governor for Injun Joe's pardon. The petition had been largely\nsigned; many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a\ncommittee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail\naround the governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample\nhis duty under foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five\ncitizens of the village, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself\nthere would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names\nto a pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently\nimpaired and leaky water-works.\n\nThe morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have\nan important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom's adventure from the\nWelshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned\nthere was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he\nwanted to talk about now. Huck's face saddened. He said:\n\n\"I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but\nwhiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must 'a' ben\nyou, soon as I heard 'bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you\nhadn't got the money becuz you'd 'a' got at me some way or other and\ntold me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something's always\ntold me we'd never get holt of that swag.\"\n\n\"Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. YOU know his tavern\nwas all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don't you remember you\nwas to watch there that night?\"\n\n\"Oh yes! Why, it seems 'bout a year ago. It was that very night that I\nfollered Injun Joe to the widder's.\"\n\n\"YOU followed him?\"\n\n\"Yes--but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe's left friends behind him,\nand I don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it\nhadn't ben for me he'd be down in Texas now, all right.\"\n\nThen Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only\nheard of the Welshman's part of it before.\n\n\"Well,\" said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question,\n\"whoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon\n--anyways it's a goner for us, Tom.\"\n\n\"Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!\"\n\n\"What!\" Huck searched his comrade's face keenly. \"Tom, have you got on\nthe track of that money again?\"\n\n\"Huck, it's in the cave!\"\n\nHuck's eyes blazed.\n\n\"Say it again, Tom.\"\n\n\"The money's in the cave!\"\n\n\"Tom--honest injun, now--is it fun, or earnest?\"\n\n\"Earnest, Huck--just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go\nin there with me and help get it out?\"\n\n\"I bet I will! I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it and not\nget lost.\"\n\n\"Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's--\"\n\n\"Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it I'll\nagree to give you my drum and every thing I've got in the world. I\nwill, by jings.\"\n\n\"All right--it's a whiz. When do you say?\"\n\n\"Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?\"\n\n\"Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,\nnow, but I can't walk more'n a mile, Tom--least I don't think I could.\"\n\n\"It's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go,\nHuck, but there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody but me\nknow about. Huck, I'll take you right to it in a skiff. I'll float the\nskiff down there, and I'll pull it back again all by myself. You\nneedn't ever turn your hand over.\"\n\n\"Less start right off, Tom.\"\n\n\"All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little\nbag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these\nnew-fangled things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many's\nthe time I wished I had some when I was in there before.\"\n\nA trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who\nwas absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles\nbelow \"Cave Hollow,\" Tom said:\n\n\"Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the\ncave hollow--no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see\nthat white place up yonder where there's been a landslide? Well, that's\none of my marks. We'll get ashore, now.\"\n\nThey landed.\n\n\"Now, Huck, where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I got out\nof with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.\"\n\nHuck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly\nmarched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:\n\n\"Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in this\ncountry. You just keep mum about it. All along I've been wanting to be\na robber, but I knew I'd got to have a thing like this, and where to\nrun across it was the bother. We've got it now, and we'll keep it\nquiet, only we'll let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in--because of course\nthere's got to be a Gang, or else there wouldn't be any style about it.\nTom Sawyer's Gang--it sounds splendid, don't it, Huck?\"\n\n\"Well, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?\"\n\n\"Oh, most anybody. Waylay people--that's mostly the way.\"\n\n\"And kill them?\"\n\n\"No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.\"\n\n\"What's a ransom?\"\n\n\"Money. You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends; and\nafter you've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill them.\nThat's the general way. Only you don't kill the women. You shut up the\nwomen, but you don't kill them. They're always beautiful and rich, and\nawfully scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take\nyour hat off and talk polite. They ain't anybody as polite as robbers\n--you'll see that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and\nafter they've been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and\nafter that you couldn't get them to leave. If you drove them out they'd\nturn right around and come back. It's so in all the books.\"\n\n\"Why, it's real bully, Tom. I believe it's better'n to be a pirate.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and\ncircuses and all that.\"\n\nBy this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom\nin the lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel,\nthen made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps\nbrought them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through\nhim. He showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of\nclay against the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the\nflame struggle and expire.\n\nThe boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and\ngloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently\nentered and followed Tom's other corridor until they reached the\n\"jumping-off place.\" The candles revealed the fact that it was not\nreally a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet\nhigh. Tom whispered:\n\n\"Now I'll show you something, Huck.\"\n\nHe held his candle aloft and said:\n\n\"Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There--on\nthe big rock over yonder--done with candle-smoke.\"\n\n\"Tom, it's a CROSS!\"\n\n\"NOW where's your Number Two? 'UNDER THE CROSS,' hey? Right yonder's\nwhere I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!\"\n\nHuck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:\n\n\"Tom, less git out of here!\"\n\n\"What! and leave the treasure?\"\n\n\"Yes--leave it. Injun Joe's ghost is round about there, certain.\"\n\n\"No it ain't, Huck, no it ain't. It would ha'nt the place where he\ndied--away out at the mouth of the cave--five mile from here.\"\n\n\"No, Tom, it wouldn't. It would hang round the money. I know the ways\nof ghosts, and so do you.\"\n\nTom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in his\nmind. But presently an idea occurred to him--\n\n\"Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we're making of ourselves! Injun Joe's\nghost ain't a going to come around where there's a cross!\"\n\nThe point was well taken. It had its effect.\n\n\"Tom, I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us, that\ncross is. I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.\"\n\nTom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.\nHuck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the\ngreat rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result.\nThey found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with\na pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some\nbacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there\nwas no money-box. The lads searched and researched this place, but in\nvain. Tom said:\n\n\"He said UNDER the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the\ncross. It can't be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on\nthe ground.\"\n\nThey searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged.\nHuck could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:\n\n\"Lookyhere, Huck, there's footprints and some candle-grease on the\nclay about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now,\nwhat's that for? I bet you the money IS under the rock. I'm going to\ndig in the clay.\"\n\n\"That ain't no bad notion, Tom!\" said Huck with animation.\n\nTom's \"real Barlow\" was out at once, and he had not dug four inches\nbefore he struck wood.\n\n\"Hey, Huck!--you hear that?\"\n\nHuck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and\nremoved. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.\nTom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he\ncould, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed to\nexplore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended\ngradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to\nthe left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and\nexclaimed:\n\n\"My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!\"\n\nIt was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern,\nalong with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two\nor three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish\nwell soaked with the water-drip.\n\n\"Got it at last!\" said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with\nhis hand. \"My, but we're rich, Tom!\"\n\n\"Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to believe,\nbut we HAVE got it, sure! Say--let's not fool around here. Let's snake\nit out. Lemme see if I can lift the box.\"\n\nIt weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward\nfashion, but could not carry it conveniently.\n\n\"I thought so,\" he said; \"THEY carried it like it was heavy, that day\nat the ha'nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of\nfetching the little bags along.\"\n\nThe money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross\nrock.\n\n\"Now less fetch the guns and things,\" said Huck.\n\n\"No, Huck--leave them there. They're just the tricks to have when we\ngo to robbing. We'll keep them there all the time, and we'll hold our\norgies there, too. It's an awful snug place for orgies.\"\n\n\"What orgies?\"\n\n\"I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we've got to\nhave them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long time. It's\ngetting late, I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll eat and smoke when we\nget to the skiff.\"\n\nThey presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily\nout, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the\nskiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got\nunder way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting\ncheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.\n\n\"Now, Huck,\" said Tom, \"we'll hide the money in the loft of the\nwidow's woodshed, and I'll come up in the morning and we'll count it\nand divide, and then we'll hunt up a place out in the woods for it\nwhere it will be safe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till\nI run and hook Benny Taylor's little wagon; I won't be gone a minute.\"\n\nHe disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two\nsmall sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started\noff, dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the\nWelshman's house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move\non, the Welshman stepped out and said:\n\n\"Hallo, who's that?\"\n\n\"Huck and Tom Sawyer.\"\n\n\"Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.\nHere--hurry up, trot ahead--I'll haul the wagon for you. Why, it's not\nas light as it might be. Got bricks in it?--or old metal?\"\n\n\"Old metal,\" said Tom.\n\n\"I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool\naway more time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to sell to the\nfoundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But\nthat's human nature--hurry along, hurry along!\"\n\nThe boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.\n\n\"Never mind; you'll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas'.\"\n\nHuck said with some apprehension--for he was long used to being\nfalsely accused:\n\n\"Mr. Jones, we haven't been doing nothing.\"\n\nThe Welshman laughed.\n\n\"Well, I don't know, Huck, my boy. I don't know about that. Ain't you\nand the widow good friends?\"\n\n\"Yes. Well, she's ben good friends to me, anyway.\"\n\n\"All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?\"\n\nThis question was not entirely answered in Huck's slow mind before he\nfound himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas' drawing-room.\nMr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.\n\nThe place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any\nconsequence in the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the\nHarpers, the Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor,\nand a great many more, and all dressed in their best. The widow\nreceived the boys as heartily as any one could well receive two such\nlooking beings. They were covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt\nPolly blushed crimson with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head\nat Tom. Nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did, however. Mr.\nJones said:\n\n\"Tom wasn't at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and\nHuck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.\"\n\n\"And you did just right,\" said the widow. \"Come with me, boys.\"\n\nShe took them to a bedchamber and said:\n\n\"Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of clothes\n--shirts, socks, everything complete. They're Huck's--no, no thanks,\nHuck--Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they'll fit both of you.\nGet into them. We'll wait--come down when you are slicked up enough.\"\n\nThen she left.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nHUCK said: \"Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain't\nhigh from the ground.\"\n\n\"Shucks! what do you want to slope for?\"\n\n\"Well, I ain't used to that kind of a crowd. I can't stand it. I ain't\ngoing down there, Tom.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother! It ain't anything. I don't mind it a bit. I'll take care\nof you.\"\n\nSid appeared.\n\n\"Tom,\" said he, \"auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon.\nMary got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody's been fretting about\nyou. Say--ain't this grease and clay, on your clothes?\"\n\n\"Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist 'tend to your own business. What's all this\nblow-out about, anyway?\"\n\n\"It's one of the widow's parties that she's always having. This time\nit's for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they\nhelped her out of the other night. And say--I can tell you something,\nif you want to know.\"\n\n\"Well, what?\"\n\n\"Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people\nhere to-night, but I overheard him tell auntie to-day about it, as a\nsecret, but I reckon it's not much of a secret now. Everybody knows\n--the widow, too, for all she tries to let on she don't. Mr. Jones was\nbound Huck should be here--couldn't get along with his grand secret\nwithout Huck, you know!\"\n\n\"Secret about what, Sid?\"\n\n\"About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow's. I reckon Mr. Jones\nwas going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will\ndrop pretty flat.\"\n\nSid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.\n\n\"Sid, was it you that told?\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind who it was. SOMEBODY told--that's enough.\"\n\n\"Sid, there's only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and\nthat's you. If you had been in Huck's place you'd 'a' sneaked down the\nhill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can't do any but mean\nthings, and you can't bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.\nThere--no thanks, as the widow says\"--and Tom cuffed Sid's ears and\nhelped him to the door with several kicks. \"Now go and tell auntie if\nyou dare--and to-morrow you'll catch it!\"\n\nSome minutes later the widow's guests were at the supper-table, and a\ndozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room,\nafter the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr.\nJones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the\nhonor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was\nanother person whose modesty--\n\nAnd so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck's share in the\nadventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the\nsurprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and\neffusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However,\nthe widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many\ncompliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot the\nnearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely\nintolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody's gaze\nand everybody's laudations.\n\nThe widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have\nhim educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start\nhim in business in a modest way. Tom's chance was come. He said:\n\n\"Huck don't need it. Huck's rich.\"\n\nNothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept\nback the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But\nthe silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:\n\n\"Huck's got money. Maybe you don't believe it, but he's got lots of\nit. Oh, you needn't smile--I reckon I can show you. You just wait a\nminute.\"\n\nTom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a\nperplexed interest--and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.\n\n\"Sid, what ails Tom?\" said Aunt Polly. \"He--well, there ain't ever any\nmaking of that boy out. I never--\"\n\nTom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly\ndid not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon\nthe table and said:\n\n\"There--what did I tell you? Half of it's Huck's and half of it's mine!\"\n\nThe spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke\nfor a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom\nsaid he could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of\ninterest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the\ncharm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:\n\n\"I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it\ndon't amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I'm\nwilling to allow.\"\n\nThe money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve\nthousand dollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one\ntime before, though several persons were there who were worth\nconsiderably more than that in property.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nTHE reader may rest satisfied that Tom's and Huck's windfall made a\nmighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a\nsum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked\nabout, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the\ncitizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every\n\"haunted\" house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was\ndissected, plank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for\nhidden treasure--and not by boys, but men--pretty grave, unromantic\nmen, too, some of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were\ncourted, admired, stared at. The boys were not able to remember that\ntheir remarks had possessed weight before; but now their sayings were\ntreasured and repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be\nregarded as remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and\nsaying commonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up\nand discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village\npaper published biographical sketches of the boys.\n\nThe Widow Douglas put Huck's money out at six per cent., and Judge\nThatcher did the same with Tom's at Aunt Polly's request. Each lad had\nan income, now, that was simply prodigious--a dollar for every week-day\nin the year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got\n--no, it was what he was promised--he generally couldn't collect it. A\ndollar and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in\nthose old simple days--and clothe him and wash him, too, for that\nmatter.\n\nJudge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no\ncommonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When\nBecky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her\nwhipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded\ngrace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that\nwhipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine\noutburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie--a lie that\nwas worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to\nbreast with George Washington's lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky\nthought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he\nwalked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight\noff and told Tom about it.\n\nJudge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some\nday. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the\nNational Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school\nin the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or\nboth.\n\nHuck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow\nDouglas' protection introduced him into society--no, dragged him into\nit, hurled him into it--and his sufferings were almost more than he\ncould bear. The widow's servants kept him clean and neat, combed and\nbrushed, and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had\nnot one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know\nfor a friend. He had to eat with a knife and fork; he had to use\nnapkin, cup, and plate; he had to learn his book, he had to go to\nchurch; he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in\nhis mouth; whithersoever he turned, the bars and shackles of\ncivilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot.\n\nHe bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up\nmissing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in\ngreat distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched\nhigh and low, they dragged the river for his body. Early the third\nmorning Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads\ndown behind the abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found\nthe refugee. Huck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some\nstolen odds and ends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with\nhis pipe. He was unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of\nrags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free and\nhappy. Tom routed him out, told him the trouble he had been causing,\nand urged him to go home. Huck's face lost its tranquil content, and\ntook a melancholy cast. He said:\n\n\"Don't talk about it, Tom. I've tried it, and it don't work; it don't\nwork, Tom. It ain't for me; I ain't used to it. The widder's good to\nme, and friendly; but I can't stand them ways. She makes me get up just\nat the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all to\nthunder; she won't let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them\nblamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don't seem to any air\ngit through 'em, somehow; and they're so rotten nice that I can't set\ndown, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher's; I hain't slid on a\ncellar-door for--well, it 'pears to be years; I got to go to church and\nsweat and sweat--I hate them ornery sermons! I can't ketch a fly in\nthere, I can't chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by\na bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell--everything's\nso awful reg'lar a body can't stand it.\"\n\n\"Well, everybody does that way, Huck.\"\n\n\"Tom, it don't make no difference. I ain't everybody, and I can't\nSTAND it. It's awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy--I don't\ntake no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing; I\ngot to ask to go in a-swimming--dern'd if I hain't got to ask to do\neverything. Well, I'd got to talk so nice it wasn't no comfort--I'd got\nto go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste in\nmy mouth, or I'd a died, Tom. The widder wouldn't let me smoke; she\nwouldn't let me yell, she wouldn't let me gape, nor stretch, nor\nscratch, before folks--\" [Then with a spasm of special irritation and\ninjury]--\"And dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a\nwoman! I HAD to shove, Tom--I just had to. And besides, that school's\ngoing to open, and I'd a had to go to it--well, I wouldn't stand THAT,\nTom. Looky here, Tom, being rich ain't what it's cracked up to be. It's\njust worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead\nall the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar'l suits me, and\nI ain't ever going to shake 'em any more. Tom, I wouldn't ever got into\nall this trouble if it hadn't 'a' ben for that money; now you just take\nmy sheer of it along with your'n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes--not\nmany times, becuz I don't give a dern for a thing 'thout it's tollable\nhard to git--and you go and beg off for me with the widder.\"\n\n\"Oh, Huck, you know I can't do that. 'Tain't fair; and besides if\nyou'll try this thing just a while longer you'll come to like it.\"\n\n\"Like it! Yes--the way I'd like a hot stove if I was to set on it long\nenough. No, Tom, I won't be rich, and I won't live in them cussed\nsmothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and\nI'll stick to 'em, too. Blame it all! just as we'd got guns, and a\ncave, and all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to\ncome up and spile it all!\"\n\nTom saw his opportunity--\n\n\"Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain't going to keep me back from turning\nrobber.\"\n\n\"No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?\"\n\n\"Just as dead earnest as I'm sitting here. But Huck, we can't let you\ninto the gang if you ain't respectable, you know.\"\n\nHuck's joy was quenched.\n\n\"Can't let me in, Tom? Didn't you let me go for a pirate?\"\n\n\"Yes, but that's different. A robber is more high-toned than what a\npirate is--as a general thing. In most countries they're awful high up\nin the nobility--dukes and such.\"\n\n\"Now, Tom, hain't you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn't shet me\nout, would you, Tom? You wouldn't do that, now, WOULD you, Tom?\"\n\n\"Huck, I wouldn't want to, and I DON'T want to--but what would people\nsay? Why, they'd say, 'Mph! Tom Sawyer's Gang! pretty low characters in\nit!' They'd mean you, Huck. You wouldn't like that, and I wouldn't.\"\n\nHuck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally\nhe said:\n\n\"Well, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if\nI can come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang, Tom.\"\n\n\"All right, Huck, it's a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I'll ask the\nwidow to let up on you a little, Huck.\"\n\n\"Will you, Tom--now will you? That's good. If she'll let up on some of\nthe roughest things, I'll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd\nthrough or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?\"\n\n\"Oh, right off. We'll get the boys together and have the initiation\nto-night, maybe.\"\n\n\"Have the which?\"\n\n\"Have the initiation.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"It's to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang's\nsecrets, even if you're chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and\nall his family that hurts one of the gang.\"\n\n\"That's gay--that's mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.\"\n\n\"Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing's got to be done at\nmidnight, in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find--a ha'nted\nhouse is the best, but they're all ripped up now.\"\n\n\"Well, midnight's good, anyway, Tom.\"\n\n\"Yes, so it is. And you've got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with\nblood.\"\n\n\"Now, that's something LIKE! Why, it's a million times bullier than\npirating. I'll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be\na reg'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking 'bout it, I reckon\nshe'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.\"\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a BOY, it\nmust stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming\nthe history of a MAN. When one writes a novel about grown people, he\nknows exactly where to stop--that is, with a marriage; but when he\nwrites of juveniles, he must stop where he best can.\n\nMost of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are\nprosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the\nstory of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they\nturned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that\npart of their lives at present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

After much thought, I decided that\nI was a person fitted to furnish to mankind this spectacle. So I\ndetermined to do it. This was in March, 1878.\n\nI looked about me for the right sort of person to accompany me in the\ncapacity of agent, and finally hired a Mr. Harris for this service.\n\nIt was also my purpose to study art while in Europe. Mr. Harris was in\nsympathy with me in this. He was as much of an enthusiast in art as\nI was, and not less anxious to learn to paint. I desired to learn the\nGerman language; so did Harris.\n\nToward the middle of April we sailed in the HOLSATIA, Captain Brandt,\nand had a very pleasant trip, indeed.\n\nAfter a brief rest at Hamburg, we made preparations for a long\npedestrian trip southward in the soft spring weather, but at the\nlast moment we changed the program, for private reasons, and took the\nexpress-train.\n\nWe made a short halt at Frankfort-on-the-Main, and found it an\ninteresting city. I would have liked to visit the birthplace of\nGutenburg, but it could not be done, as no memorandum of the site of the\nhouse has been kept. So we spent an hour in the Goethe mansion instead.\nThe city permits this house to belong to private parties, instead\nof gracing and dignifying herself with the honor of possessing and\nprotecting it.\n\nFrankfort is one of the sixteen cities which have the distinction of\nbeing the place where the following incident occurred. Charlemagne,\nwhile chasing the Saxons (as HE said), or being chased by them (as THEY\nsaid), arrived at the bank of the river at dawn, in a fog. The enemy\nwere either before him or behind him; but in any case he wanted to get\nacross, very badly. He would have given anything for a guide, but none\nwas to be had. Presently he saw a deer, followed by her young, approach\nthe water. He watched her, judging that she would seek a ford, and he\nwas right. She waded over, and the army followed. So a great Frankish\nvictory or defeat was gained or avoided; and in order to commemorate the\nepisode, Charlemagne commanded a city to be built there, which he named\nFrankfort--the ford of the Franks. None of the other cities where this\nevent happened were named for it. This is good evidence that Frankfort\nwas the first place it occurred at.\n\nFrankfort has another distinction--it is the birthplace of the German\nalphabet; or at least of the German word for alphabet --BUCHSTABEN.\nThey say that the first movable types were made on birch\nsticks--BUCHSTABE--hence the name.\n\nI was taught a lesson in political economy in Frankfort. I had brought\nfrom home a box containing a thousand very cheap cigars. By way of\nexperiment, I stepped into a little shop in a queer old back street,\ntook four gaily decorated boxes of wax matches and three cigars, and\nlaid down a silver piece worth 48 cents. The man gave me 43 cents\nchange.\n\nIn Frankfort everybody wears clean clothes, and I think we noticed that\nthis strange thing was the case in Hamburg, too, and in the villages\nalong the road. Even in the narrowest and poorest and most ancient\nquarters of Frankfort neat and clean clothes were the rule. The little\nchildren of both sexes were nearly always nice enough to take into a\nbody's lap. And as for the uniforms of the soldiers, they were newness\nand brightness carried to perfection. One could never detect a smirch\nor a grain of dust upon them. The street-car conductors and drivers wore\npretty uniforms which seemed to be just out of the bandbox, and their\nmanners were as fine as their clothes.\n\nIn one of the shops I had the luck to stumble upon a book which has\ncharmed me nearly to death. It is entitled THE LEGENDS OF THE RHINE FROM\nBASLE TO ROTTERDAM, by F. J. Kiefer; translated by L. W. Garnham, B.A.\n\nAll tourists MENTION the Rhine legends--in that sort of way which\nquietly pretends that the mentioner has been familiar with them all his\nlife, and that the reader cannot possibly be ignorant of them--but no\ntourist ever TELLS them. So this little book fed me in a very hungry\nplace; and I, in my turn, intend to feed my reader, with one or\ntwo little lunches from the same larder. I shall not mar Garnham's\ntranslation by meddling with its English; for the most toothsome thing\nabout it is its quaint fashion of building English sentences on the\nGerman plan--and punctuating them accordingly to no plan at all.\n\nIn the chapter devoted to \"Legends of Frankfort,\" I find the following:\n\n\"THE KNAVE OF BERGEN\" \"In Frankfort at the Romer was a great mask-ball,\nat the coronation festival, and in the illuminated saloon, the clanging\nmusic invited to dance, and splendidly appeared the rich toilets and\ncharms of the ladies, and the festively costumed Princes and Knights.\nAll seemed pleasure, joy, and roguish gaiety, only one of the numerous\nguests had a gloomy exterior; but exactly the black armor in which he\nwalked about excited general attention, and his tall figure, as well as\nthe noble propriety of his movements, attracted especially the regards\nof the ladies.\n\n\n\nWho the Knight was? Nobody could guess, for his Vizier was well closed,\nand nothing made him recognizable. Proud and yet modest he advanced to\nthe Empress; bowed on one knee before her seat, and begged for the favor\nof a waltz with the Queen of the festival. And she allowed his request.\nWith light and graceful steps he danced through the long saloon, with\nthe sovereign who thought never to have found a more dexterous and\nexcellent dancer. But also by the grace of his manner, and fine\nconversation he knew to win the Queen, and she graciously accorded him\na second dance for which he begged, a third, and a fourth, as well as\nothers were not refused him. How all regarded the happy dancer, how\nmany envied him the high favor; how increased curiosity, who the masked\nknight could be.\n\n\"Also the Emperor became more and more excited with curiosity, and with\ngreat suspense one awaited the hour, when according to mask-law, each\nmasked guest must make himself known. This moment came, but although all\nother unmasked; the secret knight still refused to allow his features\nto be seen, till at last the Queen driven by curiosity, and vexed at the\nobstinate refusal; commanded him to open his Vizier.\n\n\n\nHe opened it, and none of the high ladies and knights knew him. But from\nthe crowded spectators, 2 officials advanced, who recognized the black\ndancer, and horror and terror spread in the saloon, as they said who the\nsupposed knight was. It was the executioner of Bergen. But glowing with\nrage, the King commanded to seize the criminal and lead him to death,\nwho had ventured to dance, with the queen; so disgraced the Empress,\nand insulted the crown. The culpable threw himself at the Emperor, and\nsaid--\n\n\n\n\"'Indeed I have heavily sinned against all noble guests assembled here,\nbut most heavily against you my sovereign and my queen. The Queen is\ninsulted by my haughtiness equal to treason, but no punishment even\nblood, will not be able to wash out the disgrace, which you have\nsuffered by me. Therefore oh King! allow me to propose a remedy, to\nefface the shame, and to render it as if not done. Draw your sword and\nknight me, then I will throw down my gauntlet, to everyone who dares to\nspeak disrespectfully of my king.'\n\n\"The Emperor was surprised at this bold proposal, however it appeared\nthe wisest to him; 'You are a knave,' he replied after a moment's\nconsideration, 'however your advice is good, and displays prudence, as\nyour offense shows adventurous courage. Well then,' and gave him the\nknight-stroke 'so I raise you to nobility, who begged for grace for your\noffense now kneels before me, rise as knight; knavish you have acted,\nand Knave of Bergen shall you be called henceforth,' and gladly the\nBlack knight rose; three cheers were given in honor of the Emperor, and\nloud cries of joy testified the approbation with which the Queen danced\nstill once with the Knave of Bergen.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nHeidelberg\n\n[Landing a Monarch at Heidelberg]\n\n\nWe stopped at a hotel by the railway-station. Next morning, as we sat in\nmy room waiting for breakfast to come up, we got a good deal interested\nin something which was going on over the way, in front of another hotel.\nFirst, the personage who is called the PORTIER (who is not the PORTER,\nbut is a sort of first-mate of a hotel) [1. See Appendix A] appeared\nat the door in a spick-and-span new blue cloth uniform, decorated with\nshining brass buttons, and with bands of gold lace around his cap and\nwristbands; and he wore white gloves, too.\n\n\n\nHe shed an official glance upon the situation, and then began to give\norders. Two women-servants came out with pails and brooms and brushes,\nand gave the sidewalk a thorough scrubbing; meanwhile two others\nscrubbed the four marble steps which led up to the door; beyond these we\ncould see some men-servants taking up the carpet of the grand staircase.\nThis carpet was carried away and the last grain of dust beaten and\nbanged and swept out of it; then brought back and put down again. The\nbrass stair-rods received an exhaustive polishing and were returned to\ntheir places. Now a troop of servants brought pots and tubs of blooming\nplants and formed them into a beautiful jungle about the door and the\nbase of the staircase. Other servants adorned all the balconies of the\nvarious stories with flowers and banners; others ascended to the\nroof and hoisted a great flag on a staff there. Now came some more\nchamber-maids and retouched the sidewalk, and afterward wiped the marble\nsteps with damp cloths and finished by dusting them off with feather\nbrushes. Now a broad black carpet was brought out and laid down the\nmarble steps and out across the sidewalk to the curbstone. The PORTIER\ncast his eye along it, and found it was not absolutely straight; he\ncommanded it to be straightened; the servants made the effort--made\nseveral efforts, in fact--but the PORTIER was not satisfied. He finally\nhad it taken up, and then he put it down himself and got it right.\n\nAt this stage of the proceedings, a narrow bright red carpet was\nunrolled and stretched from the top of the marble steps to the\ncurbstone, along the center of the black carpet. This red path cost the\nPORTIER more trouble than even the black one had done. But he patiently\nfixed and refixed it until it was exactly right and lay precisely in the\nmiddle of the black carpet. In New York these performances would have\ngathered a mighty crowd of curious and intensely interested spectators;\nbut here it only captured an audience of half a dozen little boys who\nstood in a row across the pavement, some with their school-knapsacks on\ntheir backs and their hands in their pockets, others with arms full of\nbundles, and all absorbed in the show. Occasionally one of them skipped\nirreverently over the carpet and took up a position on the other side.\nThis always visibly annoyed the PORTIER.\n\n\n\nNow came a waiting interval. The landlord, in plain clothes, and\nbareheaded, placed himself on the bottom marble step, abreast the\nPORTIER, who stood on the other end of the same steps; six or eight\nwaiters, gloved, bareheaded, and wearing their whitest linen, their\nwhitest cravats, and their finest swallow-tails, grouped themselves\nabout these chiefs, but leaving the carpetway clear. Nobody moved or\nspoke any more but only waited.\n\nIn a short time the shrill piping of a coming train was heard, and\nimmediately groups of people began to gather in the street. Two or three\nopen carriages arrived, and deposited some maids of honor and some male\nofficials at the hotel. Presently another open carriage brought the\nGrand Duke of Baden, a stately man in uniform, who wore the handsome\nbrass-mounted, steel-spiked helmet of the army on his head. Last came\nthe Empress of Germany and the Grand Duchess of Baden in a closed\ncarriage; these passed through the low-bowing groups of servants and\ndisappeared in the hotel, exhibiting to us only the backs of their\nheads, and then the show was over.\n\nIt appears to be as difficult to land a monarch as it is to launch a\nship.\n\nBut as to Heidelberg. The weather was growing pretty warm,--very warm,\nin fact. So we left the valley and took quarters at the Schloss Hotel,\non the hill, above the Castle.\n\n\n\nHeidelberg lies at the mouth of a narrow gorge--a gorge the shape of\na shepherd's crook; if one looks up it he perceives that it is about\nstraight, for a mile and a half, then makes a sharp curve to the\nright and disappears. This gorge--along whose bottom pours the swift\nNeckar--is confined between (or cloven through) a couple of long, steep\nridges, a thousand feet high and densely wooded clear to their summits,\nwith the exception of one section which has been shaved and put under\ncultivation. These ridges are chopped off at the mouth of the gorge\nand form two bold and conspicuous headlands, with Heidelberg nestling\nbetween them; from their bases spreads away the vast dim expanse of the\nRhine valley, and into this expanse the Neckar goes wandering in shining\ncurves and is presently lost to view.\n\nNow if one turns and looks up the gorge once more, he will see the\nSchloss Hotel on the right perched on a precipice overlooking the\nNeckar--a precipice which is so sumptuously cushioned and draped with\nfoliage that no glimpse of the rock appears. The building seems very\nairily situated. It has the appearance of being on a shelf half-way\nup the wooded mountainside; and as it is remote and isolated, and very\nwhite, it makes a strong mark against the lofty leafy rampart at its\nback.\n\nThis hotel had a feature which was a decided novelty, and one which\nmight be adopted with advantage by any house which is perched in a\ncommanding situation. This feature may be described as a series of\nglass-enclosed parlors CLINGING TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE, one against\neach and every bed-chamber and drawing-room. They are like long, narrow,\nhigh-ceiled bird-cages hung against the building. My room was a corner\nroom, and had two of these things, a north one and a west one.\n\n\n\nFrom the north cage one looks up the Neckar gorge; from the west one he\nlooks down it. This last affords the most extensive view, and it is one\nof the loveliest that can be imagined, too. Out of a billowy upheaval\nof vivid green foliage, a rifle-shot removed, rises the huge ruin\nof Heidelberg Castle, [2. See Appendix B] with empty window arches,\nivy-mailed battlements, moldering towers--the Lear of inanimate\nnature--deserted, discrowned, beaten by the storms, but royal still,\nand beautiful. It is a fine sight to see the evening sunlight suddenly\nstrike the leafy declivity at the Castle's base and dash up it and\ndrench it as with a luminous spray, while the adjacent groves are in\ndeep shadow.\n\n\n\nBehind the Castle swells a great dome-shaped hill, forest-clad, and\nbeyond that a nobler and loftier one. The Castle looks down upon the\ncompact brown-roofed town; and from the town two picturesque old bridges\nspan the river. Now the view broadens; through the gateway of the\nsentinel headlands you gaze out over the wide Rhine plain, which\nstretches away, softly and richly tinted, grows gradually and dreamily\nindistinct, and finally melts imperceptibly into the remote horizon.\n\nI have never enjoyed a view which had such a serene and satisfying charm\nabout it as this one gives.\n\nThe first night we were there, we went to bed and to sleep early; but\nI awoke at the end of two or three hours, and lay a comfortable while\nlistening to the soothing patter of the rain against the balcony\nwindows. I took it to be rain, but it turned out to be only the murmur\nof the restless Neckar, tumbling over her dikes and dams far below, in\nthe gorge. I got up and went into the west balcony and saw a wonderful\nsight. Away down on the level under the black mass of the Castle, the\ntown lay, stretched along the river, its intricate cobweb of streets\njeweled with twinkling lights; there were rows of lights on the bridges;\nthese flung lances of light upon the water, in the black shadows of the\narches; and away at the extremity of all this fairy spectacle blinked\nand glowed a massed multitude of gas-jets which seemed to cover acres of\nground; it was as if all the diamonds in the world had been spread\nout there. I did not know before, that a half-mile of sextuple\nrailway-tracks could be made such an adornment.\n\n\n\nOne thinks Heidelberg by day--with its surroundings--is the last\npossibility of the beautiful; but when he sees Heidelberg by night, a\nfallen Milky Way, with that glittering railway constellation pinned to\nthe border, he requires time to consider upon the verdict.\n\nOne never tires of poking about in the dense woods that clothe all\nthese lofty Neckar hills to their beguiling and impressive charm in any\ncountry; but German legends and fairy tales have given these an added\ncharm. They have peopled all that region with gnomes, and dwarfs, and\nall sorts of mysterious and uncanny creatures. At the time I am writing\nof, I had been reading so much of this literature that sometimes I was\nnot sure but I was beginning to believe in the gnomes and fairies as\nrealities.\n\nOne afternoon I got lost in the woods about a mile from the hotel, and\npresently fell into a train of dreamy thought about animals which talk,\nand kobolds, and enchanted folk, and the rest of the pleasant legendary\nstuff; and so, by stimulating my fancy, I finally got to imagining I\nglimpsed small flitting shapes here and there down the columned\naisles of the forest. It was a place which was peculiarly meet for the\noccasion. It was a pine wood, with so thick and soft a carpet of brown\nneedles that one's footfall made no more sound than if he were treading\non wool; the tree-trunks were as round and straight and smooth as\npillars, and stood close together; they were bare of branches to a point\nabout twenty-five feet above-ground, and from there upward so thick with\nboughs that not a ray of sunlight could pierce through. The world was\nbright with sunshine outside, but a deep and mellow twilight reigned in\nthere, and also a deep silence so profound that I seemed to hear my own\nbreathings.\n\nWhen I had stood ten minutes, thinking and imagining, and getting\nmy spirit in tune with the place, and in the right mood to enjoy the\nsupernatural, a raven suddenly uttered a horse croak over my head. It\nmade me start; and then I was angry because I started. I looked up, and\nthe creature was sitting on a limb right over me, looking down at me.\nI felt something of the same sense of humiliation and injury which\none feels when he finds that a human stranger has been clandestinely\ninspecting him in his privacy and mentally commenting upon him. I eyed\nthe raven, and the raven eyed me. Nothing was said during some seconds.\nThen the bird stepped a little way along his limb to get a better point\nof observation, lifted his wings, stuck his head far down below his\nshoulders toward me and croaked again--a croak with a distinctly\ninsulting expression about it. If he had spoken in English he could not\nhave said any more plainly than he did say in raven, \"Well, what do YOU\nwant here?\" I felt as foolish as if I had been caught in some mean act\nby a responsible being, and reproved for it. However, I made no reply;\nI would not bandy words with a raven. The adversary waited a while, with\nhis shoulders still lifted, his head thrust down between them, and\nhis keen bright eye fixed on me; then he threw out two or three more\ninsults, which I could not understand, further than that I knew a\nportion of them consisted of language not used in church.\n\n\n\nI still made no reply. Now the adversary raised his head and\ncalled. There was an answering croak from a little distance in the\nwood--evidently a croak of inquiry. The adversary explained with\nenthusiasm, and the other raven dropped everything and came. The two sat\nside by side on the limb and discussed me as freely and offensively as\ntwo great naturalists might discuss a new kind of bug. The thing became\nmore and more embarrassing. They called in another friend. This was too\nmuch. I saw that they had the advantage of me, and so I concluded to get\nout of the scrape by walking out of it. They enjoyed my defeat as much\nas any low white people could have done. They craned their necks and\nlaughed at me (for a raven CAN laugh, just like a man), they squalled\ninsulting remarks after me as long as they could see me. They were\nnothing but ravens--I knew that--what they thought of me could be a\nmatter of no consequence--and yet when even a raven shouts after you,\n\"What a hat!\" \"Oh, pull down your vest!\" and that sort of thing, it\nhurts you and humiliates you, and there is no getting around it with\nfine reasoning and pretty arguments.\n\nAnimals talk to each other, of course. There can be no question about\nthat; but I suppose there are very few people who can understand them.\nI never knew but one man who could. I knew he could, however, because he\ntold me so himself. He was a middle-aged, simple-hearted miner who had\nlived in a lonely corner of California, among the woods and mountains,\na good many years, and had studied the ways of his only neighbors, the\nbeasts and the birds, until he believed he could accurately translate\nany remark which they made. This was Jim Baker. According to Jim Baker,\nsome animals have only a limited education, and some use only simple\nwords, and scarcely ever a comparison or a flowery figure; whereas,\ncertain other animals have a large vocabulary, a fine command of\nlanguage and a ready and fluent delivery; consequently these latter talk\na great deal; they like it; they are so conscious of their talent,\nand they enjoy \"showing off.\" Baker said, that after long and careful\nobservation, he had come to the conclusion that the bluejays were the\nbest talkers he had found among birds and beasts. Said he:\n\n\"There's more TO a bluejay than any other creature. He has got more\nmoods, and more different kinds of feelings than other creatures; and,\nmind you, whatever a bluejay feels, he can put into language. And\nno mere commonplace language, either, but rattling, out-and-out\nbook-talk--and bristling with metaphor, too--just bristling! And as for\ncommand of language--why YOU never see a bluejay get stuck for a word.\nNo man ever did. They just boil out of him! And another thing: I've\nnoticed a good deal, and there's no bird, or cow, or anything that uses\nas good grammar as a bluejay. You may say a cat uses good grammar. Well,\na cat does--but you let a cat get excited once; you let a cat get to\npulling fur with another cat on a shed, nights, and you'll hear grammar\nthat will give you the lockjaw. Ignorant people think it's the NOISE\nwhich fighting cats make that is so aggravating, but it ain't so; it's\nthe sickening grammar they use. Now I've never heard a jay use bad\ngrammar but very seldom; and when they do, they are as ashamed as a\nhuman; they shut right down and leave.\n\n\n\n\"You may call a jay a bird. Well, so he is, in a measure--but he's got\nfeathers on him, and don't belong to no church, perhaps; but otherwise\nhe is just as much human as you be. And I'll tell you for why. A jay's\ngifts, and instincts, and feelings, and interests, cover the whole\nground. A jay hasn't got any more principle than a Congressman. A jay\nwill lie, a jay will steal, a jay will deceive, a jay will betray; and\nfour times out of five, a jay will go back on his solemnest promise. The\nsacredness of an obligation is such a thing which you can't cram into\nno bluejay's head. Now, on top of all this, there's another thing; a\njay can out-swear any gentleman in the mines. You think a cat can swear.\nWell, a cat can; but you give a bluejay a subject that calls for his\nreserve-powers, and where is your cat? Don't talk to ME--I know too much\nabout this thing; in the one little particular of scolding--just good,\nclean, out-and-out scolding--a bluejay can lay over anything, human or\ndivine. Yes, sir, a jay is everything that a man is. A jay can cry,\na jay can laugh, a jay can feel shame, a jay can reason and plan and\ndiscuss, a jay likes gossip and scandal, a jay has got a sense of humor,\na jay knows when he is an ass just as well as you do--maybe better. If\na jay ain't human, he better take in his sign, that's all. Now I'm going\nto tell you a perfectly true fact about some bluejays.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nBaker's Bluejay Yarn\n\n[What Stumped the Blue Jays]\n\n\n\"When I first begun to understand jay language correctly, there was a\nlittle incident happened here. Seven years ago, the last man in this\nregion but me moved away. There stands his house--been empty ever since;\na log house, with a plank roof--just one big room, and no more; no\nceiling--nothing between the rafters and the floor. Well, one Sunday\nmorning I was sitting out here in front of my cabin, with my cat, taking\nthe sun, and looking at the blue hills, and listening to the leaves\nrustling so lonely in the trees, and thinking of the home away yonder in\nthe states, that I hadn't heard from in thirteen years, when a bluejay\nlit on that house, with an acorn in his mouth, and says, 'Hello, I\nreckon I've struck something.' When he spoke, the acorn dropped out of\nhis mouth and rolled down the roof, of course, but he didn't care; his\nmind was all on the thing he had struck. It was a knot-hole in the roof.\nHe cocked his head to one side, shut one eye and put the other one to\nthe hole, like a possum looking down a jug; then he glanced up with\nhis bright eyes, gave a wink or two with his wings--which signifies\ngratification, you understand--and says, 'It looks like a hole, it's\nlocated like a hole--blamed if I don't believe it IS a hole!'\n\n\"Then he cocked his head down and took another look; he glances up\nperfectly joyful, this time; winks his wings and his tail both, and\nsays, 'Oh, no, this ain't no fat thing, I reckon! If I ain't in luck!\n--Why it's a perfectly elegant hole!' So he flew down and got that\nacorn, and fetched it up and dropped it in, and was just tilting his\nhead back, with the heavenliest smile on his face, when all of a\nsudden he was paralyzed into a listening attitude and that smile faded\ngradually out of his countenance like breath off'n a razor, and the\nqueerest look of surprise took its place. Then he says, 'Why, I didn't\nhear it fall!' He cocked his eye at the hole again, and took a long\nlook; raised up and shook his head; stepped around to the other side of\nthe hole and took another look from that side; shook his head again. He\nstudied a while, then he just went into the Details--walked round and\nround the hole and spied into it from every point of the compass.\nNo use. Now he took a thinking attitude on the comb of the roof and\nscratched the back of his head with his right foot a minute, and finally\nsays, 'Well, it's too many for ME, that's certain; must be a mighty long\nhole; however, I ain't got no time to fool around here, I got to \"tend\nto business\"; I reckon it's all right--chance it, anyway.'\n\n\"So he flew off and fetched another acorn and dropped it in, and tried\nto flirt his eye to the hole quick enough to see what become of it,\nbut he was too late. He held his eye there as much as a minute; then he\nraised up and sighed, and says, 'Confound it, I don't seem to understand\nthis thing, no way; however, I'll tackle her again.' He fetched\nanother acorn, and done his level best to see what become of it, but he\ncouldn't. He says, 'Well, I never struck no such a hole as this before;\nI'm of the opinion it's a totally new kind of a hole.' Then he begun\nto get mad. He held in for a spell, walking up and down the comb of the\nroof and shaking his head and muttering to himself; but his feelings got\nthe upper hand of him, presently, and he broke loose and cussed himself\nblack in the face. I never see a bird take on so about a little thing.\nWhen he got through he walks to the hole and looks in again for half a\nminute; then he says, 'Well, you're a long hole, and a deep hole, and\na mighty singular hole altogether--but I've started in to fill you, and\nI'm damned if I DON'T fill you, if it takes a hundred years!'\n\n\n\n\"And with that, away he went. You never see a bird work so since you was\nborn. He laid into his work like a nigger, and the way he hove acorns\ninto that hole for about two hours and a half was one of the most\nexciting and astonishing spectacles I ever struck. He never stopped to\ntake a look anymore--he just hove 'em in and went for more. Well, at\nlast he could hardly flop his wings, he was so tuckered out. He comes\na-dropping down, once more, sweating like an ice-pitcher, dropped his\nacorn in and says, 'NOW I guess I've got the bulge on you by this time!'\nSo he bent down for a look. If you'll believe me, when his head come up\nagain he was just pale with rage. He says, 'I've shoveled acorns enough\nin there to keep the family thirty years, and if I can see a sign of one\nof 'em I wish I may land in a museum with a belly full of sawdust in two\nminutes!'\n\n\"He just had strength enough to crawl up on to the comb and lean his\nback agin the chimbly, and then he collected his impressions and\nbegun to free his mind. I see in a second that what I had mistook for\nprofanity in the mines was only just the rudiments, as you may say.\n\n\"Another jay was going by, and heard him doing his devotions, and stops\nto inquire what was up. The sufferer told him the whole circumstance,\nand says, 'Now yonder's the hole, and if you don't believe me, go and\nlook for yourself.' So this fellow went and looked, and comes back and\nsays, 'How many did you say you put in there?' 'Not any less than\ntwo tons,' says the sufferer. The other jay went and looked again. He\ncouldn't seem to make it out, so he raised a yell, and three more jays\ncome. They all examined the hole, they all made the sufferer tell\nit over again, then they all discussed it, and got off as many\nleather-headed opinions about it as an average crowd of humans could\nhave done.\n\n\"They called in more jays; then more and more, till pretty soon this\nwhole region 'peared to have a blue flush about it. There must have been\nfive thousand of them; and such another jawing and disputing and ripping\nand cussing, you never heard. Every jay in the whole lot put his eye to\nthe hole and delivered a more chuckle-headed opinion about the mystery\nthan the jay that went there before him. They examined the house all\nover, too. The door was standing half open, and at last one old jay\nhappened to go and light on it and look in. Of course, that knocked the\nmystery galley-west in a second. There lay the acorns, scattered all\nover the floor.. He flopped his wings and raised a whoop. 'Come here!'\nhe says, 'Come here, everybody; hang'd if this fool hasn't been trying\nto fill up a house with acorns!' They all came a-swooping down like a\nblue cloud, and as each fellow lit on the door and took a glance, the\nwhole absurdity of the contract that that first jay had tackled hit him\nhome and he fell over backward suffocating with laughter, and the next\njay took his place and done the same.\n\n\"Well, sir, they roosted around here on the housetop and the trees for\nan hour, and guffawed over that thing like human beings. It ain't any\nuse to tell me a bluejay hasn't got a sense of humor, because I know\nbetter. And memory, too. They brought jays here from all over the United\nStates to look down that hole, every summer for three years. Other\nbirds, too. And they could all see the point except an owl that come\nfrom Nova Scotia to visit the Yo Semite, and he took this thing in on\nhis way back. He said he couldn't see anything funny in it. But then he\nwas a good deal disappointed about Yo Semite, too.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nStudent Life\n\n[The Laborious Beer King]\n\n\nThe summer semester was in full tide; consequently the most frequent\nfigure in and about Heidelberg was the student. Most of the students\nwere Germans, of course, but the representatives of foreign lands\nwere very numerous. They hailed from every corner of the globe--for\ninstruction is cheap in Heidelberg, and so is living, too. The\nAnglo-American Club, composed of British and American students, had\ntwenty-five members, and there was still much material left to draw\nfrom.\n\nNine-tenths of the Heidelberg students wore no badge or uniform;\nthe other tenth wore caps of various colors, and belonged to social\norganizations called \"corps.\" There were five corps, each with a color\nof its own; there were white caps, blue caps, and red, yellow, and green\nones. The famous duel-fighting is confined to the \"corps\" boys. The\n\"KNEIP\" seems to be a specialty of theirs, too. Kneips are held, now and\nthen, to celebrate great occasions, like the election of a beer king,\nfor instance. The solemnity is simple; the five corps assemble at night,\nand at a signal they all fall loading themselves with beer, out\nof pint-mugs, as fast as possible, and each man keeps his own\ncount--usually by laying aside a lucifer match for each mug he empties.\n\n\n\nThe election is soon decided. When the candidates can hold no more, a\ncount is instituted and the one who has drank the greatest number of\npints is proclaimed king. I was told that the last beer king elected\nby the corps--or by his own capabilities--emptied his mug seventy-five\ntimes. No stomach could hold all that quantity at one time, of\ncourse--but there are ways of frequently creating a vacuum, which those\nwho have been much at sea will understand.\n\nOne sees so many students abroad at all hours, that he presently begins\nto wonder if they ever have any working-hours. Some of them have, some\nof them haven't. Each can choose for himself whether he will work or\nplay; for German university life is a very free life; it seems to have\nno restraints. The student does not live in the college buildings, but\nhires his own lodgings, in any locality he prefers, and he takes his\nmeals when and where he pleases. He goes to bed when it suits him, and\ndoes not get up at all unless he wants to. He is not entered at the\nuniversity for any particular length of time; so he is likely to change\nabout. He passes no examinations upon entering college. He merely pays\na trifling fee of five or ten dollars, receives a card entitling him to\nthe privileges of the university, and that is the end of it. He is now\nready for business--or play, as he shall prefer. If he elects to\nwork, he finds a large list of lectures to choose from. He selects the\nsubjects which he will study, and enters his name for these studies; but\nhe can skip attendance.\n\n\n\nThe result of this system is, that lecture-courses upon specialties\nof an unusual nature are often delivered to very slim audiences,\nwhile those upon more practical and every-day matters of education are\ndelivered to very large ones. I heard of one case where, day after day,\nthe lecturer's audience consisted of three students--and always the\nsame three. But one day two of them remained away. The lecturer began as\nusual--\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" --then, without a smile, he corrected himself, saying--\n\n\"Sir,\" --and went on with his discourse.\n\nIt is said that the vast majority of the Heidelberg students are hard\nworkers, and make the most of their opportunities; that they have\nno surplus means to spend in dissipation, and no time to spare for\nfrolicking. One lecture follows right on the heels of another, with very\nlittle time for the student to get out of one hall and into the next;\nbut the industrious ones manage it by going on a trot. The professors\nassist them in the saving of their time by being promptly in their\nlittle boxed-up pulpits when the hours strike, and as promptly out again\nwhen the hour finishes. I entered an empty lecture-room one day just\nbefore the clock struck. The place had simple, unpainted pine desks and\nbenches for about two hundred persons.\n\n\n\nAbout a minute before the clock struck, a hundred and fifty students\nswarmed in, rushed to their seats, immediately spread open their\nnotebooks and dipped their pens in ink. When the clock began to strike,\na burly professor entered, was received with a round of applause, moved\nswiftly down the center aisle, said \"Gentlemen,\" and began to talk as he\nclimbed his pulpit steps; and by the time he had arrived in his box and\nfaced his audience, his lecture was well under way and all the pens were\ngoing. He had no notes, he talked with prodigious rapidity and\nenergy for an hour--then the students began to remind him in certain\nwell-understood ways that his time was up; he seized his hat, still\ntalking, proceeded swiftly down his pulpit steps, got out the last word\nof his discourse as he struck the floor; everybody rose respectfully,\nand he swept rapidly down the aisle and disappeared. An instant rush for\nsome other lecture-room followed, and in a minute I was alone with the\nempty benches once more.\n\n\n\nYes, without doubt, idle students are not the rule. Out of eight hundred\nin the town, I knew the faces of only about fifty; but these I saw\neverywhere, and daily. They walked about the streets and the wooded\nhills, they drove in cabs, they boated on the river, they sipped beer\nand coffee, afternoons, in the Schloss gardens. A good many of them wore\ncolored caps of the corps. They were finely and fashionably dressed,\ntheir manners were quite superb, and they led an easy, careless,\ncomfortable life. If a dozen of them sat together and a lady or a\ngentleman passed whom one of them knew and saluted, they all rose\nto their feet and took off their caps. The members of a corps always\nreceived a fellow-member in this way, too; but they paid no attention\nto members of other corps; they did not seem to see them. This was not\na discourtesy; it was only a part of the elaborate and rigid corps\netiquette.\n\nThere seems to be no chilly distance existing between the German\nstudents and the professor; but, on the contrary, a companionable\nintercourse, the opposite of chilliness and reserve. When the professor\nenters a beer-hall in the evening where students are gathered together,\nthese rise up and take off their caps, and invite the old gentleman to\nsit with them and partake. He accepts, and the pleasant talk and the\nbeer flow for an hour or two, and by and by the professor, properly\ncharged and comfortable, gives a cordial good night, while the students\nstand bowing and uncovered; and then he moves on his happy way homeward\nwith all his vast cargo of learning afloat in his hold. Nobody finds\nfault or feels outraged; no harm has been done.\n\n\n\nIt seemed to be a part of corps etiquette to keep a dog or so, too.\nI mean a corps dog--the common property of the organization, like the\ncorps steward or head servant; then there are other dogs, owned by\nindividuals.\n\nOn a summer afternoon in the Castle gardens, I have seen six students\nmarch solemnly into the grounds, in single file, each carrying a bright\nChinese parasol and leading a prodigious dog by a string. It was a very\nimposing spectacle. Sometimes there would be as many dogs around the\npavilion as students; and of all breeds and of all degrees of beauty and\nugliness. These dogs had a rather dry time of it; for they were tied\nto the benches and had no amusement for an hour or two at a time except\nwhat they could get out of pawing at the gnats, or trying to sleep and\nnot succeeding. However, they got a lump of sugar occasionally--they\nwere fond of that.\n\n\n\nIt seemed right and proper that students should indulge in dogs; but\neverybody else had them, too--old men and young ones, old women and\nnice young ladies. If there is one spectacle that is unpleasanter than\nanother, it is that of an elegantly dressed young lady towing a dog by a\nstring. It is said to be the sign and symbol of blighted love. It seems\nto me that some other way of advertising it might be devised, which\nwould be just as conspicuous and yet not so trying to the proprieties.\n\n\n\nIt would be a mistake to suppose that the easy-going pleasure-seeking\nstudent carries an empty head. Just the contrary. He has spent nine\nyears in the gymnasium, under a system which allowed him no freedom, but\nvigorously compelled him to work like a slave. Consequently, he has left\nthe gymnasium with an education which is so extensive and complete, that\nthe most a university can do for it is to perfect some of its profounder\nspecialties. It is said that when a pupil leaves the gymnasium, he not\nonly has a comprehensive education, but he KNOWS what he knows--it is\nnot befogged with uncertainty, it is burnt into him so that it will\nstay. For instance, he does not merely read and write Greek, but speaks\nit; the same with the Latin. Foreign youth steer clear of the gymnasium;\nits rules are too severe. They go to the university to put a mansard\nroof on their whole general education; but the German student already\nhas his mansard roof, so he goes there to add a steeple in the nature of\nsome specialty, such as a particular branch of law, or diseases of the\neye, or special study of the ancient Gothic tongues. So this German\nattends only the lectures which belong to the chosen branch, and drinks\nhis beer and tows his dog around and has a general good time the rest of\nthe day. He has been in rigid bondage so long that the large liberty\nof the university life is just what he needs and likes and thoroughly\nappreciates; and as it cannot last forever, he makes the most of it\nwhile it does last, and so lays up a good rest against the day that must\nsee him put on the chains once more and enter the slavery of official or\nprofessional life.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nAt the Students' Dueling-Ground\n\n[Dueling by Wholesale]\n\n\nOne day in the interest of science my agent obtained permission to bring\nme to the students' dueling-place. We crossed the river and drove up\nthe bank a few hundred yards, then turned to the left, entered a narrow\nalley, followed it a hundred yards and arrived at a two-story public\nhouse; we were acquainted with its outside aspect, for it was visible\nfrom the hotel. We went upstairs and passed into a large whitewashed\napartment which was perhaps fifty feet long by thirty feet wide and\ntwenty or twenty-five high. It was a well-lighted place. There was no\ncarpet. Across one end and down both sides of the room extended a row of\ntables, and at these tables some fifty or seventy-five students [1. See\nAppendix C] were sitting.\n\nSome of them were sipping wine, others were playing cards, others chess,\nother groups were chatting together, and many were smoking cigarettes\nwhile they waited for the coming duels. Nearly all of them wore colored\ncaps; there were white caps, green caps, blue caps, red caps, and\nbright-yellow ones; so, all the five corps were present in strong\nforce. In the windows at the vacant end of the room stood six or eight,\nnarrow-bladed swords with large protecting guards for the hand, and\noutside was a man at work sharpening others on a grindstone.\n\n\n\nHe understood his business; for when a sword left his hand one could\nshave himself with it.\n\nIt was observable that the young gentlemen neither bowed to nor spoke\nwith students whose caps differed in color from their own. This did not\nmean hostility, but only an armed neutrality. It was considered that\na person could strike harder in the duel, and with a more earnest\ninterest, if he had never been in a condition of comradeship with his\nantagonist; therefore, comradeship between the corps was not permitted.\nAt intervals the presidents of the five corps have a cold official\nintercourse with each other, but nothing further. For example, when the\nregular dueling-day of one of the corps approaches, its president calls\nfor volunteers from among the membership to offer battle; three or more\nrespond--but there must not be less than three; the president lays their\nnames before the other presidents, with the request that they furnish\nantagonists for these challengers from among their corps. This is\npromptly done. It chanced that the present occasion was the battle-day\nof the Red Cap Corps. They were the challengers, and certain caps of\nother colors had volunteered to meet them. The students fight duels in\nthe room which I have described, TWO DAYS IN EVERY WEEK DURING SEVEN\nAND A HALF OR EIGHT MONTHS IN EVERY YEAR. This custom had continued in\nGermany two hundred and fifty years.\n\nTo return to my narrative. A student in a white cap met us and\nintroduced us to six or eight friends of his who also wore white caps,\nand while we stood conversing, two strange-looking figures were led in\nfrom another room. They were students panoplied for the duel. They were\nbareheaded; their eyes were protected by iron goggles which projected an\ninch or more, the leather straps of which bound their ears flat against\ntheir heads were wound around and around with thick wrappings which\na sword could not cut through; from chin to ankle they were padded\nthoroughly against injury; their arms were bandaged and rebandaged,\nlayer upon layer, until they looked like solid black logs. These weird\napparitions had been handsome youths, clad in fashionable attire,\nfifteen minutes before, but now they did not resemble any beings one\never sees unless in nightmares. They strode along, with their arms\nprojecting straight out from their bodies; they did not hold them out\nthemselves, but fellow-students walked beside them and gave the needed\nsupport.\n\nThere was a rush for the vacant end of the room, now, and we followed\nand got good places. The combatants were placed face to face, each with\nseveral members of his own corps about him to assist; two seconds, well\npadded, and with swords in their hands, took their stations; a student\nbelonging to neither of the opposing corps placed himself in a good\nposition to umpire the combat; another student stood by with a watch and\na memorandum-book to keep record of the time and the number and nature\nof the wounds; a gray-haired surgeon was present with his lint, his\nbandages, and his instruments.\n\n\n\nAfter a moment's pause the duelists saluted the umpire respectfully,\nthen one after another the several officials stepped forward, gracefully\nremoved their caps and saluted him also, and returned to their places.\nEverything was ready now; students stood crowded together in the\nforeground, and others stood behind them on chairs and tables. Every\nface was turned toward the center of attraction.\n\nThe combatants were watching each other with alert eyes; a perfect\nstillness, a breathless interest reigned. I felt that I was going to\nsee some wary work. But not so. The instant the word was given, the two\napparitions sprang forward and began to rain blows down upon each other\nwith such lightning rapidity that I could not quite tell whether I saw\nthe swords or only flashes they made in the air; the rattling din of\nthese blows as they struck steel or paddings was something wonderfully\nstirring, and they were struck with such terrific force that I could not\nunderstand why the opposing sword was not beaten down under the assault.\nPresently, in the midst of the sword-flashes, I saw a handful of hair\nskip into the air as if it had lain loose on the victim's head and a\nbreath of wind had puffed it suddenly away.\n\nThe seconds cried \"Halt!\" and knocked up the combatants' swords with\ntheir own. The duelists sat down; a student official stepped forward,\nexamined the wounded head and touched the place with a sponge once or\ntwice; the surgeon came and turned back the hair from the wound--and\nrevealed a crimson gash two or three inches long, and proceeded to bind\nan oval piece of leather and a bunch of lint over it; the tally-keeper\nstepped up and tallied one for the opposition in his book.\n\n\n\nThen the duelists took position again; a small stream of blood was\nflowing down the side of the injured man's head, and over his shoulder\nand down his body to the floor, but he did not seem to mind this. The\nword was given, and they plunged at each other as fiercely as before;\nonce more the blows rained and rattled and flashed; every few moments\nthe quick-eyed seconds would notice that a sword was bent--then they\ncalled \"Halt!\" struck up the contending weapons, and an assisting\nstudent straightened the bent one.\n\nThe wonderful turmoil went on--presently a bright spark sprung from\na blade, and that blade broken in several pieces, sent one of its\nfragments flying to the ceiling. A new sword was provided and the fight\nproceeded. The exercise was tremendous, of course, and in time the\nfighters began to show great fatigue. They were allowed to rest a\nmoment, every little while; they got other rests by wounding each other,\nfor then they could sit down while the doctor applied the lint and\nbandages. The law is that the battle must continue fifteen minutes if\nthe men can hold out; and as the pauses do not count, this duel was\nprotracted to twenty or thirty minutes, I judged. At last it was decided\nthat the men were too much wearied to do battle longer. They were led\naway drenched with crimson from head to foot. That was a good fight, but\nit could not count, partly because it did not last the lawful fifteen\nminutes (of actual fighting), and partly because neither man was\ndisabled by his wound. It was a drawn battle, and corps law requires\nthat drawn battles shall be refought as soon as the adversaries are well\nof their hurts.\n\nDuring the conflict, I had talked a little, now and then, with a young\ngentleman of the White Cap Corps, and he had mentioned that he was to\nfight next--and had also pointed out his challenger, a young gentleman\nwho was leaning against the opposite wall smoking a cigarette and\nrestfully observing the duel then in progress.\n\nMy acquaintanceship with a party to the coming contest had the effect of\ngiving me a kind of personal interest in it; I naturally wished he might\nwin, and it was the reverse of pleasant to learn that he probably would\nnot, because, although he was a notable swordsman, the challenger was\nheld to be his superior.\n\nThe duel presently began and in the same furious way which had marked\nthe previous one. I stood close by, but could not tell which blows told\nand which did not, they fell and vanished so like flashes of light. They\nall seemed to tell; the swords always bent over the opponents' heads,\nfrom the forehead back over the crown, and seemed to touch, all the\nway; but it was not so--a protecting blade, invisible to me, was always\ninterposed between. At the end of ten seconds each man had struck twelve\nor fifteen blows, and warded off twelve or fifteen, and no harm done;\nthen a sword became disabled, and a short rest followed whilst a new one\nwas brought. Early in the next round the White Corps student got an ugly\nwound on the side of his head and gave his opponent one like it. In the\nthird round the latter received another bad wound in the head, and the\nformer had his under-lip divided. After that, the White Corps student\ngave many severe wounds, but got none of the consequence in return.\nAt the end of five minutes from the beginning of the duel the surgeon\nstopped it; the challenging party had suffered such injuries that any\naddition to them might be dangerous. These injuries were a fearful\nspectacle, but are better left undescribed. So, against expectation, my\nacquaintance was the victor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n[A Sport that Sometimes Kills]\n\n\nThe third duel was brief and bloody. The surgeon stopped it when he saw\nthat one of the men had received such bad wounds that he could not fight\nlonger without endangering his life.\n\nThe fourth duel was a tremendous encounter; but at the end of five or\nsix minutes the surgeon interfered once more: another man so severely\nhurt as to render it unsafe to add to his harms. I watched this\nengagement as I watched the others--with rapt interest and strong\nexcitement, and with a shrink and a shudder for every blow that laid\nopen a cheek or a forehead; and a conscious paling of my face when I\noccasionally saw a wound of a yet more shocking nature inflicted.\nMy eyes were upon the loser of this duel when he got his last and\nvanquishing wound--it was in his face and it carried away his--but no\nmatter, I must not enter into details. I had but a glance, and then\nturned quickly, but I would not have been looking at all if I had known\nwhat was coming. No, that is probably not true; one thinks he would not\nlook if he knew what was coming, but the interest and the excitement are\nso powerful that they would doubtless conquer all other feelings; and\nso, under the fierce exhilaration of the clashing steel, he would yield\nand look after all. Sometimes spectators of these duels faint--and it\ndoes seem a very reasonable thing to do, too.\n\nBoth parties to this fourth duel were badly hurt so much that the\nsurgeon was at work upon them nearly or quite an hour--a fact which is\nsuggestive. But this waiting interval was not wasted in idleness by\nthe assembled students. It was past noon, therefore they ordered their\nlandlord, downstairs, to send up hot beefsteaks, chickens, and such\nthings, and these they ate, sitting comfortable at the several tables,\nwhilst they chatted, disputed and laughed. The door to the surgeon's\nroom stood open, meantime, but the cutting, sewing, splicing, and\nbandaging going on in there in plain view did not seem to disturb\nanyone's appetite. I went in and saw the surgeon labor awhile, but could\nnot enjoy; it was much less trying to see the wounds given and received\nthan to see them mended; the stir and turmoil, and the music of the\nsteel, were wanting here--one's nerves were wrung by this grisly\nspectacle, whilst the duel's compensating pleasurable thrill was\nlacking.\n\nFinally the doctor finished, and the men who were to fight the closing\nbattle of the day came forth. A good many dinners were not completed,\nyet, but no matter, they could be eaten cold, after the battle;\ntherefore everybody crowded forth to see. This was not a love duel, but\na \"satisfaction\" affair. These two students had quarreled, and were here\nto settle it. They did not belong to any of the corps, but they were\nfurnished with weapons and armor, and permitted to fight here by the\nfive corps as a courtesy. Evidently these two young men were unfamiliar\nwith the dueling ceremonies, though they were not unfamiliar with the\nsword. When they were placed in position they thought it was time\nto begin--and then did begin, too, and with a most impetuous energy,\nwithout waiting for anybody to give the word. This vastly amused the\nspectators, and even broke down their studied and courtly gravity and\nsurprised them into laughter. Of course the seconds struck up the swords\nand started the duel over again. At the word, the deluge of blows began,\nbut before long the surgeon once more interfered--for the only reason\nwhich ever permits him to interfere--and the day's war was over. It was\nnow two in the afternoon, and I had been present since half past nine in\nthe morning. The field of battle was indeed a red one by this time;\nbut some sawdust soon righted that. There had been one duel before I\narrived. In it one of the men received many injuries, while the other\none escaped without a scratch.\n\nI had seen the heads and faces of ten youths gashed in every direction\nby the keen two-edged blades, and yet had not seen a victim wince, nor\nheard a moan, or detected any fleeting expression which confessed the\nsharp pain the hurts were inflicting. This was good fortitude, indeed.\nSuch endurance is to be expected in savages and prize-fighters, for they\nare born and educated to it; but to find it in such perfection in these\ngently bred and kindly natured young fellows is matter for surprise.\nIt was not merely under the excitement of the sword-play that this\nfortitude was shown; it was shown in the surgeon's room where an\nuninspiring quiet reigned, and where there was no audience. The doctor's\nmanipulations brought out neither grimaces nor moans. And in the fights\nit was observable that these lads hacked and slashed with the same\ntremendous spirit, after they were covered with streaming wounds, which\nthey had shown in the beginning.\n\nThe world in general looks upon the college duels as very farcical\naffairs: true, but considering that the college duel is fought by boys;\nthat the swords are real swords; and that the head and face are exposed,\nit seems to me that it is a farce which had quite a grave side to it.\nPeople laugh at it mainly because they think the student is so covered\nup with armor that he cannot be hurt. But it is not so; his eyes and\nears are protected, but the rest of his face and head are bare. He\ncan not only be badly wounded, but his life is in danger; and he would\nsometimes lose it but for the interference of the surgeon. It is\nnot intended that his life shall be endangered. Fatal accidents are\npossible, however. For instance, the student's sword may break, and the\nend of it fly up behind his antagonist's ear and cut an artery which\ncould not be reached if the sword remained whole. This has happened,\nsometimes, and death has resulted on the spot. Formerly the student's\narmpits were not protected--and at that time the swords were pointed,\nwhereas they are blunt, now; so an artery in the armpit was sometimes\ncut, and death followed. Then in the days of sharp-pointed swords, a\nspectator was an occasional victim--the end of a broken sword flew five\nor ten feet and buried itself in his neck or his heart, and death ensued\ninstantly. The student duels in Germany occasion two or three deaths\nevery year, now, but this arises only from the carelessness of the\nwounded men; they eat or drink imprudently, or commit excesses in the\nway of overexertion; inflammation sets in and gets such a headway that\nit cannot be arrested. Indeed, there is blood and pain and danger\nenough about the college duel to entitle it to a considerable degree of\nrespect.\n\nAll the customs, all the laws, all the details, pertaining to the\nstudent duel are quaint and naive. The grave, precise, and courtly\nceremony with which the thing is conducted, invests it with a sort of\nantique charm.\n\nThis dignity and these knightly graces suggest the tournament, not the\nprize-fight. The laws are as curious as they are strict. For instance,\nthe duelist may step forward from the line he is placed upon, if he\nchooses, but never back of it. If he steps back of it, or even leans\nback, it is considered that he did it to avoid a blow or contrive an\nadvantage; so he is dismissed from his corps in disgrace. It would seem\nnatural to step from under a descending sword unconsciously, and against\none's will and intent--yet this unconsciousness is not allowed. Again:\nif under the sudden anguish of a wound the receiver of it makes a\ngrimace, he falls some degrees in the estimation of his fellows; his\ncorps are ashamed of him: they call him \"hare foot,\" which is the German\nequivalent for chicken-hearted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n[How Bismark Fought]\n\n\nIn addition to the corps laws, there are some corps usages which have\nthe force of laws.\n\nPerhaps the president of a corps notices that one of the membership who\nis no longer an exempt--that is a freshman--has remained a sophomore\nsome little time without volunteering to fight; some day, the president,\ninstead of calling for volunteers, will APPOINT this sophomore\nto measure swords with a student of another corps; he is free to\ndecline--everybody says so--there is no compulsion. This is all\ntrue--but I have not heard of any student who DID decline; to decline\nand still remain in the corps would make him unpleasantly conspicuous,\nand properly so, since he knew, when he joined, that his main\nbusiness, as a member, would be to fight. No, there is no law against\ndeclining--except the law of custom, which is confessedly stronger than\nwritten law, everywhere.\n\n\n\nThe ten men whose duels I had witnessed did not go away when their hurts\nwere dressed, as I had supposed they would, but came back, one after\nanother, as soon as they were free of the surgeon, and mingled with the\nassemblage in the dueling-room. The white-cap student who won the second\nfight witnessed the remaining three, and talked with us during the\nintermissions. He could not talk very well, because his opponent's sword\nhad cut his under-lip in two, and then the surgeon had sewed it together\nand overlaid it with a profusion of white plaster patches; neither could\nhe eat easily, still he contrived to accomplish a slow and troublesome\nluncheon while the last duel was preparing. The man who was the worst\nhurt of all played chess while waiting to see this engagement. A good\npart of his face was covered with patches and bandages, and all the rest\nof his head was covered and concealed by them.\n\n\n\nIt is said that the student likes to appear on the street and in other\npublic places in this kind of array, and that this predilection often\nkeeps him out when exposure to rain or sun is a positive danger for\nhim. Newly bandaged students are a very common spectacle in the public\ngardens of Heidelberg. It is also said that the student is glad to\nget wounds in the face, because the scars they leave will show so well\nthere; and it is also said that these face wounds are so prized that\nyouths have even been known to pull them apart from time to time and\nput red wine in them to make them heal badly and leave as ugly a scar\nas possible. It does not look reasonable, but it is roundly asserted\nand maintained, nevertheless; I am sure of one thing--scars are plenty\nenough in Germany, among the young men; and very grim ones they are,\ntoo. They crisscross the face in angry red welts, and are permanent and\nineffaceable.\n\n\n\nSome of these scars are of a very strange and dreadful aspect; and the\neffect is striking when several such accent the milder ones, which form\na city map on a man's face; they suggest the \"burned district\" then. We\nhad often noticed that many of the students wore a colored silk band\nor ribbon diagonally across their breasts. It transpired that this\nsignifies that the wearer has fought three duels in which a decision\nwas reached--duels in which he either whipped or was whipped--for drawn\nbattles do not count. [1] After a student has received his ribbon, he\nis \"free\"; he can cease from fighting, without reproach--except some one\ninsult him; his president cannot appoint him to fight; he can volunteer\nif he wants to, or remain quiescent if he prefers to do so. Statistics\nshow that he does NOT prefer to remain quiescent. They show that the\nduel has a singular fascination about it somewhere, for these free\nmen, so far from resting upon the privilege of the badge, are always\nvolunteering. A corps student told me it was of record that Prince\nBismarck fought thirty-two of these duels in a single summer term when\nhe was in college. So he fought twenty-nine after his badge had given\nhim the right to retire from the field.\n\n1. FROM MY DIARY.--Dined in a hotel a few miles up the Neckar, in a room\nwhose walls were hung all over with framed portrait-groups of the Five\nCorps; some were recent, but many antedated photography, and were\npictured in lithography--the dates ranged back to forty or fifty years\nago. Nearly every individual wore the ribbon across his breast. In one\nportrait-group representing (as each of these pictures did) an entire\nCorps, I took pains to count the ribbons: there were twenty-seven\nmembers, and twenty-one of them wore that significant badge.\n\nThe statistics may be found to possess interest in several particulars.\nTwo days in every week are devoted to dueling. The rule is rigid that\nthere must be three duels on each of these days; there are generally\nmore, but there cannot be fewer. There were six the day I was present;\nsometimes there are seven or eight. It is insisted that eight duels a\nweek--four for each of the two days--is too low an average to draw\na calculation from, but I will reckon from that basis, preferring an\nunderstatement to an overstatement of the case. This requires about four\nhundred and eighty or five hundred duelists a year--for in summer the\ncollege term is about three and a half months, and in winter it is four\nmonths and sometimes longer. Of the seven hundred and fifty students in\nthe university at the time I am writing of, only eighty belonged to the\nfive corps, and it is only these corps that do the dueling; occasionally\nother students borrow the arms and battleground of the five corps in\norder to settle a quarrel, but this does not happen every dueling-day.\n[2] Consequently eighty youths furnish the material for some two hundred\nand fifty duels a year. This average gives six fights a year to each\nof the eighty. This large work could not be accomplished if the\nbadge-holders stood upon their privilege and ceased to volunteer.\n\n2. They have to borrow the arms because they could not get them\nelsewhere or otherwise. As I understand it, the public authorities, all\nover Germany, allow the five Corps to keep swords, but DO NOT ALLOW THEM\nTO USE THEM. This is law is rigid; it is only the execution of it that\nis lax.\n\nOf course, where there is so much fighting, the students make it a point\nto keep themselves in constant practice with the foil. One often sees\nthem, at the tables in the Castle grounds, using their whips or canes to\nillustrate some new sword trick which they have heard about; and between\nthe duels, on the day whose history I have been writing, the swords were\nnot always idle; every now and then we heard a succession of the keen\nhissing sounds which the sword makes when it is being put through its\npaces in the air, and this informed us that a student was practicing.\nNecessarily, this unceasing attention to the art develops an expert\noccasionally. He becomes famous in his own university, his renown\nspreads to other universities. He is invited to Goettingen, to fight\nwith a Goettingen expert; if he is victorious, he will be invited\nto other colleges, or those colleges will send their experts to him.\nAmericans and Englishmen often join one or another of the five corps. A\nyear or two ago, the principal Heidelberg expert was a big Kentuckian;\nhe was invited to the various universities and left a wake of victory\nbehind him all about Germany; but at last a little student in Strasburg\ndefeated him. There was formerly a student in Heidelberg who had picked\nup somewhere and mastered a peculiar trick of cutting up under instead\nof cleaving down from above. While the trick lasted he won in sixteen\nsuccessive duels in his university; but by that time observers had\ndiscovered what his charm was, and how to break it, therefore his\nchampionship ceased.\n\nA rule which forbids social intercourse between members of different\ncorps is strict. In the dueling-house, in the parks, on the street,\nand anywhere and everywhere that the students go, caps of a color group\nthemselves together. If all the tables in a public garden were crowded\nbut one, and that one had two red-cap students at it and ten vacant\nplaces, the yellow-caps, the blue-caps, the white caps, and the green\ncaps, seeking seats, would go by that table and not seem to see it, nor\nseem to be aware that there was such a table in the grounds. The student\nby whose courtesy we had been enabled to visit the dueling-place, wore\nthe white cap--Prussian Corps. He introduced us to many white caps, but\nto none of another color. The corps etiquette extended even to us, who\nwere strangers, and required us to group with the white corps only, and\nspeak only with the white corps, while we were their guests, and keep\naloof from the caps of the other colors. Once I wished to examine some\nof the swords, but an American student said, \"It would not be quite\npolite; these now in the windows all have red hilts or blue; they will\nbring in some with white hilts presently, and those you can handle\nfreely.\" When a sword was broken in the first duel, I wanted a piece\nof it; but its hilt was the wrong color, so it was considered best and\npolitest to await a properer season.\n\n\nIt was brought to me after the room was cleared, and I will now make\na \"life-size\" sketch of it by tracing a line around it with my pen, to\nshow the width of the weapon. [Figure 1] The length of these swords is\nabout three feet, and they are quite heavy. One's disposition to cheer,\nduring the course of the duels or at their close, was naturally strong,\nbut corps etiquette forbade any demonstrations of this sort. However\nbrilliant a contest or a victory might be, no sign or sound betrayed\nthat any one was moved.

He had been\nuniversally trusted and honored in his day, but had finally, fallen into\nmisfortune; while serving his third term in Congress, and while upon the\npoint of being elevated to the Senate--which was considered the summit of\nearthly aggrandizement in those days--he had yielded to temptation, when\nin distress for money wherewith to save his estate; and sold his vote.\nHis crime was discovered, and his fall followed instantly.  Nothing could\nreinstate him in the confidence of the people, his ruin was\nirretrievable--his disgrace complete.  All doors were closed against him,\nall men avoided him.  After years of skulking retirement and dissipation,\ndeath had relieved him of his troubles at last, and his funeral followed\nclose upon that of Mr. Hawkins.  He died as he had latterly lived--wholly\nalone and friendless.  He had no relatives--or if he had they did not\nacknowledge him.  The coroner's jury found certain memoranda upon his\nbody and about the premises which revealed a fact not suspected by the\nvillagers before-viz., that Laura was not the child of Mr. and Mrs.\nHawkins.\n\nThe gossips were soon at work.  They were but little hampered by the fact\nthat the memoranda referred to betrayed nothing but the bare circumstance\nthat Laura's real parents were unknown, and stopped there.  So far from\nbeing hampered by this, the gossips seemed to gain all the more freedom\nfrom it.  They supplied all the missing information themselves, they\nfilled up all the blanks.  The town soon teemed with histories of Laura's\norigin and secret history, no two versions precisely alike, but all\nelaborate, exhaustive, mysterious and interesting, and all agreeing in\none vital particular-to-wit, that there was a suspicious cloud about her\nbirth, not to say a disreputable one.\n\nLaura began to encounter cold looks, averted eyes and peculiar nods and\ngestures which perplexed her beyond measure; but presently the pervading\ngossip found its way to her, and she understood them--then.  Her pride\nwas stung.  She was astonished, and at first incredulous.  She was about\nto ask her mother if there was any truth in these reports, but upon\nsecond thought held her peace.  She soon gathered that Major Lackland's\nmemoranda seemed to refer to letters which had passed between himself and\nJudge Hawkins.  She shaped her course without difficulty the day that\nthat hint reached her.\n\nThat night she sat in her room till all was still, and then she stole\ninto the garret and began a search.  She rummaged long among boxes of\nmusty papers relating to business matters of no, interest to her, but at\nlast she found several bundles of letters.  One bundle was marked\n\"private,\" and in that she found what she wanted.  She selected six or\neight letters from the package and began to devour their contents,\nheedless of the cold.\n\nBy the dates, these letters were from five to seven years old.  They were\nall from Major Lackland to Mr. Hawkins.  The substance of them was, that\nsome one in the east had been inquiring of Major Lackland about a lost\nchild and its parents, and that it was conjectured that the child might\nbe Laura.\n\nEvidently some of the letters were missing, for the name of the\ninquirer was not mentioned; there was a casual reference to \"this\nhandsome-featured aristocratic gentleman,\" as if the reader and the\nwriter were accustomed to speak of him and knew who was meant.\n\nIn one letter the Major said he agreed with Mr. Hawkins that the inquirer\nseemed not altogether on the wrong track; but he also agreed that it\nwould be best to keep quiet until more convincing developments were\nforthcoming.\n\nAnother letter said that \"the poor soul broke completely down when be saw\nLaura's picture, and declared it must be she.\"\n\nStill another said:\n\n     \"He seems entirely alone in the world, and his heart is so wrapped\n     up in this thing that I believe that if it proved a false hope, it\n     would kill him; I have persuaded him to wait a little while and go\n     west when I go.\"\n\nAnother letter had this paragraph in it:\n\n     \"He is better one day and worse the next, and is out of his mind a\n     good deal of the time.  Lately his case has developed a something\n     which is a wonder to the hired nurses, but which will not be much of\n     a marvel to you if you have read medical philosophy much.  It is\n     this: his lost memory returns to him when he is delirious, and goes\n     away again when he is himself-just as old Canada Joe used to talk\n     the French patois of his boyhood in the delirium of typhus fever,\n     though he could not do it when his mind was clear.  Now this poor\n     gentleman's memory has always broken down before he reached the\n     explosion of the steamer; he could only remember starting up the\n     river with his wife and child, and he had an idea that there was a\n     race, but he was not certain; he could not name the boat he was on;\n     there was a dead blank of a month or more that supplied not an item\n     to his recollection.  It was not for me to assist him, of course.\n     But now in his delirium it all comes out: the names of the boats,\n     every incident of the explosion, and likewise the details of his\n     astonishing escape--that is, up to where, just as a yawl-boat was\n     approaching him (he was clinging to the starboard wheel of the\n     burning wreck at the time), a falling timber struck him on the head.\n     But I will write out his wonderful escape in full to-morrow or next\n     day.  Of course the physicians will not let me tell him now that our\n     Laura is indeed his child--that must come later, when his health is\n     thoroughly restored.  His case is not considered dangerous at all;\n     he will recover presently, the doctors say.  But they insist that he\n     must travel a little when he gets well--they recommend a short sea\n     voyage, and they say he can be persuaded to try it if we continue to\n     keep him in ignorance and promise to let him see L. as soon as he\n     returns.\"\n\nThe letter that bore the latest date of all, contained this clause:\n\n     \"It is the most unaccountable thing in the world; the mystery\n     remains as impenetrable as ever; I have hunted high and low for him,\n     and inquired of everybody, but in vain; all trace of him ends at\n     that hotel in New York; I never have seen or heard of him since,\n     up to this day; he could hardly have sailed, for his name does not\n     appear upon the books of any shipping office in New York or Boston\n     or Baltimore.  How fortunate it seems, now, that we kept this thing\n     to ourselves; Laura still has a father in you, and it is better for\n     her that we drop this subject here forever.\"\n\nThat was all.  Random remarks here and there, being pieced together gave\nLaura a vague impression of a man of fine presence, abort forty-three or\nforty-five years of age, with dark hair and eyes, and a slight limp in\nhis walk--it was not stated which leg was defective.  And this indistinct\nshadow represented her father.  She made an exhaustive search for the\nmissing letters, but found none.  They had probably been burned; and she\ndoubted not that the ones she had ferreted out would have shared the same\nfate if Mr. Hawkins had not been a dreamer, void of method, whose mind\nwas perhaps in a state of conflagration over some bright new speculation\nwhen he received them.\n\nShe sat long, with the letters in her lap, thinking--and unconsciously\nfreezing.  She felt like a lost person who has traveled down a long lane\nin good hope of escape, and, just as the night descends finds his\nprogress barred by a bridge-less river whose further shore, if it has\none, is lost in the darkness.  If she could only have found these letters\na month sooner!  That was her thought.  But now the dead had carried\ntheir secrets with them.  A dreary, melancholy settled down upon her.\nAn undefined sense of injury crept into her heart.  She grew very\nmiserable.\n\nShe had just reached the romantic age--the age when there is a sad\nsweetness, a dismal comfort to a girl to find out that there is a mystery\nconnected with her birth, which no other piece of good luck can afford.\nShe had more than her rightful share of practical good sense, but still\nshe was human; and to be human is to have one's little modicum of romance\nsecreted away in one's composition.  One never ceases to make a hero of\none's self, (in private,) during life, but only alters the style of his\nheroism from time to time as the drifting years belittle certain gods of\nhis admiration and raise up others in their stead that seem greater.\n\nThe recent wearing days and nights of watching, and the wasting grief\nthat had possessed her, combined with the profound depression that\nnaturally came with the reaction of idleness, made Laura peculiarly\nsusceptible at this time to romantic impressions.  She was a heroine,\nnow, with a mysterious father somewhere.  She could not really tell\nwhether she wanted to find him and spoil it all or not; but still all the\ntraditions of romance pointed to the making the attempt as the usual and\nnecessary, course to follow; therefore she would some day begin the\nsearch when opportunity should offer.\n\nNow a former thought struck her--she would speak to Mrs. Hawkins.\nAnd naturally enough Mrs. Hawkins appeared on the stage at that moment.\n\nShe said she knew all--she knew that Laura had discovered the secret that\nMr. Hawkins, the elder children, Col. Sellers and herself had kept so\nlong and so faithfully; and she cried and said that now that troubles had\nbegun they would never end; her daughter's love would wean itself away\nfrom her and her heart would break.  Her grief so wrought upon Laura that\nthe girl almost forgot her own troubles for the moment in her compassion\nfor her mother's distress.  Finally Mrs. Hawkins said:\n\n\"Speak to me, child--do not forsake me.  Forget all this miserable talk.\nSay I am your mother!--I have loved you so long, and there is no other.\nI am your mother, in the sight of God, and nothing shall ever take you\nfrom me!\"\n\nAll barriers fell, before this appeal.  Laura put her arms about her\nmother's neck and said:\n\n\"You are my mother, and always shall be.  We will be as we have always\nbeen; and neither this foolish talk nor any other thing shall part us or\nmake us less to each other than we are this hour.\"\n\nThere was no longer any sense of separation or estrangement between them.\nIndeed their love seemed more perfect now than it had ever been before.\nBy and by they went down stairs and sat by the fire and talked long and\nearnestly about Laura's history and the letters.  But it transpired that\nMrs. Hawkins had never known of this correspondence between her husband\nand Major Lackland.  With his usual consideration for his wife, Mr.\nHawkins had shielded her from the worry the matter would have caused her.\n\nLaura went to bed at last with a mind that had gained largely in\ntranquility and had lost correspondingly in morbid romantic exaltation.\nShe was pensive, the next day, and subdued; but that was not matter for\nremark, for she did not differ from the mournful friends about her in\nthat respect.  Clay and Washington were the same loving and admiring\nbrothers now that they had always been.  The great secret was new to some\nof the younger children, but their love suffered no change under the\nwonderful revelation.\n\nIt is barely possible that things might have presently settled down into\ntheir old rut and the mystery have lost the bulk of its romantic\nsublimity in Laura's eyes, if the village gossips could have quieted\ndown.  But they could not quiet down and they did not.  Day after day\nthey called at the house, ostensibly upon visits of condolence, and they\npumped away at the mother and the children without seeming to know that\ntheir questionings were in bad taste.  They meant no harm they only\nwanted to know.  Villagers always want to know.\n\nThe family fought shy of the questionings, and of course that was high\ntestimony \"if the Duchess was respectably born, why didn't they come out\nand prove it?--why did they, stick to that poor thin story about picking\nher up out of a steamboat explosion?\"\n\nUnder this ceaseless persecution, Laura's morbid self-communing was\nrenewed.  At night the day's contribution of detraction, innuendo and\nmalicious conjecture would be canvassed in her mind, and then she would\ndrift into a course of thinking.  As her thoughts ran on, the indignant\ntears would spring to her eyes, and she would spit out fierce little\nejaculations at intervals.  But finally she would grow calmer and say\nsome comforting disdainful thing--something like this:\n\n\"But who are they?--Animals!  What are their opinions to me?  Let them\ntalk--I will not stoop to be affected by it.  I could hate----.\nNonsense--nobody I care for or in any way respect is changed toward me,\nI fancy.\"\n\nShe may have supposed she was thinking of many individuals, but it was\nnot so--she was thinking of only one.  And her heart warmed somewhat,\ntoo, the while.  One day a friend overheard a conversation like this:\n--and naturally came and told her all about it:\n\n\"Ned, they say you don't go there any more.  How is that?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't; but I tell you it's not because I don't want to and it's\nnot because I think it is any matter who her father was or who he wasn't,\neither; it's only on account of this talk, talk, talk.  I think she is a\nfine girl every way, and so would you if you knew her as well as I do;\nbut you know how it is when a girl once gets talked about--it's all up\nwith her--the world won't ever let her alone, after that.\"\n\nThe only comment Laura made upon this revelation, was:\n\n\"Then it appears that if this trouble had not occurred I could have had\nthe happiness of Mr. Ned Thurston's serious attentions.  He is well\nfavored in person, and well liked, too, I believe, and comes of one of\nthe first families of the village.  He is prosperous, too, I hear; has\nbeen a doctor a year, now, and has had two patients--no, three, I think;\nyes, it was three.  I attended their funerals.  Well, other people have\nhoped and been disappointed; I am not alone in that.  I wish you could\nstay to dinner, Maria--we are going to have sausages; and besides,\nI wanted to talk to you about Hawkeye and make you promise to come and\nsee us when we are settled there.\"\n\nBut Maria could not stay.  She had come to mingle romantic tears with\nLaura's over the lover's defection and had found herself dealing with a\nheart that could not rise to an appreciation of affliction because its\ninterest was all centred in sausages.\n\nBut as soon as Maria was gone, Laura stamped her expressive foot and\nsaid:\n\n\"The coward!  Are all books lies?  I thought he would fly to the front,\nand be brave and noble, and stand up for me against all the world, and\ndefy my enemies, and wither these gossips with his scorn!  Poor crawling\nthing, let him go.  I do begin to despise thin world!\"\n\nShe lapsed into thought.  Presently she said:\n\n\"If the time ever comes, and I get a chance, Oh, I'll----\"\n\nShe could not find a word that was strong enough, perhaps.  By and by she\nsaid:\n\n\"Well, I am glad of it--I'm glad of it.  I never cared anything for him\nanyway!\"\n\nAnd then, with small consistency, she cried a little, and patted her foot\nmore indignantly than ever.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTwo months had gone by and the Hawkins family were domiciled in Hawkeye.\nWashington was at work in the real estate office again, and was\nalternately in paradise or the other place just as it happened that\nLouise was gracious to him or seemingly indifferent--because indifference\nor preoccupation could mean nothing else than that she was thinking of\nsome other young person.  Col. Sellers had asked him several times, to\ndine with him, when he first returned to Hawkeye, but Washington, for no\nparticular reason, had not accepted.  No particular reason except one\nwhich he preferred to keep to himself--viz. that he could not bear to be\naway from Louise.  It occurred to him, now, that the Colonel had not\ninvited him lately--could he be offended?  He resolved to go that very\nday, and give the Colonel a pleasant surprise.  It was a good idea;\nespecially as Louise had absented herself from breakfast that morning,\nand torn his heart; he would tear hers, now, and let her see how it felt.\n\nThe Sellers family were just starting to dinner when Washington burst\nupon them with his surprise.  For an instant the Colonel looked\nnonplussed, and just a bit uncomfortable; and Mrs. Sellers looked\nactually distressed; but the next moment the head of the house was\nhimself again, and exclaimed:\n\n\"All right, my boy, all right--always glad to see you--always glad to\nhear your voice and take you by the hand.  Don't wait for special\ninvitations--that's all nonsense among friends.  Just come whenever you\ncan, and come as often as you can--the oftener the better.  You can't\nplease us any better than that, Washington; the little woman will tell\nyou so herself.  We don't pretend to style.  Plain folks, you know--plain\nfolks.  Just a plain family dinner, but such as it is, our friends are\nalways welcome, I reckon you know that yourself, Washington.  Run along,\nchildren, run along; Lafayette,--[**In those old days the average man\ncalled his children after his most revered literary and historical idols;\nconsequently there was hardly a family, at least in the West, but had a\nWashington in it--and also a Lafayette, a Franklin, and six or eight\nsounding names from Byron, Scott, and the Bible, if the offspring held\nout.  To visit such a family, was to find one's self confronted by a\ncongress made up of representatives of the imperial myths and the\nmajestic dead of all the ages.  There was something thrilling about it,\nto a stranger, not to say awe inspiring.]--stand off the cat's tail,\nchild, can't you see what you're doing?--Come, come, come, Roderick Dhu,\nit isn't nice for little boys to hang onto young gentlemen's coat tails\n--but never mind him, Washington, he's full of spirits and don't mean any\nharm.  Children will be children, you know.  Take the chair next to Mrs.\nSellers, Washington--tut, tut, Marie Antoinette, let your brother have\nthe fork if he wants it, you are bigger than he is.\"\n\nWashington contemplated the banquet, and wondered if he were in his right\nmind.  Was this the plain family dinner?  And was it all present?  It was\nsoon apparent that this was indeed the dinner: it was all on the table:\nit consisted of abundance of clear, fresh water, and a basin of raw\nturnips--nothing more.\n\nWashington stole a glance at Mrs. Sellers's face, and would have given\nthe world, the next moment, if he could have spared her that.  The poor\nwoman's face was crimson, and the tears stood in her eyes.  Washington\ndid not know what to do.  He wished he had never come there and spied out\nthis cruel poverty and brought pain to that poor little lady's heart and\nshame to her cheek; but he was there, and there was no escape.  Col.\nSellers hitched back his coat sleeves airily from his wrists as who\nshould say \"Now for solid enjoyment!\" seized a fork, flourished it and\nbegan to harpoon turnips and deposit them in the plates before him \"Let\nme help you, Washington--Lafayette pass this plate Washington--ah, well,\nwell, my boy, things are looking pretty bright, now, I tell you.\nSpeculation--my! the whole atmosphere's full of money.  I would'nt take\nthree fortunes for one little operation I've got on hand now--have\nanything from the casters?  No?  Well, you're right, you're right.  Some\npeople like mustard with turnips, but--now there was Baron Poniatowski\n--Lord, but that man did know how to live!--true Russian you know, Russian\nto the back bone; I say to my wife, give me a Russian every time, for a\ntable comrade.  The Baron used to say, 'Take mustard, Sellers, try the\nmustard,--a man can't know what turnips are in perfection without,\nmustard,' but I always said, 'No, Baron, I'm a plain man and I want my\nfood plain--none of your embellishments for Beriah Sellers--no made\ndishes for me!  And it's the best way--high living kills more than it\ncures in this world, you can rest assured of that.--Yes indeed,\nWashington, I've got one little operation on hand that--take some more\nwater--help yourself, won't you?--help yourself, there's plenty of it.\n--You'll find it pretty good, I guess.  How does that fruit strike you?\"\n\nWashington said he did not know that he had ever tasted better.  He did\nnot add that he detested turnips even when they were cooked loathed them\nin their natural state.  No, he kept this to himself, and praised the\nturnips to the peril of his soul.\n\n\"I thought you'd like them.  Examine them--examine them--they'll bear it.\nSee how perfectly firm and juicy they are--they can't start any like them\nin this part of the country, I can tell you.  These are from New Jersey\n--I imported them myself.  They cost like sin, too; but lord bless me,\nI go in for having the best of a thing, even if it does cost a little\nmore--it's the best economy, in the long run.  These are the Early\nMalcolm--it's a turnip that can't be produced except in just one orchard,\nand the supply never is up to the demand.  Take some more water,\nWashington--you can't drink too much water with fruit--all the doctors\nsay that.  The plague can't come where this article is, my boy!\"\n\n\"Plague?  What plague?\"\n\n\"What plague, indeed?  Why the Asiatic plague that nearly depopulated\nLondon a couple of centuries ago.\"\n\n\"But how does that concern us?  There is no plague here, I reckon.\"\n\n\"Sh! I've let it out!  Well, never mind--just keep it to yourself.\nPerhaps I oughtn't said anything, but its bound to come out sooner or\nlater, so what is the odds?  Old McDowells wouldn't like me to--to\n--bother it all, I'll jest tell the whole thing and let it go.  You see,\nI've been down to St. Louis, and I happened to run across old Dr.\nMcDowells--thinks the world of me, does the doctor.  He's a man that\nkeeps himself to himself, and well he may, for he knows that he's got a\nreputation that covers the whole earth--he won't condescend to open\nhimself out to many people, but lord bless you, he and I are just like\nbrothers; he won't let me go to a hotel when I'm in the city--says I'm\nthe only man that's company to him, and I don't know but there's some\ntruth in it, too, because although I never like to glorify myself and\nmake a great to-do over what I am or what I can do or what I know,\nI don't mind saying here among friends that I am better read up in most\nsciences, maybe, than the general run of professional men in these days.\nWell, the other day he let me into a little secret, strictly on the\nquiet, about this matter of the plague.\n\n\"You see it's booming right along in our direction--follows the Gulf\nStream, you know, just as all those epidemics do, and within three months\nit will be just waltzing through this land like a whirlwind!  And whoever\nit touches can make his will and contract for the funeral.  Well you\ncan't cure it, you know, but you can prevent it.  How?  Turnips! that's\nit!  Turnips and water!  Nothing like it in the world, old McDowells\nsays, just fill yourself up two or three times a day, and you can snap\nyour fingers at the plague.  Sh!--keep mum, but just you confine yourself\nto that diet and you're all right.  I wouldn't have old McDowells know\nthat I told about it for anything--he never would speak to me again.\nTake some more water, Washington--the more water you drink, the better.\nHere, let me give you some more of the turnips.  No, no, no, now, I\ninsist.  There, now.  Absorb those.  They're, mighty sustaining--brim\nfull of nutriment--all the medical books say so.  Just eat from four to\nseven good-sized turnips at a meal, and drink from a pint and a half to a\nquart of water, and then just sit around a couple of hours and let them\nferment.  You'll feel like a fighting cock next day.\"\n\nFifteen or twenty minutes later the Colonel's tongue was still chattering\naway--he had piled up several future fortunes out of several incipient\n\"operations\" which he had blundered into within the past week, and was\nnow soaring along through some brilliant expectations born of late\npromising experiments upon the lacking ingredient of the eye-water.\nAnd at such a time Washington ought to have been a rapt and enthusiastic\nlistener, but he was not, for two matters disturbed his mind and\ndistracted his attention.  One was, that he discovered, to his confusion\nand shame, that in allowing himself to be helped a second time to the\nturnips, he had robbed those hungry children.  He had not needed the\ndreadful \"fruit,\" and had not wanted it; and when he saw the pathetic\nsorrow in their faces when they asked for more and there was no more to\ngive them, he hated himself for his stupidity and pitied the famishing\nyoung things with all his heart.  The other matter that disturbed him was\nthe dire inflation that had begun in his stomach.  It grew and grew, it\nbecame more and more insupportable.  Evidently the turnips were\n\"fermenting.\"  He forced himself to sit still as long as he could, but\nhis anguish conquered him at last.\n\nHe rose in the midst of the Colonel's talk and excused himself on the\nplea of a previous engagement.  The Colonel followed him to the door,\npromising over and over again that he would use his influence to get some\nof the Early Malcolms for him, and insisting that he should not be such a\nstranger but come and take pot-luck with him every chance he got.\nWashington was glad enough to get away and feel free again.  He\nimmediately bent his steps toward home.\n\nIn bed he passed an hour that threatened to turn his hair gray, and then\na blessed calm settled down upon him that filled his heart with\ngratitude.  Weak and languid, he made shift to turn himself about and\nseek rest and sleep; and as his soul hovered upon the brink of\nunconciousness, he heaved a long, deep sigh, and said to himself that in\nhis heart he had cursed the Colonel's preventive of rheumatism, before,\nand now let the plague come if it must--he was done with preventives;\nif ever any man beguiled him with turnips and water again, let him die\nthe death.\n\nIf he dreamed at all that night, no gossiping spirit disturbed his\nvisions to whisper in his ear of certain matters just then in bud in the\nEast, more than a thousand miles away that after the lapse of a few years\nwould develop influences which would profoundly affect the fate and\nfortunes of the Hawkins family.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\"Oh, it's easy enough to make a fortune,\" Henry said.\n\n\"It seems to be easier than it is, I begin to think,\" replied Philip.\n\n\"Well, why don't you go into something?  You'll never dig it out of the\nAstor Library.\"\n\nIf there be any place and time in the world where and when it seems easy\nto \"go into something\" it is in Broadway on a spring morning, when one is\nwalking city-ward, and has before him the long lines of palace-shops with\nan occasional spire seen through the soft haze that lies over the lower\ntown, and hears the roar and hum of its multitudinous traffic.\n\nTo the young American, here or elsewhere, the paths to fortune are\ninnumerable and all open; there is invitation in the air and success in\nall his wide horizon.  He is embarrassed which to choose, and is not\nunlikely to waste years in dallying with his chances, before giving\nhimself to the serious tug and strain of a single object.  He has no\ntraditions to bind him or guide him, and his impulse is to break away\nfrom the occupation his father has followed, and make a new way for\nhimself.\n\nPhilip Sterling used to say that if he should seriously set himself for\nten years to any one of the dozen projects that were in his brain, he\nfelt that he could be a rich man.  He wanted to be rich, he had a sincere\ndesire for a fortune, but for some unaccountable reason he hesitated\nabout addressing himself to the narrow work of getting it.  He never\nwalked Broadway, a part of its tide of abundant shifting life, without\nfeeling something of the flush of wealth, and unconsciously taking the\nelastic step of one well-to-do in this prosperous world.\n\nEspecially at night in the crowded theatre--Philip was too young to\nremember the old Chambers' Street box, where the serious Burton led his\nhilarious and pagan crew--in the intervals of the screaming comedy, when\nthe orchestra scraped and grunted and tooted its dissolute tunes, the\nworld seemed full of opportunities to Philip, and his heart exulted with\na conscious ability to take any of its prizes he chose to pluck.\n\nPerhaps it was the swimming ease of the acting, on the stage, where\nvirtue had its reward in three easy acts, perhaps it was the excessive\nlight of the house, or the music, or the buzz of the excited talk between\nacts, perhaps it was youth which believed everything, but for some reason\nwhile Philip was at the theatre he had the utmost confidence in life and\nhis ready victory in it.\n\nDelightful illusion of paint and tinsel and silk attire, of cheap\nsentiment and high and mighty dialogue!  Will there not always be rosin\nenough for the squeaking fiddle-bow?\n\nDo we not all like the maudlin hero, who is sneaking round the right\nentrance, in wait to steal the pretty wife of his rich and tyrannical\nneighbor from the paste-board cottage at the left entrance? and when he\nadvances down to the foot-lights and defiantly informs the audience that,\n\"he who lays his hand on a woman except in the way of kindness,\" do we\nnot all applaud so as to drown the rest of the sentence?\n\nPhilip never was fortunate enough to hear what would become of a man who\nshould lay his hand on a woman with the exception named; but he learned\nafterwards that the woman who lays her hand on a man, without any\nexception whatsoever, is always acquitted by the jury.\n\nThe fact was, though Philip Sterling did not know it, that he wanted\nseveral other things quite as much as he wanted wealth.  The modest\nfellow would have liked fame thrust upon him for some worthy achievement;\nit might be for a book, or for the skillful management of some great\nnewspaper, or for some daring expedition like that of Lt. Strain or Dr.\nKane.  He was unable to decide exactly what it should be.  Sometimes he\nthought he would like to stand in a conspicuous pulpit and humbly preach\nthe gospel of repentance; and it even crossed his mind that it would be\nnoble to give himself to a missionary life to some benighted region,\nwhere the date-palm grows, and the nightingale's voice is in tune, and\nthe bul-bul sings on the off nights.  If he were good enough he would\nattach himself to that company of young men in the Theological Seminary,\nwho were seeing New York life in preparation for the ministry.\n\nPhilip was a New England boy and had graduated at Yale; he had not\ncarried off with him all the learning of that venerable institution, but\nhe knew some things that were not in the regular course of study.  A very\ngood use of the English language and considerable knowledge of its\nliterature was one of them; he could sing a song very well, not in time\nto be sure, but with enthusiasm; he could make a magnetic speech at a\nmoment's notice in the class room, the debating society, or upon any\nfence or dry-goods box that was convenient; he could lift himself by one\narm, and do the giant swing in the gymnasium; he could strike out from\nhis left shoulder; he could handle an oar like a professional and pull\nstroke in a winning race.  Philip had a good appetite, a sunny temper,\nand a clear hearty laugh.  He had brown hair, hazel eyes set wide apart,\na broad but not high forehead, and a fresh winning face.  He was six feet\nhigh, with broad shoulders, long legs and a swinging gait; one of those\nloose-jointed, capable fellows, who saunter into the world with a free\nair and usually make a stir in whatever company they enter.\n\nAfter he left college Philip took the advice of friends and read law.\nLaw seemed to him well enough as a science, but he never could discover a\npractical case where it appeared to him worth while to go to law, and all\nthe clients who stopped with this new clerk in the ante-room of the law\noffice where he was writing, Philip invariably advised to settle--no\nmatter how, but settle--greatly to the disgust of his employer, who knew\nthat justice between man and man could only be attained by the recognized\nprocesses, with the attendant fees.  Besides Philip hated the copying of\npleadings, and he was certain that a life of \"whereases\" and \"aforesaids\"\nand whipping the devil round the stump, would be intolerable.\n\n[Note: these few paragraphs are nearly an autobiography of the life of\nCharles Dudley Warner whose contributions to the story start here with\nChapter XII.  D.W.]\n\nHis pen therefore, and whereas, and not as aforesaid, strayed off into\nother scribbling.  In an unfortunate hour, he had two or three papers\naccepted by first-class magazines, at three dollars the printed page,\nand, behold, his vocation was open to him.  He would make his mark in\nliterature.\n\nLife has no moment so sweet as that in which a young man believes himself\ncalled into the immortal ranks of the masters of literature.  It is such\na noble ambition, that it is a pity it has usually such a shallow\nfoundation.\n\nAt the time of this history, Philip had gone to New York for a career.\nWith his talent he thought he should have little difficulty in getting an\neditorial position upon a metropolitan newspaper; not that he knew\nanything about news paper work, or had the least idea of journalism; he\nknew he was not fitted for the technicalities of the subordinate\ndepartments, but he could write leaders with perfect ease, he was sure.\nThe drudgery of the newspaper office was too distaste ful, and besides it\nwould be beneath the dignity of a graduate and a successful magazine\nwriter.  He wanted to begin at the top of the ladder.\n\nTo his surprise he found that every situation in the editorial department\nof the journals was full, always had been full, was always likely to be\nfull.  It seemed to him that the newspaper managers didn't want genius,\nbut mere plodding and grubbing.  Philip therefore read diligently in the\nAstor library, planned literary works that should compel attention, and\nnursed his genius.  He had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into\nthe Dorking Convention, then in session, make a sketch of the men and\nwomen on the platform, and take it to the editor of the Daily Grapevine,\nand see what he could get a line for it.\n\nOne day he had an offer from some country friends, who believed in him,\nto take charge of a provincial daily newspaper, and he went to consult\nMr. Gringo--Gringo who years ago managed the Atlas--about taking the\nsituation.\n\n\"Take it of course,\" says Gringo, take anything that offers, why not?\"\n\n\"But they want me to make it an opposition paper.\"\n\n\"Well, make it that.  That party is going to succeed, it's going to elect\nthe next president.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Philip, stoutly, \"its wrong in principle, and\nit ought not to succeed, but I don't see how I can go for a thing I don't\nbelieve in.\"\n\n\"O, very well,\" said Gringo, turning away with a shade of contempt,\n\"you'll find if you are going into literature and newspaper work that you\ncan't afford a conscience like that.\"\n\nBut Philip did afford it, and he wrote, thanking his friends, and\ndeclining because he said the political scheme would fail, and ought to\nfail.  And he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening\nlarge enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world.\n\nIt was in this time of rather impatient waiting that Philip was one\nmorning walking down Broadway with Henry Brierly.  He frequently\naccompanied Henry part way down town to what the latter called his office\nin Broad Street, to which he went, or pretended to go, with regularity\nevery day.  It was evident to the most casual acquaintance that he was a\nman of affairs, and that his time was engrossed in the largest sort of\noperations, about which there was a mysterious air.  His liability to be\nsuddenly summoned to Washington, or Boston or Montreal or even to\nLiverpool was always imminent.  He never was so summoned, but none of his\nacquaintances would have been surprised to hear any day that he had gone\nto Panama or Peoria, or to hear from him that he had bought the Bank of\nCommerce.\n\nThe two were intimate at that time,--they had been class, mates--and saw\na great deal of each other.  Indeed, they lived together in Ninth Street,\nin a boarding-house, there, which had the honor of lodging and partially\nfeeding several other young fellows of like kidney, who have since gone\ntheir several ways into fame or into obscurity.\n\nIt was during the morning walk to which reference has been made that\nHenry Brierly suddenly said, \"Philip, how would you like to go to\nSt. Jo?\"\n\n\"I think I should like it of all things,\" replied Philip, with some\nhesitation, \"but what for.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's a big operation.  We are going, a lot of us, railroad men,\nengineers, contractors.  You know my uncle is a great railroad man.  I've\nno doubt I can get you a chance to go if you'll go.\"\n\n\"But in what capacity would I go?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm going as an engineer.  You can go as one.\"\n\n\"I don't know an engine from a coal cart.\"\n\n\"Field engineer, civil engineer.  You can begin by carrying a rod, and\nputting down the figures.  It's easy enough.  I'll show you about that.\nWe'll get Trautwine and some of those books.\"\n\n\"Yes, but what is it for, what is it all about?\"\n\n\"Why don't you see?  We lay out a line, spot the good land, enter it up,\nknow where the stations are to be, spot them, buy lots; there's heaps of\nmoney in it.  We wouldn't engineer long.\"\n\n\"When do you go?\" was Philip's next question, after some moments of\nsilence.\n\n\"To-morrow.  Is that too soon?\"\n\n\"No, its not too soon.  I've been ready to go anywhere for six months.\nThe fact is, Henry, that I'm about tired of trying to force myself into\nthings, and am quite willing to try floating with the stream for a while,\nand see where I will land.  This seems like a providential call; it's\nsudden enough.\"\n\nThe two young men who were by this time full of the adventure, went down\nto the Wall street office of Henry's uncle and had a talk with that wily\noperator.  The uncle knew Philip very well, and was pleased with his\nfrank enthusiasm, and willing enough to give him a trial in the western\nventure.  It was settled therefore, in the prompt way in which things are\nsettled in New York, that they would start with the rest of the company\nnext morning for the west.\n\nOn the way up town these adventurers bought books on engineering, and\nsuits of India-rubber, which they supposed they would need in a new and\nprobably damp country, and many other things which nobody ever needed\nanywhere.\n\nThe night was spent in packing up and writing letters, for Philip would\nnot take such an important step without informing his friends.  If they\ndisapprove, thought he, I've done my duty by letting them know.  Happy\nyouth, that is ready to pack its valise, and start for Cathay on an\nhour's notice.\n\n\"By the way,\" calls out Philip from his bed-room, to Henry, \"where is\nSt. Jo.?\"\n\n\"Why, it's in Missouri somewhere, on the frontier I think.  We'll get a\nmap.\"\n\n\"Never mind the map.  We will find the place itself.  I was afraid it was\nnearer home.\"\n\nPhilip wrote a long letter, first of all, to his mother, full of love and\nglowing anticipations of his new opening.  He wouldn't bother her with\nbusiness details, but he hoped that the day was not far off when she\nwould see him return, with a moderate fortune, and something to add to\nthe comfort of her advancing years.\n\nTo his uncle he said that he had made an arrangement with some New York\ncapitalists to go to Missouri, in a land and railroad operation, which\nwould at least give him a knowledge of the world and not unlikely offer\nhim a business opening.  He knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he\nhad at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter.\n\nIt was to Ruth Bolton that Philip wrote last.  He might never see her\nagain; he went to seek his fortune.  He well knew the perils of the\nfrontier, the savage state of society, the lurking Indians and the\ndangers of fever.  But there was no real danger to a person who took care\nof himself.  Might he write to her often and, tell her of his life.\nIf he returned with a fortune, perhaps and perhaps.  If he was\nunsuccessful, or if he never returned--perhaps it would be as well.\nNo time or distance, however, would ever lessen his interest in her.  He\nwould say good-night, but not good-bye.\n\nIn the soft beginning of a Spring morning, long before New York had\nbreakfasted, while yet the air of expectation hung about the wharves of\nthe metropolis, our young adventurers made their way to the Jersey City\nrailway station of the Erie road, to begin the long, swinging, crooked\njourney, over what a writer of a former day called a causeway of cracked\nrails and cows, to the West.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n          What ever to say be toke in his entente,\n          his langage was so fayer & pertynante,\n          yt semeth unto manys herying not only the worde,\n          but veryly the thyng.\n                              Caxton's Book of Curtesye.\n\nIn the party of which our travelers found themselves members, was Duff\nBrown, the great railroad contractor, and subsequently a well-known\nmember of Congress; a bluff, jovial Bost'n man, thick-set, close shaven,\nwith a heavy jaw and a low forehead--a very pleasant man if you were not\nin his way.  He had government contracts also, custom houses and dry\ndocks, from Portland to New Orleans, and managed to get out of congress,\nin appropriations, about weight for weight of gold for the stone\nfurnished.\n\nAssociated with him, and also of this party, was Rodney Schaick, a sleek\nNew York broker, a man as prominent in the church as in the stock\nexchange, dainty in his dress, smooth of speech, the necessary complement\nof Duff Brown in any enterprise that needed assurance and adroitness.\n\nIt would be difficult to find a pleasanter traveling party one that shook\noff more readily the artificial restraints of Puritanic strictness, and\ntook the world with good-natured allowance.  Money was plenty for every\nattainable luxury, and there seemed to be no doubt that its supply would\ncontinue, and that fortunes were about to be made without a great deal of\ntoil.  Even Philip soon caught the prevailing spirit; Barry did not need\nany inoculation, he always talked in six figures.  It was as natural for\nthe dear boy to be rich as it is for most people to be poor.\n\nThe elders of the party were not long in discovering the fact, which\nalmost all travelers to the west soon find out; that the water was poor.\nIt must have been by a lucky premonition of this that they all had brandy\nflasks with which to qualify the water of the country; and it was no\ndoubt from an uneasy feeling of the danger of being poisoned that they\nkept experimenting, mixing a little of the dangerous and changing fluid,\nas they passed along, with the contents of the flasks, thus saving their\nlives hour by hour.  Philip learned afterwards that temperance and the\nstrict observance of Sunday and a certain gravity of deportment are\ngeographical habits, which people do not usually carry with them away\nfrom home.\n\nOur travelers stopped in Chicago long enough to see that they could make\ntheir fortunes there in two week's tine, but it did not seem worth while;\nthe west was more attractive; the further one went the wider the\nopportunities opened.\n\nThey took railroad to Alton and the steamboat from there to St. Louis,\nfor the change and to have a glimpse of the river.\n\n\"Isn't this jolly?\" cried Henry, dancing out of the barber's room, and\ncoming down the deck with a one, two, three step, shaven, curled and\nperfumed after his usual exquisite fashion.\n\n\"What's jolly?\" asked Philip, looking out upon the dreary and monotonous\nwaste through which the shaking steamboat was coughing its way.\n\n\"Why, the whole thing; it's immense I can tell you.  I wouldn't give that\nto be guaranteed a hundred thousand cold cash in a year's time.\"\n\n\"Where's Mr. Brown?\"\n\n\"He is in the saloon, playing poker with Schaick and that long haired\nparty with the striped trousers, who scrambled aboard when the stage\nplank was half hauled in, and the big Delegate to Congress from out\nwest.\"\n\n\"That's a fine looking fellow, that delegate, with his glossy, black\nwhiskers; looks like a Washington man; I shouldn't think he'd be at\npoker.\"\n\n\"Oh, its only five cent ante, just to make it interesting, the Delegate\nsaid.\"\n\n\"But I shouldn't think a representative in Congress would play poker any\nway in a public steamboat.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, you've got to pass the time.  I tried a hand myself, but those\nold fellows are too many for me.  The Delegate knows all the points.\nI'd bet a hundred dollars he will ante his way right into the United\nStates Senate when his territory comes in.  He's got the cheek for it.\"\n\n\"He has the grave and thoughtful manner of expectoration of a public man,\nfor one thing,\" added Philip.\n\n\"Harry,\" said Philip, after a pause, \"what have you got on those big\nboots for; do you expect to wade ashore?\"\n\n\"I'm breaking 'em in.\"\n\nThe fact was Harry had got himself up in what he thought a proper costume\nfor a new country, and was in appearance a sort of compromise between a\ndandy of Broadway and a backwoodsman.  Harry, with blue eyes, fresh\ncomplexion, silken whiskers and curly chestnut hair, was as handsome as\na fashion plate.  He wore this morning a soft hat, a short cutaway coat,\nan open vest displaying immaculate linen, a leathern belt round his\nwaist, and top-boots of soft leather, well polished, that came above his\nknees and required a string attached to his belt to keep them up.  The\nlight hearted fellow gloried in these shining encasements of his well\nshaped legs, and told Philip that they were a perfect protection against\nprairie rattle-snakes, which never strike above the knee.\n\nThe landscape still wore an almost wintry appearance when our travelers\nleft Chicago.  It was a genial spring day when they landed at St. Louis;\nthe birds were singing, the blossoms of peach trees in city garden plots,\nmade the air sweet, and in the roar and tumult on the long river levee\nthey found an excitement that accorded with their own hopeful\nanticipations.\n\nThe party went to the Southern Hotel, where the great Duff Brown was very\nwell known, and indeed was a man of so much importance that even the\noffice clerk was respectful to him.  He might have respected in him also\na certain vulgar swagger and insolence of money, which the clerk greatly\nadmired.\n\nThe young fellows liked the house and liked the city; it seemed to them a\nmighty free and hospitable town.  Coming from the East they were struck\nwith many peculiarities.  Everybody smoked in the streets, for one thing,\nthey noticed; everybody \"took a drink\" in an open manner whenever he\nwished to do so or was asked, as if the habit needed no concealment or\napology.  In the evening when they walked about they found people sitting\non the door-steps of their dwellings, in a manner not usual in a northern\ncity; in front of some of the hotels and saloons the side walks were\nfilled with chairs and benches--Paris fashion, said Harry--upon which\npeople lounged in these warm spring evenings, smoking, always smoking;\nand the clink of glasses and of billiard balls was in the air.  It was\ndelightful.\n\nHarry at once found on landing that his back-woods custom would not be\nneeded in St. Louis, and that, in fact, he had need of all the resources\nof his wardrobe to keep even with the young swells of the town.  But this\ndid not much matter, for Harry was always superior to his clothes.\nAs they were likely to be detained some time in the city, Harry told\nPhilip that he was going to improve his time.  And he did.  It was an\nencouragement to any industrious man to see this young fellow rise,\ncarefully dress himself, eat his breakfast deliberately, smoke his cigar\ntranquilly, and then repair to his room, to what he called his work, with\na grave and occupied manner, but with perfect cheerfulness.\n\nHarry would take off his coat, remove his cravat, roll up his\nshirt-sleeves, give his curly hair the right touch before the glass, get\nout his book on engineering, his boxes of instruments, his drawing paper,\nhis profile paper, open the book of logarithms, mix his India ink,\nsharpen his pencils, light a cigar, and sit down at the table to \"lay out\na line,\" with the most grave notion that he was mastering the details of\nengineering.  He would spend half a day in these preparations without\never working out a problem or having the faintest conception of the use\nof lines or logarithms.  And when he had finished, he had the most\ncheerful confidence that he had done a good day's work.\n\nIt made no difference, however, whether Harry was in his room in a hotel\nor in a tent, Philip soon found, he was just the same.  In camp he would\nget himself, up in the most elaborate toilet at his command, polish his\nlong boots to the top, lay out his work before him, and spend an hour or\nlonger, if anybody was looking at him, humming airs, knitting his brows,\nand \"working\" at engineering; and if a crowd of gaping rustics were\nlooking on all the while it was perfectly satisfactory to him.\n\n\"You see,\" he says to Philip one morning at the hotel when he was thus\nengaged, \"I want to get the theory of this thing, so that I can have a\ncheck on the engineers.\"\n\n\"I thought you were going to be an engineer yourself,\"  queried Philip.\n\n\"Not many times, if the court knows herself.  There's better game.  Brown\nand Schaick have, or will have, the control for the whole line of the\nSalt Lick Pacific Extension, forty thousand dollars a mile over the\nprairie, with extra for hard-pan--and it'll be pretty much all hardpan\nI can tell you; besides every alternate section of land on this line.\nThere's millions in the job.  I'm to have the sub-contract for the first\nfifty miles, and you can bet it's a soft thing.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what you do, Philip,\" continued Larry, in a burst of\ngenerosity, \"if I don't get you into my contract, you'll be with the\nengineers, and you jest stick a stake at the first ground marked for a\ndepot, buy the land of the farmer before he knows where the depot will\nbe, and we'll turn a hundred or so on that.  I'll advance the money for\nthe payments, and you can sell the lots.  Schaick is going to let me have\nten thousand just for a flyer in such operations.\"\n\n\"But that's a good deal of money.\"\n\n\"Wait till you are used to handling money.  I didn't come out here for a\nbagatelle.  My uncle wanted me to stay East and go in on the Mobile\ncustom house, work up the Washington end of it; he said there was a\nfortune in it for a smart young fellow, but I preferred to take the\nchances out here.  Did I tell you I had an offer from Bobbett and Fanshaw\nto go into their office as confidential clerk on a salary of ten\nthousand?\"\n\n\"Why didn't you take it ?\" asked Philip, to whom a salary of two thousand\nwould have seemed wealth, before he started on this journey.\n\n\"Take it?  I'd rather operate on my own hook;\" said Harry, in his most\nairy manner.\n\nA few evenings after their arrival at the Southern, Philip and Harry made\nthe acquaintance of a very agreeable gentleman, whom they had frequently\nseen before about the hotel corridors, and passed a casual word with.  He\nhad the air of a man of business, and was evidently a person of\nimportance.\n\nThe precipitating of this casual intercourse into the more substantial\nform of an acquaintanceship was the work of the gentleman himself, and\noccurred in this wise.  Meeting the two friends in the lobby one evening,\nhe asked them to give him the time, and added:\n\n\"Excuse me, gentlemen--strangers in St. Louis?  Ah, yes-yes.  From the\nEast, perhaps?  Ah; just so, just so.  Eastern born myself--Virginia.\nSellers is my name--Beriah Sellers.\n\n\"Ah! by the way--New York, did you say?  That reminds me; just met some\ngentlemen from your State, a week or two ago--very prominent gentlemen\n--in public life they are; you must know them, without doubt.  Let me see\n--let me see.  Curious those names have escaped me.  I know they were from\nyour State, because I remember afterward my old friend Governor Shackleby\nsaid to me--fine man, is the Governor--one of the finest men our country\nhas produced--said he, 'Colonel, how did you like those New York\ngentlemen?--not many such men in the world,--Colonel Sellers,' said the\nGovernor--yes, it was New York he said--I remember it distinctly.\nI can't recall those names, somehow.  But no matter.  Stopping here,\ngentlemen--stopping at the Southern?\"\n\nIn shaping their reply in their minds, the title \"Mr.\" had a place in it;\nbut when their turn had arrived to speak, the title \"Colonel\" came from\ntheir lips instead.\n\nThey said yes, they were abiding at the Southern, and thought it a very\ngood house.\n\n\"Yes, yes, the Southern is fair.  I myself go to the Planter's, old,\naristocratic house.  We Southern gentlemen don't change our ways, you\nknow.  I always make it my home there when I run down from Hawkeye--my\nplantation is in Hawkeye, a little up in the country.  You should know\nthe Planter's.\"\n\nPhilip and Harry both said they should like to see a hotel that had been\nso famous in its day--a cheerful hostelrie, Philip said it must have been\nwhere duels were fought there across the dining-room table.\n\n\"You may believe it, sir, an uncommonly pleasant lodging.  Shall we\nwalk?\"\n\nAnd the three strolled along the streets, the Colonel talking all\nthe way in the most liberal and friendly manner, and with a frank\nopen-heartedness that inspired confidence.\n\n\"Yes, born East myself, raised all along, know the West--a great country,\ngentlemen.  The place for a young fellow of spirit to pick up a fortune,\nsimply pick it up, it's lying round loose here.  Not a day that I don't\nput aside an opportunity; too busy to look into it.  Management of my own\nproperty takes my time.  First visit?  Looking for an opening?\"\n\n\"Yes, looking around,\" replied Harry.\n\n\"Ah, here we are.  You'd rather sit here in front than go to my\napartments?  So had I. An opening eh?\"\n\nThe Colonel's eyes twinkled.  \"Ah, just so.  The country is opening up,\nall we want is capital to develop it.  Slap down the rails and bring the\nland into market.  The richest land on God Almighty's footstool is lying\nright out there.  If I had my capital free I could plant it for\nmillions.\"\n\n\"I suppose your capital is largely in your plantation?\" asked Philip.\n\n\"Well, partly, sir, partly.  I'm down here now with reference to a little\noperation--a little side thing merely.  By the way gentlemen, excuse the\nliberty, but it's about my usual time\"--\n\nThe Colonel paused, but as no movement of his acquaintances followed this\nplain remark, he added, in an explanatory manner,\n\n\"I'm rather particular about the exact time--have to be in this climate.\"\n\nEven this open declaration of his hospitable intention not being\nunderstood the Colonel politely said,\n\n\"Gentlemen, will you take something?\"\n\nCol. Sellers led the way to a saloon on Fourth street under the hotel,\nand the young gentlemen fell into the custom of the country.\n\n\"Not that,\" said the Colonel to the bar-keeper, who shoved along the\ncounter a bottle of apparently corn-whiskey, as if he had done it before\non the same order; \"not that,\" with a wave of the hand.  \"That Otard if\nyou please.  Yes.  Never take an inferior liquor, gentlemen, not in the\nevening, in this climate.  There.  That's the stuff.  My respects!\"\n\nThe hospitable gentleman, having disposed of his liquor, remarking that\nit was not quite the thing--\"when a man has his own cellar to go to, he\nis apt to get a little fastidious about his liquors\"--called for cigars.\nBut the brand offered did not suit him; he motioned the box away, and\nasked for some particular Havana's, those in separate wrappers.\n\n\"I always smoke this sort, gentlemen; they are a little more expensive,\nbut you'll learn, in this climate, that you'd better not economize on\npoor cigars\"\n\nHaving imparted this valuable piece of information, the Colonel lighted\nthe fragrant cigar with satisfaction, and then carelessly put his fingers\ninto his right vest pocket.  That movement being without result, with a\nshade of disappointment on his face, he felt in his left vest pocket.\nNot finding anything there, he looked up with a serious and annoyed air,\nanxiously slapped his right pantaloon's pocket, and then his left, and\nexclaimed,\n\n\"By George, that's annoying.  By George, that's mortifying.  Never had\nanything of that kind happen to me before.  I've left my pocket-book.\nHold!  Here's a bill, after all.  No, thunder, it's a receipt.\"\n\n\"Allow me,\" said Philip, seeing how seriously the Colonel was annoyed,\nand taking out his purse.\n\nThe Colonel protested he couldn't think of it, and muttered something to\nthe barkeeper about \"hanging it up,\" but the vender of exhilaration made\nno sign, and Philip had the privilege of paying the costly shot; Col.\nSellers profusely apologizing and claiming the right \"next time, next\ntime.\"\n\nAs soon as Beriah Sellers had bade his friends good night and seen them\ndepart, he did not retire apartments in the Planter's, but took his way\nto his lodgings with a friend in a distant part of the city.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nThe letter that Philip Sterling wrote to Ruth Bolton, on the evening of\nsetting out to seek his fortune in the west, found that young lady in her\nown father's house in Philadelphia.  It was one of the pleasantest of the\nmany charming suburban houses in that hospitable city, which is\nterritorially one of the largest cities in the world, and only prevented\nfrom becoming the convenient metropolis of the country by the intrusive\nstrip of Camden and Amboy sand which shuts it off from the Atlantic\nocean.  It is a city of steady thrift, the arms of which might well be\nthe deliberate but delicious terrapin that imparts such a royal flavor to\nits feasts.\n\nIt was a spring morning, and perhaps it was the influence of it that made\nRuth a little restless, satisfied neither with the out-doors nor the\nin-doors.  Her sisters had gone to the city to show some country visitors\nIndependence Hall, Girard College and Fairmount Water Works and Park,\nfour objects which Americans cannot die peacefully, even in Naples,\nwithout having seen.  But Ruth confessed that she was tired of them, and\nalso of the Mint.  She was tired of other things.  She tried this morning\nan air or two upon the piano, sang a simple song in a sweet but slightly\nmetallic voice, and then seating herself by the open window, read\nPhilip's letter.  Was she thinking about Philip, as she gazed across the\nfresh lawn over the tree tops to the Chelton Hills, or of that world\nwhich his entrance, into her tradition-bound life had been one of the\nmeans of opening to her?  Whatever she thought, she was not idly musing,\nas one might see by the expression of her face.  After a time she took\nup a book; it was a medical work, and to all appearance about as\ninteresting to a girl of eighteen as the statutes at large; but her face\nwas soon aglow over its pages, and she was so absorbed in it that she did\nnot notice the entrance of her mother at the open door.\n\n\"Ruth?\"\n\n\"Well, mother,\" said the young student, looking up, with a shade of\nimpatience.\n\n\"I wanted to talk with thee a little about thy plans.\"\n\n\"Mother; thee knows I couldn't stand it at Westfield; the school stifled\nme, it's a place to turn young people into dried fruit.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Margaret Bolton, with a half anxious smile, thee chafes\nagainst all the ways of Friends, but what will thee do?  Why is thee so\ndiscontented?\"\n\n\"If I must say it, mother, I want to go away, and get out of this dead\nlevel.\"\n\nWith a look half of pain and half of pity, her mother answered, \"I am\nsure thee is little interfered with; thee dresses as thee will, and goes\nwhere thee pleases, to any church thee likes, and thee has music.  I had\na visit yesterday from the society's committee by way of discipline,\nbecause we have a piano in the house, which is against the rules.\"\n\n\"I hope thee told the elders that father and I are responsible for the\npiano, and that, much as thee loves music, thee is never in the room when\nit is played.  Fortunately father is already out of meeting, so they\ncan't discipline him.  I heard father tell cousin Abner that he was\nwhipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined\nto have what compensation he could get now.\"\n\n\"Thy ways greatly try me, Ruth, and all thy relations.  I desire thy\nhappiness first of all, but thee is starting out on a dangerous path.\nIs thy father willing thee should go away to a school of the world's\npeople?\"\n\n\"I have not asked him,\" Ruth replied with a look that might imply that\nshe was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her own\nmind and then compelled others to make up theirs in accordance with hers.\n\n\"And when thee has got the education thee wants, and lost all relish for\nthe society of thy friends and the ways of thy ancestors, what then?\"\n\nRuth turned square round to her mother, and with an impassive face and\nnot the slightest change of tone, said,\n\n\"Mother, I'm going to study medicine?\"\n\nMargaret Bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity.\n\n\"Thee, study medicine!  A slight frail girl like thee, study medicine!\nDoes thee think thee could stand it six months?  And the lectures,\nand the dissecting rooms, has thee thought of the dissecting rooms?\"\n\n\"Mother,\" said Ruth calmly, \"I have thought it all over.  I know I can go\nthrough the whole, clinics, dissecting room and all.  Does thee think I\nlack nerve?  What is there to fear in a person dead more than in a person\nliving?\"\n\n\"But thy health and strength, child; thee can never stand the severe\napplication.  And, besides, suppose thee does learn medicine?\"\n\n\"I will practice it.\"\n\n\"Here?\"\n\n\"Here.\"\n\n\"Where thee and thy family are known?\"\n\n\"If I can get patients.\"\n\n\"I hope at least, Ruth, thee will let us know when thee opens an office,\"\nsaid her mother, with an approach to sarcasm that she rarely indulged in,\nas she rose and left the room.\n\nRuth sat quite still for a tine, with face intent and flushed.  It was\nout now.  She had begun her open battle.\n\nThe sight-seers returned in high spirits from the city.  Was there any\nbuilding in Greece to compare with Girard College, was there ever such a\nmagnificent pile of stone devised for the shelter of poor orphans?  Think\nof the stone shingles of the roof eight inches thick!  Ruth asked the\nenthusiasts if they would like to live in such a sounding mausoleum, with\nits great halls and echoing rooms, and no comfortable place in it for the\naccommodation of any body?  If they were orphans, would they like to be\nbrought up in a Grecian temple?\n\nAnd then there was Broad street!  Wasn't it the broadest and the longest\nstreet in the world?  There certainly was no end to it, and even Ruth was\nPhiladelphian enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end,\nor architectural point upon which the weary eye could rest.\n\nBut neither St. Girard, nor Broad street, neither wonders of the Mint nor\nthe glories of the Hall where the ghosts of our fathers sit always\nsigning the Declaration; impressed the visitors so much as the splendors\nof the Chestnut street windows, and the bargains on Eighth street.\nThe truth is that the country cousins had come to town to attend the\nYearly Meeting, and the amount of shopping that preceded that religious\nevent was scarcely exceeded by the preparations for the opera in more\nworldly circles.\n\n\"Is thee going to the Yearly Meeting, Ruth?\" asked one of the girls.\n\n\"I have nothing to wear,\" replied that demure person.  \"If thee wants to\nsee new bonnets, orthodox to a shade and conformed to the letter of the\ntrue form, thee must go to the Arch Street Meeting.  Any departure from\neither color or shape would be instantly taken note of.  It has occupied\nmother a long time, to find at the shops the exact shade for her new\nbonnet.  Oh, thee must go by all means.  But thee won't see there a\nsweeter woman than mother.\"\n\n\"And thee won't go?\"\n\n\"Why should I?  I've been again and again.  If I go to Meeting at all I\nlike best to sit in the quiet old house in Germantown, where the windows\nare all open and I can see the trees, and hear the stir of the leaves.\nIt's such a crush at the Yearly Meeting at Arch Street, and then there's\nthe row of sleek-looking young men who line the curbstone and stare at us\nas we come out.  No, I don't feel at home there.\"\n\nThat evening Ruth and her father sat late by the drawing-room fire, as\nthey were quite apt to do at night.  It was always a time of confidences.\n\n\"Thee has another letter from young Sterling,\" said Eli Bolton.\n\n\"Yes.  Philip has gone to the far west.\"\n\n\"How far?\"\n\n\"He doesn't say, but it's on the frontier, and on the map everything\nbeyond it is marked 'Indians' and 'desert,' and looks as desolate as a\nWednesday Meeting.\"\n\n\"Humph.  It was time for him to do something.  Is he going to start a\ndaily newspaper among the Kick-a-poos?\"\n\n\"Father, thee's unjust to Philip.  He's going into business.\"\n\n\"What sort of business can a young man go into without capital?\"\n\n\"He doesn't say exactly what it is,\" said Ruth a little dubiously, \"but\nit's something about land and railroads, and thee knows, father, that\nfortunes are made nobody knows exactly how, in a new country.\"\n\n\"I should think so, you innocent puss, and in an old one too.  But Philip\nis honest, and he has talent enough, if he will stop scribbling, to make\nhis way.  But thee may as well take care of theeself, Ruth, and not go\ndawdling along with a young man in his adventures, until thy own mind is\na little more settled what thee wants.\"\n\nThis excellent advice did not seem to impress Ruth greatly, for she was\nlooking away with that abstraction of vision which often came into her\ngrey eyes, and at length she exclaimed, with a sort of impatience,\n\n\"I wish I could go west, or south, or somewhere.  What a box women are\nput into, measured for it, and put in young; if we go anywhere it's in a\nbox, veiled and pinioned and shut in by disabilities.  Father, I should\nlike to break things and get loose!\"\n\nWhat a sweet-voiced little innocent, it was to be sure.\n\n\"Thee will no doubt break things enough when thy time comes, child; women\nalways have; but what does thee want now that thee hasn't?\"\n\n\"I want to be something, to make myself something, to do something.  Why\nshould I rust, and be stupid, and sit in inaction because I am a girl?\nWhat would happen to me if thee should lose thy property and die?  What\none useful thing could I do for a living, for the support of mother and\nthe children?  And if I had a fortune, would thee want me to lead a\nuseless life?\"\n\n\"Has thy mother led a useless life?\"\n\n\"Somewhat that depends upon whether her children amount to anything,\"\nretorted the sharp little disputant.  \"What's the good, father, of a\nseries of human beings who don't advance any?\"\n\nFriend Eli, who had long ago laid aside the Quaker dress, and was out of\nMeeting, and who in fact after a youth of doubt could not yet define his\nbelief, nevertheless looked with some wonder at this fierce young eagle\nof his, hatched in a Friend's dove-cote.  But he only said,\n\n\"Has thee consulted thy mother about a career, I suppose it is a career\nthee wants?\"\n\nRuth did not reply directly; she complained that her mother didn't\nunderstand her.  But that wise and placid woman understood the sweet\nrebel a great deal better than Ruth understood herself.  She also had a\nhistory, possibly, and had sometime beaten her young wings against the\ncage of custom, and indulged in dreams of a new social order, and had\npassed through that fiery period when it seems possible for one mind,\nwhich has not yet tried its limits, to break up and re-arrange the world.\n\nRuth replied to Philip's letter in due time and in the most cordial and\nunsentimental manner.  Philip liked the letter, as he did everything she\ndid; but he had a dim notion that there was more about herself in the\nletter than about him.  He took it with him from the Southern Hotel, when\nhe went to walk, and read it over and again in an unfrequented street as\nhe stumbled along. The rather common-place and unformed hand-writing\nseemed to him peculiar and characteristic, different from that of any\nother woman.\n\nRuth was glad to hear that Philip had made a push into the world, and she\nwas sure that his talent and courage would make a way for him.  She\nshould pray for his success at any rate, and especially that the Indians,\nin St. Louis, would not take his scalp.\n\nPhilip looked rather dubious at this sentence, and wished that he had\nwritten nothing about Indians.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nEli Bolton and his wife talked over Ruth's case, as they had often done\nbefore, with no little anxiety.  Alone of all their children she was\nimpatient of the restraints and monotony of the Friends' Society, and\nwholly indisposed to accept the \"inner light\" as a guide into a life of\nacceptance and inaction.  When Margaret told her husband of Ruth's newest\nproject, he did not exhibit so much surprise as she hoped for.  In fact\nhe said that he did not see why a woman should not enter the medical\nprofession if she felt a call to it.\n\n\"But,\" said Margaret, \"consider her total inexperience of the world, and\nher frail health.  Can such a slight little body endure the ordeal of the\npreparation for, or the strain of, the practice of the profession?\"\n\n\"Did thee ever think, Margaret, whether, she can endure being thwarted in\nan, object on which she has so set her heart, as she has on this?  Thee\nhas trained her thyself at home, in her enfeebled childhood, and thee\nknows how strong her will is, and what she has been able to accomplish in\nself-culture by the simple force of her determination.  She never will be\nsatisfied until she has tried her own strength.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" said Margaret, with an inconsequence that is not exclusively\nfeminine, \"that she were in the way to fall in love and marry by and by.\nI think that would cure her of some of her notions.  I am not sure but if\nshe went away, to some distant school, into an entirely new life, her\nthoughts would be diverted.\"\n\nEli Bolton almost laughed as he regarded his wife, with eyes that never\nlooked at her except fondly, and replied,\n\n\"Perhaps thee remembers that thee had notions also, before we were\nmarried, and before thee became a member of Meeting.  I think Ruth comes\nhonestly by certain tendencies which thee has hidden under the Friend's\ndress.\"\n\nMargaret could not say no to this, and while she paused, it was evident\nthat memory was busy with suggestions to shake her present opinions.\n\n\"Why not let Ruth try the study for a time,\" suggested Eli; \"there is a\nfair beginning of a Woman's Medical College in the city.  Quite likely\nshe will soon find that she needs first a more general culture, and fall,\nin with thy wish that she should see more of the world at some large\nschool.\"\n\nThere really seemed to be nothing else to be done, and Margaret consented\nat length without approving.  And it was agreed that Ruth, in order to\nspare her fatigue, should take lodgings with friends near the college and\nmake a trial in the pursuit of that science to which we all owe our\nlives, and sometimes as by a miracle of escape.\n\nThat day Mr. Bolton brought home a stranger to dinner, Mr. Bigler of the\ngreat firm of Pennybacker, Bigler & Small, railroad contractors.  He was\nalways bringing home somebody, who had a scheme; to build a road, or open\na mine, or plant a swamp with cane to grow paper-stock, or found a\nhospital, or invest in a patent shad-bone separator, or start a college\nsomewhere on the frontier, contiguous to a land speculation.\n\nThe Bolton house was a sort of hotel for this kind of people.  They were\nalways coming.  Ruth had known them from childhood, and she used to say\nthat her father attracted them as naturally as a sugar hogshead does\nflies.  Ruth had an idea that a large portion of the world lived by\ngetting the rest of the world into schemes.  Mr. Bolton never could say\n\"no\" to any of them, not even, said Ruth again, to the society for\nstamping oyster shells with scripture texts before they were sold at\nretail.\n\nMr. Bigler's plan this time, about which he talked loudly, with his mouth\nfull, all dinner time, was the building of the Tunkhannock, Rattlesnake\nand Young-womans-town railroad, which would not only be a great highway to\nthe west, but would open to market inexhaustible coal-fields and untold\nmillions of lumber.  The plan of operations was very simple.\n\n\"We'll buy the lands,\" explained he, \"on long time, backed by the notes\nof good men; and then mortgage them for money enough to get the road well\non.  Then get the towns on the line to issue their bonds for stock, and\nsell their bonds for enough to complete the road, and partly stock it,\nespecially if we mortgage each section as we complete it.  We can then\nsell the rest of the stock on the prospect of the business of the road\nthrough an improved country, and also sell the lands at a big advance,\non the strength of the road.  All we want,\" continued Mr. Bigler in his\nfrank manner, \"is a few thousand dollars to start the surveys, and\narrange things in the legislature.  There is some parties will have to be\nseen, who might make us trouble.\"\n\n\"It will take a good deal of money to start the enterprise,\" remarked Mr.\nBolton, who knew very well what \"seeing\" a Pennsylvania Legislature\nmeant, but was too polite to tell Mr. Bigler what he thought of him,\nwhile he was his guest; \"what security would one have for it?\"\n\nMr. Bigler smiled a hard kind of smile, and said, \"You'd be inside, Mr.\nBolton, and you'd have the first chance in the deal.\"\n\nThis was rather unintelligible to Ruth, who was nevertheless somewhat\namused by the study of a type of character she had seen before.\nAt length she interrupted the conversation by asking,\n\n\"You'd sell the stock, I suppose, Mr. Bigler, to anybody who was\nattracted by the prospectus?\"\n\n\"O, certainly, serve all alike,\" said Mr. Bigler, now noticing Ruth for\nthe first time, and a little puzzled by the serene, intelligent face that\nwas turned towards him.\n\n\"Well, what would become of the poor people who had been led to put their\nlittle money into the speculation, when you got out of it and left it\nhalf way?\"\n\nIt would be no more true to say of Mr. Bigler that he was or could be\nembarrassed, than to say that a brass counterfeit dollar-piece would\nchange color when refused; the question annoyed him a little, in Mr.\nBolton's presence.\n\n\"Why, yes, Miss, of course, in a great enterprise for the benefit of the\ncommunity there will little things occur, which, which--and, of course,\nthe poor ought to be looked to; I tell my wife, that the poor must be\nlooked to; if you can tell who are poor--there's so many impostors.  And\nthen, there's so many poor in the legislature to be looked after,\" said\nthe contractor with a sort of a chuckle, \"isn't that so, Mr. Bolton?\"\n\nEli Bolton replied that he never had much to do with the legislature.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued this public benefactor, \"an uncommon poor lot this year,\nuncommon.  Consequently an expensive lot.  The fact is, Mr. Bolton, that\nthe price is raised so high on United States Senator now, that it affects\nthe whole market; you can't get any public improvement through on\nreasonable terms.  Simony is what I call it, Simony,\" repeated Mr.\nBigler, as if he had said a good thing.\n\nMr. Bigler went on and gave some very interesting details of the intimate\nconnection between railroads and politics, and thoroughly entertained\nhimself all dinner time, and as much disgusted Ruth, who asked no more\nquestions, and her father who replied in monosyllables:\n\n\"I wish,\" said Ruth to her father, after the guest had gone, \"that you\nwouldn't bring home any more such horrid men.  Do all men who wear big\ndiamond breast-pins, flourish their knives at table, and use bad grammar,\nand cheat?\"\n\n\"O, child, thee mustn't be too observing.  Mr. Bigler is one of the most\nimportant men in the state; nobody has more influence at Harrisburg.\nI don't like him any more than thee does, but I'd better lend him a\nlittle money than to have his ill will.\"\n\n\"Father, I think thee'd better have his ill-will than his company.  Is it\ntrue that he gave money to help build the pretty little church of\nSt. James the Less, and that he is, one of the vestrymen?\"\n\n\"Yes.  He is not such a bad fellow.  One of the men in Third street asked\nhim the other day, whether his was a high church or a low church?  Bigler\nsaid he didn't know; he'd been in it once, and he could touch the ceiling\nin the side aisle with his hand.\"\n\n\"I think he's just horrid,\" was Ruth's final summary of him, after the\nmanner of the swift judgment of women, with no consideration of the\nextenuating circumstances.  Mr. Bigler had no idea that he had not made a\ngood impression on the whole family; he certainly intended to be\nagreeable.  Margaret agreed with her daughter, and though she never said\nanything to such people, she was grateful to Ruth for sticking at least\none pin into him.\n\nSuch was the serenity of the Bolton household that a stranger in it would\nnever have suspected there was any opposition to Ruth's going to the\nMedical School.  And she went quietly to take her residence in town, and\nbegan her attendance of the lectures, as if it were the most natural\nthing in the world.  She did not heed, if she heard, the busy and\nwondering gossip of relations and acquaintances, gossip that has no less\ncurrency among the Friends than elsewhere because it is whispered slyly\nand creeps about in an undertone.\n\nRuth was absorbed, and for the first time in her life thoroughly happy;\nhappy in the freedom of her life, and in the keen enjoyment of the\ninvestigation that broadened its field day by day.  She was in high\nspirits when she came home to spend First Days; the house was full of her\ngaiety and her merry laugh, and the children wished that Ruth would never\ngo away again.  But her mother noticed, with a little anxiety, the\nsometimes flushed face, and the sign of an eager spirit in the kindling\neyes, and, as well, the serious air of determination and endurance in her\nface at unguarded moments.\n\nThe college was a small one and it sustained itself not without\ndifficulty in this city, which is so conservative, and is yet the origin\nof so many radical movements.  There were not more than a dozen\nattendants on the lectures all together, so that the enterprise had the\nair of an experiment, and the fascination of pioneering for those engaged\nin it.  There was one woman physician driving about town in her carriage,\nattacking the most violent diseases in all quarters with persistent\ncourage, like a modern Bellona in her war chariot, who was popularly\nsupposed to gather in fees to the amount ten to twenty thousand dollars a\nyear.  Perhaps some of these students looked forward to the near day when\nthey would support such a practice and a husband besides, but it is\nunknown that any of them ever went further than practice in hospitals and\nin their own nurseries, and it is feared that some of them were quite as\nready as their sisters, in emergencies, to \"call a man.\"\n\nIf Ruth had any exaggerated expectations of a professional life, she kept\nthem to herself, and was known to her fellows of the class simply as a\ncheerful, sincere student, eager in her investigations, and never\nimpatient at anything, except an insinuation that women had not as much\nmental capacity for science as men.\n\n\"They really say,\" said one young Quaker sprig to another youth of his\nage, \"that Ruth Bolton is really going to be a saw-bones, attends\nlectures, cuts up bodies, and all that.  She's cool enough for a surgeon,\nanyway.\"  He spoke feelingly, for he had very likely been weighed in\nRuth's calm eyes sometime, and thoroughly scared by the little laugh that\naccompanied a puzzling reply to one of his conversational nothings.  Such\nyoung gentlemen, at this time, did not come very distinctly into Ruth's\nhorizon, except as amusing circumstances.\n\nAbout the details of her student life, Ruth said very little to her\nfriends, but they had reason to know, afterwards, that it required all\nher nerve and the almost complete exhaustion of her physical strength,\nto carry her through.  She began her anatomical practice upon detached\nportions of the human frame, which were brought into the demonstrating\nroom--dissecting the eye, the ear, and a small tangle of muscles and\nnerves--an occupation which had not much more savor of death in it than\nthe analysis of a portion of a plant out of which the life went when it\nwas plucked up by the roots.  Custom inures the most sensitive persons to\nthat which is at first most repellant; and in the late war we saw the\nmost delicate women, who could not at home endure the sight of blood,\nbecome so used to scenes of carnage, that they walked the hospitals and\nthe margins of battle-fields, amid the poor remnants of torn humanity,\nwith as perfect self-possession as if they were strolling in a flower\ngarden.\n\nIt happened that Ruth was one evening deep in a line of investigation\nwhich she could not finish or understand without demonstration, and so\neager was she in it, that it seemed as if she could not wait till the\nnext day.  She, therefore, persuaded a fellow student, who was reading\nthat evening with her, to go down to the dissecting room of the college,\nand ascertain what they wanted to know by an hour's work there.  Perhaps,\nalso, Ruth wanted to test her own nerve, and to see whether the power of\nassociation was stronger in her mind than her own will.\n\nThe janitor of the shabby and comfortless old building admitted the\ngirls, not without suspicion, and gave them lighted candles, which they\nwould need, without other remark than \"there's a new one, Miss,\" as the\ngirls went up the broad stairs.\n\nThey climbed to the third story, and paused before a door, which they\nunlocked, and which admitted them into a long apartment, with a row of\nwindows on one side and one at the end.  The room was without light, save\nfrom the stars and the candles the girls carried, which revealed to them\ndimly two long and several small tables, a few benches and chairs, a\ncouple of skeletons hanging on the wall, a sink, and cloth-covered heaps\nof something upon the tables here and there.\n\nThe windows were open, and the cool night wind came in strong enough to\nflutter a white covering now and then, and to shake the loose casements.\nBut all the sweet odors of the night could not take from the room a faint\nsuggestion of mortality.\n\nThe young ladies paused a moment.  The room itself was familiar enough,\nbut night makes almost any chamber eerie, and especially such a room of\ndetention as this where the mortal parts of the unburied might--almost be\nsupposed to be, visited, on the sighing night winds, by the wandering\nspirits of their late tenants.\n\nOpposite and at some distance across the roofs of lower buildings, the\ngirls saw a tall edifice, the long upper story of which seemed to be a\ndancing hall.  The windows of that were also open, and through them they\nheard the scream of the jiggered and tortured violin, and the pump, pump\nof the oboe, and saw the moving shapes of men and women in quick\ntransition, and heard the prompter's drawl.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Ruth, \"what the girls dancing there would think if they\nsaw us, or knew that there was such a room as this so near them.\"\n\nShe did not speak very loud, and, perhaps unconsciously, the girls drew\nnear to each other as they approached the long table in the centre of the\nroom.  A straight object lay upon it, covered with a sheet.  This was\ndoubtless \"the new one\" of which the janitor spoke.  Ruth advanced, and\nwith a not very steady hand lifted the white covering from the upper part\nof the figure and turned it down.  Both the girls started.  It was a\nnegro.  The black face seemed to defy the pallor of death, and asserted\nan ugly life-likeness that was frightful.\n\nRuth was as pale as the white sheet, and her comrade whispered, \"Come\naway, Ruth, it is awful.\"\n\nPerhaps it was the wavering light of the candles, perhaps it was only the\nagony from a death of pain, but the repulsive black face seemed to wear a\nscowl that said, \"Haven't you yet done with the outcast, persecuted black\nman, but you must now haul him from his grave, and send even your women\nto dismember his body?\"\n\nWho is this dead man, one of thousands who died yesterday, and will be\ndust anon, to protest that science shall not turn his worthless carcass\nto some account?\n\nRuth could have had no such thought, for with a pity in her sweet face,\nthat for the moment overcame fear and disgust, she reverently replaced\nthe covering, and went away to her own table, as her companion did to\nhers.  And there for an hour they worked at their several problems,\nwithout speaking, but not without an awe of the presence there, \"the new\none,\" and not without an awful sense of life itself, as they heard the\npulsations of the music and the light laughter from the dancing-hall.\n\nWhen, at length, they went away, and locked the dreadful room behind\nthem, and came out into the street, where people were passing, they, for\nthe first time, realized, in the relief they felt, what a nervous strain\nthey had been under.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nWhile Ruth was thus absorbed in her new occupation, and the spring was\nwearing away, Philip and his friends were still detained at the Southern\nHotel.  The great contractors had concluded their business with the state\nand railroad officials and with the lesser contractors, and departed for\nthe East.  But the serious illness of one of the engineers kept Philip\nand Henry in the city and occupied in alternate watchings.\n\nPhilip wrote to Ruth of the new acquaintance they had made, Col. Sellers,\nan enthusiastic and hospitable gentleman, very much interested in the\ndevelopment of the country, and in their success.  They had not had an\nopportunity to visit at his place \"up in the country\" yet, but the\nColonel often dined with them, and in confidence, confided to them his\nprojects, and seemed to take a great liking to them, especially to his\nfriend Harry.  It was true that he never seemed to have ready money,\nbut he was engaged in very large operations.\n\nThe correspondence was not very brisk between these two young persons,\nso differently occupied; for though Philip wrote long letters, he got\nbrief ones in reply, full of sharp little observations however, such as\none concerning Col. Sellers, namely, that such men dined at their house\nevery week.\n\nRuth's proposed occupation astonished Philip immensely, but while he\nargued it and discussed it, he did not dare hint to her his fear that it\nwould interfere with his most cherished plans.  He too sincerely\nrespected Ruth's judgment to make any protest, however, and he would have\ndefended her course against the world.\n\nThis enforced waiting at St. Louis was very irksome to Philip.  His money\nwas running away, for one thing, and he longed to get into the field,\nand see for himself what chance there was for a fortune or even an\noccupation.  The contractors had given the young men leave to join the\nengineer corps as soon as they could, but otherwise had made no provision\nfor them, and in fact had left them with only the most indefinite\nexpectations of something large in the future.\n\nHarry was entirely happy; in his circumstances.  He very soon knew\neverybody, from the governor of the state down to the waiters at the\nhotel.  He had the Wall street slang at his tongue's end; he always\ntalked like a capitalist, and entered with enthusiasm into all the land\nand railway schemes with which the air was thick.\n\nCol. Sellers and Harry talked together by the hour and by the day.  Harry\ninformed his new friend that he was going out with the engineer corps of\nthe Salt Lick Pacific Extension, but that wasn't his real business.\n\n\"I'm to have, with another party,\" said Harry, \"a big contract in the\nroad, as soon as it is let; and, meantime, I'm with the engineers to spy\nout the best land and the depot sites.\"\n\n\"It's everything,\" suggested' the Colonel, \"in knowing where to invest.\nI've known people throwaway their money because they  were too\nconsequential to take Sellers' advice.  Others, again, have made their\npile on taking it.  I've looked over the ground; I've been studying it\nfor twenty years.  You can't put your finger on a spot in the map of\nMissouri that I don't know as if I'd made it.  When you want to place\nanything,\" continued the Colonel, confidently, \"just let Beriah Sellers\nknow.  That's all.\"\n\n\"Oh, I haven't got much in ready money I can lay my hands on now, but if\na fellow could do anything with fifteen or twenty thousand dollars,\nas a beginning, I shall draw for that when I see the right opening.\"\n\n\"Well, that's something, that's something, fifteen or twenty thousand\ndollars, say twenty--as an advance,\" said the Colonel reflectively, as if\nturning over his mind for a project that could be entered on with such a\ntrifling sum.\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is--but only to you Mr. Brierly, only to you,\nmind; I've got a little project that I've been keeping.  It looks small,\nlooks small on paper, but it's got a big future.  What should you say,\nsir, to a city, built up like the rod of Aladdin had touched it, built up\nin two years, where now you wouldn't expect it any more than you'd expect\na light-house on the top of Pilot Knob? and you could own the land!  It\ncan be done, sir.  It can be done!\"\n\nThe Colonel hitched up his chair close to Harry, laid his hand on his\nknee, and, first looking about him, said in a low voice, \"The Salt Lick\nPacific Extension is going to run through Stone's Landing!  The Almighty\nnever laid out a cleaner piece of level prairie for a city; and it's the\nnatural center of all that region of hemp and tobacco.\"\n\n\"What makes you think the road will go there?  It's twenty miles, on the\nmap, off the straight line of the road?\"\n\n\"You can't tell what is the straight line till the engineers have been\nover it.  Between us, I have talked with Jeff Thompson, the division\nengineer.  He understands the wants of Stone's Landing, and the claims of\nthe inhabitants--who are to be there.  Jeff says that a railroad is for\n--the accommodation of the people and not for the benefit of gophers; and\nif, he don't run this to Stone's Landing he'll be damned!  You ought to\nknow Jeff; he's one of the most enthusiastic engineers in this western\ncountry, and one of the best fellows that ever looked through the bottom\nof a glass.\"\n\nThe recommendation was not undeserved.  There was nothing that Jeff\nwouldn't do, to accommodate a friend, from sharing his last dollar with\nhim, to winging him in a duel.  When he understood from Col. Sellers.\nhow the land lay at Stone's Landing, he cordially shook hands with that\ngentleman, asked him to drink, and fairly roared out, \"Why, God bless my\nsoul, Colonel, a word from one Virginia gentleman to another is 'nuff\nced.'  There's Stone's Landing been waiting for a railroad more than four\nthousand years, and damme if she shan't have it.\"\n\nPhilip had not so much faith as Harry in Stone's Landing, when the latter\nopened the project to him, but Harry talked about it as if he already\nowned that incipient city.\n\nHarry thoroughly believed in all his projects and inventions, and lived\nday by day in their golden atmosphere.  Everybody liked the young fellow,\nfor how could they help liking one of such engaging manners and large\nfortune?  The waiters at the hotel would do more for him than for any\nother guest, and he made a great many acquaintances among the people of\nSt. Louis, who liked his sensible and liberal views about the development\nof the western country, and about St. Louis.  He said it ought to be the\nnational capital.  Harry made partial arrangements with several of the\nmerchants for furnishing supplies for his contract on the Salt Lick\nPacific Extension; consulted the maps with the engineers, and went over\nthe profiles with the contractors, figuring out estimates for bids.\nHe was exceedingly busy with those things when he was not at the bedside\nof his sick acquaintance, or arranging the details of his speculation\nwith Col. Sellers.\n\nMeantime the days went along and the weeks, and the money in Harry's\npocket got lower and lower.  He was just as liberal with what he had as\nbefore, indeed it was his nature to be free with his money or with that\nof others, and he could lend or spend a dollar with an air that made it\nseem like ten.  At length, at the end of one week, when his hotel bill\nwas presented, Harry found not a cent in his pocket to meet it.  He\ncarelessly remarked to the landlord that he was not that day in funds,\nbut he would draw on New York, and he sat down and wrote to the\ncontractors in that city a glowing letter about the prospects of the\nroad, and asked them to advance a hundred or two, until he got at work.\nNo reply came.  He wrote again, in an unoffended business like tone,\nsuggesting that he had better draw at three days.  A short answer came to\nthis, simply saying that money was very tight in Wall street just then,\nand that he had better join the engineer corps as soon as he could.\n\nBut the bill had to be paid, and Harry took it to Philip, and asked him\nif he thought he hadn't better draw on his uncle.  Philip had not much\nfaith in Harry's power of \"drawing,\" and told him that he would pay the\nbill himself.  Whereupon Harry dismissed the matter then and thereafter\nfrom his thoughts, and, like a light-hearted good fellow as he was, gave\nhimself no more trouble about his board-bills.  Philip paid them, swollen\nas they were with a monstrous list of extras; but he seriously counted\nthe diminishing bulk of his own hoard, which was all the money he had in\nthe world.  Had he not tacitly agreed to share with Harry to the last in\nthis adventure, and would not the generous fellow divide; with him if he,\nPhilip, were in want and Harry had anything?\n\nThe fever at length got tired of tormenting the stout young engineer, who\nlay sick at the hotel, and left him, very thin, a little sallow but an\n\"acclimated\" man.  Everybody said he was \"acclimated\" now, and said it\ncheerfully.  What it is to be acclimated to western fevers no two persons\nexactly agree.\n\nSome say it is a sort of vaccination that renders death by some malignant\ntype of fever less probable.  Some regard it as a sort of initiation,\nlike that into the Odd Fellows, which renders one liable to his regular\ndues thereafter.  Others consider it merely the acquisition of a habit of\ntaking every morning before breakfast a dose of bitters, composed of\nwhiskey and assafoetida, out of the acclimation jug.\n\nJeff Thompson afterwards told Philip that he once asked Senator Atchison,\nthen acting Vice-President: of the United States, about the possibility\nof acclimation; he thought the opinion of the second officer of our great\ngovernment would be, valuable on this point.  They were sitting together\non a bench before a country tavern, in the free converse permitted by our\ndemocratic habits.\n\n\"I suppose, Senator, that you have become acclimated to this country?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Vice-President, crossing his legs, pulling his\nwide-awake down over his forehead, causing a passing chicken to hop\nquickly one side by the accuracy of his aim, and speaking with senatorial\ndeliberation, \"I think I have.  I've been here twenty-five years, and\ndash, dash my dash to dash, if I haven't entertained twenty-five separate\nand distinct earthquakes, one a year.  The niggro is the only person who\ncan stand the fever and ague of this region.\"\n\nThe convalescence of the engineer was the signal for breaking up quarters\nat St. Louis, and the young fortune-hunters started up the river in good\nspirits.  It was only the second time either of them had been upon a\nMississippi steamboat, and nearly everything they saw had the charm of\nnovelty.  Col. Sellers was at the landing to bid thorn good-bye.\n\n\"I shall send you up that basket of champagne by the next boat; no, no;\nno thanks; you'll find it not bad in camp,\" he cried out as the plank was\nhauled in.  \"My respects to Thompson.  Tell him to sight for Stone's.\nLet me know, Mr. Brierly, when you are ready to locate; I'll come over\nfrom Hawkeye.  Goodbye.\"\n\nAnd the last the young fellows saw of the Colonel, he was waving his hat,\nand beaming prosperity and good luck.\n\nThe voyage was delightful, and was not long enough to become monotonous.\nThe travelers scarcely had time indeed to get accustomed to the splendors\nof the great saloon where the tables were spread for meals, a marvel of\npaint and gilding, its ceiling hung with fancifully cut tissue-paper of\nmany colors, festooned and arranged in endless patterns.  The whole was\nmore beautiful than a barber's shop.  The printed bill of fare at dinner\nwas longer and more varied, the proprietors justly boasted, than that of\nany hotel in New York.  It must have been the work of an author of talent\nand imagination, and it surely was not his fault if the dinner itself was\nto a certain extent a delusion, and if the guests got something that\ntasted pretty much the same whatever dish they ordered; nor was it his\nfault if a general flavor of rose in all the dessert dishes suggested\nthat they hid passed through the barber's saloon on their way from the\nkitchen.\n\nThe travelers landed at a little settlement on the left bank, and at once\ntook horses for the camp in the interior, carrying their clothes and\nblankets strapped behind the saddles.  Harry was dressed as we have seen\nhim once before, and his long and shining boots attracted not a little\nthe attention of the few persons they met on the road, and especially of\nthe bright faced wenches who lightly stepped along the highway,\npicturesque in their colored kerchiefs, carrying light baskets, or riding\nupon mules and balancing before them a heavier load.\n\nHarry sang fragments of operas and talked abort their fortune.  Philip\neven was excited by the sense of freedom and adventure, and the beauty of\nthe landscape.  The prairie, with its new grass and unending acres of\nbrilliant flowers--chiefly the innumerable varieties of phlox-bore the\nlook of years of cultivation, and the occasional open groves of white\noaks gave it a park-like appearance.  It was hardly unreasonable to\nexpect to see at any moment, the gables and square windows of an\nElizabethan mansion in one of the well kept groves.\n\nTowards sunset of the third day, when the young gentlemen thought they\nought to be near the town of Magnolia, near which they had been directed\nto find the engineers' camp, they descried a log house and drew up before\nit to enquire the way.  Half the building was store, and half was\ndwelling house.  At the door of the latter stood a regress with a bright\nturban on her head, to whom Philip called,\n\n\"Can you tell me, auntie, how far it is to the town of Magnolia?\"\n\n\"Why, bress you chile,\" laughed the woman, \"you's dere now.\"\n\nIt was true.  This log horse was the compactly built town, and all\ncreation was its suburbs.  The engineers' camp was only two or three\nmiles distant.\n\n\"You's boun' to find it,\" directed auntie, \"if you don't keah nuffin\n'bout de road, and go fo' de sun-down.\"\n\nA brisk gallop brought the riders in sight of the twinkling light of the\ncamp, just as the stars came out.  It lay in a little hollow, where a\nsmall stream ran through a sparse grove of young white oaks.  A half\ndozen tents were pitched under the trees, horses and oxen were corraled\nat a little distance, and a group of men sat on camp stools or lay on\nblankets about a bright fire.  The twang of a banjo became audible as\nthey drew nearer, and they saw a couple of negroes, from some neighboring\nplantation, \"breaking down\" a juba in approved style, amid the \"hi, hi's\"\nof the spectators.\n\nMr. Jeff Thompson, for it was the camp of this redoubtable engineer, gave\nthe travelers a hearty welcome, offered them ground room in his own tent,\nordered supper, and set out a small jug, a drop from which he declared\nnecessary on account of the chill of the evening.\n\n\"I never saw an Eastern man,\" said Jeff, \"who knew how to drink from a\njug with one hand.  It's as easy as lying.  So.\"  He grasped the handle\nwith the right hand, threw the jug back upon his arm, and applied his\nlips to the nozzle.  It was an act as graceful as it was simple.\n\"Besides,\" said Mr. Thompson, setting it down, \"it puts every man on his\nhonor as to quantity.\"\n\nEarly to turn in was the rule of the camp, and by nine o'clock everybody\nwas under his blanket, except Jeff himself, who worked awhile at his\ntable over his field-book, and then arose, stepped outside the tent door\nand sang, in a strong and not unmelodious tenor, the Star Spangled Banner\nfrom beginning to end.  It proved to be his nightly practice to let off\nthe unexpended seam of his conversational powers, in the words of this\nstirring song.\n\nIt was a long time before Philip got to sleep.  He saw the fire light,\nhe saw the clear stars through the tree-tops, he heard the gurgle of the\nstream, the stamp of the horses, the occasional barking of the dog which\nfollowed the cook's wagon, the hooting of an owl; and when these failed\nhe saw Jeff, standing on a battlement, mid the rocket's red glare, and\nheard him sing, \"Oh, say, can you see?\", It was the first time he had\never slept on the ground.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n         ----\"We have view'd it,\n          And measur'd it within all, by the scale\n          The richest tract of land, love, in the kingdom!\n          There will be made seventeen or eighteeen millions,\n          Or more, as't may be handled!\"\n                              The Devil is an Ass.\n\nNobody dressed more like an engineer than Mr. Henry Brierly.  The\ncompleteness of his appointments was the envy of the corps, and the gay\nfellow himself was the admiration of the camp servants, axemen, teamsters\nand cooks.\n\n\"I reckon you didn't git them boots no wher's this side o' Sent Louis?\"\nqueried the tall Missouri youth who acted as commissariy's assistant.\n\n\"No, New York.\"\n\n\"Yas, I've heern o' New York,\" continued the butternut lad, attentively\nstudying each item of Harry's dress, and endeavoring to cover his design\nwith interesting conversation.  \"'N there's Massachusetts.\",\n\n\"It's not far off.\"\n\n\"I've heern Massachusetts was a-----of a place.  Les, see, what state's\nMassachusetts in?\"\n\n\"Massachusetts,\" kindly replied Harry, \"is in the state of Boston.\"\n\n\"Abolish'n wan't it?  They must a cost right smart,\" referring to the\nboots.\n\nHarry shouldered his rod and went to the field, tramped over the prairie\nby day, and figured up results at night, with the utmost cheerfulness and\nindustry, and plotted the line on the profile paper, without, however,\nthe least idea of engineering practical or theoretical.  Perhaps there\nwas not a great deal of scientific knowledge in the entire corps, nor was\nvery much needed.  They were making, what is called a preliminary survey,\nand the chief object of a preliminary survey was to get up an excitement\nabout the road, to interest every town in that part of the state in it,\nunder the belief that the road would run through it, and to get the aid\nof every planter upon the prospect that a station would be on his land.\n\nMr. Jeff Thompson was the most popular engineer who could be found for\nthis work.  He did not bother himself much about details or\npracticabilities of location, but ran merrily along, sighting from the\ntop of one divide to the top of another, and striking \"plumb\" every town\nsite and big plantation within twenty or thirty miles of his route.  In\nhis own language he \"just went booming.\"\n\nThis course gave Harry an opportunity, as he said, to learn the practical\ndetails of engineering, and it gave Philip a chance to see the country,\nand to judge for himself what prospect of a fortune it offered.  Both he\nand Harry got the \"refusal\" of more than one plantation as they went\nalong, and wrote urgent letters to their eastern correspondents, upon the\nbeauty of the land and the certainty that it would quadruple in value as\nsoon as the road was finally located.  It seemed strange to them that\ncapitalists did not flock out there and secure this land.\n\nThey had not been in the field over two weeks when Harry wrote to his\nfriend Col. Sellers that he'd better be on the move, for the line was\ncertain to go to Stone's Landing.  Any one who looked at the line on the\nmap, as it was laid down from day to day, would have been uncertain which\nway it was going; but Jeff had declared that in his judgment the only\npracticable route from the point they then stood on was to follow the\ndivide to Stone's Landing, and it was generally understood that that town\nwould be the next one hit.\n\n\"We'll make it, boys,\" said the chief, \"if we have to go in a balloon.\"\n\nAnd make it they did In less than a week, this indomitable engineer had\ncarried his moving caravan over slues and branches, across bottoms and\nalong divides, and pitched his tents in the very heart of the city of\nStone's Landing.\n\n\"Well, I'll be dashed,\" was heard the cheery voice of Mr. Thompson, as he\nstepped outside the tent door at sunrise next morning.  \"If this don't\nget me.  I say, yon, Grayson, get out your sighting iron and see if you\ncan find old Sellers' town.  Blame me if we wouldn't have run plumb by it\nif twilight had held on a little longer.  Oh!  Sterling, Brierly, get up\nand see the city.  There's a steamboat just coming round the bend.\"  And\nJeff roared with laughter.  \"The mayor'll be round here to breakfast.\"\n\nThe fellows turned out of the tents, rubbing their eyes, and stared about\nthem.  They were camped on the second bench of the narrow bottom of a\ncrooked, sluggish stream, that was some five rods wide in the present\ngood stage of water.  Before them were a dozen log cabins, with stick and\nmud chimneys, irregularly disposed on either side of a not very well\ndefined road, which did not seem to know its own mind exactly, and, after\nstraggling through the town, wandered off over the rolling prairie in an\nuncertain way, as if it had started for nowhere and was quite likely to\nreach its destination.  Just as it left the town, however, it was cheered\nand assisted by a guide-board, upon which was the legend \"10 Mils to\nHawkeye.\"\n\nThe road had never been made except by the travel over it, and at this\nseason--the rainy June--it was a way of ruts cut in the black soil, and\nof fathomless mud-holes.  In the principal street of the city, it had\nreceived more attention; for hogs; great and small, rooted about in it\nand wallowed in it, turning the street into a liquid quagmire which could\nonly be crossed on pieces of plank thrown here and there.\n\nAbout the chief cabin, which was the store and grocery of this mart of\ntrade, the mud was more liquid than elsewhere, and the rude platform in\nfront of it and the dry-goods boxes mounted thereon were places of refuge\nfor all the loafers of the place.  Down by the stream was a dilapidated\nbuilding which served for a hemp warehouse, and a shaky wharf extended\nout from it, into the water.  In fact a flat-boat was there moored by it,\nit's setting poles lying across the gunwales.  Above the town the stream\nwas crossed by a crazy wooden bridge, the supports of which leaned all\nways in the soggy soil; the absence of a plank here and there in the\nflooring made the crossing of the bridge faster than a walk an offense\nnot necessary to be prohibited by law.\n\n\"This, gentlemen,\" said Jeff, \"is Columbus River, alias Goose Run.  If it\nwas widened, and deepened, and straightened, and  made, long enough, it\nwould be one of the finest rivers in the western country.\"\n\nAs the sun rose and sent his level beams along the stream, the thin\nstratum of mist, or malaria, rose also and dispersed, but the light was\nnot able to enliven the dull water nor give any hint of its apparently\nfathomless depth.  Venerable mud-turtles crawled up and roosted upon the\nold logs in the stream, their backs glistening in the sun, the first\ninhabitants of the metropolis to begin the active business of the day.\n\nIt was not long, however, before smoke began to issue from the city\nchimneys; and before the engineers, had finished their breakfast they\nwere the object of the curious inspection of six or eight boys and men,\nwho lounged into the camp and gazed about them with languid interest,\ntheir hands in their pockets every one.\n\n\"Good morning; gentlemen,\" called out the chief engineer, from the table.\n\n\"Good mawning,\" drawled out the spokesman of the party.  \"I allow\nthish-yers the railroad, I heern it was a-comin'.\"\n\n\"Yes, this is the railroad; all but the rails and the ironhorse.\"\n\n\"I reckon you kin git all the rails you want oaten my white oak timber\nover, thar,\" replied the first speaker, who appeared to be a man of\nproperty and willing to strike up a trade.\n\n\"You'll have to negotiate with the contractors about the rails, sir,\"\nsaid Jeff; \"here's Mr. Brierly, I've no doubt would like to buy your\nrails when the time comes.\"\n\n\"O,\" said the man, \"I thought maybe you'd fetch the whole bilin along\nwith you.  But if you want rails, I've got em, haint I Eph.\"\n\n\"Heaps,\" said Eph, without taking his eyes off the group at the table.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Thompson, rising from his seat and moving towards his\ntent, \"the railroad has come to Stone's Landing, sure; I move we take a\ndrink on it all round.\"\n\nThe proposal met with universal favor.  Jeff gave prosperity to Stone's\nLanding and navigation to Goose Run, and the toast was washed down with\ngusto, in the simple fluid of corn; and with the return compliment that a\nrail road was a good thing, and that Jeff Thompson was no slouch.\n\nAbout ten o'clock a horse and wagon was descried making a slow approach\nto the camp over the prairie.  As it drew near, the wagon was seen to\ncontain a portly gentleman, who hitched impatiently forward on his seat,\nshook the reins and gently touched up his horse, in the vain attempt to\ncommunicate his own energy to that dull beast, and looked eagerly at the\ntents.  When the conveyance at length drew up to Mr. Thompson's door,\nthe gentleman descended with great deliberation, straightened himself up,\nrubbed his hands, and beaming satisfaction from every part of his radiant\nframe, advanced to the group that was gathered to welcome him, and which\nhad saluted him by name as soon as he came within hearing.\n\n\"Welcome to Napoleon, gentlemen, welcome.  I am proud to see you here\nMr. Thompson.  You are, looking well Mr. Sterling.  This is the country,\nsir.  Right glad to see you Mr. Brierly.  You got that basket of\nchampagne?  No?  Those blasted river thieves!  I'll never send anything\nmore by 'em.  The best brand, Roederer.  The last I had in my cellar,\nfrom a lot sent me by Sir George Gore--took him out on a buffalo hunt,\nwhen he visited our, country.  Is always sending me some trifle.  You\nhaven't looked about any yet, gentlemen?  It's in the rough yet, in the\nrough.  Those buildings will all have to come down.  That's the place for\nthe public square, Court House, hotels, churches, jail--all that sort of\nthing.  About where we stand, the deepo.  How does that strike your\nengineering eye, Mr. Thompson?  Down yonder the business streets, running\nto the wharves.  The University up there, on rising ground, sightly\nplace, see the river for miles.  That's Columbus river, only forty-nine\nmiles to the Missouri.  You see what it is, placid, steady, no current to\ninterfere with navigation, wants widening in places and dredging, dredge\nout the harbor and raise a levee in front of the town; made by nature on\npurpose for a mart.  Look at all this country, not another building\nwithin ten miles, no other navigable stream, lay of the land points right\nhere; hemp, tobacco, corn, must come here.  The railroad will do it,\nNapoleon won't know itself in a year.\"\n\n\"Don't now evidently,\" said Philip aside to Harry.  \"Have you breakfasted\nColonel?\"\n\n\"Hastily.  Cup of coffee.  Can't trust any coffee I don't import myself.\nBut I put up a basket of provisions,--wife would put in a few delicacies,\nwomen always will, and a half dozen of that Burgundy, I was telling you\nof Mr. Briefly.  By the way, you never got to dine with me.\"  And the\nColonel strode away to the wagon and looked under the seat for the\nbasket.\n\nApparently it was not there.  For the Colonel raised up the flap, looked\nin front and behind, and then exclaimed,\n\n\"Confound it.  That comes of not doing a thing yourself.  I trusted to\nthe women folks to set that basket in the wagon, and it ain't there.\"\n\nThe camp cook speedily prepared a savory breakfast for the Colonel,\nbroiled chicken, eggs, corn-bread, and coffee, to which he did ample\njustice, and topped  off with a drop of Old Bourbon, from Mr. Thompson's\nprivate store, a brand which he said he knew well, he should think it\ncame from his own sideboard.\n\nWhile the engineer corps went to the field, to run back a couple of miles\nand ascertain, approximately, if a road could ever get down to the\nLanding, and to sight ahead across the Run, and see if it could ever get\nout again, Col. Sellers and Harry sat down and began to roughly map out\nthe city of Napoleon on a large piece of drawing paper.\n\n\"I've got the refusal of a mile square here,\" said the Colonel, \"in our\nnames, for a year, with a quarter interest reserved for the four owners.\"\n\nThey laid out the town liberally, not lacking room, leaving space for the\nrailroad to come in, and for the river as it was to be when improved.\n\nThe engineers reported that the railroad could come in, by taking a\nlittle sweep and crossing the stream on a high bridge, but the grades\nwould be steep.  Col. Sellers said he didn't care so much about the\ngrades, if the road could only be made to reach the elevators on the\nriver.  The next day Mr. Thompson made a hasty survey of the stream for a\nmile or two, so that the Colonel and Harry were enabled to show on their\nmap how nobly that would accommodate the city.  Jeff took a little\nwriting from the Colonel and Harry for a prospective share but Philip\ndeclined to join in, saying that he had no money, and didn't want to make\nengagements he couldn't fulfill.\n\nThe next morning the camp moved on, followed till it was out of sight by\nthe listless eyes of the group in front of the store, one of whom\nremarked that, \"he'd be doggoned if he ever expected to see that railroad\nany mo'.\"\n\nHarry went with the Colonel to Hawkeye to complete their arrangements, a\npart of which was the preparation of a petition to congress for the\nimprovement of the navigation of Columbus River.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nEight years have passed since the death of Mr. Hawkins.  Eight years are\nnot many in the life of a nation or the history of a state, but they\nmaybe years of destiny that shall fix the current of the century\nfollowing.  Such years were those that followed the little scrimmage on\nLexington Common.  Such years were those that followed the double-shotted\ndemand for the surrender of Fort Sumter.  History is never done with\ninquiring of these years, and summoning witnesses about them, and trying\nto understand their significance.\n\nThe eight years in America from 1860 to 1868 uprooted institutions that\nwere centuries old, changed the politics of a people, transformed the\nsocial life of half the country, and wrought so profoundly upon the\nentire national character that the influence cannot be measured short of\ntwo or three generations.\n\nAs we are accustomed to interpret the economy of providence, the life of\nthe individual is as nothing to that of the nation or the race; but who\ncan say, in the broader view and the more intelligent weight of values,\nthat the life of one man is not more than that of a nationality, and that\nthere is not a tribunal where the tragedy of one human soul shall not\nseem more significant than the overturning of any human institution\nwhatever?\n\nWhen one thinks of the tremendous forces of the upper and the nether\nworld which play for the mastery of the soul of a woman during the few\nyears in which she passes from plastic girlhood to the ripe maturity of\nwomanhood, he may well stand in awe before the momentous drama.\n\nWhat capacities she has of purity, tenderness, goodness; what capacities\nof vileness, bitterness and evil.  Nature must needs be lavish with the\nmother and creator of men, and centre in her all the possibilities of\nlife.  And a few critical years can decide whether her life is to be full\nof sweetness and light, whether she is to be the vestal of a holy temple,\nor whether she will be the fallen priestess of a desecrated shrine.\nThere are women, it is true, who seem to be capable neither of rising\nmuch nor of falling much, and whom a conventional life saves from any\nspecial development of character.\n\nBut Laura was not one of them.  She had the fatal gift of beauty, and\nthat more fatal gift which does not always accompany mere beauty, the\npower of fascination, a power that may, indeed, exist without beauty.\nShe had will, and pride and courage and ambition, and she was left to be\nvery much her own guide at the age when romance comes to the aid of\npassion, and when the awakening powers of her vigorous mind had little\nobject on which to discipline themselves.\n\nThe tremendous conflict that was fought in this girl's soul none of those\nabout her knew, and very few knew that her life had in it anything\nunusual or romantic or strange.\n\nThose were troublous days in Hawkeye as well as in most other Missouri\ntowns, days of confusion, when between Unionist and Confederate\noccupations, sudden maraudings and bush-whackings and raids, individuals\nescaped observation or comment in actions that would have filled the town\nwith scandal in quiet times.\n\nFortunately we only need to deal with Laura's life at this period\nhistorically, and look back upon such portions of it as will serve to\nreveal the woman as she was at the time of the arrival of Mr. Harry\nBrierly in Hawkeye.\n\nThe Hawkins family were settled there, and had a hard enough struggle\nwith poverty and the necessity of keeping up appearances in accord with\ntheir own family pride and the large expectations they secretly cherished\nof a fortune in the Knobs of East Tennessee.  How pinched they were\nperhaps no one knew but Clay, to whom they looked for almost their whole\nsupport.  Washington had been in Hawkeye off and on, attracted away\noccasionally by some tremendous speculation, from which he invariably\nreturned to Gen. Boswell's office as poor as he went.  He was the\ninventor of no one knew how many useless contrivances, which were not\nworth patenting, and his years had been passed in dreaming and planning\nto no purpose; until he was now a man of about thirty, without a\nprofession or a permanent occupation, a tall, brown-haired, dreamy person\nof the best intentions and the frailest resolution.  Probably however\nthe, eight years had been happier to him than to any others in his\ncircle, for the time had been mostly spent in a blissful dream of the\ncoming of enormous wealth.\n\nHe went out with a company from Hawkeye to the war, and was not wanting\nin courage, but he would have been a better soldier if he had been less\nengaged in contrivances for circumventing the enemy by strategy unknown\nto the books.\n\nIt happened to him to be captured in one of his self-appointed\nexpeditions, but the federal colonel released him, after a short\nexamination, satisfied that he could most injure the confederate forces\nopposed to the Unionists by returning him to his regiment.  Col. Sellers\nwas of course a prominent man during the war.  He was captain of the home\nguards in Hawkeye, and he never left home except upon one occasion, when\non the strength of a rumor, he executed a flank movement and fortified\nStone's Landing, a place which no one unacquainted with the country would\nbe likely to find.\n\n\"Gad,\" said the Colonel afterwards, \"the Landing is the key to upper\nMissouri, and it is the only place the enemy never captured.  If other\nplaces had been defended as well as that was, the result would have been\ndifferent, sir.\"\n\nThe Colonel had his own theories about war as he had in other things.\nIf everybody had stayed at home as he did, he said, the South never would\nhave been conquered.  For what would there have been to conquer?  Mr.\nJeff Davis was constantly writing him to take command of a corps in the\nconfederate army, but Col. Sellers said, no, his duty was at home.  And\nhe was by no means idle.  He was the inventor of the famous air torpedo,\nwhich came very near destroying the Union armies in Missouri, and the\ncity of St. Louis itself.\n\nHis plan was to fill a torpedo with Greek fire and poisonous and deadly\nmissiles, attach it to a balloon, and then let it sail away over the\nhostile camp and explode at the right moment, when the time-fuse burned\nout.  He intended to use this invention in the capture of St. Louis,\nexploding his torpedoes over the city, and raining destruction upon it\nuntil the army of occupation would gladly capitulate.  He was unable to\nprocure the Greek fire, but he constructed a vicious torpedo which would\nhave answered the purpose, but the first one prematurely exploded in his\nwood-house, blowing it clean away, and setting fire to his house.  The\nneighbors helped him put out the conflagration, but they discouraged any\nmore experiments of that sort.\n\nThe patriotic old gentleman, however, planted so much powder and so many\nexplosive contrivances in the roads leading into Hawkeye, and then forgot\nthe exact spots of danger, that people were afraid to travel the\nhighways, and used to come to town across the fields, The Colonel's motto\nwas, \"Millions for defence but not one cent for tribute.\"\n\nWhen Laura came to Hawkeye she might have forgotten the annoyances of the\ngossips of Murpheysburg and have out lived the bitterness that was\ngrowing in her heart, if she had been thrown less upon herself, or if the\nsurroundings of her life had been more congenial and helpful.  But she\nhad little society, less and less as she grew older that was congenial to\nher, and her mind preyed upon itself; and the mystery of her birth at\nonce chagrined her and raised in her the most extravagant expectations.\nShe was proud and she felt the sting of poverty.  She could not but be\nconscious of her beauty also, and she was vain of that, and came to take\na sort of delight in the exercise of her fascinations upon the rather\nloutish young men who came in her way and whom she despised.\n\nThere was another world opened to her--a world of books.  But it was not\nthe best world of that sort, for the small libraries she had access to in\nHawkeye were decidedly miscellaneous, and largely made up of romances and\nfictions which fed her imagination with the most exaggerated notions of\nlife, and showed her men and women in a very false sort of heroism.  From\nthese stories she learned what a woman of keen intellect and some culture\njoined to beauty and fascination of manner, might expect to accomplish in\nsociety as she read of it; and along with these ideas she imbibed other\nvery crude ones in regard to the emancipation of woman.\n\nThere were also other books-histories, biographies of distinguished\npeople, travels in far lands, poems, especially those of Byron, Scott and\nShelley and Moore, which she eagerly absorbed, and appropriated therefrom\nwhat was to her liking.  Nobody in Hawkeye had read so much or, after a\nfashion, studied so diligently as Laura.  She passed for an accomplished\ngirl, and no doubt thought herself one, as she was, judged by any\nstandard near her.\n\nDuring the war there came to Hawkeye a confederate officer, Col. Selby,\nwho was stationed there for a time, in command of that district.  He was\na handsome, soldierly man of thirty years, a graduate of the University\nof Virginia, and of distinguished family, if his story might be believed,\nand, it was evident, a man of the world and of extensive travel and\nadventure.\n\nTo find in such an out of the way country place a woman like Laura was a\npiece of good luck upon which Col. Selby congratulated himself.  He was\nstudiously polite to her and treated her with a consideration to which\nshe was unaccustomed.  She had read of such men, but she had never seen\none before, one so high-bred, so noble in sentiment, so entertaining in\nconversation, so engaging in manner.\n\nIt is a long story; unfortunately it is an old story, and it need not be\ndwelt on.  Laura loved him, and believed that his love for her was as\npure and deep as her own.  She worshipped him and would have counted her\nlife a little thing to give him, if he would only love her and let her\nfeed the hunger of her heart upon him.\n\nThe passion possessed her whole being, and lifted her up, till she seemed\nto walk on air.  It was all true, then, the romances she had read, the\nbliss of love she had dreamed of.  Why had she never noticed before how\nblithesome the world was, how jocund with love; the birds sang it, the\ntrees whispered it to her as she passed, the very flowers beneath her\nfeet strewed the way as for a bridal march.\n\nWhen the Colonel went away they were engaged to be married, as soon as he\ncould make certain arrangements which he represented to be necessary, and\nquit the army.  He wrote to her from Harding, a small town in the\nsouthwest corner of the state, saying that he should be held in the\nservice longer than he had expected, but that it would not be more than a\nfew months, then he should be at liberty to take her to Chicago where he\nhad property, and should have business, either now or as soon as the war\nwas over, which he thought could not last long.  Meantime why should they\nbe separated?  He was established in comfortable quarters, and if she\ncould find company and join him, they would be married, and gain so many\nmore months of happiness.\n\nWas woman ever prudent when she loved?  Laura went to Harding, the\nneighbors supposed to nurse Washington who had fallen ill there.\nHer engagement was, of course, known in Hawkeye, and was indeed a matter\nof pride to her family.  Mrs. Hawkins would have told the first inquirer\nthat.  Laura had gone to be married; but Laura had cautioned her; she did\nnot want to be thought of, she said, as going in search of a husband; let\nthe news come back after she was married.\n\nSo she traveled to Harding on the pretence we have mentioned, and was\nmarried.  She was married, but something must have happened on that very\nday or the next that alarmed her.  Washington did not know then or after\nwhat it was, but Laura bound him not to send news of her marriage to\nHawkeye yet, and to enjoin her mother not to speak of it.  Whatever cruel\nsuspicion or nameless dread this was, Laura tried bravely to put it away,\nand not let it cloud her happiness.\n\nCommunication that summer, as may be imagined, was neither regular nor\nfrequent between the remote confederate camp at Harding and Hawkeye, and\nLaura was in a measure lost sight of--indeed, everyone had troubles\nenough of his own without borrowing from his neighbors.\n\nLaura had given herself utterly to her husband, and if he had faults, if\nhe was selfish, if he was sometimes coarse, if he was dissipated, she did\nnot or would not see it.  It was the passion of her life, the time when\nher whole nature went to flood tide and swept away all barriers.  Was her\nhusband ever cold or indifferent?  She shut her eyes to everything but\nher sense of possession of her idol.\n\nThree months passed.  One morning her husband informed her that he had\nbeen ordered South, and must go within two hours.\n\n\"I can be ready,\" said Laura, cheerfully.\n\n\"But I can't take you.  You must go back to Hawkeye.\"\n\n\"Can't-take-me?\" Laura asked, with wonder in her eyes.  \"I can't live\nwithout you.  You said-----\"\n\n\"O bother what I said,\"--and the Colonel took up his sword to buckle it\non, and then continued coolly, \"the fact is Laura, our romance is played\nout.\"\n\nLaura heard, but she did not comprehend.  She caught his arm and cried,\n\"George, how can you joke so cruelly?  I will go any where with you.\nI will wait any where.  I can't go back to Hawkeye.\"\n\n\"Well, go where you like.  Perhaps,\" continued he with a sneer, \"you\nwould do as well to wait here, for another colonel.\"\n\nLaura's brain whirled.  She did not yet comprehend.  \"What does this\nmean?  Where are you going?\"\n\n\"It means,\" said the officer, in measured words, \"that you haven't\nanything to show for a legal marriage, and that I am going to New\nOrleans.\"\n\n\"It's a lie, George, it's a lie.  I am your wife.  I shall go.  I shall\nfollow you to New Orleans.\"\n\n\"Perhaps my wife might not like it!\"\n\nLaura raised her head, her eyes flamed with fire, she tried to utter a\ncry, and fell senseless on the floor.\n\nWhen she came to herself the Colonel was gone.  Washington Hawkins stood\nat her bedside.  Did she come to herself?  Was there anything left in her\nheart but hate and bitterness, a sense of an infamous wrong at the hands\nof the only man she had ever loved?\n\nShe returned to Hawkeye.  With the exception of Washington and his\nmother, no one knew what had happened.  The neighbors supposed that the\nengagement with Col. Selby had fallen through.  Laura was ill for a long\ntime, but she recovered; she had that resolution in her that could\nconquer death almost.  And with her health came back her beauty, and an\nadded fascination, a something that might be mistaken for sadness.  Is\nthere a beauty in the knowledge of evil, a beauty that shines out in the\nface of a person whose inward life is transformed by some terrible\nexperience?  Is the pathos in the eyes of the Beatrice Cenci from her\nguilt or her innocence?\n\nLaura was not much changed.  The lovely woman had a devil in her heart.\nThat was all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Squire Hawkins sat upon the pyramid of large blocks, called\nthe \u201cstile,\u201d in front of his house, contemplating the morning.\n\nThe locality was Obedstown, East Tennessee. You would not know that\nObedstown stood on the top of a mountain, for there was nothing about\nthe landscape to indicate it--but it did: a mountain that stretched\nabroad over whole counties, and rose very gradually. The district\nwas called the \u201cKnobs of East Tennessee,\u201d and had a reputation like\nNazareth, as far as turning out any good thing was concerned.\n\nThe Squire's house was a double log cabin, in a state of decay; two\nor three gaunt hounds lay asleep about the threshold, and lifted their\nheads sadly whenever Mrs. Hawkins or the children stepped in and out\nover their bodies. Rubbish was scattered about the grassless yard; a\nbench stood near the door with a tin wash basin on it and a pail of\nwater and a gourd; a cat had begun to drink from the pail, but the\nexertion was overtaxing her energies, and she had stopped to rest. There\nwas an ash-hopper by the fence, and an iron pot, for soft-soap-boiling,\nnear it.\n\nThis dwelling constituted one-fifteenth of Obedstown; the other fourteen\nhouses were scattered about among the tall pine trees and among the\ncorn-fields in such a way that a man might stand in the midst of the\ncity and not know but that he was in the country if he only depended on\nhis eyes for information.\n\n\u201cSquire\u201d Hawkins got his title from being postmaster of Obedstown--not\nthat the title properly belonged to the office, but because in those\nregions the chief citizens always must have titles of some sort, and so\nthe usual courtesy had been extended to Hawkins. The mail was monthly,\nand sometimes amounted to as much as three or four letters at a single\ndelivery. Even a rush like this did not fill up the postmaster's whole\nmonth, though, and therefore he \u201ckept store\u201d in the intervals.\n\nThe Squire was contemplating the morning. It was balmy and tranquil, the\nvagrant breezes were laden with the odor of flowers, the murmur of bees\nwas in the air, there was everywhere that suggestion of repose that\nsummer woodlands bring to the senses, and the vague, pleasurable\nmelancholy that such a time and such surroundings inspire.\n\nPresently the United States mail arrived, on horseback. There was but\none letter, and it was for the postmaster. The long-legged youth who\ncarried the mail tarried an hour to talk, for there was no hurry; and in\na little while the male population of the village had assembled to\nhelp. As a general thing, they were dressed in homespun \u201cjeans,\u201d blue or\nyellow--here were no other varieties of it; all wore one suspender and\nsometimes two--yarn ones knitted at home,--some wore vests, but few\nwore coats. Such coats and vests as did appear, however, were rather\npicturesque than otherwise, for they were made of tolerably fanciful\npatterns of calico--a fashion which prevails thereto this day among\nthose of the community who have tastes above the common level and are\nable to afford style. Every individual arrived with his hands in his\npockets; a hand came out occasionally for a purpose, but it always went\nback again after service; and if it was the head that was served, just\nthe cant that the dilapidated straw hat got by being uplifted and rooted\nunder, was retained until the next call altered the inclination; many\nhats were present, but none were erect and no two were canted just\nalike. We are speaking impartially of men, youths and boys. And we are\nalso speaking of these three estates when we say that every individual\nwas either chewing natural leaf tobacco prepared on his own premises, or\nsmoking the same in a corn-cob pipe. Few of the men wore whiskers; none\nwore moustaches; some had a thick jungle of hair under the chin and\nhiding the throat--the only pattern recognized there as being the\ncorrect thing in whiskers; but no part of any individual's face had seen\na razor for a week.\n\nThese neighbors stood a few moments looking at the mail carrier\nreflectively while he talked; but fatigue soon began to show itself,\nand one after another they climbed up and occupied the top rail of the\nfence, hump-shouldered and grave, like a company of buzzards assembled\nfor supper and listening for the death-rattle. Old Damrell said:\n\n\u201cTha hain't no news 'bout the jedge, hit ain't likely?\u201d\n\n\u201cCain't tell for sartin; some thinks he's gwyne to be 'long toreckly,\nand some thinks 'e hain't. Russ Mosely he tote ole Hanks he mought git\nto Obeds tomorrer or nex' day he reckoned.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I wisht I knowed. I got a 'prime sow and pigs in the cote-house,\nand I hain't got no place for to put 'em. If the jedge is a gwyne to\nhold cote, I got to roust 'em out, I reckon. But tomorrer'll do, I\n'spect.\u201d\n\nThe speaker bunched his thick lips together like the stem-end of a\ntomato and shot a bumble-bee dead that had lit on a weed seven feet\naway. One after another the several chewers expressed a charge of\ntobacco juice and delivered it at the deceased with steady, aim and\nfaultless accuracy.\n\n\u201cWhat's a stirrin', down 'bout the Forks?\u201d continued Old Damrell.\n\n\u201cWell, I dunno, skasely. Ole Drake Higgins he's ben down to Shelby\nlas' week. Tuck his crap down; couldn't git shet o' the most uv it; hit\nwasn't no time for to sell, he say, so he 'fotch it back agin, 'lowin'\nto wait tell fall. Talks 'bout goin' to Mozouri--lots uv 'ems talkin'\nthat--away down thar, Ole Higgins say. Cain't make a livin' here no mo',\nsich times as these. Si Higgins he's ben over to Kaintuck n' married a\nhigh-toned gal thar, outen the fust families, an' he's come back to the\nForks with jist a hell's-mint o' whoop-jamboree notions, folks says.\nHe's tuck an' fixed up the ole house like they does in Kaintuck, he say,\nan' tha's ben folks come cler from Turpentine for to see it. He's tuck\nan gawmed it all over on the inside with plarsterin'.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat's plasterin'?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dono. Hit's what he calls it. Ole Mam Higgins, she tole me. She say\nshe wasn't gwyne to hang out in no sich a dern hole like a hog. Says\nit's mud, or some sich kind o' nastiness that sticks on n' covers up\neverything. Plarsterin', Si calls it.\u201d\n\nThis marvel was discussed at considerable length; and almost with\nanimation. But presently there was a dog-fight over in the neighborhood\nof the blacksmith shop, and the visitors slid off their perch like so\nmany turtles and strode to the battle-field with an interest bordering\non eagerness.\n\nThe Squire remained, and read his letter. Then he sighed, and sat long\nin meditation. At intervals he said:\n\n\u201cMissouri. Missouri. Well, well, well, everything is so uncertain.\u201d\n\nAt last he said:\n\n\u201cI believe I'll do it.--A man will just rot, here. My house my yard,\neverything around me, in fact, shows' that I am becoming one of these\ncattle--and I used to be thrifty in other times.\u201d\n\nHe was not more than thirty-five, but he had a worn look that made him\nseem older. He left the stile, entered that part of his house which was\nthe store, traded a quart of thick molasses for a coonskin and a cake of\nbeeswax, to an old dame in linsey-woolsey, put his letter away, and\nwent into the kitchen. His wife was there, constructing some dried apple\npies; a slovenly urchin of ten was dreaming over a rude weather-vane of\nhis own contriving; his small sister, close upon four years of age, was\nsopping corn-bread in some gravy left in the bottom of a frying-pan and\ntrying hard not to sop over a finger-mark that divided the pan through\nthe middle--for the other side belonged to the brother, whose musings\nmade him forget his stomach for the moment; a negro woman was busy\ncooking, at a vast fire-place. Shiftlessness and poverty reigned in the\nplace.\n\n\u201cNancy, I've made up my mind. The world is done with me, and perhaps\nI ought to be done with it. But no matter--I can wait. I am going to\nMissouri. I won't stay in this dead country and decay with it. I've had\nit on my mind sometime. I'm going to sell out here for whatever I can\nget, and buy a wagon and team and put you and the children in it and\nstart.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnywhere that suits you, suits me, Si. And the children can't be any\nworse off in Missouri than, they are here, I reckon.\u201d\n\nMotioning his wife to a private conference in their own room, Hawkins\nsaid: \u201cNo, they'll be better off. I've looked out for them, Nancy,\u201d and\nhis face lighted. \u201cDo you see these papers? Well, they are evidence\nthat I have taken up Seventy-five Thousand Acres of Land in this\ncounty--think what an enormous fortune it will be some day! Why, Nancy,\nenormous don't express it--the word's too tame! I tell your Nancy----\u201d\n\n\u201cFor goodness sake, Si----\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, Nancy, wait--let me finish--I've been secretly bailing and fuming\nwith this grand inspiration for weeks, and I must talk or I'll burst! I\nhaven't whispered to a soul--not a word--have had my countenance under\nlock and key, for fear it might drop something that would tell even\nthese animals here how to discern the gold mine that's glaring under\ntheir noses. Now all that is necessary to hold this land and keep it\nin the family is to pay the trifling taxes on it yearly--five or ten\ndollars--the whole tract would not sell for over a third of a cent an\nacre now, but some day people will be glad to get it for twenty dollars,\nfifty dollars, a hundred dollars an acre! What should you say to\u201d [here\nhe dropped his voice to a whisper and looked anxiously around to see\nthat there were no eavesdroppers,] \u201ca thousand dollars an acre!\n\n\u201cWell you may open your eyes and stare! But it's so. You and I may not\nsee the day, but they'll see it. Mind I tell you; they'll see it. Nancy,\nyou've heard of steamboats, and maybe you believed in them--of course\nyou did. You've heard these cattle here scoff at them and call them lies\nand humbugs,--but they're not lies and humbugs, they're a reality and\nthey're going to be a more wonderful thing some day than they are now.\nThey're going to make a revolution in this world's affairs that will\nmake men dizzy to contemplate. I've been watching--I've been watching\nwhile some people slept, and I know what's coming.\n\n\u201cEven you and I will see the day that steamboats will come up that\nlittle Turkey river to within twenty miles of this land of ours--and\nin high water they'll come right to it! And this is not all, Nancy--it\nisn't even half! There's a bigger wonder--the railroad! These worms here\nhave never even heard of it--and when they do they'll not believe in it.\nBut it's another fact. Coaches that fly over the ground twenty miles an\nhour--heavens and earth, think of that, Nancy! Twenty miles an hour. It\nmakes a man's brain whirl. Some day, when you and I are in our graves,\nthere'll be a railroad stretching hundreds of miles--all the way down\nfrom the cities of the Northern States to New Orleans--and its got to\nrun within thirty miles of this land--may be even touch a corner of\nit. Well, do you know, they've quit burning wood in some places in the\nEastern States? And what do you suppose they burn? Coal!\u201d [He bent over\nand whispered again:] \u201cThere's world--worlds of it on this land! You\nknow that black stuff that crops out of the bank of the branch?--well,\nthat's it. You've taken it for rocks; so has every body here; and\nthey've built little dams and such things with it. One man was going to\nbuild a chimney out of it. Nancy I expect I turned as white as a sheet!\nWhy, it might have caught fire and told everything. I showed him it\nwas too crumbly. Then he was going to build it of copper ore--splendid\nyellow forty-per-cent. ore! There's fortunes upon fortunes of copper\nore on our land! It scared me to death, the idea of this fool starting\na smelting furnace in his house without knowing it, and getting his\ndull eyes opened. And then he was going to build it of iron ore! There's\nmountains of iron ore here, Nancy--whole mountains of it. I wouldn't\ntake any chances. I just stuck by him--I haunted him--I never let\nhim alone till he built it of mud and sticks like all the rest of the\nchimneys in this dismal country. Pine forests, wheat land, corn land,\niron, copper, coal--wait till the railroads come, and the steamboats!\nWe'll never see the day, Nancy--never in the world--never, never, never,\nchild. We've got to drag along, drag along, and eat crusts in toil and\npoverty, all hopeless and forlorn--but they'll ride in coaches, Nancy!\nThey'll live like the princes of the earth; they'll be courted\nand worshiped; their names will be known from ocean to ocean! Ah,\nwell-a-day! Will they ever come back here, on the railroad and the\nsteamboat, and say, 'This one little spot shall not be touched--this\nhovel shall be sacred--for here our father and our mother suffered for\nus, thought for us, laid the foundations of our future as solid as the\nhills!'\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a great, good, noble soul, Si Hawkins, and I am an honored\nwoman to be the wife of such a man\u201d--and the tears stood in her eyes\nwhen she said it. \u201cWe will go to Missouri. You are out of your place,\nhere, among these groping dumb creatures. We will find a higher place,\nwhere you can walk with your own kind, and be understood when you\nspeak--not stared at as if you were talking some foreign tongue. I would\ngo anywhere, anywhere in the wide world with you. I would rather my body\nwould starve and die than your mind should hunger and wither away in\nthis lonely land.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpoken like yourself, my child! But we'll not starve, Nancy. Far from\nit. I have a letter from Beriah Sellers--just came this day. A letter\nthat--I'll read you a line from it!\u201d\n\nHe flew out of the room. A shadow blurred the sunlight in Nancy's\nface--there was uneasiness in it, and disappointment. A procession of\ndisturbing thoughts began to troop through her mind. Saying nothing\naloud, she sat with her hands in her lap; now and then she clasped\nthem, then unclasped them, then tapped the ends of the fingers together;\nsighed, nodded, smiled--occasionally paused, shook her head. This\npantomime was the elocutionary expression of an unspoken soliloquy which\nhad something of this shape:\n\n\u201cI was afraid of it--was afraid of it. Trying to make our fortune\nin Virginia, Beriah Sellers nearly ruined us and we had to settle in\nKentucky and start over again. Trying to make our fortune in Kentucky\nhe crippled us again and we had to move here. Trying to make our fortune\nhere, he brought us clear down to the ground, nearly. He's an honest\nsoul, and means the very best in the world, but I'm afraid, I'm afraid\nhe's too flighty. He has splendid ideas, and he'll divide his chances\nwith his friends with a free hand, the good generous soul, but something\ndoes seem to always interfere and spoil everything. I never did think\nhe was right well balanced. But I don't blame my husband, for I do think\nthat when that man gets his head full of a new notion, he can out-talk a\nmachine. He'll make anybody believe in that notion that'll listen to him\nten minutes--why I do believe he would make a deaf and dumb man believe\nin it and get beside himself, if you only set him where he could see his\neyes tally and watch his hands explain. What a head he has got! When he\ngot up that idea there in Virginia of buying up whole loads of negroes\nin Delaware and Virginia and Tennessee, very quiet, having papers drawn\nto have them delivered at a place in Alabama and take them and pay for\nthem, away yonder at a certain time, and then in the meantime get a\nlaw made stopping everybody from selling negroes to the south after a\ncertain day--it was somehow that way--mercy how the man would have made\nmoney! Negroes would have gone up to four prices. But after he'd spent\nmoney and worked hard, and traveled hard, and had heaps of negroes all\ncontracted for, and everything going along just right, he couldn't get\nthe laws passed and down the whole thing tumbled. And there in Kentucky,\nwhen he raked up that old numskull that had been inventing away at a\nperpetual motion machine for twenty-two years, and Beriah Sellers saw at\na glance where just one more little cog-wheel would settle the business,\nwhy I could see it as plain as day when he came in wild at midnight and\nhammered us out of bed and told the whole thing in a whisper with the\ndoors bolted and the candle in an empty barrel.\n\nOceans of money in it--anybody could see that. But it did cost a deal\nto buy the old numskull out--and then when they put the new cog wheel\nin they'd overlooked something somewhere and it wasn't any use--the\ntroublesome thing wouldn't go. That notion he got up here did look as\nhandy as anything in the world; and how him and Si did sit up nights\nworking at it with the curtains down and me watching to see if any\nneighbors were about. The man did honestly believe there was a fortune\nin that black gummy oil that stews out of the bank Si says is coal; and\nhe refined it himself till it was like water, nearly, and it did burn,\nthere's no two ways about that; and I reckon he'd have been all right in\nCincinnati with his lamp that he got made, that time he got a house full\nof rich speculators to see him exhibit only in the middle of his speech\nit let go and almost blew the heads off the whole crowd.\n\nI haven't got over grieving for the money that cost yet. I am sorry\nenough Beriah Sellers is in Missouri, now, but I was glad when he went.\nI wonder what his letter says. But of course it's cheerful; he's never\ndown-hearted--never had any trouble in his life--didn't know it if\nhe had. It's always sunrise with that man, and fine and blazing, at\nthat--never gets noon, though--leaves off and rises again. Nobody can\nhelp liking the creature, he means so well--but I do dread to come\nacross him again; he's bound to set us all crazy, of course. Well, there\ngoes old widow Hopkins--it always takes her a week to buy a spool of\nthread and trade a hank of yarn. Maybe Si can come with the letter,\nnow.\u201d\n\nAnd he did:\n\n\u201cWidow Hopkins kept me--I haven't any patience with such tedious people.\nNow listen, Nancy--just listen at this:\n\n\u201c'Come right along to Missouri! Don't wait and worry about a good price\nbut sell out for whatever you can get, and come along, or you might be\ntoo late. Throw away your traps, if necessary, and come empty-handed.\nYou'll never regret it. It's the grandest country--the loveliest\nland--the purest atmosphere--I can't describe it; no pen can do it\njustice. And it's filling up, every day--people coming from everywhere.\nI've got the biggest scheme on earth--and I'll take you in; I'll take\nin every friend I've got that's ever stood by me, for there's enough\nfor all, and to spare. Mum's the word--don't whisper--keep yourself to\nyourself. You'll see! Come! --rush!--hurry!--don't wait for anything!'\n\u201cIt's the same old boy, Nancy, jest the same old boy--ain't he?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I think there's a little of the old sound about his voice yet. I\nsuppose you--you'll still go, Si?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo! Well, I should think so, Nancy. It's all a chance, of course, and,\nchances haven't been kind to us, I'll admit--but whatever comes, old\nwife, they're provided for. Thank God for that!\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen,\u201d came low and earnestly.\n\nAnd with an activity and a suddenness that bewildered Obedstown and\nalmost took its breath away, the Hawkinses hurried through with their\narrangements in four short months and flitted out into the great\nmysterious blank that lay beyond the Knobs of Tennessee.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nToward the close of the third day's journey the wayfarers were just\nbeginning to think of camping, when they came upon a log cabin in the\nwoods. Hawkins drew rein and entered the yard. A boy about ten years old\nwas sitting in the cabin door with his face bowed in his hands. Hawkins\napproached, expecting his footfall to attract attention, but it did not.\nHe halted a moment, and then said:\n\n\u201cCome, come, little chap, you mustn't be going to sleep before sundown\u201d\n\nWith a tired expression the small face came up out of the hands,--a face\ndown which tears were flowing.\n\n\u201cAh, I'm sorry I spoke so, my boy. Tell me--is anything the matter?\u201d\n\nThe boy signified with a scarcely perceptible gesture that the trouble\nwas in the house, and made room for Hawkins to pass. Then he put his\nface in his hands again and rocked himself about as one suffering a\ngrief that is too deep to find help in moan or groan or outcry.\nHawkins stepped within. It was a poverty stricken place. Six or eight\nmiddle-aged country people of both sexes were grouped about an object\nin the middle of the room; they were noiselessly busy and they talked\nin whispers when they spoke. Hawkins uncovered and approached. A coffin\nstood upon two backless chairs. These neighbors had just finished\ndisposing the body of a woman in it--a woman with a careworn, gentle\nface that had more the look of sleep about it than of death. An old lady\nmotioned, toward the door and said to Hawkins in a whisper:\n\n\u201cHis mother, po' thing. Died of the fever, last night. Tha warn't no\nsich thing as saving of her. But it's better for her--better for her.\nHusband and the other two children died in the spring, and she hain't\never hilt up her head sence. She jest went around broken-hearted like,\nand never took no intrust in anything but Clay--that's the boy thar.\nShe jest worshiped Clay--and Clay he worshiped her. They didn't 'pear to\nlive at all, only when they was together, looking at each other, loving\none another. She's ben sick three weeks; and if you believe me that\nchild has worked, and kep' the run of the med'cin, and the times of\ngiving it, and sot up nights and nussed her, and tried to keep up her\nsperits, the same as a grown-up person. And last night when she kep'\na sinking and sinking, and turned away her head and didn't know him no\nmo', it was fitten to make a body's heart break to see him climb onto\nthe bed and lay his cheek agin hern and call her so pitiful and she not\nanswer. But bymeby she roused up, like, and looked around wild, and then\nshe see him, and she made a great cry and snatched him to her breast and\nhilt him close and kissed him over and over agin; but it took the last\npo' strength she had, and so her eyelids begin to close down, and her\narms sort o' drooped away and then we see she was gone, po' creetur. And\nClay, he--Oh, the po' motherless thing--I cain't talk about it--I cain't\nbear to talk about it.\u201d\n\nClay had disappeared from the door; but he came in, now, and the\nneighbors reverently fell apart and made way for him. He leaned upon the\nopen coffin and let his tears course silently. Then he put out his small\nhand and smoothed the hair and stroked the dead face lovingly. After a\nbit he brought his other hand up from behind him and laid three or\nfour fresh wild flowers upon the breast, bent over and kissed the\nunresponsive lips time and time again, and then turned away and went out\nof the house without looking at any of the company. The old lady said to\nHawkins:\n\n\u201cShe always loved that kind o' flowers. He fetched 'em for her every\nmorning, and she always kissed him. They was from away north somers--she\nkep' school when she fust come. Goodness knows what's to become o' that\npo' boy. No father, no mother, no kin folks of no kind. Nobody to go\nto, nobody that k'yers for him--and all of us is so put to it for to get\nalong and families so large.\u201d\n\nHawkins understood. All eyes were turned inquiringly upon him. He said:\n\n\u201cFriends, I am not very well provided for, myself, but still I would not\nturn my back on a homeless orphan. If he will go with me I will give him\na home, and loving regard--I will do for him as I would have another do\nfor a child of my own in misfortune.\u201d\n\nOne after another the people stepped forward and wrung the stranger's\nhand with cordial good will, and their eyes looked all that their hands\ncould not express or their lips speak.\n\n\u201cSaid like a true man,\u201d said one.\n\n\u201cYou was a stranger to me a minute ago, but you ain't now,\u201d said\nanother.\n\n\u201cIt's bread cast upon the waters--it'll return after many days,\u201d said\nthe old lady whom we have heard speak before.\n\n\u201cYou got to camp in my house as long as you hang out here,\u201d said one.\n\u201cIf tha hain't room for you and yourn my tribe'll turn out and camp in\nthe hay loft.\u201d\n\nA few minutes afterward, while the preparations for the funeral were\nbeing concluded, Mr. Hawkins arrived at his wagon leading his little\nwaif by the hand, and told his wife all that had happened, and asked her\nif he had done right in giving to her and to himself this new care? She\nsaid:\n\n\u201cIf you've done wrong, Si Hawkins, it's a wrong that will shine brighter\nat the judgment day than the rights that many a man has done before you.\nAnd there isn't any compliment you can pay me equal to doing a thing\nlike this and finishing it up, just taking it for granted that I'll be\nwilling to it. Willing? Come to me; you poor motherless boy, and let me\ntake your grief and help you carry it.\u201d\n\nWhen the child awoke in the morning, it was as if from a troubled dream.\nBut slowly the confusion in his mind took form, and he remembered his\ngreat loss; the beloved form in the coffin; his talk with a generous\nstranger who offered him a home; the funeral, where the stranger's wife\nheld him by the hand at the grave, and cried with him and comforted\nhim; and he remembered how this, new mother tucked him in his bed in the\nneighboring farm house, and coaxed him to talk about his troubles, and\nthen heard him say his prayers and kissed him good night, and left him\nwith the soreness in his heart almost healed and his bruised spirit at\nrest.\n\nAnd now the new mother came again, and helped him to dress, and combed\nhis hair, and drew his mind away by degrees from the dismal yesterday,\nby telling him about the wonderful journey he was going to take and the\nstrange things he was going to see. And after breakfast they two went\nalone to the grave, and his heart went out to his new friend and his\nuntaught eloquence poured the praises of his buried idol into her ears\nwithout let or hindrance. Together they planted roses by the headboard\nand strewed wild flowers upon the grave; and then together they went\naway, hand in hand, and left the dead to the long sleep that heals all\nheart-aches and ends all sorrows.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nWhatever the lagging dragging journey may have been to the rest of\nthe emigrants, it was a wonder and delight to the children, a world\nof enchantment; and they believed it to be peopled with the mysterious\ndwarfs and giants and goblins that figured in the tales the negro slaves\nwere in the habit of telling them nightly by the shuddering light of the\nkitchen fire.\n\nAt the end of nearly a week of travel, the party went into camp near\na shabby village which was caving, house by house, into the hungry\nMississippi. The river astonished the children beyond measure. Its\nmile-breadth of water seemed an ocean to them, in the shadowy twilight,\nand the vague riband of trees on the further shore, the verge of a\ncontinent which surely none but they had ever seen before.\n\n\u201cUncle Dan'l\u201d (colored,) aged 40; his wife, \u201caunt Jinny,\u201d aged 30,\n\u201cYoung Miss\u201d Emily Hawkins, \u201cYoung Mars\u201d Washington Hawkins and \u201cYoung\nMars\u201d Clay, the new member of the family, ranged themselves on a log,\nafter supper, and contemplated the marvelous river and discussed it. The\nmoon rose and sailed aloft through a maze of shredded cloud-wreaths; the\nsombre river just perceptibly brightened under the veiled light; a deep\nsilence pervaded the air and was emphasized, at intervals, rather than\nbroken, by the hooting of an owl, the baying of a dog, or the muffled\ncrash of a carving bank in the distance.\n\nThe little company assembled on the log were all children (at least in\nsimplicity and broad and comprehensive ignorance,) and the remarks they\nmade about the river were in keeping with the character; and so awed\nwere they by the grandeur and the solemnity of the scene before them,\nand by their belief that the air was filled with invisible spirits and\nthat the faint zephyrs were caused by their passing wings, that all\ntheir talk took to itself a tinge of the supernatural, and their voices\nwere subdued to a low and reverent tone. Suddenly Uncle Dan'l exclaimed:\n\n\u201cChil'en, dah's sum fin a comin!\u201d\n\nAll crowded close together and every heart beat faster.\n\nUncle Dan'l pointed down the river with his bony finger.\n\nA deep coughing sound troubled the stillness, way toward a wooded cape\nthat jetted into the stream a mile distant. All in an instant a fierce\neye of fire shot out from behind the cape and sent a long brilliant\npathway quivering athwart the dusky water. The coughing grew louder and\nlouder, the glaring eye grew larger and still larger, glared wilder and\nstill wilder. A huge shape developed itself out of the gloom, and from\nits tall duplicate horns dense volumes of smoke, starred and spangled\nwith sparks, poured out and went tumbling away into the farther\ndarkness. Nearer and nearer the thing came, till its long sides began\nto glow with spots of light which mirrored themselves in the river and\nattended the monster like a torchlight procession.\n\n\u201cWhat is it! Oh, what is it, Uncle Dan'l!\u201d\n\nWith deep solemnity the answer came:\n\n\u201cIt's de Almighty! Git down on yo' knees!\u201d\n\nIt was not necessary to say it twice. They were all kneeling, in\na moment. And then while the mysterious coughing rose stronger and\nstronger and the threatening glare reached farther and wider, the\nnegro's voice lifted up its supplications:\n\n\u201cO Lord', we's ben mighty wicked, an' we knows dat we 'zerve to go to\nde bad place, but good Lord, deah Lord, we ain't ready yit, we ain't\nready--let dese po' chilen hab one mo' chance, jes' one mo' chance. Take\nde ole niggah if you's got to hab somebody.--Good Lord, good deah Lord,\nwe don't know whah you's a gwyne to, we don't know who you's got yo' eye\non, but we knows by de way you's a comin', we knows by de way you's a\ntiltin' along in yo' charyot o' fiah dat some po' sinner's a gwyne\nto ketch it. But good Lord, dose chilen don't b'long heah, dey's f'm\nObedstown whah dey don't know nuffin, an' you knows, yo' own sef, dat\ndey ain't 'sponsible. An' deah Lord, good Lord, it ain't like yo' mercy,\nit ain't like yo' pity, it ain't like yo' long-sufferin' lovin' kindness\nfor to take dis kind o' 'vantage o' sick little chil'en as dose is when\ndey's so many ornery grown folks chuck full o' cussedness dat wants\nroastin' down dah. Oh, Lord, spah de little chil'en, don't tar de little\nchil'en away f'm dey frens, jes' let 'em off jes' dis once, and take it\nout'n de ole niggah. HEAH I IS, LORD, HEAH I IS! De ole niggah's ready,\nLord, de ole----\u201d\n\nThe flaming and churning steamer was right abreast the party, and not\ntwenty steps away. The awful thunder of a mud-valve suddenly burst\nforth, drowning the prayer, and as suddenly Uncle Dan'l snatched a child\nunder each arm and scoured into the woods with the rest of the pack at\nhis heels. And then, ashamed of himself, he halted in the deep darkness\nand shouted, (but rather feebly:)\n\n\u201cHeah I is, Lord, heah I is!\u201d\n\nThere was a moment of throbbing suspense, and then, to the surprise and\nthe comfort of the party, it was plain that the august presence had gone\nby, for its dreadful noises were receding. Uncle Dan'l headed a cautious\nreconnaissance in the direction of the log. Sure enough \u201cthe Lord\u201d\n was just turning a point a short distance up the river, and while they\nlooked the lights winked out and the coughing diminished by degrees and\npresently ceased altogether.\n\n\u201cH'wsh! Well now dey's some folks says dey ain't no 'ficiency in prah.\nDis Chile would like to know whah we'd a ben now if it warn't fo' dat\nprah? Dat's it. Dat's it!\u201d\n\n\u201cUncle Dan'l, do you reckon it was the prayer that saved us?\u201d said Clay.\n\n\u201cDoes I reckon? Don't I know it! Whah was yo' eyes? Warn't de Lord jes'\na cumin' chow! chow! CHOW! an' a goin' on turrible--an' do de Lord carry\non dat way 'dout dey's sumfin don't suit him? An' warn't he a lookin'\nright at dis gang heah, an' warn't he jes' a reachin' for 'em? An'\nd'you spec' he gwyne to let 'em off 'dout somebody ast him to do it? No\nindeedy!\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you reckon he saw, us, Uncle Dan'l?\n\n\u201cDe law sakes, Chile, didn't I see him a lookin' at us?\u201d.\n\n\u201cDid you feel scared, Uncle Dan'l?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo sah! When a man is 'gaged in prah, he ain't fraid o' nuffin--dey\ncan't nuffin tetch him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell what did you run for?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I--I--mars Clay, when a man is under de influence ob de sperit,\nhe do-no, what he's 'bout--no sah; dat man do-no what he's 'bout. You\nmout take an' tah de head off'n dat man an' he wouldn't scasely fine\nit out. Date's de Hebrew chil'en dat went frough de fiah; dey was burnt\nconsidable--ob coase dey was; but dey didn't know nuffin 'bout it--heal\nright up agin; if dey'd ben gals dey'd missed dey long haah, (hair,)\nmaybe, but dey wouldn't felt de burn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know but what they were girls. I think they were.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow mars Clay, you knows bettern dat. Sometimes a body can't tell\nwhedder you's a sayin' what you means or whedder you's a sayin' what you\ndon't mean, 'case you says 'em bofe de same way.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how should I know whether they were boys or girls?\u201d\n\n\u201cGoodness sakes, mars Clay, don't de Good Book say? 'Sides, don't it\ncall 'em de HE-brew chil'en? If dey was gals wouldn't dey be de SHE-brew\nchil'en? Some people dat kin read don't 'pear to take no notice when dey\ndo read.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Uncle Dan'l, I think that-----My! here comes another one up the\nriver! There can't be two!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe gone dis time--we done gone dis time, sho'! Dey ain't two, mars\nClay--days de same one. De Lord kin 'pear eberywhah in a second.\nGoodness, how do fiah and de smoke do belch up! Dat mean business,\nhoney. He comin' now like he fo'got sumfin. Come 'long, chil'en, time\nyou's gwyne to roos'. Go 'long wid you--ole Uncle Daniel gwyne out in de\nwoods to rastle in prah--de ole nigger gwyne to do what he kin to sabe\nyou agin.\u201d\n\nHe did go to the woods and pray; but he went so far that he doubted,\nhimself, if the Lord heard him when He went by.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n--Seventhly, Before his Voyage, He should make his peace with God,\nsatisfie his Creditors if he be in debt; Pray earnestly to God to\nprosper him in his Voyage, and to keep him from danger, and, if he\nbe 'sui juris' he should make his last will, and wisely order all his\naffairs, since many that go far abroad, return not home. (This good and\nChristian Counsel is given by Martinus Zeilerus in his Apodemical Canons\nbefore his Itinerary of Spain and Portugal.) Early in the morning Squire\nHawkins took passage in a small steamboat, with his family and his two\nslaves, and presently the bell rang, the stage-plank was hauled in, and\nthe vessel proceeded up the river. The children and the slaves were not\nmuch more at ease after finding out that this monster was a creature of\nhuman contrivance than they were the night before when they thought it\nthe Lord of heaven and earth. They started, in fright, every time the\ngauge-cocks sent out an angry hiss, and they quaked from head to foot\nwhen the mud-valves thundered. The shivering of the boat under the\nbeating of the wheels was sheer misery to them.\n\nBut of course familiarity with these things soon took away their\nterrors, and then the voyage at once became a glorious adventure, a\nroyal progress through the very heart and home of romance, a realization\nof their rosiest wonder-dreams. They sat by the hour in the shade of\nthe pilot house on the hurricane deck and looked out over the curving\nexpanses of the river sparkling in the sunlight. Sometimes the boat\nfought the mid-stream current, with a verdant world on either hand, and\nremote from both; sometimes she closed in under a point, where the dead\nwater and the helping eddies were, and shaved the bank so closely that\nthe decks were swept by the jungle of over-hanging willows and littered\nwith a spoil of leaves; departing from these \u201cpoints\u201d she regularly\ncrossed the river every five miles, avoiding the \u201cbight\u201d of the great\nbinds and thus escaping the strong current; sometimes she went out\nand skirted a high \u201cbluff\u201d sand-bar in the middle of the stream, and\noccasionally followed it up a little too far and touched upon the shoal\nwater at its head--and then the intelligent craft refused to run herself\naground, but \u201csmelt\u201d the bar, and straightway the foamy streak that\nstreamed away from her bows vanished, a great foamless wave rolled\nforward and passed her under way, and in this instant she leaned far\nover on her side, shied from the bar and fled square away from the\ndanger like a frightened thing--and the pilot was lucky if he managed\nto \u201cstraighten her up\u201d before she drove her nose into the opposite bank;\nsometimes she approached a solid wall of tall trees as if she meant to\nbreak through it, but all of a sudden a little crack would open just\nenough to admit her, and away she would go plowing through the \u201cchute\u201d\n with just barely room enough between the island on one side and the\nmain land on the other; in this sluggish water she seemed to go like a\nracehorse; now and then small log cabins appeared in little clearings,\nwith the never-failing frowsy women and girls in soiled and faded\nlinsey-woolsey leaning in the doors or against woodpiles and rail\nfences, gazing sleepily at the passing show; sometimes she found shoal\nwater, going out at the head of those \u201cchutes\u201d or crossing the river,\nand then a deck-hand stood on the bow and hove the lead, while the boat\nslowed down and moved cautiously; sometimes she stopped a moment at a\nlanding and took on some freight or a passenger while a crowd of slouchy\nwhite men and negroes stood on the bank and looked sleepily on with\ntheir hands in their pantaloons pockets,--of course--for they never took\nthem out except to stretch, and when they did this they squirmed about\nand reached their fists up into the air and lifted themselves on tip-toe\nin an ecstasy of enjoyment.\n\nWhen the sun went down it turned all the broad river to a national\nbanner laid in gleaming bars of gold and purple and crimson; and in time\nthese glories faded out in the twilight and left the fairy archipelagoes\nreflecting their fringing foliage in the steely mirror of the stream.\n\nAt night the boat forged on through the deep solitudes of the river,\nhardly ever discovering a light to testify to a human presence--mile\nafter mile and league after league the vast bends were guarded by\nunbroken walls of forest that had never been disturbed by the voice or\nthe foot-fall of man or felt the edge of his sacrilegious axe.\n\nAn hour after supper the moon came up, and Clay and Washington ascended\nto the hurricane deck to revel again in their new realm of enchantment.\nThey ran races up and down the deck; climbed about the bell; made\nfriends with the passenger-dogs chained under the lifeboat; tried to\nmake friends with a passenger-bear fastened to the verge-staff but were\nnot encouraged;\n\n\u201cskinned the cat\u201d on the hog-chains; in a word, exhausted the\namusement-possibilities of the deck. Then they looked wistfully up at\nthe pilot house, and finally, little by little, Clay ventured up there,\nfollowed diffidently by Washington. The pilot turned presently to \u201cget\nhis stern-marks,\u201d saw the lads and invited them in. Now their happiness\nwas complete. This cosy little house, built entirely of glass and\ncommanding a marvelous prospect in every direction was a magician's\nthrone to them and their enjoyment of the place was simply boundless.\n\nThey sat them down on a high bench and looked miles ahead and saw the\nwooded capes fold back and reveal the bends beyond; and they looked\nmiles to the rear and saw the silvery highway diminish its breadth by\ndegrees and close itself together in the distance. Presently the pilot\nsaid:\n\n\u201cBy George, yonder comes the Amaranth!\u201d\n\nA spark appeared, close to the water, several miles down the river. The\npilot took his glass and looked at it steadily for a moment, and said,\nchiefly to himself:\n\n\u201cIt can't be the Blue Wing. She couldn't pick us up this way. It's the\nAmaranth, sure!\u201d\n\nHe bent over a speaking tube and said:\n\n\u201cWho's on watch down there?\u201d\n\nA hollow, unhuman voice rumbled up through the tube in answer:\n\n\u201cI am. Second engineer.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood! You want to stir your stumps, now, Harry--the Amaranth's just\nturned the point--and she's just a--humping herself, too!\u201d\n\nThe pilot took hold of a rope that stretched out forward, jerked it\ntwice, and two mellow strokes of the big bell responded. A voice out on\nthe deck shouted:\n\n\u201cStand by, down there, with that labboard lead!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don't want the lead,\u201d said the pilot, \u201cI want you. Roust out the\nold man--tell him the Amaranth's coming. And go and call Jim--tell him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye-aye, sir!\u201d\n\nThe \u201cold man\u201d was the captain--he is always called so, on steamboats and\nships; \u201cJim\u201d was the other pilot. Within two minutes both of these men\nwere flying up the pilothouse stairway, three steps at a jump. Jim was\nin his shirt sleeves,--with his coat and vest on his arm. He said:\n\n\u201cI was just turning in. Where's the glass\u201d\n\nHe took it and looked:\n\n\u201cDon't appear to be any night-hawk on the jack-staff--it's the Amaranth,\ndead sure!\u201d\n\nThe captain took a good long look, and only said:\n\n\u201cDamnation!\u201d\n\nGeorge Davis, the pilot on watch, shouted to the night-watchman on deck:\n\n\u201cHow's she loaded?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo inches by the head, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201c'T ain't enough!\u201d\n\nThe captain shouted, now:\n\n\u201cCall the mate. Tell him to call all hands and get a lot of that sugar\nforrard--put her ten inches by the head. Lively, now!\u201d\n\n\u201cAye-aye, sir.\u201d\n\nA riot of shouting and trampling floated up from below, presently, and\nthe uneasy steering of the boat soon showed that she was getting \u201cdown\nby the head.\u201d\n\nThe three men in the pilot house began to talk in short, sharp\nsentences, low and earnestly. As their excitement rose, their voices\nwent down. As fast as one of them put down the spy-glass another took\nit up--but always with a studied air of calmness. Each time the verdict\nwas:\n\n\u201cShe's a gaining!\u201d\n\nThe captain spoke through the tube:\n\n\u201cWhat steam are you carrying?\u201d\n\n\u201cA hundred and forty-two, sir! But she's getting hotter and hotter all\nthe time.\u201d\n\nThe boat was straining and groaning and quivering like a monster in\npain. Both pilots were at work now, one on each side of the wheel, with\ntheir coats and vests off, their bosoms and collars wide open and the\nperspiration flowing down heir faces. They were holding the boat so\nclose to the shore that the willows swept the guards almost from stem to\nstern.\n\n\u201cStand by!\u201d whispered George.\n\n\u201cAll ready!\u201d said Jim, under his breath.\n\n\u201cLet her come!\u201d\n\nThe boat sprang away from the bank like a deer, and darted in a long\ndiagonal toward the other shore. She closed in again and thrashed her\nfierce way along the willows as before. The captain put down the glass:\n\n\u201cLord how she walks up on us! I do hate to be beat!\u201d\n\n\u201cJim,\u201d said George, looking straight ahead, watching the slightest\nyawing of the boat and promptly meeting it with the wheel, \u201chow'll it do\nto try Murderer's Chute?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it's--it's taking chances. How was the cottonwood stump on the\nfalse point below Boardman's Island this morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cWater just touching the roots.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell it's pretty close work. That gives six feet scant in the head of\nMurderer's Chute. We can just barely rub through if we hit it exactly\nright. But it's worth trying. She don't dare tackle it!\u201d--meaning the\nAmaranth.\n\nIn another instant the Boreas plunged into what seemed a crooked creek,\nand the Amaranth's approaching lights were shut out in a moment. Not\na whisper was uttered, now, but the three men stared ahead into the\nshadows and two of them spun the wheel back and forth with anxious\nwatchfulness while the steamer tore along. The chute seemed to come to\nan end every fifty yards, but always opened out in time. Now the head\nof it was at hand. George tapped the big bell three times, two leadsmen\nsprang to their posts, and in a moment their weird cries rose on the\nnight air and were caught up and repeated by two men on the upper deck:\n\n\u201cNo-o bottom!\u201d\n\n\u201cDe-e-p four!\u201d\n\n\u201cHalf three!\u201d\n\n\u201cQuarter three!\u201d\n\n\u201cMark under wa-a-ter three!\u201d\n\n\u201cHalf twain!\u201d\n\n\u201cQuarter twain!-----\u201d\n\nDavis pulled a couple of ropes--there was a jingling of small bells far\nbelow, the boat's speed slackened, and the pent steam began to whistle\nand the gauge-cocks to scream:\n\n\u201cBy the mark twain!\u201d\n\n\u201cQuar--ter--her--er--less twain!\u201d\n\n\u201cEight and a half!\u201d\n\n\u201cEight feet!\u201d\n\n\u201cSeven-ana-half!\u201d\n\nAnother jingling of little bells and the wheels ceased turning\naltogether. The whistling of the steam was something frightful now--it\nalmost drowned all other noises.\n\n\u201cStand by to meet her!\u201d\n\nGeorge had the wheel hard down and was standing on a spoke.\n\n\u201cAll ready!\u201d\n\nThe boat hesitated--seemed to hold her breath, as did the captain and\npilots--and then she began to fall away to starboard and every eye\nlighted:\n\n\u201cNow then!--meet her! meet her! Snatch her!\u201d\n\nThe wheel flew to port so fast that the spokes blended into a\nspider-web--the swing of the boat subsided--she steadied herself----\n\n\u201cSeven feet!\u201d\n\n\u201cSev--six and a half!\u201d\n\n\u201cSix feet! Six f----\u201d\n\nBang! She hit the bottom! George shouted through the tube:\n\n\u201cSpread her wide open! Whale it at her!\u201d\n\nPow-wow-chow! The escape-pipes belched snowy pillars of steam aloft, the\nboat ground and surged and trembled--and slid over into----\n\n\u201cM-a-r-k twain!\u201d\n\n\u201cQuarter-her----\u201d\n\n\u201cTap! tap! tap!\u201d (to signify \u201cLay in the leads\u201d)\n\nAnd away she went, flying up the willow shore, with the whole silver sea\nof the Mississippi stretching abroad on every hand.\n\nNo Amaranth in sight!\n\n\u201cHa-ha, boys, we took a couple of tricks that time!\u201d said the captain.\n\nAnd just at that moment a red glare appeared in the head of the chute\nand the Amaranth came springing after them!\n\n\u201cWell, I swear!\u201d\n\n\u201cJim, what is the meaning of that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll tell you what's the meaning of it. That hail we had at Napoleon\nwas Wash Hastings, wanting to come to Cairo--and we didn't stop. He's\nin that pilot house, now, showing those mud turtles how to hunt for easy\nwater.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's it! I thought it wasn't any slouch that was running that middle\nbar in Hog-eye Bend. If it's Wash Hastings--well, what he don't know\nabout the river ain't worth knowing--a regular gold-leaf, kid-glove,\ndiamond breastpin pilot Wash Hastings is. We won't take any tricks off\nof him, old man!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I'd a stopped for him, that's all.\u201d\n\nThe Amaranth was within three hundred yards of the Boreas, and still\ngaining. The \u201cold man\u201d spoke through the tube:\n\n\u201cWhat is she-carrying now?\u201d\n\n\u201cA hundred and sixty-five, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow's your wood?\u201d\n\n\u201cPine all out-cypress half gone-eating up cotton-wood like pie!\u201d\n\n\u201cBreak into that rosin on the main deck-pile it in, the boat can pay for\nit!\u201d\n\nSoon the boat was plunging and quivering and screaming more madly than\never. But the Amaranth's head was almost abreast the Boreas's stern:\n\n\u201cHow's your steam, now, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cHundred and eighty-two, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cBreak up the casks of bacon in the forrard hold! Pile it in! Levy on\nthat turpentine in the fantail-drench every stick of wood with it!\u201d\n\nThe boat was a moving earthquake by this time:\n\n\u201cHow is she now?\u201d\n\n\u201cA hundred and ninety-six and still a-swelling!--water, below the middle\ngauge-cocks!--carrying every pound she can stand!--nigger roosting on\nthe safety-valve!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood! How's your draft?\u201d\n\n\u201cBully! Every time a nigger heaves a stick of wood into the furnace he\ngoes out the chimney, with it!\u201d\n\nThe Amaranth drew steadily up till her jack-staff breasted the Boreas's\nwheel-house--climbed along inch by inch till her chimneys breasted\nit--crept along, further and further, till the boats were wheel to\nwheel--and then they closed up with a heavy jolt and locked together\ntight and fast in the middle of the big river under the flooding\nmoonlight! A roar and a hurrah went up from the crowded decks of\nboth steamers--all hands rushed to the guards to look and shout\nand gesticulate--the weight careened the vessels over toward each\nother--officers flew hither and thither cursing and storming, trying\nto drive the people amidships--both captains were leaning over their\nrailings shaking their fists, swearing and threatening--black volumes\nof smoke rolled up and canopied the scene,--delivering a rain of sparks\nupon the vessels--two pistol shots rang out, and both captains dodged\nunhurt and the packed masses of passengers surged back and fell apart\nwhile the shrieks of women and children soared above the intolerable\ndin----\n\nAnd then there was a booming roar, a thundering crash, and the riddled\nAmaranth dropped loose from her hold and drifted helplessly away!\n\nInstantly the fire-doors of the Boreas were thrown open and the men\nbegan dashing buckets of water into the furnaces--for it would have been\ndeath and destruction to stop the engines with such a head of steam on.\n\nAs soon as possible the Boreas dropped down to the floating wreck and\ntook off the dead, the wounded and the unhurt--at least all that could\nbe got at, for the whole forward half of the boat was a shapeless ruin,\nwith the great chimneys lying crossed on top of it, and underneath were\na dozen victims imprisoned alive and wailing for help. While men with\naxes worked with might and main to free these poor fellows, the Boreas's\nboats went about, picking up stragglers from the river.\n\nAnd now a new horror presented itself. The wreck took fire from the\ndismantled furnaces! Never did men work with a heartier will than did\nthose stalwart braves with the axes. But it was of no use. The fire\nate its way steadily, despising the bucket brigade that fought it. It\nscorched the clothes, it singed the hair of the axemen--it drove them\nback, foot by foot--inch by inch--they wavered, struck a final blow\nin the teeth of the enemy, and surrendered. And as they fell back they\nheard prisoned voices saying:\n\n\u201cDon't leave us! Don't desert us! Don't, don't do it!\u201d\n\nAnd one poor fellow said:\n\n\u201cI am Henry Worley, striker of the Amaranth! My mother lives in St.\nLouis. Tell her a lie for a poor devil's sake, please. Say I was killed\nin an instant and never knew what hurt me--though God knows I've neither\nscratch nor bruise this moment! It's hard to burn up in a coop like this\nwith the whole wide world so near. Good-bye boys--we've all got to come\nto it at last, anyway!\u201d\n\nThe Boreas stood away out of danger, and the ruined steamer went\ndrifting down the stream an island of wreathing and climbing flame that\nvomited clouds of smoke from time to time, and glared more fiercely\nand sent its luminous tongues higher and higher after each emission. A\nshriek at intervals told of a captive that had met his doom. The wreck\nlodged upon a sandbar, and when the Boreas turned the next point on her\nupward journey it was still burning with scarcely abated fury.\n\nWhen the boys came down into the main saloon of the Boreas, they saw a\npitiful sight and heard a world of pitiful sounds. Eleven poor creatures\nlay dead and forty more lay moaning, or pleading or screaming, while\na score of Good Samaritans moved among them doing what they could to\nrelieve their sufferings; bathing their chinless faces and bodies with\nlinseed oil and lime water and covering the places with bulging masses\nof raw cotton that gave to every face and form a dreadful and unhuman\naspect.\n\nA little wee French midshipman of fourteen lay fearfully injured, but\nnever uttered a sound till a physician of Memphis was about to dress his\nhurts. Then he said:\n\n\u201cCan I get well? You need not be afraid to tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo--I--I am afraid you can not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen do not waste your time with me--help those that can get well.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut----\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp those that can get well! It is, not for me to be a girl. I carry\nthe blood of eleven generations of soldiers in my veins!\u201d\n\nThe physician--himself a man who had seen service in the navy in his\ntime--touched his hat to this little hero, and passed on.\n\nThe head engineer of the Amaranth, a grand specimen of physical manhood,\nstruggled to his feet a ghastly spectacle and strode toward his brother,\nthe second engineer, who was unhurt. He said:\n\n\u201cYou were on watch. You were boss. You would not listen to me when I\nbegged you to reduce your steam. Take that!--take it to my wife and tell\nher it comes from me by the hand of my murderer! Take it--and take my\ncurse with it to blister your heart a hundred years--and may you live so\nlong!\u201d\n\nAnd he tore a ring from his finger, stripping flesh and skin with it,\nthrew it down and fell dead!\n\nBut these things must not be dwelt upon. The Boreas landed her dreadful\ncargo at the next large town and delivered it over to a multitude of\neager hands and warm southern hearts--a cargo amounting by this time to\n39 wounded persons and 22 dead bodies. And with these she delivered a\nlist of 96 missing persons that had drowned or otherwise perished at the\nscene of the disaster.\n\nA jury of inquest was impaneled, and after due deliberation and inquiry\nthey returned the inevitable American verdict which has been so familiar\nto our ears all the days of our lives--\u201cNOBODY TO BLAME.\u201d\n\n**[The incidents of the explosion are not invented. They happened just\nas they are told.--The Authors.]\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nIl veut faire secher de la neige au four et la vendre pour du sel blanc.\nWhen the Boreas backed away from the land to continue her voyage up the\nriver, the Hawkinses were richer by twenty-four hours of experience in\nthe contemplation of human suffering and in learning through honest hard\nwork how to relieve it. And they were richer in another way also. In the\nearly turmoil an hour after the explosion, a little black-eyed girl of\nfive years, frightened and crying bitterly, was struggling through the\nthrong in the Boreas' saloon calling her mother and father, but no one\nanswered. Something in the face of Mr. Hawkins attracted her and she\ncame and looked up at him; was satisfied, and took refuge with him. He\npetted her, listened to her troubles, and said he would find her friends\nfor her. Then he put her in a state-room with his children and told\nthem to be kind to her (the adults of his party were all busy with the\nwounded) and straightway began his search.\n\nIt was fruitless. But all day he and his wife made inquiries, and hoped\nagainst hope. All that they could learn was that the child and her\nparents came on board at New Orleans, where they had just arrived in a\nvessel from Cuba; that they looked like people from the Atlantic States;\nthat the family name was Van Brunt and the child's name Laura. This\nwas all. The parents had not been seen since the explosion. The child's\nmanners were those of a little lady, and her clothes were daintier and\nfiner than any Mrs. Hawkins had ever seen before.\n\nAs the hours dragged on the child lost heart, and cried so piteously\nfor her mother that it seemed to the Hawkinses that the moanings and the\nwailings of the mutilated men and women in the saloon did not so\nstrain at their heart-strings as the sufferings of this little desolate\ncreature. They tried hard to comfort her; and in trying, learned to love\nher; they could not help it, seeing how she clung, to them and put her\narms about their necks and found no solace but in their kind eyes and\ncomforting words: There was a question in both their hearts--a question\nthat rose up and asserted itself with more and more pertinacity as\nthe hours wore on--but both hesitated to give it voice--both kept\nsilence--and--waited. But a time came at last when the matter would bear\ndelay no longer. The boat had landed, and the dead and the wounded were\nbeing conveyed to the shore. The tired child was asleep in the arms of\nMrs. Hawkins. Mr. Hawkins came into their presence and stood without\nspeaking. His eyes met his wife's; then both looked at the child--and as\nthey looked it stirred in its sleep and nestled closer; an expression\nof contentment and peace settled upon its face that touched the\nmother-heart; and when the eyes of husband and wife met again, the\nquestion was asked and answered.\n\nWhen the Boreas had journeyed some four hundred miles from the time the\nHawkinses joined her, a long rank of steamboats was sighted, packed side\nby side at a wharf like sardines, in a box, and above and beyond them\nrose the domes and steeples and general architectural confusion of a\ncity--a city with an imposing umbrella of black smoke spread over it.\nThis was St. Louis. The children of the Hawkins family were playing\nabout the hurricane deck, and the father and mother were sitting in the\nlee of the pilot house essaying to keep order and not greatly grieved\nthat they were not succeeding.\n\n\u201cThey're worth all the trouble they are, Nancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and more, Si.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe you! You wouldn't sell one of them at a good round figure?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot for all the money in the bank, Si.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy own sentiments every time. It is true we are not rich--but still you\nare not sorry---you haven't any misgivings about the additions?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. God will provide\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen. And so you wouldn't even part with Clay? Or Laura!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot for anything in the world. I love them just the same as I love my\nown: They pet me and spoil me even more than the others do, I think. I\nreckon we'll get along, Si.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, it will all come out right, old mother. I wouldn't be afraid\nto adopt a thousand children if I wanted to, for there's that Tennessee\nLand, you know--enough to make an army of them rich. A whole army,\nNancy! You and I will never see the day, but these little chaps will.\nIndeed they will. One of these days it will be the rich Miss Emily\nHawkins--and the wealthy Miss Laura Van Brunt Hawkins--and the Hon.\nGeorge Washington Hawkins, millionaire--and Gov. Henry Clay Hawkins,\nmillionaire! That is the way the world will word it! Don't let's ever\nfret about the children, Nancy--never in the world. They're all right.\nNancy, there's oceans and oceans of money in that land--mark my words!\u201d\n\nThe children had stopped playing, for the moment, and drawn near to\nlisten. Hawkins said:\n\n\u201cWashington, my boy, what will you do when you get to be one of the\nrichest men in the world?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know, father. Sometimes I think I'll have a balloon and go\nup in the air; and sometimes I think I'll have ever so many books; and\nsometimes I think I'll have ever so many weathercocks and water-wheels;\nor have a machine like that one you and Colonel Sellers bought; and\nsometimes I think I'll have--well, somehow I don't know--somehow I ain't\ncertain; maybe I'll get a steamboat first.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same old chap!--always just a little bit divided about things.--And\nwhat will you do when you get to be one of the richest men in the world,\nClay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know, sir. My mother--my other mother that's gone away--she\nalways told me to work along and not be much expecting to get rich, and\nthen I wouldn't be disappointed if I didn't get rich. And so I reckon\nit's better for me to wait till I get rich, and then by that time maybe\nI'll know what I'll want--but I don't now, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cCareful old head!--Governor Henry Clay Hawkins!--that's what you'll be,\nClay, one of these days. Wise old head! weighty old head! Go on, now,\nand play--all of you. It's a prime lot, Nancy; as the Obedstown folk say\nabout their hogs.\u201d\n\nA smaller steamboat received the Hawkinses and their fortunes, and bore\nthem a hundred and thirty miles still higher up the Mississippi, and\nlanded them at a little tumble-down village on the Missouri shore in the\ntwilight of a mellow October day.\n\nThe next morning they harnessed up their team and for two days they\nwended slowly into the interior through almost roadless and uninhabited\nforest solitudes. And when for the last time they pitched their tents,\nmetaphorically speaking, it was at the goal of their hopes, their new\nhome.\n\nBy the muddy roadside stood a new log cabin, one story high--the store;\nclustered in the neighborhood were ten or twelve more cabins, some new,\nsome old.\n\nIn the sad light of the departing day the place looked homeless enough.\nTwo or three coatless young men sat in front of the store on a dry-goods\nbox, and whittled it with their knives, kicked it with their vast boots,\nand shot tobacco-juice at various marks. Several ragged negroes leaned\ncomfortably against the posts of the awning and contemplated the arrival\nof the wayfarers with lazy curiosity. All these people presently managed\nto drag themselves to the vicinity of the Hawkins' wagon, and there they\ntook up permanent positions, hands in pockets and resting on one leg;\nand thus anchored they proceeded to look and enjoy. Vagrant dogs came\nwagging around and making inquiries of Hawkins's dog, which were not\nsatisfactory and they made war on him in concert. This would have\ninterested the citizens but it was too many on one to amount to anything\nas a fight, and so they commanded the peace and the foreign dog coiled\nhis tail and took sanctuary under the wagon. Slatternly negro girls\nand women slouched along with pails deftly balanced on their heads, and\njoined the group and stared. Little half dressed white boys, and little\nnegro boys with nothing whatever on but tow-linen shirts with a fine\nsouthern exposure, came from various directions and stood with their\nhands locked together behind them and aided in the inspection. The rest\nof the population were laying down their employments and getting\nready to come, when a man burst through the assemblage and seized the\nnew-comers by the hands in a frenzy of welcome, and exclaimed--indeed\nalmost shouted:\n\n\u201cWell who could have believed it! Now is it you sure enough--turn\naround! hold up your heads! I want to look at you good! Well, well,\nwell, it does seem most too good to be true, I declare! Lord, I'm so\nglad to see you! Does a body's whole soul good to look at you! Shake\nhands again! Keep on shaking hands! Goodness gracious alive. What will\nmy wife say?--Oh yes indeed, it's so!--married only last week--lovely,\nperfectly lovely creature, the noblest woman that ever--you'll like\nher, Nancy! Like her? Lord bless me you'll love her--you'll dote on\nher--you'll be twins! Well, well, well, let me look at you again! Same\nold--why bless my life it was only jest this very morning that my wife\nsays, 'Colonel'--she will call me Colonel spite of everything I can\ndo--she says 'Colonel, something tells me somebody's coming!' and\nsure enough here you are, the last people on earth a body could have\nexpected. Why she'll think she's a prophetess--and hanged if I don't\nthink so too--and you know there ain't any country but what a prophet's\nan honor to, as the proverb says. Lord bless me and here's the children,\ntoo! Washington, Emily, don't you know me? Come, give us a kiss. Won't\nI fix you, though!--ponies, cows, dogs, everything you can think of\nthat'll delight a child's heart--and--Why how's this? Little strangers?\nWell you won't be any strangers here, I can tell you. Bless your souls\nwe'll make you think you never was at home before--'deed and 'deed we\nwill, I can tell you! Come, now, bundle right along with me. You can't\nglorify any hearth stone but mine in this camp, you know--can't eat\nanybody's bread but mine--can't do anything but just make yourselves\nperfectly at home and comfortable, and spread yourselves out and rest!\nYou hear me! Here--Jim, Tom, Pete, Jake, fly around! Take that team to\nmy place--put the wagon in my lot--put the horses under the shed, and\nget out hay and oats and fill them up! Ain't any hay and oats? Well get\nsome--have it charged to me--come, spin around, now! Now, Hawkins, the\nprocession's ready; mark time, by the left flank, forward-march!\u201d\n\nAnd the Colonel took the lead, with Laura astride his neck, and the\nnewly-inspired and very grateful immigrants picked up their tired limbs\nwith quite a spring in them and dropped into his wake.\n\nPresently they were ranged about an old-time fire-place whose blazing\nlogs sent out rather an unnecessary amount of heat, but that was no\nmatter--supper was needed, and to have it, it had to be cooked. This\napartment was the family bedroom, parlor, library and kitchen, all in\none. The matronly little wife of the Colonel moved hither and thither\nand in and out with her pots and pans in her hands, happiness in her\nheart and a world of admiration of her husband in her eyes.\n\nAnd when at last she had spread the cloth and loaded it with hot corn\nbread, fried chickens, bacon, buttermilk, coffee, and all manner of\ncountry luxuries, Col. Sellers modified his harangue and for a moment\nthrottled it down to the orthodox pitch for a blessing, and then\ninstantly burst forth again as from a parenthesis and clattered on with\nmight and main till every stomach in the party was laden with all\nit could carry. And when the new-comers ascended the ladder to their\ncomfortable feather beds on the second floor--to wit the garret--Mrs.\nHawkins was obliged to say:\n\n\u201cHang the fellow, I do believe he has gone wilder than ever, but still\na body can't help liking him if they would--and what is more, they don't\never want to try when they see his eyes and hear him talk.\u201d\n\nWithin a week or two the Hawkinses were comfortably domiciled in a new\nlog house, and were beginning to feel at home. The children were put to\nschool; at least it was what passed for a school in those days: a place\nwhere tender young humanity devoted itself for eight or ten hours a day\nto learning incomprehensible rubbish by heart out of books and reciting\nit by rote, like parrots; so that a finished education consisted simply\nof a permanent headache and the ability to read without stopping to\nspell the words or take breath. Hawkins bought out the village store for\na song and proceeded to reap the profits, which amounted to but little\nmore than another song.\n\nThe wonderful speculation hinted at by Col. Sellers in his letter turned\nout to be the raising of mules for the Southern market; and really it\npromised very well. The young stock cost but a trifle, the rearing\nbut another trifle, and so Hawkins was easily persuaded to embark his\nslender means in the enterprise and turn over the keep and care of the\nanimals to Sellers and Uncle Dan'l.\n\nAll went well: Business prospered little by little. Hawkins even built a\nnew house, made it two full stories high and put a lightning rod on it.\nPeople came two or three miles to look at it. But they knew that the rod\nattracted the lightning, and so they gave the place a wide berth in\na storm, for they were familiar with marksmanship and doubted if the\nlightning could hit that small stick at a distance of a mile and a half\noftener than once in a hundred and fifty times. Hawkins fitted out\nhis house with \u201cstore\u201d furniture from St. Louis, and the fame of its\nmagnificence went abroad in the land. Even the parlor carpet was from\nSt. Louis--though the other rooms were clothed in the \u201crag\u201d carpeting\nof the country. Hawkins put up the first \u201cpaling\u201d fence that had ever\nadorned the village; and he did not stop there, but whitewashed it. His\noil-cloth window-curtains had noble pictures on them of castles such\nas had never been seen anywhere in the world but on window-curtains.\nHawkins enjoyed the admiration these prodigies compelled, but he always\nsmiled to think how poor and cheap they were, compared to what the\nHawkins mansion would display in a future day after the Tennessee Land\nshould have borne its minted fruit. Even Washington observed, once, that\nwhen the Tennessee Land was sold he would have a \u201cstore\u201d carpet in his\nand Clay's room like the one in the parlor. This pleased Hawkins, but\nit troubled his wife. It did not seem wise, to her, to put one's entire\nearthly trust in the Tennessee Land and never think of doing any work.\n\nHawkins took a weekly Philadelphia newspaper and a semi-weekly St. Louis\njournal--almost the only papers that came to the village, though Godey's\nLady's Book found a good market there and was regarded as the perfection\nof polite literature by some of the ablest critics in the place. Perhaps\nit is only fair to explain that we are writing of a by gone age--some\ntwenty or thirty years ago. In the two newspapers referred to lay the\nsecret of Hawkins's growing prosperity. They kept him informed of the\ncondition of the crops south and east, and thus he knew which articles\nwere likely to be in demand and which articles were likely to be\nunsalable, weeks and even months in advance of the simple folk about\nhim. As the months went by he came to be regarded as a wonderfully lucky\nman. It did not occur to the citizens that brains were at the bottom of\nhis luck.\n\nHis title of \u201cSquire\u201d came into vogue again, but only for a season; for,\nas his wealth and popularity augmented, that title, by imperceptible\nstages, grew up into \u201cJudge;\u201d indeed it bade fair to swell into\n\u201cGeneral\u201d bye and bye. All strangers of consequence who visited the\nvillage gravitated to the Hawkins Mansion and became guests of the\n\u201cJudge.\u201d\n\nHawkins had learned to like the people of his section very much. They\nwere uncouth and not cultivated, and not particularly industrious; but\nthey were honest and straightforward, and their virtuous ways commanded\nrespect. Their patriotism was strong, their pride in the flag was of\nthe old fashioned pattern, their love of country amounted to idolatry.\nWhoever dragged the national honor in the dirt won their deathless\nhatred. They still cursed Benedict Arnold as if he were a personal\nfriend who had broken faith--but a week gone by.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nWe skip ten years and this history finds certain changes to record.\nJudge Hawkins and Col. Sellers have made and lost two or three moderate\nfortunes in the meantime and are now pinched by poverty. Sellers has two\npairs of twins and four extras. In Hawkins's family are six children of\nhis own and two adopted ones. From time to time, as fortune smiled,\nthe elder children got the benefit of it, spending the lucky seasons\nat excellent schools in St. Louis and the unlucky ones at home in the\nchafing discomfort of straightened circumstances.\n\nNeither the Hawkins children nor the world that knew them ever supposed\nthat one of the girls was of alien blood and parentage: Such difference\nas existed between Laura and Emily is not uncommon in a family. The\ngirls had grown up as sisters, and they were both too young at the time\nof the fearful accident on the Mississippi to know that it was that\nwhich had thrown their lives together.\n\nAnd yet any one who had known the secret of Laura's birth and had\nseen her during these passing years, say at the happy age of twelve or\nthirteen, would have fancied that he knew the reason why she was more\nwinsome than her school companion.\n\nPhilosophers dispute whether it is the promise of what she will be in\nthe careless school-girl, that makes her attractive, the undeveloped\nmaidenhood, or the mere natural, careless sweetness of childhood. If\nLaura at twelve was beginning to be a beauty, the thought of it had\nnever entered her head. No, indeed. Her mind was filled with more\nimportant thoughts. To her simple school-girl dress she was beginning\nto add those mysterious little adornments of ribbon-knots and ear-rings,\nwhich were the subject of earnest consultations with her grown friends.\n\nWhen she tripped down the street on a summer's day with her dainty\nhands propped into the ribbon-broidered pockets of her apron, and elbows\nconsequently more or less akimbo with her wide Leghorn hat flapping down\nand hiding her face one moment and blowing straight up against her fore\nhead the next and making its revealment of fresh young beauty; with\nall her pretty girlish airs and graces in full play, and that sweet\nignorance of care and that atmosphere of innocence and purity all about\nher that belong to her gracious time of life, indeed she was a vision to\nwarm the coldest heart and bless and cheer the saddest.\n\nWillful, generous, forgiving, imperious, affectionate, improvident,\nbewitching, in short--was Laura at this period. Could she have remained\nthere, this history would not need to be written. But Laura had grown\nto be almost a woman in these few years, to the end of which we have now\ncome--years which had seen Judge Hawkins pass through so many trials.\n\nWhen the judge's first bankruptcy came upon him, a homely human angel\nintruded upon him with an offer of $1,500 for the Tennessee Land.\nMrs. Hawkins said take it. It was a grievous temptation, but the judge\nwithstood it. He said the land was for the children--he could not rob\nthem of their future millions for so paltry a sum. When the second\nblight fell upon him, another angel appeared and offered $3,000 for the\nland. He was in such deep distress that he allowed his wife to persuade\nhim to let the papers be drawn; but when his children came into his\npresence in their poor apparel, he felt like a traitor and refused to\nsign.\n\nBut now he was down again, and deeper in the mire than ever. He paced\nthe floor all day, he scarcely slept at night. He blushed even\nto acknowledge it to himself, but treason was in his mind--he was\nmeditating, at last, the sale of the land. Mrs. Hawkins stepped into\nthe room. He had not spoken a word, but he felt as guilty as if she had\ncaught him in some shameful act. She said:\n\n\u201cSi, I do not know what we are going to do. The children are not fit to\nbe seen, their clothes are in such a state. But there's something more\nserious still.--There is scarcely a bite in the house to eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, Nancy, go to Johnson----.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohnson indeed! You took that man's part when he hadn't a friend in the\nworld, and you built him up and made him rich. And here's the result of\nit: He lives in our fine house, and we live in his miserable log cabin.\nHe has hinted to our children that he would rather they wouldn't come\nabout his yard to play with his children,--which I can bear, and bear\neasy enough, for they're not a sort we want to associate with much--but\nwhat I can't bear with any quietness at all, is his telling Franky\nour bill was running pretty high this morning when I sent him for some\nmeal--and that was all he said, too--didn't give him the meal--turned\noff and went to talking with the Hargrave girls about some stuff they\nwanted to cheapen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNancy, this is astounding!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so it is, I warrant you. I've kept still, Si, as long as ever I\ncould. Things have been getting worse and worse, and worse and worse,\nevery single day; I don't go out of the house, I feel so down; but you\nhad trouble enough, and I wouldn't say a word--and I wouldn't say a word\nnow, only things have got so bad that I don't know what to do, nor where\nto turn.\u201d And she gave way and put her face in her hands and cried.\n\n\u201cPoor child, don't grieve so. I never thought that of Johnson. I am\nclear at my wit's end. I don't know what in the world to do. Now if\nsomebody would come along and offer $3,000--Uh, if somebody only would\ncome along and offer $3,000 for that Tennessee Land.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou'd sell it, Si!\u201d said Mrs. Hawkins excitedly.\n\n\u201cTry me!\u201d\n\nMrs. Hawkins was out of the room in a moment. Within a minute she was\nback again with a business-looking stranger, whom she seated, and then\nshe took her leave again. Hawkins said to himself, \u201cHow can a man ever\nlose faith? When the blackest hour comes, Providence always comes with\nit--ah, this is the very timeliest help that ever poor harried devil\nhad; if this blessed man offers but a thousand I'll embrace him like a\nbrother!\u201d\n\nThe stranger said:\n\n\u201cI am aware that you own 75,000 acres, of land in East Tennessee, and\nwithout sacrificing your time, I will come to the point at once. I am\nagent of an iron manufacturing company, and they empower me to offer you\nten thousand dollars for that land.\u201d\n\nHawkins's heart bounded within him. His whole frame was racked and\nwrenched with fettered hurrahs. His first impulse was to shout \u201cDone!\nand God bless the iron company, too!\u201d\n\nBut a something flitted through his mind, and his opened lips uttered\nnothing. The enthusiasm faded away from his eyes, and the look of a man\nwho is thinking took its place. Presently, in a hesitating, undecided\nway, he said:\n\n\u201cWell, I--it don't seem quite enough. That--that is a very valuable\nproperty--very valuable. It's brim full of iron-ore, sir--brim full of\nit! And copper, coal,--everything--everything you can think of! Now,\nI'll tell you what I'll do. I'll reserve everything except the iron, and\nI'll sell them the iron property for $15,000 cash, I to go in with them\nand own an undivided interest of one-half the concern--or the stock,\nas you may say. I'm out of business, and I'd just as soon help run the\nthing as not. Now how does that strike you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I am only an agent of these people, who are friends of mine, and\nI am not even paid for my services. To tell you the truth, I have tried\nto persuade them not to go into the thing; and I have come square out\nwith their offer, without throwing out any feelers--and I did it in the\nhope that you would refuse. A man pretty much always refuses another\nman's first offer, no matter what it is. But I have performed my duty,\nand will take pleasure in telling them what you say.\u201d\n\nHe was about to rise. Hawkins said,\n\n\u201cWait a bit.\u201d\n\nHawkins thought again. And the substance of his thought was: \u201cThis is\na deep man; this is a very deep man; I don't like his candor; your\nostentatiously candid business man's a deep fox--always a deep fox;\nthis man's that iron company himself--that's what he is; he wants that\nproperty, too; I am not so blind but I can see that; he don't want the\ncompany to go into this thing--O, that's very good; yes, that's very\ngood indeed--stuff! he'll be back here tomorrow, sure, and take my\noffer; take it? I'll risk anything he is suffering to take it now;\nhere--I must mind what I'm about. What has started this sudden\nexcitement about iron? I wonder what is in the wind? just as sure as\nI'm alive this moment, there's something tremendous stirring in iron\nspeculation\u201d [here Hawkins got up and began to pace the floor with\nexcited eyes and with gesturing hands]--\u201csomething enormous going on in\niron, without the shadow of a doubt, and here I sit mousing in the dark\nand never knowing anything about it; great heaven, what an escape I've\nmade! this underhanded mercenary creature might have taken me up--and\nruined me! but I have escaped, and I warrant me I'll not put my foot\ninto--\u201d\n\nHe stopped and turned toward the stranger; saying:\n\n\u201cI have made you a proposition, you have not accepted it, and I desire\nthat you will consider that I have made none. At the same time my\nconscience will not allow me to--. Please alter the figures I named to\nthirty thousand dollars, if you will, and let the proposition go to the\ncompany--I will stick to it if it breaks my heart!\u201d The stranger looked\namused, and there was a pretty well defined touch of surprise in his\nexpression, too, but Hawkins never noticed it. Indeed he scarcely\nnoticed anything or knew what he was about. The man left; Hawkins flung\nhimself into a chair; thought a few moments, then glanced around, looked\nfrightened, sprang to the door----\n\n\u201cToo late--too late! He's gone! Fool that I am! always a fool! Thirty\nthousand--ass that I am! Oh, why didn't I say fifty thousand!\u201d\n\nHe plunged his hands into his hair and leaned his elbows on his knees,\nand fell to rocking himself back and forth in anguish. Mrs. Hawkins\nsprang in, beaming:\n\n\u201cWell, Si?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, con-found the con-founded--con-found it, Nancy. I've gone and done\nit, now!\u201d\n\n\u201cDone what Si for mercy's sake!\u201d\n\n\u201cDone everything! Ruined everything!\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me, tell me, tell me! Don't keep a body in such suspense. Didn't\nhe buy, after all? Didn't he make an offer?\u201d\n\n\u201cOffer? He offered $10,000 for our land, and----\u201d\n\n\u201cThank the good providence from the very bottom of my heart of hearts!\nWhat sort of ruin do you call that, Si!\u201d\n\n\u201cNancy, do you suppose I listened to such a preposterous proposition?\nNo! Thank fortune I'm not a simpleton! I saw through the pretty scheme\nin a second. It's a vast iron speculation!--millions upon millions in\nit! But fool as I am I told him he could have half the iron property for\nthirty thousand--and if I only had him back here he couldn't touch it\nfor a cent less than a quarter of a million!\u201d\n\nMrs. Hawkins looked up white and despairing:\n\n\u201cYou threw away this chance, you let this man go, and we in this awful\ntrouble? You don't mean it, you can't mean it!\u201d\n\n\u201cThrow it away? Catch me at it! Why woman, do you suppose that man don't\nknow what he is about? Bless you, he'll be back fast enough to-morrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever, never, never. He never will comeback. I don't know what is to\nbecome of us. I don't know what in the world is to become of us.\u201d\n\nA shade of uneasiness came into Hawkins's face. He said:\n\n\u201cWhy, Nancy, you--you can't believe what you are saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cBelieve it, indeed? I know it, Si. And I know that we haven't a cent in\nthe world, and we've sent ten thousand dollars a-begging.\u201d\n\n\u201cNancy, you frighten me. Now could that man--is it possible that\nI--hanged if I don't believe I have missed a chance! Don't grieve,\nNancy, don't grieve. I'll go right after him. I'll take--I'll take--what\na fool I am!--I'll take anything he'll give!\u201d\n\nThe next instant he left the house on a run. But the man was no longer\nin the town. Nobody knew where he belonged or whither he had gone.\nHawkins came slowly back, watching wistfully but hopelessly for the\nstranger, and lowering his price steadily with his sinking heart. And\nwhen his foot finally pressed his own threshold, the value he held the\nentire Tennessee property at was five hundred dollars--two hundred down\nand the rest in three equal annual payments, without interest.\n\nThere was a sad gathering at the Hawkins fireside the next night. All\nthe children were present but Clay. Mr. Hawkins said:\n\n\u201cWashington, we seem to be hopelessly fallen, hopelessly involved. I am\nready to give up. I do not know where to turn--I never have been down so\nlow before, I never have seen things so dismal. There are many mouths\nto feed; Clay is at work; we must lose you, also, for a little while, my\nboy. But it will not be long--the Tennessee land----\u201d\n\nHe stopped, and was conscious of a blush. There was silence for a\nmoment, and then Washington--now a lank, dreamy-eyed stripling between\ntwenty-two and twenty-three years of age--said:\n\n\u201cIf Col. Sellers would come for me, I would go and stay with him a\nwhile, till the Tennessee land is sold. He has often wanted me to come,\never since he moved to Hawkeye.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm afraid he can't well come for you, Washington. From what I can\nhear--not from him of course, but from others--he is not far from as bad\noff as we are--and his family is as large, too. He might find something\nfor you to do, maybe, but you'd better try to get to him yourself,\nWashington--it's only thirty miles.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how can I, father? There's no stage or anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if there were, stages require money. A stage goes from Swansea,\nfive miles from here. But it would be cheaper to walk.\u201d\n\n\u201cFather, they must know you there, and no doubt they would credit you in\na moment, for a little stage ride like that. Couldn't you write and ask\nthem?\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn't you, Washington--seeing it's you that wants the ride? And what\ndo you think you'll do, Washington, when you get to Hawkeye? Finish your\ninvention for making window-glass opaque?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir, I have given that up. I almost knew I could do it, but it was\nso tedious and troublesome I quit it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was afraid of it, my boy. Then I suppose you'll finish your plan of\ncoloring hen's eggs by feeding a peculiar diet to the hen?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir. I believe I have found out the stuff that will do it, but it\nkills the hen; so I have dropped that for the present, though I can take\nit up again some day when I learn how to manage the mixture better.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what have you got on hand--anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, three or four things. I think they are all good and can all\nbe done, but they are tiresome, and besides they require money. But as\nsoon as the land is sold----\u201d\n\n\u201cEmily, were you about to say something?\u201d said Hawkins.\n\n\u201cYes, sir. If you are willing, I will go to St. Louis. That will make\nanother mouth less to feed. Mrs. Buckner has always wanted me to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the money, child?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy I think she would send it, if you would write her--and I know she\nwould wait for her pay till----\u201d\n\n\u201cCome, Laura, let's hear from you, my girl.\u201d\n\nEmily and Laura were about the same age--between seventeen and eighteen.\nEmily was fair and pretty, girlish and diffident--blue eyes and light\nhair. Laura had a proud bearing, and a somewhat mature look; she had\nfine, clean-cut features, her complexion was pure white and contrasted\nvividly with her black hair and eyes; she was not what one calls\npretty--she was beautiful. She said:\n\n\u201cI will go to St. Louis, too, sir. I will find a way to get there. I\nwill make a way. And I will find a way to help myself along, and do what\nI can to help the rest, too.\u201d\n\nShe spoke it like a princess. Mrs. Hawkins smiled proudly and kissed\nher, saying in a tone of fond reproof:\n\n\u201cSo one of my girls is going to turn out and work for her living! It's\nlike your pluck and spirit, child, but we will hope that we haven't got\nquite down to that, yet.\u201d\n\nThe girl's eyes beamed affection under her mother's caress. Then she\nstraightened up, folded her white hands in her lap and became a splendid\nice-berg. Clay's dog put up his brown nose for a little attention, and\ngot it. He retired under the table with an apologetic yelp, which did\nnot affect the iceberg.\n\nJudge Hawkins had written and asked Clay to return home and consult with\nhim upon family affairs. He arrived the evening after this conversation,\nand the whole household gave him a rapturous welcome. He brought sadly\nneeded help with him, consisting of the savings of a year and a half of\nwork--nearly two hundred dollars in money.\n\nIt was a ray of sunshine which (to this easy household) was the earnest\nof a clearing sky.\n\nBright and early in the morning the family were astir, and all were\nbusy preparing Washington for his journey--at least all but Washington\nhimself, who sat apart, steeped in a reverie. When the time for his\ndeparture came, it was easy to see how fondly all loved him and how hard\nit was to let him go, notwithstanding they had often seen him go before,\nin his St. Louis schooling days. In the most matter-of-course way they\nhad borne the burden of getting him ready for his trip, never seeming\nto think of his helping in the matter; in the same matter-of-course way\nClay had hired a horse and cart; and now that the good-byes were ended\nhe bundled Washington's baggage in and drove away with the exile.\n\nAt Swansea Clay paid his stage fare, stowed him away in the vehicle,\nand saw him off. Then he returned home and reported progress, like a\ncommittee of the whole.\n\nClay remained at home several days. He held many consultations with his\nmother upon the financial condition of the family, and talked once with\nhis father upon the same subject, but only once. He found a change in\nthat quarter which was distressing; years of fluctuating fortune had\ndone their work; each reverse had weakened the father's spirit and\nimpaired his energies; his last misfortune seemed to have left hope and\nambition dead within him; he had no projects, formed no plans--evidently\nhe was a vanquished man. He looked worn and tired. He inquired into\nClay's affairs and prospects, and when he found that Clay was doing\npretty well and was likely to do still better, it was plain that he\nresigned himself with easy facility to look to the son for a support;\nand he said, \u201cKeep yourself informed of poor Washington's condition and\nmovements, and help him along all you can, Clay.\u201d\n\nThe younger children, also, seemed relieved of all fears and distresses,\nand very ready and willing to look to Clay for a livelihood. Within\nthree days a general tranquility and satisfaction reigned in the\nhousehold. Clay's hundred and eighty or ninety, dollars had worked a\nwonder. The family were as contented, now, and as free from care as they\ncould have been with a fortune. It was well that Mrs. Hawkins held the\npurse otherwise the treasure would have lasted but a very little while.\n\nIt took but a trifle to pay Hawkins's outstanding obligations, for he\nhad always had a horror of debt.\n\nWhen Clay bade his home good-bye and set out to return to the field of\nhis labors, he was conscious that henceforth he was to have his father's\nfamily on his hands as pensioners; but he did not allow himself to chafe\nat the thought, for he reasoned that his father had dealt by him with a\nfree hand and a loving one all his life, and now that hard fortune had\nbroken his spirit it ought to be a pleasure, not a pain, to work for\nhim. The younger children were born and educated dependents. They had\nnever been taught to do anything for themselves, and it did not seem to\noccur to them to make an attempt now.\n\nThe girls would not have been permitted to work for a living under any\ncircumstances whatever. It was a southern family, and of good blood; and\nfor any person except Laura, either within or without the household to\nhave suggested such an idea would have brought upon the suggester the\nsuspicion of being a lunatic.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n     Via, Pecunia! when she's run and gone\n     And fled, and dead, then will I fetch her again\n     With aqua vita, out of an old hogshead!\n     While there are lees of wine, or dregs of beer,\n     I'll never want her! Coin her out of cobwebs,\n     Dust, but I'll have her! raise wool upon egg-shells,\n     Sir, and make grass grow out of marrow-bones,\n     To make her come!\n     B. Jonson.\n\nBearing Washington Hawkins and his fortunes, the stage-coach tore out\nof Swansea at a fearful gait, with horn tooting gaily and half the town\nadmiring from doors and windows. But it did not tear any more after it\ngot to the outskirts; it dragged along stupidly enough, then--till it\ncame in sight of the next hamlet; and then the bugle tooted gaily again\nand again the vehicle went tearing by the horses. This sort of conduct\nmarked every entry to a station and every exit from it; and so in those\ndays children grew up with the idea that stage-coaches always tore and\nalways tooted; but they also grew up with the idea that pirates went\ninto action in their Sunday clothes, carrying the black flag in one\nhand and pistolling people with the other, merely because they were so\nrepresented in the pictures--but these illusions vanished when later\nyears brought their disenchanting wisdom. They learned then that the\nstagecoach is but a poor, plodding, vulgar thing in the solitudes of the\nhighway; and that the pirate is only a seedy, unfantastic \u201crough,\u201d when\nhe is out of the pictures.\n\nToward evening, the stage-coach came thundering into Hawkeye with a\nperfectly triumphant ostentation--which was natural and proper, for\nHawkey a was a pretty large town for interior Missouri. Washington,\nvery stiff and tired and hungry, climbed out, and wondered how he was\nto proceed now. But his difficulty was quickly solved. Col. Sellers came\ndown the street on a run and arrived panting for breath. He said:\n\n\u201cLord bless you--I'm glad to see you, Washington--perfectly delighted to\nsee you, my boy! I got your message. Been on the look-out for you. Heard\nthe stage horn, but had a party I couldn't shake off--man that's got an\nenormous thing on hand--wants me to put some capital into it--and I tell\nyou, my boy, I could do worse, I could do a deal worse. No, now, let\nthat luggage alone; I'll fix that. Here, Jerry, got anything to do? All\nright-shoulder this plunder and follow me. Come along, Washington. Lord\nI'm glad to see you! Wife and the children are just perishing to look at\nyou. Bless you, they won't know you, you've grown so. Folks all well, I\nsuppose? That's good--glad to hear that. We're always going to run down\nand see them, but I'm into so many operations, and they're not things a\nman feels like trusting to other people, and so somehow we keep putting\nit off. Fortunes in them! Good gracious, it's the country to pile up\nwealth in! Here we are--here's where the Sellers dynasty hangs out.\nHump it on the door-step, Jerry--the blackest niggro in the State,\nWashington, but got a good heart--mighty likely boy, is Jerry. And now\nI suppose you've got to have ten cents, Jerry. That's all right--when\na man works for me--when a man--in the other pocket, I reckon--when\na man--why, where the mischief as that portmonnaie!--when a--well now\nthat's odd--Oh, now I remember, must have left it at the bank; and\nb'George I've left my check-book, too--Polly says I ought to have\na nurse--well, no matter. Let me have a dime, Washington, if you've\ngot--ah, thanks. Now clear out, Jerry, your complexion has brought on\nthe twilight half an hour ahead of time. Pretty fair joke--pretty fair.\nHere he is, Polly! Washington's come, children! come now, don't eat him\nup--finish him in the house. Welcome, my boy, to a mansion that is proud\nto shelter the son of the best man that walks on the ground. Si Hawkins\nhas been a good friend to me, and I believe I can say that whenever\nI've had a chance to put him into a good thing I've done it, and done\nit pretty cheerfully, too. I put him into that sugar speculation--what a\ngrand thing that was, if we hadn't held on too long!\u201d\n\nTrue enough; but holding on too long had utterly ruined both of them;\nand the saddest part of it was, that they never had had so much money\nto lose before, for Sellers's sale of their mule crop that year in New\nOrleans had been a great financial success. If he had kept out of sugar\nand gone back home content to stick to mules it would have been a happy\nwisdom. As it was, he managed to kill two birds with one stone--that is\nto say, he killed the sugar speculation by holding for high rates till\nhe had to sell at the bottom figure, and that calamity killed the mule\nthat laid the golden egg--which is but a figurative expression and will\nbe so understood. Sellers had returned home cheerful but empty-handed,\nand the mule business lapsed into other hands. The sale of the Hawkins\nproperty by the Sheriff had followed, and the Hawkins hearts been torn\nto see Uncle Dan'l and his wife pass from the auction-block into the\nhands of a negro trader and depart for the remote South to be seen no\nmore by the family. It had seemed like seeing their own flesh and blood\nsold into banishment.\n\nWashington was greatly pleased with the Sellers mansion. It was a\ntwo-story-and-a-half brick, and much more stylish than any of its\nneighbors. He was borne to the family sitting room in triumph by the\nswarm of little Sellerses, the parents following with their arms about\neach other's waists.\n\nThe whole family were poorly and cheaply dressed; and the clothing,\nalthough neat and clean, showed many evidences of having seen long\nservice. The Colonel's \u201cstovepipe\u201d hat was napless and shiny with much\npolishing, but nevertheless it had an almost convincing expression\nabout it of having been just purchased new. The rest of his clothing was\nnapless and shiny, too, but it had the air of being entirely satisfied\nwith itself and blandly sorry for other people's clothes. It was growing\nrather dark in the house, and the evening air was chilly, too. Sellers\nsaid:\n\n\u201cLay off your overcoat, Washington, and draw up to the stove and make\nyourself at home--just consider yourself under your own shingles my\nboy--I'll have a fire going, in a jiffy. Light the lamp, Polly, dear,\nand let's have things cheerful--just as glad to see you, Washington, as\nif you'd been lost a century and we'd found you again!\u201d\n\nBy this time the Colonel was conveying a lighted match into a poor\nlittle stove. Then he propped the stove door to its place by leaning the\npoker against it, for the hinges had retired from business. This door\nframed a small square of isinglass, which now warmed up with a faint\nglow. Mrs. Sellers lit a cheap, showy lamp, which dissipated a good deal\nof the gloom, and then everybody gathered into the light and took the\nstove into close companionship.\n\nThe children climbed all over Sellers, fondled him, petted him, and were\nlavishly petted in return. Out from this tugging, laughing, chattering\ndisguise of legs and arms and little faces, the Colonel's voice worked\nits way and his tireless tongue ran blithely on without interruption;\nand the purring little wife, diligent with her knitting, sat near at\nhand and looked happy and proud and grateful; and she listened as one\nwho listens to oracles and, gospels and whose grateful soul is being\nrefreshed with the bread of life. Bye and bye the children quieted down\nto listen; clustered about their father, and resting their elbows on his\nlegs, they hung upon his words as if he were uttering the music of the\nspheres.\n\nA dreary old hair-cloth sofa against the wall; a few damaged chairs;\nthe small table the lamp stood on; the crippled stove--these things\nconstituted the furniture of the room. There was no carpet on the floor;\non the wall were occasional square-shaped interruptions of the general\ntint of the plaster which betrayed that there used to be pictures in the\nhouse--but there were none now. There were no mantel ornaments, unless\none might bring himself to regard as an ornament a clock which never\ncame within fifteen strokes of striking the right time, and whose hands\nalways hitched together at twenty-two minutes past anything and traveled\nin company the rest of the way home.\n\n\u201cRemarkable clock!\u201d said Sellers, and got up and wound it. \u201cI've been\noffered--well, I wouldn't expect you to believe what I've been offered\nfor that clock. Old Gov. Hager never sees me but he says, 'Come, now,\nColonel, name your price--I must have that clock!' But my goodness I'd\nas soon think of selling my wife. As I was saying to--silence in the\ncourt, now, she's begun to strike! You can't talk against her--you have\nto just be patient and hold up till she's said her say. Ah well, as I\nwas saying, when--she's beginning again! Nineteen, twenty, twenty-one,\ntwenty-two, twen----ah, that's all.--Yes, as I was saying to old\nJudge----go it, old girl, don't mind me.--Now how is that?----isn't that\na good, spirited tone? She can wake the dead! Sleep? Why you might as\nwell try to sleep in a thunder-factory. Now just listen at that. She'll\nstrike a hundred and fifty, now, without stopping,--you'll see. There\nain't another clock like that in Christendom.\u201d\n\nWashington hoped that this might be true, for the din was\ndistracting--though the family, one and all, seemed filled with joy; and\nthe more the clock \u201cbuckled down to her work\u201d as the Colonel expressed\nit, and the more insupportable the clatter became, the more enchanted\nthey all appeared to be. When there was silence, Mrs Sellers lifted upon\nWashington a face that beamed with a childlike pride, and said:\n\n\u201cIt belonged to his grandmother.\u201d\n\nThe look and the tone were a plain call for admiring surprise, and\ntherefore Washington said (it was the only thing that offered itself at\nthe moment:)\n\n\u201cIndeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it did, didn't it father!\u201d exclaimed one of the twins. \u201cShe was my\ngreat-grandmother--and George's too; wasn't she, father! You never saw\nher, but Sis has seen her, when Sis was a baby-didn't you, Sis! Sis has\nseen her most a hundred times. She was awful deef--she's dead now. Ain't\nshe, father!\u201d\n\nAll the children chimed in, now, with one general Babel of information\nabout deceased--nobody offering to read the riot act or seeming to\ndiscountenance the insurrection or disapprove of it in any way--but the\nhead twin drowned all the turmoil and held his own against the field:\n\n\u201cIt's our clock, now--and it's got wheels inside of it, and a thing that\nflutters every time she strikes--don't it, father! Great-grandmother\ndied before hardly any of us was born--she was an Old-School Baptist and\nhad warts all over her--you ask father if she didn't. She had an uncle\nonce that was bald-headed and used to have fits; he wasn't our uncle,\nI don't know what he was to us--some kin or another I reckon--father's\nseen him a thousand times--hain't you, father! We used to have a calf\nthat et apples and just chawed up dishrags like nothing, and if you\nstay here you'll see lots of funerals--won't he, Sis! Did you ever see a\nhouse afire? I have! Once me and Jim Terry----\u201d\n\nBut Sellers began to speak now, and the storm ceased. He began to tell\nabout an enormous speculation he was thinking of embarking some capital\nin--a speculation which some London bankers had been over to consult\nwith him about--and soon he was building glittering pyramids of coin,\nand Washington was presently growing opulent under the magic of his\neloquence. But at the same time Washington was not able to ignore the\ncold entirely.\n\nHe was nearly as close to the stove as he could get, and yet he could\nnot persuade himself that he felt the slightest heat, notwithstanding\nthe isinglass' door was still gently and serenely glowing. He tried to\nget a trifle closer to the stove, and the consequence was, he tripped\nthe supporting poker and the stove-door tumbled to the floor. And then\nthere was a revelation--there was nothing in the stove but a lighted\ntallow-candle! The poor youth blushed and felt as if he must die\nwith shame. But the Colonel was only disconcerted for a moment--he\nstraightway found his voice again:\n\n\u201cA little idea of my own, Washington--one of the greatest things in the\nworld! You must write and tell your father about it--don't forget that,\nnow. I have been reading up some European Scientific reports--friend of\nmine, Count Fugier, sent them to me--sends me all sorts of things from\nParis--he thinks the world of me, Fugier does. Well, I saw that the\nAcademy of France had been testing the properties of heat, and they came\nto the conclusion that it was a nonconductor or something like that,\nand of course its influence must necessarily be deadly in nervous\norganizations with excitable temperaments, especially where there is any\ntendency toward rheumatic affections. Bless you I saw in a moment what\nwas the matter with us, and says I, out goes your fires!--no more slow\ntorture and certain death for me, sir. What you want is the appearance\nof heat, not the heat itself--that's the idea. Well how to do it was the\nnext thing. I just put my head to work, pegged away a couple of days,\nand here you are! Rheumatism? Why a man can't any more start a case of\nrheumatism in this house than he can shake an opinion out of a mummy!\nStove with a candle in it and a transparent door--that's it--it has been\nthe salvation of this family. Don't you fail to write your father about\nit, Washington. And tell him the idea is mine--I'm no more conceited\nthan most people, I reckon, but you know it is human nature for a man to\nwant credit for a thing like that.\u201d\n\nWashington said with his blue lips that he would, but he said in his\nsecret heart that he would promote no such iniquity. He tried to believe\nin the healthfulness of the invention, and succeeded tolerably well; but\nafter all he could not feel that good health in a frozen body was any\nreal improvement on the rheumatism.\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n     --Whan pe horde is thynne, as of seruyse,\n     Nought replenesshed with grete diuersite\n     Of mete & drinke, good chere may then suffise\n     With honest talkyng---- The Book of Curtesye.\n\n     MAMMON. Come on, sir. Now, you set your foot on shore\n     In Novo Orbe; here's the rich Peru:\n     And there within, sir, are the golden mines,\n     Great Solomon's Ophir!----\n     B. Jonson\n\nThe supper at Col. Sellers's was not sumptuous, in the beginning, but it\nimproved on acquaintance. That is to say, that what Washington regarded\nat first sight as mere lowly potatoes, presently became awe-inspiring\nagricultural productions that had been reared in some ducal garden\nbeyond the sea, under the sacred eye of the duke himself, who had sent\nthem to Sellers; the bread was from corn which could be grown in only\none favored locality in the earth and only a favored few could get it;\nthe Rio coffee, which at first seemed execrable to the taste, took to\nitself an improved flavor when Washington was told to drink it slowly\nand not hurry what should be a lingering luxury in order to be fully\nappreciated--it was from the private stores of a Brazilian nobleman with\nan unrememberable name. The Colonel's tongue was a magician's wand that\nturned dried apples into figs and water into wine as easily as it could\nchange a hovel into a palace and present poverty into imminent future\nriches.\n\nWashington slept in a cold bed in a carpetless room and woke up in a\npalace in the morning; at least the palace lingered during the moment\nthat he was rubbing his eyes and getting his bearings--and then it\ndisappeared and he recognized that the Colonel's inspiring talk had been\ninfluencing his dreams. Fatigue had made him sleep late; when he entered\nthe sitting room he noticed that the old hair-cloth sofa was absent;\nwhen he sat down to breakfast the Colonel tossed six or seven dollars\nin bills on the table, counted them over, said he was a little short and\nmust call upon his banker; then returned the bills to his wallet with\nthe indifferent air of a man who is used to money. The breakfast was\nnot an improvement upon the supper, but the Colonel talked it up and\ntransformed it into an oriental feast. Bye and bye, he said:\n\n\u201cI intend to look out for you, Washington, my boy. I hunted up a place\nfor you yesterday, but I am not referring to that,--now--that is a mere\nlivelihood--mere bread and butter; but when I say I mean to look out for\nyou I mean something very different. I mean to put things in your way\nthan will make a mere livelihood a trifling thing. I'll put you in a\nway to make more money that you'll ever know what to do with. You'll be\nright here where I can put my hand on you when anything turns up. I've\ngot some prodigious operations on foot; but I'm keeping quiet; mum's the\nword; your old hand don't go around pow-wowing and letting everybody\nsee his k'yards and find out his little game. But all in good time,\nWashington, all in good time. You'll see. Now there's an operation in\ncorn that looks well. Some New York men are trying to get me to go into\nit--buy up all the growing crops and just boss the market when they\nmature--ah, I tell you it's a great thing. And it only costs a trifle;\ntwo millions or two and a half will do it. I haven't exactly promised\nyet--there's no hurry--the more indifferent I seem, you know, the\nmore anxious those fellows will get. And then there is the hog\nspeculation--that's bigger still. We've got quiet men at work,\u201d [he was\nvery impressive here,] \u201cmousing around, to get propositions out of all\nthe farmers in the whole west and northwest for the hog crop, and\nother agents quietly getting propositions and terms out of all the\nmanufactories--and don't you see, if we can get all the hogs and all the\nslaughter houses into our hands on the dead quiet--whew! it would take\nthree ships to carry the money.--I've looked into the thing--calculated\nall the chances for and all the chances against, and though I shake my\nhead and hesitate and keep on thinking, apparently, I've got my mind\nmade up that if the thing can be done on a capital of six millions,\nthat's the horse to put up money on! Why Washington--but what's the use\nof talking about it--any man can see that there's whole Atlantic oceans\nof cash in it, gulfs and bays thrown in. But there's a bigger thing than\nthat, yes bigger----\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy Colonel, you can't want anything bigger!\u201d said Washington, his eyes\nblazing. \u201cOh, I wish I could go into either of those speculations--I\nonly wish I had money--I wish I wasn't cramped and kept down and\nfettered with poverty, and such prodigious chances lying right here in\nsight! Oh, it is a fearful thing to be poor. But don't throw away those\nthings--they are so splendid and I can see how sure they are. Don't\nthrow them away for something still better and maybe fail in it! I\nwouldn't, Colonel. I would stick to these. I wish father were here and\nwere his old self again--Oh, he never in his life had such chances as\nthese are. Colonel; you can't improve on these--no man can improve on\nthem!\u201d\n\nA sweet, compassionate smile played about the Colonel's features, and he\nleaned over the table with the air of a man who is \u201cgoing to show you\u201d\n and do it without the least trouble:\n\n\u201cWhy Washington, my boy, these things are nothing. They look large of\ncourse--they look large to a novice, but to a man who has been all his\nlife accustomed to large operations--shaw! They're well enough to while\naway an idle hour with, or furnish a bit of employment that will give\na trifle of idle capital a chance to earn its bread while it is waiting\nfor something to do, but--now just listen a moment--just let me give you\nan idea of what we old veterans of commerce call 'business.' Here's\nthe Rothschild's proposition--this is between you and me, you\nunderstand----\u201d\n\nWashington nodded three or four times impatiently, and his glowing eyes\nsaid, \u201cYes, yes--hurry--I understand----\u201d\n\n----\u201cfor I wouldn't have it get out for a fortune. They want me to go\nin with them on the sly--agent was here two weeks ago about it--go in\non the sly\u201d [voice down to an impressive whisper, now,] \u201cand buy up a\nhundred and thirteen wild cat banks in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky,\nIllinois and Missouri--notes of these banks are at all sorts of discount\nnow--average discount of the hundred and thirteen is forty-four per\ncent--buy them all up, you see, and then all of a sudden let the cat out\nof the bag! Whiz! the stock of every one of those wildcats would spin\nup to a tremendous premium before you could turn a handspring--profit\non the speculation not a dollar less than forty millions!\u201d [An eloquent\npause, while the marvelous vision settled into W.'s focus.] \u201cWhere's\nyour hogs now? Why my dear innocent boy, we would just sit down on the\nfront door-steps and peddle banks like lucifer matches!\u201d\n\nWashington finally got his breath and said:\n\n\u201cOh, it is perfectly wonderful! Why couldn't these things have happened\nin father's day? And I--it's of no use--they simply lie before my face\nand mock me. There is nothing for me but to stand helpless and see other\npeople reap the astonishing harvest.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind, Washington, don't you worry. I'll fix you. There's plenty\nof chances. How much money have you got?\u201d\n\nIn the presence of so many millions, Washington could not keep from\nblushing when he had to confess that he had but eighteen dollars in the\nworld.\n\n\u201cWell, all right--don't despair. Other people have been obliged to begin\nwith less. I have a small idea that may develop into something for us\nboth, all in good time. Keep your money close and add to it. I'll make\nit breed. I've been experimenting (to pass away the time), on a little\npreparation for curing sore eyes--a kind of decoction nine-tenths water\nand the other tenth drugs that don't cost more than a dollar a barrel;\nI'm still experimenting; there's one ingredient wanted yet to perfect\nthe thing, and somehow I can't just manage to hit upon the thing that's\nnecessary, and I don't dare talk with a chemist, of course. But I'm\nprogressing, and before many weeks I wager the country will ring with\nthe fame of Beriah Sellers' Infallible Imperial Oriental Optic Liniment\nand Salvation for Sore Eyes--the Medical Wonder of the Age! Small\nbottles fifty cents, large ones a dollar. Average cost, five and seven\ncents for the two sizes.\n\n\u201cThe first year sell, say, ten thousand bottles in Missouri, seven\nthousand in Iowa, three thousand in Arkansas, four thousand in Kentucky,\nsix thousand in Illinois, and say twenty-five thousand in the rest of\nthe country. Total, fifty five thousand bottles; profit clear of all\nexpenses, twenty thousand dollars at the very lowest calculation. All\nthe capital needed is to manufacture the first two thousand bottles--say\na hundred and fifty dollars--then the money would begin to flow in.\nThe second year, sales would reach 200,000 bottles--clear profit, say,\n$75,000--and in the meantime the great factory would be building in\nSt. Louis, to cost, say, $100,000. The third year we could easily sell\n1,000,000 bottles in the United States and----\u201d\n\n\u201cO, splendid!\u201d said Washington. \u201cLet's commence right away--let's----\u201d\n\n\u201c----1,000,000 bottles in the United States--profit at least\n$350,000--and then it would begin to be time to turn our attention\ntoward the real idea of the business.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe real idea of it! Ain't $350,000 a year a pretty real----\u201d\n\n\u201cStuff! Why what an infant you are, Washington--what a guileless,\nshort-sighted, easily-contented innocent you are, my poor little\ncountry-bred know-nothing! Would I go to all that trouble and bother for\nthe poor crumbs a body might pick up in this country? Now do I look\nlike a man who----does my history suggest that I am a man who deals\nin trifles, contents himself with the narrow horizon that hems in the\ncommon herd, sees no further than the end of his nose? Now you know that\nthat is not me--couldn't be me. You ought to know that if I throw my\ntime and abilities into a patent medicine, it's a patent medicine whose\nfield of operations is the solid earth! its clients the swarming nations\nthat inhabit it! Why what is the republic of America for an eye-water\ncountry? Lord bless you, it is nothing but a barren highway that you've\ngot to cross to get to the true eye-water market! Why, Washington, in\nthe Oriental countries people swarm like the sands of the desert; every\nsquare mile of ground upholds its thousands upon thousands of struggling\nhuman creatures--and every separate and individual devil of them's got\nthe ophthalmia! It's as natural to them as noses are--and sin. It's born\nwith them, it stays with them, it's all that some of them have left when\nthey die. Three years of introductory trade in the orient and what will\nbe the result? Why, our headquarters would be in Constantinople and\nour hindquarters in Further India! Factories and warehouses in Cairo,\nIspahan, Bagdad, Damascus, Jerusalem, Yedo, Peking, Bangkok, Delhi,\nBombay--and Calcutta! Annual income--well, God only knows how many\nmillions and millions apiece!\u201d\n\nWashington was so dazed, so bewildered--his heart and his eyes had\nwandered so far away among the strange lands beyond the seas, and such\navalanches of coin and currency had fluttered and jingled confusedly\ndown before him, that he was now as one who has been whirling round\nand round for a time, and, stopping all at once, finds his surroundings\nstill whirling and all objects a dancing chaos. However, little by\nlittle the Sellers family cooled down and crystalized into shape, and\nthe poor room lost its glitter and resumed its poverty. Then the youth\nfound his voice and begged Sellers to drop everything and hurry up the\neye-water; and he got his eighteen dollars and tried to force it upon\nthe Colonel--pleaded with him to take it--implored him to do it. But\nthe Colonel would not; said he would not need the capital (in his\nnative magnificent way he called that eighteen dollars Capital) till the\neye-water was an accomplished fact. He made Washington easy in his\nmind, though, by promising that he would call for it just as soon as the\ninvention was finished, and he added the glad tidings that nobody but\njust they two should be admitted to a share in the speculation.\n\nWhen Washington left the breakfast table he could have worshiped that\nman. Washington was one of that kind of people whose hopes are in the\nvery clouds one day and in the gutter the next. He walked on air now.\nThe Colonel was ready to take him around and introduce him to the\nemployment he had found for him, but Washington begged for a few moments\nin which to write home; with his kind of people, to ride to-day's new\ninterest to death and put off yesterday's till another time, is nature\nitself. He ran up stairs and wrote glowingly, enthusiastically, to his\nmother about the hogs and the corn, the banks and the eye-water--and\nadded a few inconsequential millions to each project. And he said that\npeople little dreamed what a man Col. Sellers was, and that the world\nwould open its eyes when it found out. And he closed his letter thus:\n\n\u201cSo make yourself perfectly easy, mother-in a little while you shall\nhave everything you want, and more. I am not likely to stint you in\nanything, I fancy. This money will not be for me, alone, but for all\nof us. I want all to share alike; and there is going to be far more\nfor each than one person can spend. Break it to father cautiously--you\nunderstand the need of that--break it to him cautiously, for he has had\nsuch cruel hard fortune, and is so stricken by it that great good news\nmight prostrate him more surely than even bad, for he is used to the bad\nbut is grown sadly unaccustomed to the other. Tell Laura--tell all the\nchildren. And write to Clay about it if he is not with you yet. You may\ntell Clay that whatever I get he can freely share in-freely. He knows\nthat that is true--there will be no need that I should swear to that to\nmake him believe it. Good-bye--and mind what I say: Rest perfectly easy,\none and all of you, for our troubles are nearly at an end.\u201d\n\nPoor lad, he could not know that his mother would cry some loving,\ncompassionate tears over his letter and put off the family with a\nsynopsis of its contents which conveyed a deal of love to them but not\nmuch idea of his prospects or projects. And he never dreamed that such\na joyful letter could sadden her and fill her night with sighs, and\ntroubled thoughts, and bodings of the future, instead of filling it with\npeace and blessing it with restful sleep.\n\nWhen the letter was done, Washington and the Colonel sallied forth, and\nas they walked along Washington learned what he was to be. He was to\nbe a clerk in a real estate office. Instantly the fickle youth's dreams\nforsook the magic eye-water and flew back to the Tennessee Land. And the\ngorgeous possibilities of that great domain straightway began to occupy\nhis imagination to such a degree that he could scarcely manage to keep\neven enough of his attention upon the Colonel's talk to retain the\ngeneral run of what he was saying. He was glad it was a real estate\noffice--he was a made man now, sure.\n\nThe Colonel said that General Boswell was a rich man and had a good and\ngrowing business; and that Washington's work would be light and he would\nget forty dollars a month and be boarded and lodged in the General's\nfamily--which was as good as ten dollars more; and even better, for he\ncould not live as well even at the \u201cCity Hotel\u201d as he would there, and\nyet the hotel charged fifteen dollars a month where a man had a good\nroom.\n\nGeneral Boswell was in his office; a comfortable looking place, with\nplenty of outline maps hanging about the walls and in the windows, and\na spectacled man was marking out another one on a long table. The office\nwas in the principal street. The General received Washington with a\nkindly but reserved politeness. Washington rather liked his looks. He\nwas about fifty years old, dignified, well preserved and well dressed.\nAfter the Colonel took his leave, the General talked a while with\nWashington--his talk consisting chiefly of instructions about the\nclerical duties of the place. He seemed satisfied as to Washington's\nability to take care of the books, he was evidently a pretty fair\ntheoretical bookkeeper, and experience would soon harden theory\ninto practice. By and by dinner-time came, and the two walked to the\nGeneral's house; and now Washington noticed an instinct in himself that\nmoved him to keep not in the General's rear, exactly, but yet not at his\nside--somehow the old gentleman's dignity and reserve did not inspire\nfamiliarity.\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nWashington dreamed his way along the street, his fancy flitting from\ngrain to hogs, from hogs to banks, from banks to eye-water, from\neye-water to Tennessee Land, and lingering but a feverish moment upon\neach of these fascinations. He was conscious of but one outward thing,\nto wit, the General, and he was really not vividly conscious of him.\n\nArrived at the finest dwelling in the town, they entered it and were at\nhome. Washington was introduced to Mrs. Boswell, and his imagination was\non the point of flitting into the vapory realms of speculation again,\nwhen a lovely girl of sixteen or seventeen came in. This vision swept\nWashington's mind clear of its chaos of glittering rubbish in an\ninstant. Beauty had fascinated him before; many times he had been in\nlove even for weeks at a time with the same object but his heart had\nnever suffered so sudden and so fierce an assault as this, within his\nrecollection.\n\nLouise Boswell occupied his mind and drifted among his multiplication\ntables all the afternoon. He was constantly catching himself in a\nreverie--reveries made up of recalling how she looked when she first\nburst upon him; how her voice thrilled him when she first spoke; how\ncharmed the very air seemed by her presence. Blissful as the afternoon\nwas, delivered up to such a revel as this, it seemed an eternity,\nso impatient was he to see the girl again. Other afternoons like it\nfollowed. Washington plunged into this love affair as he plunged into\neverything else--upon impulse and without reflection. As the days\nwent by it seemed plain that he was growing in favor with Louise,--not\nsweepingly so, but yet perceptibly, he fancied. His attentions to her\ntroubled her father and mother a little, and they warned Louise, without\nstating particulars or making allusions to any special person, that a\ngirl was sure to make a mistake who allowed herself to marry anybody but\na man who could support her well.\n\nSome instinct taught Washington that his present lack of money would be\nan obstruction, though possibly not a bar, to his hopes, and straightway\nhis poverty became a torture to him which cast all his former sufferings\nunder that held into the shade. He longed for riches now as he had never\nlonged for them before.\n\nHe had been once or twice to dine with Col. Sellers, and had been\ndiscouraged to note that the Colonel's bill of fare was falling off both\nin quantity and quality--a sign, he feared, that the lacking ingredient\nin the eye-water still remained undiscovered--though Sellers always\nexplained that these changes in the family diet had been ordered by\nthe doctor, or suggested by some new scientific work the Colonel had\nstumbled upon. But it always turned out that the lacking ingredient was\nstill lacking--though it always appeared, at the same time, that the\nColonel was right on its heels.\n\nEvery time the Colonel came into the real estate office Washington's\nheart bounded and his eyes lighted with hope, but it always turned out\nthat the Colonel was merely on the scent of some vast, undefined landed\nspeculation--although he was customarily able to say that he was nearer\nto the all-necessary ingredient than ever, and could almost name the\nhour when success would dawn. And then Washington's heart would sink\nagain and a sigh would tell when it touched bottom.\n\nAbout this time a letter came, saying that Judge Hawkins had been ailing\nfor a fortnight, and was now considered to be seriously ill. It was\nthought best that Washington should come home. The news filled him with\ngrief, for he loved and honored his father; the Boswells were touched\nby the youth's sorrow, and even the General unbent and said encouraging\nthings to him.--There was balm in this; but when Louise bade him\ngood-bye, and shook his hand and said, \u201cDon't be cast down--it will all\ncome out right--I know it will all come out right,\u201d it seemed a blessed\nthing to be in misfortune, and the tears that welled up to his eyes were\nthe messengers of an adoring and a grateful heart; and when the girl saw\nthem and answering tears came into her own eyes, Washington could hardly\ncontain the excess of happiness that poured into the cavities of his\nbreast that were so lately stored to the roof with grief.\n\nAll the way home he nursed his woe and exalted it. He pictured\nhimself as she must be picturing him: a noble, struggling young spirit\npersecuted by misfortune, but bravely and patiently waiting in the\nshadow of a dread calamity and preparing to meet the blow as became\none who was all too used to hard fortune and the pitiless buffetings of\nfate. These thoughts made him weep, and weep more broken-heartedly than\never; and he wished that she could see his sufferings now.\n\nThere was nothing significant in the fact that Louise, dreamy and\ndistraught, stood at her bedroom bureau that night, scribbling\n\u201cWashington\u201d here and there over a sheet of paper. But there was\nsomething significant in the fact that she scratched the word out every\ntime she wrote it; examined the erasure critically to see if anybody\ncould guess at what the word had been; then buried it under a maze of\nobliterating lines; and finally, as if still unsatisfied, burned the\npaper.\n\nWhen Washington reached home, he recognized at once how serious\nhis father's case was. The darkened room, the labored breathing and\noccasional moanings of the patient, the tip-toeing of the attendants and\ntheir whispered consultations, were full of sad meaning. For three or\nfour nights Mrs. Hawkins and Laura had been watching by the bedside;\nClay had arrived, preceding Washington by one day, and he was now added\nto the corps of watchers. Mr. Hawkins would have none but these three,\nthough neighborly assistance was offered by old friends. From this time\nforth three-hour watches were instituted, and day and night the watchers\nkept their vigils. By degrees Laura and her mother began to show wear,\nbut neither of them would yield a minute of their tasks to Clay. He\nventured once to let the midnight hour pass without calling Laura, but\nhe ventured no more; there was that about her rebuke when he tried\nto explain, that taught him that to let her sleep when she might be\nministering to her father's needs, was to rob her of moments that were\npriceless in her eyes; he perceived that she regarded it as a privilege\nto watch, not a burden. And, he had noticed, also, that when midnight\nstruck, the patient turned his eyes toward the door, with an expectancy\nin them which presently grew into a longing but brightened into\ncontentment as soon as the door opened and Laura appeared. And he did\nnot need Laura's rebuke when he heard his father say:\n\n\u201cClay is good, and you are tired, poor child; but I wanted you so.\u201d\n\n\u201cClay is not good, father--he did not call me. I would not have treated\nhim so. How could you do it, Clay?\u201d\n\nClay begged forgiveness and promised not to break faith again; and as\nhe betook him to his bed, he said to himself: \u201cIt's a steadfast little\nsoul; whoever thinks he is doing the Duchess a kindness by intimating\nthat she is not sufficient for any undertaking she puts her hand to,\nmakes a mistake; and if I did not know it before, I know now that there\nare surer ways of pleasing her than by trying to lighten her labor when\nthat labor consists in wearing herself out for the sake of a person she\nloves.\u201d\n\nA week drifted by, and all the while the patient sank lower and lower.\nThe night drew on that was to end all suspense. It was a wintry one.\nThe darkness gathered, the snow was falling, the wind wailed plaintively\nabout the house or shook it with fitful gusts. The doctor had paid his\nlast visit and gone away with that dismal remark to the nearest friend\nof the family that he \u201cbelieved there was nothing more that he could\ndo\u201d--a remark which is always overheard by some one it is not meant for\nand strikes a lingering half-conscious hope dead with a withering shock;\nthe medicine phials had been removed from the bedside and put out of\nsight, and all things made orderly and meet for the solemn event that\nwas impending; the patient, with closed eyes, lay scarcely breathing;\nthe watchers sat by and wiped the gathering damps from his forehead\nwhile the silent tears flowed down their faces; the deep hush was only\ninterrupted by sobs from the children, grouped about the bed.\n\nAfter a time--it was toward midnight now--Mr. Hawkins roused out of\na doze, looked about him and was evidently trying to speak. Instantly\nLaura lifted his head and in a failing voice he said, while something of\nthe old light shone in his eyes:\n\n\u201cWife--children--come nearer--nearer. The darkness grows. Let me see you\nall, once more.\u201d\n\nThe group closed together at the bedside, and their tears and sobs came\nnow without restraint.\n\n\u201cI am leaving you in cruel poverty. I have been--so foolish--so\nshort-sighted. But courage! A better day is--is coming. Never lose\nsight of the Tennessee Land! Be wary. There is wealth stored up for you\nthere--wealth that is boundless! The children shall hold up their heads\nwith the best in the land, yet. Where are the papers?--Have you got the\npapers safe? Show them--show them to me!\u201d\n\nUnder his strong excitement his voice had gathered power and his last\nsentences were spoken with scarcely a perceptible halt or hindrance.\nWith an effort he had raised himself almost without assistance to a\nsitting posture. But now the fire faded out of his eyes and he fell\nback exhausted. The papers were brought and held before him, and\nthe answering smile that flitted across his face showed that he was\nsatisfied. He closed his eyes, and the signs of approaching dissolution\nmultiplied rapidly. He lay almost motionless for a little while, then\nsuddenly partly raised his head and looked about him as one who peers\ninto a dim uncertain light. He muttered:\n\n\u201cGone? No--I see you--still. It is--it is-over. But you are--safe. Safe.\nThe Ten-----\u201d\n\nThe voice died out in a whisper; the sentence was never finished. The\nemaciated fingers began to pick at the coverlet, a fatal sign. After a\ntime there were no sounds but the cries of the mourners within and the\ngusty turmoil of the wind without. Laura had bent down and kissed her\nfather's lips as the spirit left the body; but she did not sob, or utter\nany ejaculation; her tears flowed silently. Then she closed the dead\neyes, and crossed the hands upon the breast; after a season, she kissed\nthe forehead reverently, drew the sheet up over the face, and then\nwalked apart and sat down with the look of one who is done with life\nand has no further interest in its joys and sorrows, its hopes or its\nambitions. Clay buried his face in the coverlet of the bed; when the\nother children and the mother realized that death was indeed come at\nlast, they threw themselves into each others' arms and gave way to a\nfrenzy of grief.\n\n\n\n\nPart 2.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nCHAPTER X Laura Hawkins Discovers a Mystery in Her Parentage and Grows\nMorbid Under the Village Gossip\n\nCHAPTER XI A Dinner with Col Sellers--Wonderful Effects of Raw Turnips\n\nCHAPTER XII Philip Sterling and Henry Brierly--Arrangements to Go West\nas Engineers\n\nCHAPTER XIII Rail--Road Contractors and Party Traveling--Philip and\nHarry form the Acquaintance of Col Sellers\n\nCHAPTER XIV Ruth Bolton and Her Parents\n\nCHAPTER XV Visitors of the Boltons--Mr Bigler \u201cSees the\nLegislature\u201d--Ruth Bolton Commences Medical Studies\n\nCHAPTER XVI The Engineers Detained at St Louis--Off for Camp--Reception\nby Jeff\n\nCHAPTER XVII The Engineer Corps Arrive at Stone's Landing\n\nCHAPTER XVIII Laura and Her Marriage to Colonel Selby--Deserted and\nReturns to Hawkeye\n\nILLUSTRATIONS\n\n37.LAURA SEEKING POR EVIDENCES OF HER BIRTH 38.EVER TRUE 39.A\nHEALTHY MEAL 40.PHILIP AT THE THEATRE 41.WHAT PHILIP LEARNED\nAT COLLEGE 42.THE DELEGATE'S INTERESTING GAME 43.THE PERSON OF\nIMPORTANCE 44. \u201cNOT THAT\u201d 45.RUTH'S MOTHER MAKES ENQUIRIES 46.THE\nLETTER 47.CARING FOR THE POOR 48.ANATOMICAL INVESTIGATIONS 49.RUTH\nLOOKING AT THE \u201cNEW ONE\u201d BY CANDLE LIGHT 60. \u201cONLY FOR YOU, BRIERLY\u201d\n 51.AN ACCLIMATED MAN 51.NO THANKS!

He had been\nuniversally trusted and honored in his day, but had finally, fallen into\nmisfortune; while serving his third term in Congress, and while upon the\npoint of being elevated to the Senate--which was considered the summit\nof earthly aggrandizement in those days--he had yielded to temptation,\nwhen in distress for money wherewith to save his estate; and sold his\nvote. His crime was discovered, and his fall followed instantly. Nothing\ncould reinstate him in the confidence of the people, his ruin was\nirretrievable--his disgrace complete. All doors were closed against him,\nall men avoided him. After years of skulking retirement and dissipation,\ndeath had relieved him of his troubles at last, and his funeral followed\nclose upon that of Mr. Hawkins. He died as he had latterly lived--wholly\nalone and friendless. He had no relatives--or if he had they did not\nacknowledge him. The coroner's jury found certain memoranda upon his\nbody and about the premises which revealed a fact not suspected by the\nvillagers before-viz., that Laura was not the child of Mr. and Mrs.\nHawkins.\n\nThe gossips were soon at work. They were but little hampered by the\nfact that the memoranda referred to betrayed nothing but the bare\ncircumstance that Laura's real parents were unknown, and stopped there.\nSo far from being hampered by this, the gossips seemed to gain all\nthe more freedom from it. They supplied all the missing information\nthemselves, they filled up all the blanks. The town soon teemed\nwith histories of Laura's origin and secret history, no two versions\nprecisely alike, but all elaborate, exhaustive, mysterious and\ninteresting, and all agreeing in one vital particular--to-wit, that\nthere was a suspicious cloud about her birth, not to say a disreputable\none.\n\nLaura began to encounter cold looks, averted eyes and peculiar nods and\ngestures which perplexed her beyond measure; but presently the pervading\ngossip found its way to her, and she understood them--then. Her pride\nwas stung. She was astonished, and at first incredulous. She was about\nto ask her mother if there was any truth in these reports, but upon\nsecond thought held her peace. She soon gathered that Major Lackland's\nmemoranda seemed to refer to letters which had passed between himself\nand Judge Hawkins. She shaped her course without difficulty the day that\nthat hint reached her.\n\nThat night she sat in her room till all was still, and then she stole\ninto the garret and began a search. She rummaged long among boxes of\nmusty papers relating to business matters of no interest to her, but\nat last she found several bundles of letters. One bundle was marked\n\u201cprivate,\u201d and in that she found what she wanted. She selected six\nor eight letters from the package and began to devour their contents,\nheedless of the cold.\n\nBy the dates, these letters were from five to seven years old. They were\nall from Major Lackland to Mr. Hawkins. The substance of them was, that\nsome one in the east had been inquiring of Major Lackland about a lost\nchild and its parents, and that it was conjectured that the child might\nbe Laura.\n\nEvidently some of the letters were missing, for the name of the\ninquirer was not mentioned; there was a casual reference to \u201cthis\nhandsome-featured aristocratic gentleman,\u201d as if the reader and the\nwriter were accustomed to speak of him and knew who was meant.\n\nIn one letter the Major said he agreed with Mr. Hawkins that the\ninquirer seemed not altogether on the wrong track; but he also agreed\nthat it would be best to keep quiet until more convincing developments\nwere forthcoming.\n\nAnother letter said that \u201cthe poor soul broke completely down when he\nsaw Laura's picture, and declared it must be she.\u201d\n\nStill another said:\n\n\u201cHe seems entirely alone in the world, and his heart is so wrapped up in\nthis thing that I believe that if it proved a false hope, it would kill\nhim; I have persuaded him to wait a little while and go west when I go.\u201d\n Another letter had this paragraph in it:\n\n\u201cHe is better one day and worse the next, and is out of his mind a good\ndeal of the time. Lately his case has developed a something which is a\nwonder to the hired nurses, but which will not be much of a marvel\nto you if you have read medical philosophy much. It is this: his lost\nmemory returns to him when he is delirious, and goes away again when he\nis himself-just as old Canada Joe used to talk the French patois of his\nboyhood in the delirium of typhus fever, though he could not do it when\nhis mind was clear. Now this poor gentleman's memory has always broken\ndown before he reached the explosion of the steamer; he could only\nremember starting up the river with his wife and child, and he had an\nidea that there was a race, but he was not certain; he could not name\nthe boat he was on; there was a dead blank of a month or more that\nsupplied not an item to his recollection. It was not for me to assist\nhim, of course. But now in his delirium it all comes out: the names of\nthe boats, every incident of the explosion, and likewise the details of\nhis astonishing escape--that is, up to where, just as a yawl-boat was\napproaching him (he was clinging to the starboard wheel of the burning\nwreck at the time), a falling timber struck him on the head. But I will\nwrite out his wonderful escape in full to-morrow or next day. Of course\nthe physicians will not let me tell him now that our Laura is indeed his\nchild--that must come later, when his health is thoroughly restored. His\ncase is not considered dangerous at all; he will recover presently, the\ndoctors say. But they insist that he must travel a little when he\ngets well--they recommend a short sea voyage, and they say he can be\npersuaded to try it if we continue to keep him in ignorance and promise\nto let him see L. as soon as he returns.\u201d The letter that bore the\nlatest date of all, contained this clause:\n\n\u201cIt is the most unaccountable thing in the world; the mystery remains as\nimpenetrable as ever; I have hunted high and low for him, and inquired\nof everybody, but in vain; all trace of him ends at that hotel in New\nYork; I never have seen or heard of him since, up to this day; he could\nhardly have sailed, for his name does not appear upon the books of any\nshipping office in New York or Boston or Baltimore. How fortunate it\nseems, now, that we kept this thing to ourselves; Laura still has a\nfather in you, and it is better for her that we drop this subject here\nforever.\u201d That was all. Random remarks here and there, being pieced\ntogether gave Laura a vague impression of a man of fine presence, about\nforty-three or forty-five years of age, with dark hair and eyes, and a\nslight limp in his walk--it was not stated which leg was defective. And\nthis indistinct shadow represented her father. She made an exhaustive\nsearch for the missing letters, but found none. They had probably been\nburned; and she doubted not that the ones she had ferreted out would\nhave shared the same fate if Mr. Hawkins had not been a dreamer, void\nof method, whose mind was perhaps in a state of conflagration over some\nbright new speculation when he received them.\n\nShe sat long, with the letters in her lap, thinking--and unconsciously\nfreezing. She felt like a lost person who has traveled down a long\nlane in good hope of escape, and, just as the night descends finds his\nprogress barred by a bridge-less river whose further shore, if it has\none, is lost in the darkness. If she could only have found these letters\na month sooner! That was her thought. But now the dead had carried\ntheir secrets with them. A dreary, melancholy settled down upon her. An\nundefined sense of injury crept into her heart. She grew very miserable.\n\nShe had just reached the romantic age--the age when there is a sad\nsweetness, a dismal comfort to a girl to find out that there is a\nmystery connected with her birth, which no other piece of good luck can\nafford. She had more than her rightful share of practical good sense,\nbut still she was human; and to be human is to have one's little modicum\nof romance secreted away in one's composition. One never ceases to make\na hero of one's self, (in private,) during life, but only alters the\nstyle of his heroism from time to time as the drifting years belittle\ncertain gods of his admiration and raise up others in their stead that\nseem greater.\n\nThe recent wearing days and nights of watching, and the wasting grief\nthat had possessed her, combined with the profound depression that\nnaturally came with the reaction of idleness, made Laura peculiarly\nsusceptible at this time to romantic impressions. She was a heroine,\nnow, with a mysterious father somewhere. She could not really tell\nwhether she wanted to find him and spoil it all or not; but still all\nthe traditions of romance pointed to the making the attempt as the usual\nand necessary course to follow; therefore she would some day begin the\nsearch when opportunity should offer.\n\nNow a former thought struck her--she would speak to Mrs. Hawkins. And\nnaturally enough Mrs. Hawkins appeared on the stage at that moment.\n\nShe said she knew all--she knew that Laura had discovered the secret\nthat Mr. Hawkins, the elder children, Col. Sellers and herself had kept\nso long and so faithfully; and she cried and said that now that troubles\nhad begun they would never end; her daughter's love would wean itself\naway from her and her heart would break. Her grief so wrought upon\nLaura that the girl almost forgot her own troubles for the moment in her\ncompassion for her mother's distress. Finally Mrs. Hawkins said:\n\n\u201cSpeak to me, child--do not forsake me. Forget all this miserable talk.\nSay I am your mother!--I have loved you so long, and there is no other.\nI am your mother, in the sight of God, and nothing shall ever take you\nfrom me!\u201d\n\nAll barriers fell, before this appeal. Laura put her arms about her\nmother's neck and said:\n\n\u201cYou are my mother, and always shall be. We will be as we have always\nbeen; and neither this foolish talk nor any other thing shall part us or\nmake us less to each other than we are this hour.\u201d\n\nThere was no longer any sense of separation or estrangement between\nthem. Indeed their love seemed more perfect now than it had ever been\nbefore. By and by they went down stairs and sat by the fire and talked\nlong and earnestly about Laura's history and the letters. But it\ntranspired that Mrs. Hawkins had never known of this correspondence\nbetween her husband and Major Lackland. With his usual consideration for\nhis wife, Mr. Hawkins had shielded her from the worry the matter would\nhave caused her.\n\nLaura went to bed at last with a mind that had gained largely in\ntranquility and had lost correspondingly in morbid romantic exaltation.\nShe was pensive, the next day, and subdued; but that was not matter for\nremark, for she did not differ from the mournful friends about her in\nthat respect. Clay and Washington were the same loving and admiring\nbrothers now that they had always been. The great secret was new to some\nof the younger children, but their love suffered no change under the\nwonderful revelation.\n\nIt is barely possible that things might have presently settled down\ninto their old rut and the mystery have lost the bulk of its romantic\nsublimity in Laura's eyes, if the village gossips could have quieted\ndown. But they could not quiet down and they did not. Day after day\nthey called at the house, ostensibly upon visits of condolence, and they\npumped away at the mother and the children without seeming to know\nthat their questionings were in bad taste. They meant no harm they only\nwanted to know. Villagers always want to know.\n\nThe family fought shy of the questionings, and of course that was high\ntestimony \u201cif the Duchess was respectably born, why didn't they come out\nand prove it?--why did they, stick to that poor thin story about picking\nher up out of a steamboat explosion?\u201d\n\nUnder this ceaseless persecution, Laura's morbid self-communing was\nrenewed. At night the day's contribution of detraction, innuendo and\nmalicious conjecture would be canvassed in her mind, and then she would\ndrift into a course of thinking. As her thoughts ran on, the indignant\ntears would spring to her eyes, and she would spit out fierce little\nejaculations at intervals. But finally she would grow calmer and say\nsome comforting disdainful thing--something like this:\n\n\u201cBut who are they?--Animals! What are their opinions to me? Let\nthem talk--I will not stoop to be affected by it. I could hate----.\nNonsense--nobody I care for or in any way respect is changed toward me,\nI fancy.\u201d\n\nShe may have supposed she was thinking of many individuals, but it was\nnot so--she was thinking of only one. And her heart warmed somewhat,\ntoo, the while. One day a friend overheard a conversation like\nthis:--and naturally came and told her all about it:\n\n\u201cNed, they say you don't go there any more. How is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don't; but I tell you it's not because I don't want to and\nit's not because I think it is any matter who her father was or who he\nwasn't, either; it's only on account of this talk, talk, talk. I think\nshe is a fine girl every way, and so would you if you knew her as well\nas I do; but you know how it is when a girl once gets talked about--it's\nall up with her--the world won't ever let her alone, after that.\u201d\n\nThe only comment Laura made upon this revelation, was:\n\n\u201cThen it appears that if this trouble had not occurred I could have\nhad the happiness of Mr. Ned Thurston's serious attentions. He is well\nfavored in person, and well liked, too, I believe, and comes of one of\nthe first families of the village. He is prosperous, too, I hear; has\nbeen a doctor a year, now, and has had two patients--no, three, I think;\nyes, it was three. I attended their funerals. Well, other people have\nhoped and been disappointed; I am not alone in that. I wish you could\nstay to dinner, Maria--we are going to have sausages; and besides, I\nwanted to talk to you about Hawkeye and make you promise to come and see\nus when we are settled there.\u201d\n\nBut Maria could not stay. She had come to mingle romantic tears with\nLaura's over the lover's defection and had found herself dealing with a\nheart that could not rise to an appreciation of affliction because its\ninterest was all centred in sausages.\n\nBut as soon as Maria was gone, Laura stamped her expressive foot and\nsaid:\n\n\u201cThe coward! Are all books lies? I thought he would fly to the front,\nand be brave and noble, and stand up for me against all the world, and\ndefy my enemies, and wither these gossips with his scorn! Poor crawling\nthing, let him go. I do begin to despise this world!\u201d\n\nShe lapsed into thought. Presently she said:\n\n\u201cIf the time ever comes, and I get a chance, Oh, I'll----\u201d\n\nShe could not find a word that was strong enough, perhaps. By and by she\nsaid:\n\n\u201cWell, I am glad of it--I'm glad of it. I never cared anything for him\nanyway!\u201d\n\nAnd then, with small consistency, she cried a little, and patted her\nfoot more indignantly than ever.\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nTwo months had gone by and the Hawkins family were domiciled in\nHawkeye. Washington was at work in the real estate office again, and\nwas alternately in paradise or the other place just as it happened\nthat Louise was gracious to him or seemingly indifferent--because\nindifference or preoccupation could mean nothing else than that she was\nthinking of some other young person. Col. Sellers had asked him\nseveral times, to dine with him, when he first returned to Hawkeye, but\nWashington, for no particular reason, had not accepted. No particular\nreason except one which he preferred to keep to himself--viz. that he\ncould not bear to be away from Louise. It occurred to him, now, that the\nColonel had not invited him lately--could he be offended? He resolved\nto go that very day, and give the Colonel a pleasant surprise. It was a\ngood idea; especially as Louise had absented herself from breakfast that\nmorning, and torn his heart; he would tear hers, now, and let her see\nhow it felt.\n\nThe Sellers family were just starting to dinner when Washington\nburst upon them with his surprise. For an instant the Colonel looked\nnonplussed, and just a bit uncomfortable; and Mrs. Sellers looked\nactually distressed; but the next moment the head of the house was\nhimself again, and exclaimed:\n\n\u201cAll right, my boy, all right--always glad to see you--always glad\nto hear your voice and take you by the hand. Don't wait for special\ninvitations--that's all nonsense among friends. Just come whenever you\ncan, and come as often as you can--the oftener the better. You can't\nplease us any better than that, Washington; the little woman will tell\nyou so herself. We don't pretend to style. Plain folks, you know--plain\nfolks. Just a plain family dinner, but such as it is, our friends are\nalways welcome, I reckon you know that yourself, Washington. Run along,\nchildren, run along; Lafayette,--[**In those old days the average man\ncalled his children after his most revered literary and historical\nidols; consequently there was hardly a family, at least in the West,\nbut had a Washington in it--and also a Lafayette, a Franklin, and six or\neight sounding names from Byron, Scott, and the Bible, if the offspring\nheld out. To visit such a family, was to find one's self confronted by\na congress made up of representatives of the imperial myths and the\nmajestic dead of all the ages. There was something thrilling about it,\nto a stranger, not to say awe inspiring.]--stand off the cat's tail,\nchild, can't you see what you're doing?--Come, come, come, Roderick\nDhu, it isn't nice for little boys to hang onto young gentlemen's coat\ntails--but never mind him, Washington, he's full of spirits and don't\nmean any harm. Children will be children, you know. Take the chair\nnext to Mrs. Sellers, Washington--tut, tut, Marie Antoinette, let your\nbrother have the fork if he wants it, you are bigger than he is.\u201d\n\nWashington contemplated the banquet, and wondered if he were in his\nright mind. Was this the plain family dinner? And was it all present?\nIt was soon apparent that this was indeed the dinner: it was all on the\ntable: it consisted of abundance of clear, fresh water, and a basin of\nraw turnips--nothing more.\n\nWashington stole a glance at Mrs. Sellers's face, and would have given\nthe world, the next moment, if he could have spared her that. The poor\nwoman's face was crimson, and the tears stood in her eyes. Washington\ndid not know what to do. He wished he had never come there and spied out\nthis cruel poverty and brought pain to that poor little lady's heart\nand shame to her cheek; but he was there, and there was no escape. Col.\nSellers hitched back his coat sleeves airily from his wrists as who\nshould say \u201cNow for solid enjoyment!\u201d seized a fork, flourished it and\nbegan to harpoon turnips and deposit them in the plates before him \u201cLet\nme help you, Washington--Lafayette, pass this plate to Washington--ah,\nwell, well, my boy, things are looking pretty bright, now, I tell you.\nSpeculation--my! the whole atmosphere's full of money. I would'nt take\nthree fortunes for one little operation I've got on hand now--have\nanything from the casters? No? Well, you're right, you're right.\nSome people like mustard with turnips, but--now there was Baron\nPoniatowski--Lord, but that man did know how to live!--true Russian\nyou know, Russian to the back bone; I say to my wife, give me a Russian\nevery time, for a table comrade. The Baron used to say, 'Take mustard,\nSellers, try the mustard,--a man can't know what turnips are in\nperfection without, mustard,' but I always said, 'No, Baron, I'm a plain\nman and I want my food plain--none of your embellishments for Beriah\nSellers--no made dishes for me! And it's the best way--high living kills\nmore than it cures in this world, you can rest assured of that.--Yes\nindeed, Washington, I've got one little operation on hand that--take\nsome more water--help yourself, won't you?--help yourself, there's\nplenty of it.--You'll find it pretty good, I guess. How does that fruit\nstrike you?\u201d\n\nWashington said he did not know that he had ever tasted better. He did\nnot add that he detested turnips even when they were cooked--loathed\nthem in their natural state. No, he kept this to himself, and praised\nthe turnips to the peril of his soul.\n\n\u201cI thought you'd like them. Examine them--examine them--they'll bear\nit. See how perfectly firm and juicy they are--they can't start any like\nthem in this part of the country, I can tell you. These are from New\nJersey--I imported them myself. They cost like sin, too; but lord bless\nme, I go in for having the best of a thing, even if it does cost a\nlittle more--it's the best economy, in the long run. These are the\nEarly Malcolm--it's a turnip that can't be produced except in just one\norchard, and the supply never is up to the demand. Take some more water,\nWashington--you can't drink too much water with fruit--all the doctors\nsay that. The plague can't come where this article is, my boy!\u201d\n\n\u201cPlague? What plague?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat plague, indeed? Why the Asiatic plague that nearly depopulated\nLondon a couple of centuries ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how does that concern us? There is no plague here, I reckon.\u201d\n\n\u201cSh! I've let it out! Well, never mind--just keep it to yourself.\nPerhaps I oughtn't said anything, but its bound to come out sooner\nor later, so what is the odds? Old McDowells wouldn't like me\nto--to--bother it all, I'll jest tell the whole thing and let it go. You\nsee, I've been down to St. Louis, and I happened to run across old Dr.\nMcDowells--thinks the world of me, does the doctor. He's a man that\nkeeps himself to himself, and well he may, for he knows that he's got\na reputation that covers the whole earth--he won't condescend to open\nhimself out to many people, but lord bless you, he and I are just like\nbrothers; he won't let me go to a hotel when I'm in the city--says I'm\nthe only man that's company to him, and I don't know but there's some\ntruth in it, too, because although I never like to glorify myself and\nmake a great to-do over what I am or what I can do or what I know, I\ndon't mind saying here among friends that I am better read up in most\nsciences, maybe, than the general run of professional men in these days.\nWell, the other day he let me into a little secret, strictly on the\nquiet, about this matter of the plague.\n\n\u201cYou see it's booming right along in our direction--follows the Gulf\nStream, you know, just as all those epidemics do, and within three\nmonths it will be just waltzing through this land like a whirlwind! And\nwhoever it touches can make his will and contract for the funeral.\nWell you can't cure it, you know, but you can prevent it. How? Turnips!\nthat's it! Turnips and water! Nothing like it in the world, old\nMcDowells says, just fill yourself up two or three times a day, and you\ncan snap your fingers at the plague. Sh!--keep mum, but just you\nconfine yourself to that diet and you're all right. I wouldn't have old\nMcDowells know that I told about it for anything--he never would speak\nto me again. Take some more water, Washington--the more water you drink,\nthe better. Here, let me give you some more of the turnips. No, no,\nno, now, I insist. There, now. Absorb those. They're, mighty\nsustaining--brim full of nutriment--all the medical books say so. Just\neat from four to seven good-sized turnips at a meal, and drink from a\npint and a half to a quart of water, and then just sit around a couple\nof hours and let them ferment. You'll feel like a fighting cock next\nday.\u201d\n\nFifteen or twenty minutes later the Colonel's tongue was still\nchattering away--he had piled up several future fortunes out of several\nincipient \u201coperations\u201d which he had blundered into within the past week,\nand was now soaring along through some brilliant expectations born of\nlate promising experiments upon the lacking ingredient of the eye-water.\nAnd at such a time Washington ought to have been a rapt and enthusiastic\nlistener, but he was not, for two matters disturbed his mind and\ndistracted his attention. One was, that he discovered, to his confusion\nand shame, that in allowing himself to be helped a second time to the\nturnips, he had robbed those hungry children. He had not needed the\ndreadful \u201cfruit,\u201d and had not wanted it; and when he saw the pathetic\nsorrow in their faces when they asked for more and there was no more to\ngive them, he hated himself for his stupidity and pitied the famishing\nyoung things with all his heart. The other matter that disturbed him was\nthe dire inflation that had begun in his stomach. It grew and grew,\nit became more and more insupportable. Evidently the turnips were\n\u201cfermenting.\u201d He forced himself to sit still as long as he could, but\nhis anguish conquered him at last.\n\nHe rose in the midst of the Colonel's talk and excused himself on the\nplea of a previous engagement. The Colonel followed him to the door,\npromising over and over again that he would use his influence to get\nsome of the Early Malcolms for him, and insisting that he should not be\nsuch a stranger but come and take pot-luck with him every chance he\ngot. Washington was glad enough to get away and feel free again. He\nimmediately bent his steps toward home.\n\nIn bed he passed an hour that threatened to turn his hair gray, and\nthen a blessed calm settled down upon him that filled his heart with\ngratitude. Weak and languid, he made shift to turn himself about\nand seek rest and sleep; and as his soul hovered upon the brink of\nunconciousness, he heaved a long, deep sigh, and said to himself that in\nhis heart he had cursed the Colonel's preventive of rheumatism, before,\nand now let the plague come if it must--he was done with preventives; if\never any man beguiled him with turnips and water again, let him die the\ndeath.\n\nIf he dreamed at all that night, no gossiping spirit disturbed his\nvisions to whisper in his ear of certain matters just then in bud in\nthe East, more than a thousand miles away that after the lapse of a few\nyears would develop influences which would profoundly affect the fate\nand fortunes of the Hawkins family.\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\u201cOh, it's easy enough to make a fortune,\u201d Henry said.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be easier than it is, I begin to think,\u201d replied Philip.\n\n\u201cWell, why don't you go into something? You'll never dig it out of the\nAstor Library.\u201d\n\nIf there be any place and time in the world where and when it seems easy\nto \u201cgo into something\u201d it is in Broadway on a spring morning, when one\nis walking city-ward, and has before him the long lines of palace-shops\nwith an occasional spire seen through the soft haze that lies over the\nlower town, and hears the roar and hum of its multitudinous traffic.\n\nTo the young American, here or elsewhere, the paths to fortune are\ninnumerable and all open; there is invitation in the air and success\nin all his wide horizon. He is embarrassed which to choose, and is not\nunlikely to waste years in dallying with his chances, before giving\nhimself to the serious tug and strain of a single object. He has no\ntraditions to bind him or guide him, and his impulse is to break away\nfrom the occupation his father has followed, and make a new way for\nhimself.\n\nPhilip Sterling used to say that if he should seriously set himself for\nten years to any one of the dozen projects that were in his brain, he\nfelt that he could be a rich man. He wanted to be rich, he had a sincere\ndesire for a fortune, but for some unaccountable reason he hesitated\nabout addressing himself to the narrow work of getting it. He never\nwalked Broadway, a part of its tide of abundant shifting life, without\nfeeling something of the flush of wealth, and unconsciously taking the\nelastic step of one well-to-do in this prosperous world.\n\nEspecially at night in the crowded theatre--Philip was too young to\nremember the old Chambers' Street box, where the serious Burton led his\nhilarious and pagan crew--in the intervals of the screaming comedy, when\nthe orchestra scraped and grunted and tooted its dissolute tunes, the\nworld seemed full of opportunities to Philip, and his heart exulted with\na conscious ability to take any of its prizes he chose to pluck.\n\nPerhaps it was the swimming ease of the acting, on the stage, where\nvirtue had its reward in three easy acts, perhaps it was the excessive\nlight of the house, or the music, or the buzz of the excited talk\nbetween acts, perhaps it was youth which believed everything, but for\nsome reason while Philip was at the theatre he had the utmost confidence\nin life and his ready victory in it.\n\nDelightful illusion of paint and tinsel and silk attire, of cheap\nsentiment and high and mighty dialogue! Will there not always be rosin\nenough for the squeaking fiddle-bow?\n\nDo we not all like the maudlin hero, who is sneaking round the right\nentrance, in wait to steal the pretty wife of his rich and tyrannical\nneighbor from the paste-board cottage at the left entrance? and when\nhe advances down to the foot-lights and defiantly informs the audience\nthat, \u201che who lays his hand on a woman except in the way of kindness,\u201d\n do we not all applaud so as to drown the rest of the sentence?\n\nPhilip never was fortunate enough to hear what would become of a man who\nshould lay his hand on a woman with the exception named; but he learned\nafterwards that the woman who lays her hand on a man, without any\nexception whatsoever, is always acquitted by the jury.\n\nThe fact was, though Philip Sterling did not know it, that he wanted\nseveral other things quite as much as he wanted wealth. The modest\nfellow would have liked fame thrust upon him for some worthy\nachievement; it might be for a book, or for the skillful management of\nsome great newspaper, or for some daring expedition like that of Lt.\nStrain or Dr. Kane. He was unable to decide exactly what it should be.\nSometimes he thought he would like to stand in a conspicuous pulpit and\nhumbly preach the gospel of repentance; and it even crossed his mind\nthat it would be noble to give himself to a missionary life to some\nbenighted region, where the date-palm grows, and the nightingale's voice\nis in tune, and the bul-bul sings on the off nights. If he were good\nenough he would attach himself to that company of young men in the\nTheological Seminary, who were seeing New York life in preparation for\nthe ministry.\n\nPhilip was a New England boy and had graduated at Yale; he had not\ncarried off with him all the learning of that venerable institution, but\nhe knew some things that were not in the regular course of study. A\nvery good use of the English language and considerable knowledge of its\nliterature was one of them; he could sing a song very well, not in time\nto be sure, but with enthusiasm; he could make a magnetic speech at a\nmoment's notice in the class room, the debating society, or upon any\nfence or dry-goods box that was convenient; he could lift himself by one\narm, and do the giant swing in the gymnasium; he could strike out from\nhis left shoulder; he could handle an oar like a professional and pull\nstroke in a winning race. Philip had a good appetite, a sunny temper,\nand a clear hearty laugh. He had brown hair, hazel eyes set wide apart,\na broad but not high forehead, and a fresh winning face. He was six feet\nhigh, with broad shoulders, long legs and a swinging gait; one of those\nloose-jointed, capable fellows, who saunter into the world with a free\nair and usually make a stir in whatever company they enter.\n\nAfter he left college Philip took the advice of friends and read law.\nLaw seemed to him well enough as a science, but he never could discover\na practical case where it appeared to him worth while to go to law, and\nall the clients who stopped with this new clerk in the ante-room of the\nlaw office where he was writing, Philip invariably advised to settle--no\nmatter how, but settle--greatly to the disgust of his employer, who\nknew that justice between man and man could only be attained by the\nrecognized processes, with the attendant fees. Besides Philip hated the\ncopying of pleadings, and he was certain that a life of \u201cwhereases\u201d\n and \u201caforesaids\u201d and whipping the devil round the stump, would be\nintolerable.\n\n[Note: these few paragraphs are nearly an autobiography of the life of\nCharles Dudley Warner whose contributions to the story start here with\nChapter XII. D.W.]\n\nHis pen therefore, and whereas, and not as aforesaid, strayed off into\nother scribbling. In an unfortunate hour, he had two or three papers\naccepted by first-class magazines, at three dollars the printed page,\nand, behold, his vocation was open to him. He would make his mark in\nliterature.\n\nLife has no moment so sweet as that in which a young man believes\nhimself called into the immortal ranks of the masters of literature.\nIt is such a noble ambition, that it is a pity it has usually such a\nshallow foundation.\n\nAt the time of this history, Philip had gone to New York for a career.\nWith his talent he thought he should have little difficulty in getting\nan editorial position upon a metropolitan newspaper; not that he knew\nanything about newspaper work, or had the least idea of journalism;\nhe knew he was not fitted for the technicalities of the subordinate\ndepartments, but he could write leaders with perfect ease, he was sure.\nThe drudgery of the newspaper office was too distasteful, and besides\nit would be beneath the dignity of a graduate and a successful magazine\nwriter. He wanted to begin at the top of the ladder.\n\nTo his surprise he found that every situation in the editorial\ndepartment of the journals was full, always had been full, was always\nlikely to be full. It seemed to him that the newspaper managers didn't\nwant genius, but mere plodding and grubbing. Philip therefore read\ndiligently in the Astor library, planned literary works that should\ncompel attention, and nursed his genius. He had no friend wise enough\nto tell him to step into the Dorking Convention, then in session, make\na sketch of the men and women on the platform, and take it to the editor\nof the Daily Grapevine, and see what he could get a line for it.\n\nOne day he had an offer from some country friends, who believed in him,\nto take charge of a provincial daily newspaper, and he went to consult\nMr. Gringo--Gringo who years ago managed the Atlas--about taking the\nsituation.\n\n\u201cTake it of course,\u201d says Gringo, \u201ctake anything that offers, why not?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they want me to make it an opposition paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, make it that. That party is going to succeed, it's going to elect\nthe next president.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't believe it,\u201d said Philip, stoutly, \u201cits wrong in principle,\nand it ought not to succeed, but I don't see how I can go for a thing I\ndon't believe in.\u201d\n\n\u201cO, very well,\u201d said Gringo, turning away with a shade of contempt,\n\u201cyou'll find if you are going into literature and newspaper work that\nyou can't afford a conscience like that.\u201d\n\nBut Philip did afford it, and he wrote, thanking his friends, and\ndeclining because he said the political scheme would fail, and ought to\nfail. And he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening\nlarge enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world.\n\nIt was in this time of rather impatient waiting that Philip was\none morning walking down Broadway with Henry Brierly. He frequently\naccompanied Henry part way down town to what the latter called his\noffice in Broad Street, to which he went, or pretended to go, with\nregularity every day. It was evident to the most casual acquaintance\nthat he was a man of affairs, and that his time was engrossed in the\nlargest sort of operations, about which there was a mysterious air. His\nliability to be suddenly summoned to Washington, or Boston or Montreal\nor even to Liverpool was always imminent. He never was so summoned, but\nnone of his acquaintances would have been surprised to hear any day that\nhe had gone to Panama or Peoria, or to hear from him that he had bought\nthe Bank of Commerce.\n\nThe two were intimate at that time,--they had been classmates--and saw\na great deal of each other. Indeed, they lived together in Ninth Street,\nin a boarding-house, there, which had the honor of lodging and partially\nfeeding several other young fellows of like kidney, who have since gone\ntheir several ways into fame or into obscurity.\n\nIt was during the morning walk to which reference has been made that\nHenry Brierly suddenly said, \u201cPhilip, how would you like to go to St.\nJo?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I should like it of all things,\u201d replied Philip, with some\nhesitation, \u201cbut what for.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it's a big operation. We are going, a lot of us, railroad men,\nengineers, contractors. You know my uncle is a great railroad man. I've\nno doubt I can get you a chance to go if you'll go.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut in what capacity would I go?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I'm going as an engineer. You can go as one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know an engine from a coal cart.\u201d\n\n\u201cField engineer, civil engineer. You can begin by carrying a rod, and\nputting down the figures. It's easy enough. I'll show you about that.\nWe'll get Trautwine and some of those books.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but what is it for, what is it all about?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don't you see? We lay out a line, spot the good land, enter it up,\nknow where the stations are to be, spot them, buy lots; there's heaps of\nmoney in it. We wouldn't engineer long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen do you go?\u201d was Philip's next question, after some moments of\nsilence.\n\n\u201cTo-morrow. Is that too soon?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, its not too soon. I've been ready to go anywhere for six months.\nThe fact is, Henry, that I'm about tired of trying to force myself\ninto things, and am quite willing to try floating with the stream for a\nwhile, and see where I will land. This seems like a providential call;\nit's sudden enough.\u201d\n\nThe two young men who were by this time full of the adventure, went down\nto the Wall street office of Henry's uncle and had a talk with that\nwily operator. The uncle knew Philip very well, and was pleased with his\nfrank enthusiasm, and willing enough to give him a trial in the western\nventure. It was settled therefore, in the prompt way in which things are\nsettled in New York, that they would start with the rest of the company\nnext morning for the west.\n\nOn the way up town these adventurers bought books on engineering, and\nsuits of India-rubber, which they supposed they would need in a new and\nprobably damp country, and many other things which nobody ever needed\nanywhere.\n\nThe night was spent in packing up and writing letters, for Philip would\nnot take such an important step without informing his friends. If they\ndisapprove, thought he, I've done my duty by letting them know. Happy\nyouth, that is ready to pack its valise, and start for Cathay on an\nhour's notice.\n\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d calls out Philip from his bed-room, to Henry, \u201cwhere is\nSt. Jo.?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, it's in Missouri somewhere, on the frontier I think. We'll get a\nmap.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind the map. We will find the place itself. I was afraid it was\nnearer home.\u201d\n\nPhilip wrote a long letter, first of all, to his mother, full of love\nand glowing anticipations of his new opening. He wouldn't bother her\nwith business details, but he hoped that the day was not far off when\nshe would see him return, with a moderate fortune, and something to add\nto the comfort of her advancing years.\n\nTo his uncle he said that he had made an arrangement with some New York\ncapitalists to go to Missouri, in a land and railroad operation, which\nwould at least give him a knowledge of the world and not unlikely offer\nhim a business opening. He knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he\nhad at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter.\n\nIt was to Ruth Bolton that Philip wrote last. He might never see her\nagain; he went to seek his fortune. He well knew the perils of the\nfrontier, the savage state of society, the lurking Indians and the\ndangers of fever. But there was no real danger to a person who took care\nof himself. Might he write to her often and, tell her of his life. If he\nreturned with a fortune, perhaps and perhaps. If he was unsuccessful, or\nif he never returned--perhaps it would be as well. No time or distance,\nhowever, would ever lessen his interest in her. He would say good-night,\nbut not good-bye.\n\nIn the soft beginning of a Spring morning, long before New York had\nbreakfasted, while yet the air of expectation hung about the wharves of\nthe metropolis, our young adventurers made their way to the Jersey City\nrailway station of the Erie road, to begin the long, swinging, crooked\njourney, over what a writer of a former day called a causeway of cracked\nrails and cows, to the West.\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n     What ever to say be toke in his entente,\n     his langage was so fayer & pertynante,\n     yt semeth unto manys herying not only the worde,\n     but veryly the thyng.\n     Caxton's Book of Curtesye.\n\nIn the party of which our travelers found themselves members, was Duff\nBrown, the great railroad contractor, and subsequently a well-known\nmember of Congress; a bluff, jovial Bost'n man, thick-set, close shaven,\nwith a heavy jaw and a low forehead--a very pleasant man if you were\nnot in his way. He had government contracts also, custom houses and dry\ndocks, from Portland to New Orleans, and managed to get out of congress,\nin appropriations, about weight for weight of gold for the stone\nfurnished.\n\nAssociated with him, and also of this party, was Rodney Schaick, a\nsleek New York broker, a man as prominent in the church as in the\nstock exchange, dainty in his dress, smooth of speech, the necessary\ncomplement of Duff Brown in any enterprise that needed assurance and\nadroitness.\n\nIt would be difficult to find a pleasanter traveling party, one\nthat shook off more readily the artificial restraints of Puritanic\nstrictness, and took the world with good-natured allowance. Money was\nplenty for every attainable luxury, and there seemed to be no doubt\nthat its supply would continue, and that fortunes were about to be made\nwithout a great deal of toil. Even Philip soon caught the prevailing\nspirit; Barry did not need any inoculation, he always talked in six\nfigures. It was as natural for the dear boy to be rich as it is for most\npeople to be poor.\n\nThe elders of the party were not long in discovering the fact, which\nalmost all travelers to the west soon find out; that the water was\npoor. It must have been by a lucky premonition of this that they all had\nbrandy flasks with which to qualify the water of the country; and it\nwas no doubt from an uneasy feeling of the danger of being poisoned that\nthey kept experimenting, mixing a little of the dangerous and changing\nfluid, as they passed along, with the contents of the flasks, thus\nsaving their lives hour by hour. Philip learned afterwards that\ntemperance and the strict observance of Sunday and a certain gravity of\ndeportment are geographical habits, which people do not usually carry\nwith them away from home.\n\nOur travelers stopped in Chicago long enough to see that they could\nmake their fortunes there in two week's time, but it did not seem worth\nwhile; the west was more attractive; the further one went the wider the\nopportunities opened.\n\nThey took railroad to Alton and the steamboat from there to St. Louis,\nfor the change and to have a glimpse of the river.\n\n\u201cIsn't this jolly?\u201d cried Henry, dancing out of the barber's room, and\ncoming down the deck with a one, two, three step, shaven, curled and\nperfumed after his usual exquisite fashion.\n\n\u201cWhat's jolly?\u201d asked Philip, looking out upon the dreary and monotonous\nwaste through which the shaking steamboat was coughing its way.\n\n\u201cWhy, the whole thing; it's immense I can tell you. I wouldn't give that\nto be guaranteed a hundred thousand cold cash in a year's time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere's Mr. Brown?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is in the saloon, playing poker with Schaick and that long haired\nparty with the striped trousers, who scrambled aboard when the stage\nplank was half hauled in, and the big Delegate to Congress from out\nwest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's a fine looking fellow, that delegate, with his glossy, black\nwhiskers; looks like a Washington man; I shouldn't think he'd be at\npoker.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, its only five cent ante, just to make it interesting, the Delegate\nsaid.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I shouldn't think a representative in Congress would play poker any\nway in a public steamboat.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense, you've got to pass the time. I tried a hand myself, but those\nold fellows are too many for me. The Delegate knows all the points. I'd\nbet a hundred dollars he will ante his way right into the United States\nSenate when his territory comes in. He's got the cheek for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has the grave and thoughtful manner of expectoration of a public\nman, for one thing,\u201d added Philip.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Philip, after a pause, \u201cwhat have you got on those big\nboots for; do you expect to wade ashore?\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm breaking 'em in.\u201d\n\nThe fact was Harry had got himself up in what he thought a proper\ncostume for a new country, and was in appearance a sort of compromise\nbetween a dandy of Broadway and a backwoodsman. Harry, with blue eyes,\nfresh complexion, silken whiskers and curly chestnut hair, was as\nhandsome as a fashion plate. He wore this morning a soft hat, a short\ncutaway coat, an open vest displaying immaculate linen, a leathern belt\nround his waist, and top-boots of soft leather, well polished, that came\nabove his knees and required a string attached to his belt to keep them\nup. The light hearted fellow gloried in these shining encasements of his\nwell shaped legs, and told Philip that they were a perfect protection\nagainst prairie rattle-snakes, which never strike above the knee.\n\nThe landscape still wore an almost wintry appearance when our travelers\nleft Chicago. It was a genial spring day when they landed at St. Louis;\nthe birds were singing, the blossoms of peach trees in city garden\nplots, made the air sweet, and in the roar and tumult on the long river\nlevee they found an excitement that accorded with their own hopeful\nanticipations.\n\nThe party went to the Southern Hotel, where the great Duff Brown was\nvery well known, and indeed was a man of so much importance that even\nthe office clerk was respectful to him. He might have respected in him\nalso a certain vulgar swagger and insolence of money, which the clerk\ngreatly admired.\n\nThe young fellows liked the house and liked the city; it seemed to them\na mighty free and hospitable town. Coming from the East they were struck\nwith many peculiarities. Everybody smoked in the streets, for one thing,\nthey noticed; everybody \u201ctook a drink\u201d in an open manner whenever he\nwished to do so or was asked, as if the habit needed no concealment or\napology. In the evening when they walked about they found people\nsitting on the door-steps of their dwellings, in a manner not usual in a\nnorthern city; in front of some of the hotels and saloons the side walks\nwere filled with chairs and benches--Paris fashion, said Harry--upon\nwhich people lounged in these warm spring evenings, smoking, always\nsmoking; and the clink of glasses and of billiard balls was in the air.\nIt was delightful.\n\nHarry at once found on landing that his back-woods custom would not be\nneeded in St. Louis, and that, in fact, he had need of all the resources\nof his wardrobe to keep even with the young swells of the town. But this\ndid not much matter, for Harry was always superior to his clothes. As\nthey were likely to be detained some time in the city, Harry told\nPhilip that he was going to improve his time. And he did. It was an\nencouragement to any industrious man to see this young fellow rise,\ncarefully dress himself, eat his breakfast deliberately, smoke his cigar\ntranquilly, and then repair to his room, to what he called his work,\nwith a grave and occupied manner, but with perfect cheerfulness.\n\nHarry would take off his coat, remove his cravat, roll up his\nshirt-sleeves, give his curly hair the right touch before the glass,\nget out his book on engineering, his boxes of instruments, his drawing\npaper, his profile paper, open the book of logarithms, mix his India\nink, sharpen his pencils, light a cigar, and sit down at the table to\n\u201clay out a line,\u201d with the most grave notion that he was mastering the\ndetails of engineering. He would spend half a day in these preparations\nwithout ever working out a problem or having the faintest conception\nof the use of lines or logarithms. And when he had finished, he had the\nmost cheerful confidence that he had done a good day's work.\n\nIt made no difference, however, whether Harry was in his room in a hotel\nor in a tent, Philip soon found, he was just the same. In camp he would\nget himself up in the most elaborate toilet at his command, polish his\nlong boots to the top, lay out his work before him, and spend an hour or\nlonger, if anybody was looking at him, humming airs, knitting his brows,\nand \u201cworking\u201d at engineering; and if a crowd of gaping rustics were\nlooking on all the while it was perfectly satisfactory to him.\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d he says to Philip one morning at the hotel when he was thus\nengaged, \u201cI want to get the theory of this thing, so that I can have a\ncheck on the engineers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you were going to be an engineer yourself,\u201d queried Philip.\n\n\u201cNot many times, if the court knows herself. There's better game. Brown\nand Schaick have, or will have, the control for the whole line of the\nSalt Lick Pacific Extension, forty thousand dollars a mile over the\nprairie, with extra for hard-pan--and it'll be pretty much all hardpan\nI can tell you; besides every alternate section of land on this line.\nThere's millions in the job. I'm to have the sub-contract for the first\nfifty miles, and you can bet it's a soft thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll tell you what you do, Philip,\u201d continued Larry, in a burst of\ngenerosity, \u201cif I don't get you into my contract, you'll be with the\nengineers, and you jest stick a stake at the first ground marked for a\ndepot, buy the land of the farmer before he knows where the depot will\nbe, and we'll turn a hundred or so on that. I'll advance the money for\nthe payments, and you can sell the lots. Schaick is going to let me have\nten thousand just for a flyer in such operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that's a good deal of money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait till you are used to handling money. I didn't come out here for\na bagatelle. My uncle wanted me to stay East and go in on the Mobile\ncustom house, work up the Washington end of it; he said there was a\nfortune in it for a smart young fellow, but I preferred to take the\nchances out here. Did I tell you I had an offer from Bobbett and\nFanshaw to go into their office as confidential clerk on a salary of ten\nthousand?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn't you take it?\u201d asked Philip, to whom a salary of two thousand\nwould have seemed wealth, before he started on this journey.\n\n\u201cTake it? I'd rather operate on my own hook;\u201d said Harry, in his most\nairy manner.\n\nA few evenings after their arrival at the Southern, Philip and Harry\nmade the acquaintance of a very agreeable gentleman, whom they had\nfrequently seen before about the hotel corridors, and passed a casual\nword with. He had the air of a man of business, and was evidently a\nperson of importance.\n\nThe precipitating of this casual intercourse into the more substantial\nform of an acquaintanceship was the work of the gentleman himself, and\noccurred in this wise. Meeting the two friends in the lobby one evening,\nhe asked them to give him the time, and added:\n\n\u201cExcuse me, gentlemen--strangers in St. Louis? Ah, yes-yes. From the\nEast, perhaps? Ah; just so, just so. Eastern born myself--Virginia.\nSellers is my name--Beriah Sellers.\n\n\u201cAh! by the way--New York, did you say? That reminds me; just met\nsome gentlemen from your State, a week or two ago--very prominent\ngentlemen--in public life they are; you must know them, without doubt.\nLet me see--let me see. Curious those names have escaped me. I know\nthey were from your State, because I remember afterward my old friend\nGovernor Shackleby said to me--fine man, is the Governor--one of the\nfinest men our country has produced--said he, 'Colonel, how did you\nlike those New York gentlemen?--not many such men in the world,--Colonel\nSellers,' said the Governor--yes, it was New York he said--I remember it\ndistinctly. I can't recall those names, somehow. But no matter. Stopping\nhere, gentlemen--stopping at the Southern?\u201d\n\nIn shaping their reply in their minds, the title \u201cMr.\u201d had a place in\nit; but when their turn had arrived to speak, the title \u201cColonel\u201d came\nfrom their lips instead.\n\nThey said yes, they were abiding at the Southern, and thought it a very\ngood house.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, the Southern is fair. I myself go to the Planter's, old,\naristocratic house. We Southern gentlemen don't change our ways, you\nknow. I always make it my home there when I run down from Hawkeye--my\nplantation is in Hawkeye, a little up in the country. You should know\nthe Planter's.\u201d\n\nPhilip and Harry both said they should like to see a hotel that had been\nso famous in its day--a cheerful hostelrie, Philip said it must have\nbeen where duels were fought there across the dining-room table.\n\n\u201cYou may believe it, sir, an uncommonly pleasant lodging. Shall we\nwalk?\u201d\n\nAnd the three strolled along the streets, the Colonel talking all\nthe way in the most liberal and friendly manner, and with a frank\nopen-heartedness that inspired confidence.\n\n\u201cYes, born East myself, raised all along, know the West--a great\ncountry, gentlemen. The place for a young fellow of spirit to pick up a\nfortune, simply pick it up, it's lying round loose here. Not a day that\nI don't put aside an opportunity; too busy to look into it. Management\nof my own property takes my time. First visit? Looking for an opening?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, looking around,\u201d replied Harry.\n\n\u201cAh, here we are. You'd rather sit here in front than go to my\napartments? So had I. An opening eh?\u201d\n\nThe Colonel's eyes twinkled. \u201cAh, just so. The country is opening up,\nall we want is capital to develop it. Slap down the rails and bring the\nland into market. The richest land on God Almighty's footstool is\nlying right out there. If I had my capital free I could plant it for\nmillions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose your capital is largely in your plantation?\u201d asked Philip.\n\n\u201cWell, partly, sir, partly. I'm down here now with reference to a little\noperation--a little side thing merely. By the way gentlemen, excuse the\nliberty, but it's about my usual time\u201d--\n\nThe Colonel paused, but as no movement of his acquaintances followed\nthis plain remark, he added, in an explanatory manner,\n\n\u201cI'm rather particular about the exact time--have to be in this\nclimate.\u201d\n\nEven this open declaration of his hospitable intention not being\nunderstood the Colonel politely said,\n\n\u201cGentlemen, will you take something?\u201d\n\nCol. Sellers led the way to a saloon on Fourth street under the hotel,\nand the young gentlemen fell into the custom of the country.\n\n\u201cNot that,\u201d said the Colonel to the bar-keeper, who shoved along the\ncounter a bottle of apparently corn-whiskey, as if he had done it before\non the same order; \u201cnot that,\u201d with a wave of the hand. \u201cThat Otard if\nyou please. Yes. Never take an inferior liquor, gentlemen, not in the\nevening, in this climate. There. That's the stuff. My respects!\u201d\n\nThe hospitable gentleman, having disposed of his liquor, remarking that\nit was not quite the thing--\u201cwhen a man has his own cellar to go to, he\nis apt to get a little fastidious about his liquors\u201d--called for cigars.\nBut the brand offered did not suit him; he motioned the box away, and\nasked for some particular Havana's, those in separate wrappers.\n\n\u201cI always smoke this sort, gentlemen; they are a little more expensive,\nbut you'll learn, in this climate, that you'd better not economize on\npoor cigars.\u201d\n\nHaving imparted this valuable piece of information, the Colonel lighted\nthe fragrant cigar with satisfaction, and then carelessly put his\nfingers into his right vest pocket. That movement being without result,\nwith a shade of disappointment on his face, he felt in his left vest\npocket. Not finding anything there, he looked up with a serious and\nannoyed air, anxiously slapped his right pantaloon's pocket, and then\nhis left, and exclaimed,\n\n\u201cBy George, that's annoying. By George, that's mortifying. Never had\nanything of that kind happen to me before. I've left my pocket-book.\nHold! Here's a bill, after all. No, thunder, it's a receipt.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllow me,\u201d said Philip, seeing how seriously the Colonel was annoyed,\nand taking out his purse.\n\nThe Colonel protested he couldn't think of it, and muttered something to\nthe barkeeper about \u201changing it up,\u201d but the vender of exhilaration made\nno sign, and Philip had the privilege of paying the costly shot; Col.\nSellers profusely apologizing and claiming the right \u201cnext time, next\ntime.\u201d\n\nAs soon as Beriah Sellers had bade his friends good night and seen them\ndepart, he did not retire apartments in the Planter's, but took his way\nto his lodgings with a friend in a distant part of the city.\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nThe letter that Philip Sterling wrote to Ruth Bolton, on the evening of\nsetting out to seek his fortune in the west, found that young lady in\nher own father's house in Philadelphia. It was one of the pleasantest\nof the many charming suburban houses in that hospitable city, which is\nterritorially one of the largest cities in the world, and only prevented\nfrom becoming the convenient metropolis of the country by the intrusive\nstrip of Camden and Amboy sand which shuts it off from the Atlantic\nocean. It is a city of steady thrift, the arms of which might well be\nthe deliberate but delicious terrapin that imparts such a royal flavor\nto its feasts.\n\nIt was a spring morning, and perhaps it was the influence of it that\nmade Ruth a little restless, satisfied neither with the out-doors nor\nthe in-doors. Her sisters had gone to the city to show some country\nvisitors Independence Hall, Girard College and Fairmount Water Works\nand Park, four objects which Americans cannot die peacefully, even in\nNaples, without having seen. But Ruth confessed that she was tired of\nthem, and also of the Mint. She was tired of other things. She tried\nthis morning an air or two upon the piano, sang a simple song in a\nsweet but slightly metallic voice, and then seating herself by the open\nwindow, read Philip's letter. Was she thinking about Philip, as she\ngazed across the fresh lawn over the tree tops to the Chelton Hills, or\nof that world which his entrance, into her tradition-bound life had been\none of the means of opening to her? Whatever she thought, she was not\nidly musing, as one might see by the expression of her face. After a\ntime she took up a book; it was a medical work, and to all appearance\nabout as interesting to a girl of eighteen as the statutes at large; but\nher face was soon aglow over its pages, and she was so absorbed in it\nthat she did not notice the entrance of her mother at the open door.\n\n\u201cRuth?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, mother,\u201d said the young student, looking up, with a shade of\nimpatience.\n\n\u201cI wanted to talk with thee a little about thy plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cMother; thee knows I couldn't stand it at Westfield; the school stifled\nme, it's a place to turn young people into dried fruit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Margaret Bolton, with a half anxious smile, \u201cthee chafes\nagainst all the ways of Friends, but what will thee do? Why is thee so\ndiscontented?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I must say it, mother, I want to go away, and get out of this dead\nlevel.\u201d\n\nWith a look half of pain and half of pity, her mother answered, \u201cI am\nsure thee is little interfered with; thee dresses as thee will, and goes\nwhere thee pleases, to any church thee likes, and thee has music. I had\na visit yesterday from the society's committee by way of discipline,\nbecause we have a piano in the house, which is against the rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope thee told the elders that father and I are responsible for the\npiano, and that, much as thee loves music, thee is never in the room\nwhen it is played. Fortunately father is already out of meeting, so\nthey can't discipline him. I heard father tell cousin Abner that he was\nwhipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined\nto have what compensation he could get now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThy ways greatly try me, Ruth, and all thy relations. I desire thy\nhappiness first of all, but thee is starting out on a dangerous path.\nIs thy father willing thee should go away to a school of the world's\npeople?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not asked him,\u201d Ruth replied with a look that might imply that\nshe was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her\nown mind and then compelled others to make up theirs in accordance with\nhers.\n\n\u201cAnd when thee has got the education thee wants, and lost all relish for\nthe society of thy friends and the ways of thy ancestors, what then?\u201d\n\nRuth turned square round to her mother, and with an impassive face and\nnot the slightest change of tone, said,\n\n\u201cMother, I'm going to study medicine?\u201d\n\nMargaret Bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity.\n\n\u201cThee, study medicine! A slight frail girl like thee, study medicine!\nDoes thee think thee could stand it six months? And the lectures, and\nthe dissecting rooms, has thee thought of the dissecting rooms?\u201d\n\n\u201cMother,\u201d said Ruth calmly, \u201cI have thought it all over. I know I can go\nthrough the whole, clinics, dissecting room and all. Does thee think I\nlack nerve? What is there to fear in a person dead more than in a person\nliving?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut thy health and strength, child; thee can never stand the severe\napplication. And, besides, suppose thee does learn medicine?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will practice it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere thee and thy family are known?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I can get patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope at least, Ruth, thee will let us know when thee opens an\noffice,\u201d said her mother, with an approach to sarcasm that she rarely\nindulged in, as she rose and left the room.\n\nRuth sat quite still for a time, with face intent and flushed. It was\nout now. She had begun her open battle.\n\nThe sight-seers returned in high spirits from the city. Was there any\nbuilding in Greece to compare with Girard College, was there ever such a\nmagnificent pile of stone devised for the shelter of poor orphans? Think\nof the stone shingles of the roof eight inches thick! Ruth asked the\nenthusiasts if they would like to live in such a sounding mausoleum,\nwith its great halls and echoing rooms, and no comfortable place in it\nfor the accommodation of any body? If they were orphans, would they like\nto be brought up in a Grecian temple?\n\nAnd then there was Broad street! Wasn't it the broadest and the longest\nstreet in the world? There certainly was no end to it, and even Ruth was\nPhiladelphian enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end,\nor architectural point upon which the weary eye could rest.\n\nBut neither St. Girard, nor Broad street, neither wonders of the Mint\nnor the glories of the Hall where the ghosts of our fathers sit always\nsigning the Declaration; impressed the visitors so much as the splendors\nof the Chestnut street windows, and the bargains on Eighth street. The\ntruth is that the country cousins had come to town to attend the Yearly\nMeeting, and the amount of shopping that preceded that religious event\nwas scarcely exceeded by the preparations for the opera in more worldly\ncircles.\n\n\u201cIs thee going to the Yearly Meeting, Ruth?\u201d asked one of the girls.\n\n\u201cI have nothing to wear,\u201d replied that demure person. \u201cIf thee wants to\nsee new bonnets, orthodox to a shade and conformed to the letter of the\ntrue form, thee must go to the Arch Street Meeting. Any departure from\neither color or shape would be instantly taken note of. It has occupied\nmother a long time, to find at the shops the exact shade for her new\nbonnet. Oh, thee must go by all means. But thee won't see there a\nsweeter woman than mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd thee won't go?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should I? I've been again and again. If I go to Meeting at all I\nlike best to sit in the quiet old house in Germantown, where the windows\nare all open and I can see the trees, and hear the stir of the leaves.\nIt's such a crush at the Yearly Meeting at Arch Street, and then there's\nthe row of sleek-looking young men who line the curbstone and stare at\nus as we come out. No, I don't feel at home there.\u201d\n\nThat evening Ruth and her father sat late by the drawing-room fire, as\nthey were quite apt to do at night. It was always a time of confidences.\n\n\u201cThee has another letter from young Sterling,\u201d said Eli Bolton.\n\n\u201cYes. Philip has gone to the far west.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow far?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn't say, but it's on the frontier, and on the map everything\nbeyond it is marked 'Indians' and 'desert,' and looks as desolate as a\nWednesday Meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cHumph. It was time for him to do something. Is he going to start a\ndaily newspaper among the Kick-a-poos?\u201d\n\n\u201cFather, thee's unjust to Philip. He's going into business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sort of business can a young man go into without capital?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn't say exactly what it is,\u201d said Ruth a little dubiously, \u201cbut\nit's something about land and railroads, and thee knows, father, that\nfortunes are made nobody knows exactly how, in a new country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should think so, you innocent puss, and in an old one too. But Philip\nis honest, and he has talent enough, if he will stop scribbling, to make\nhis way. But thee may as well take care of theeself, Ruth, and not go\ndawdling along with a young man in his adventures, until thy own mind is\na little more settled what thee wants.\u201d\n\nThis excellent advice did not seem to impress Ruth greatly, for she was\nlooking away with that abstraction of vision which often came into her\ngrey eyes, and at length she exclaimed, with a sort of impatience,\n\n\u201cI wish I could go west, or south, or somewhere. What a box women are\nput into, measured for it, and put in young; if we go anywhere it's in\na box, veiled and pinioned and shut in by disabilities. Father, I should\nlike to break things and get loose!\u201d\n\nWhat a sweet-voiced little innocent, it was to be sure.\n\n\u201cThee will no doubt break things enough when thy time comes, child;\nwomen always have; but what does thee want now that thee hasn't?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be something, to make myself something, to do something. Why\nshould I rust, and be stupid, and sit in inaction because I am a girl?\nWhat would happen to me if thee should lose thy property and die? What\none useful thing could I do for a living, for the support of mother\nand the children? And if I had a fortune, would thee want me to lead a\nuseless life?\u201d\n\n\u201cHas thy mother led a useless life?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomewhat that depends upon whether her children amount to anything,\u201d\n retorted the sharp little disputant. \u201cWhat's the good, father, of a\nseries of human beings who don't advance any?\u201d\n\nFriend Eli, who had long ago laid aside the Quaker dress, and was out of\nMeeting, and who in fact after a youth of doubt could not yet define his\nbelief, nevertheless looked with some wonder at this fierce young eagle\nof his, hatched in a Friend's dove-cote. But he only said,\n\n\u201cHas thee consulted thy mother about a career, I suppose it is a career\nthee wants?\u201d\n\nRuth did not reply directly; she complained that her mother didn't\nunderstand her. But that wise and placid woman understood the sweet\nrebel a great deal better than Ruth understood herself. She also had a\nhistory, possibly, and had sometime beaten her young wings against the\ncage of custom, and indulged in dreams of a new social order, and had\npassed through that fiery period when it seems possible for one mind,\nwhich has not yet tried its limits, to break up and re-arrange the\nworld.\n\nRuth replied to Philip's letter in due time and in the most cordial and\nunsentimental manner. Philip liked the letter, as he did everything she\ndid; but he had a dim notion that there was more about herself in the\nletter than about him. He took it with him from the Southern Hotel, when\nhe went to walk, and read it over and again in an unfrequented street\nas he stumbled along. The rather common-place and unformed hand-writing\nseemed to him peculiar and characteristic, different from that of any\nother woman.\n\nRuth was glad to hear that Philip had made a push into the world, and\nshe was sure that his talent and courage would make a way for him.\nShe should pray for his success at any rate, and especially that the\nIndians, in St. Louis, would not take his scalp.\n\nPhilip looked rather dubious at this sentence, and wished that he had\nwritten nothing about Indians.\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nEli Bolton and his wife talked over Ruth's case, as they had often done\nbefore, with no little anxiety. Alone of all their children she was\nimpatient of the restraints and monotony of the Friends' Society, and\nwholly indisposed to accept the \u201cinner light\u201d as a guide into a life of\nacceptance and inaction. When Margaret told her husband of Ruth's newest\nproject, he did not exhibit so much surprise as she hoped for. In fact\nhe said that he did not see why a woman should not enter the medical\nprofession if she felt a call to it.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Margaret, \u201cconsider her total inexperience of the world, and\nher frail health. Can such a slight little body endure the ordeal of the\npreparation for, or the strain of, the practice of the profession?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid thee ever think, Margaret, whether, she can endure being thwarted\nin an object on which she has so set her heart, as she has on this? Thee\nhas trained her thyself at home, in her enfeebled childhood, and thee\nknows how strong her will is, and what she has been able to accomplish\nin self-culture by the simple force of her determination. She never will\nbe satisfied until she has tried her own strength.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish,\u201d said Margaret, with an inconsequence that is not exclusively\nfeminine, \u201cthat she were in the way to fall in love and marry by and by.\nI think that would cure her of some of her notions. I am not sure but\nif she went away, to some distant school, into an entirely new life, her\nthoughts would be diverted.\u201d\n\nEli Bolton almost laughed as he regarded his wife, with eyes that never\nlooked at her except fondly, and replied,\n\n\u201cPerhaps thee remembers that thee had notions also, before we were\nmarried, and before thee became a member of Meeting. I think Ruth comes\nhonestly by certain tendencies which thee has hidden under the Friend's\ndress.\u201d\n\nMargaret could not say no to this, and while she paused, it was evident\nthat memory was busy with suggestions to shake her present opinions.\n\n\u201cWhy not let Ruth try the study for a time,\u201d suggested Eli; \u201cthere is\na fair beginning of a Woman's Medical College in the city. Quite likely\nshe will soon find that she needs first a more general culture, and fall\nin with thy wish that she should see more of the world at some large\nschool.\u201d\n\nThere really seemed to be nothing else to be done, and Margaret\nconsented at length without approving. And it was agreed that Ruth, in\norder to spare her fatigue, should take lodgings with friends near the\ncollege and make a trial in the pursuit of that science to which we all\nowe our lives, and sometimes as by a miracle of escape.\n\nThat day Mr. Bolton brought home a stranger to dinner, Mr. Bigler of the\ngreat firm of Pennybacker, Bigler & Small, railroad contractors. He was\nalways bringing home somebody, who had a scheme; to build a road, or\nopen a mine, or plant a swamp with cane to grow paper-stock, or found a\nhospital, or invest in a patent shad-bone separator, or start a college\nsomewhere on the frontier, contiguous to a land speculation.\n\nThe Bolton house was a sort of hotel for this kind of people. They were\nalways coming. Ruth had known them from childhood, and she used to say\nthat her father attracted them as naturally as a sugar hogshead does\nflies. Ruth had an idea that a large portion of the world lived by\ngetting the rest of the world into schemes. Mr. Bolton never could\nsay \u201cno\u201d to any of them, not even, said Ruth again, to the society for\nstamping oyster shells with scripture texts before they were sold at\nretail.\n\nMr. Bigler's plan this time, about which he talked loudly, with his\nmouth full, all dinner time, was the building of the Tunkhannock,\nRattlesnake and Youngwomans Town Railroad, which would not only be\na great highway to the west, but would open to market inexhaustible\ncoal-fields and untold millions of lumber. The plan of operations was\nvery simple.\n\n\u201cWe'll buy the lands,\u201d explained he, \u201con long time, backed by the notes\nof good men; and then mortgage them for money enough to get the road\nwell on. Then get the towns on the line to issue their bonds for stock,\nand sell their bonds for enough to complete the road, and partly stock\nit, especially if we mortgage each section as we complete it. We can\nthen sell the rest of the stock on the prospect of the business of\nthe road through an improved country, and also sell the lands at a big\nadvance, on the strength of the road. All we want,\u201d continued Mr. Bigler\nin his frank manner, \u201cis a few thousand dollars to start the surveys,\nand arrange things in the legislature. There is some parties will have\nto be seen, who might make us trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will take a good deal of money to start the enterprise,\u201d remarked\nMr. Bolton, who knew very well what \u201cseeing\u201d a Pennsylvania Legislature\nmeant, but was too polite to tell Mr. Bigler what he thought of him,\nwhile he was his guest; \u201cwhat security would one have for it?\u201d\n\nMr. Bigler smiled a hard kind of smile, and said, \u201cYou'd be inside, Mr.\nBolton, and you'd have the first chance in the deal.\u201d\n\nThis was rather unintelligible to Ruth, who was nevertheless somewhat\namused by the study of a type of character she had seen before. At\nlength she interrupted the conversation by asking,\n\n\u201cYou'd sell the stock, I suppose, Mr. Bigler, to anybody who was\nattracted by the prospectus?\u201d\n\n\u201cO, certainly, serve all alike,\u201d said Mr. Bigler, now noticing Ruth for\nthe first time, and a little puzzled by the serene, intelligent face\nthat was turned towards him.\n\n\u201cWell, what would become of the poor people who had been led to put\ntheir little money into the speculation, when you got out of it and left\nit half way?\u201d\n\nIt would be no more true to say of Mr. Bigler that he was or could be\nembarrassed, than to say that a brass counterfeit dollar-piece would\nchange color when refused; the question annoyed him a little, in Mr.\nBolton's presence.\n\n\u201cWhy, yes, Miss, of course, in a great enterprise for the benefit of the\ncommunity there will little things occur, which, which--and, of course,\nthe poor ought to be looked to; I tell my wife, that the poor must be\nlooked to; if you can tell who are poor--there's so many impostors. And\nthen, there's so many poor in the legislature to be looked after,\u201d said\nthe contractor with a sort of a chuckle, \u201cisn't that so, Mr. Bolton?\u201d\n\nEli Bolton replied that he never had much to do with the legislature.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d continued this public benefactor, \u201can uncommon poor lot this\nyear, uncommon. Consequently an expensive lot. The fact is, Mr. Bolton,\nthat the price is raised so high on United States Senator now, that it\naffects the whole market; you can't get any public improvement through\non reasonable terms. Simony is what I call it, Simony,\u201d repeated Mr.\nBigler, as if he had said a good thing.\n\nMr. Bigler went on and gave some very interesting details of the\nintimate connection between railroads and politics, and thoroughly\nentertained himself all dinner time, and as much disgusted Ruth, who\nasked no more questions, and her father who replied in monosyllables:\n\n\u201cI wish,\u201d said Ruth to her father, after the guest had gone, \u201cthat you\nwouldn't bring home any more such horrid men. Do all men who wear\nbig diamond breast-pins, flourish their knives at table, and use bad\ngrammar, and cheat?\u201d\n\n\u201cO, child, thee mustn't be too observing. Mr. Bigler is one of the most\nimportant men in the state; nobody has more influence at Harrisburg. I\ndon't like him any more than thee does, but I'd better lend him a little\nmoney than to have his ill will.\u201d\n\n\u201cFather, I think thee'd better have his ill-will than his company. Is\nit true that he gave money to help build the pretty little church of St.\nJames the Less, and that he is, one of the vestrymen?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. He is not such a bad fellow. One of the men in Third street asked\nhim the other day, whether his was a high church or a low church?\nBigler said he didn't know; he'd been in it once, and he could touch the\nceiling in the side aisle with his hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he's just horrid,\u201d was Ruth's final summary of him, after the\nmanner of the swift judgment of women, with no consideration of the\nextenuating circumstances. Mr. Bigler had no idea that he had not made\na good impression on the whole family; he certainly intended to be\nagreeable. Margaret agreed with her daughter, and though she never said\nanything to such people, she was grateful to Ruth for sticking at least\none pin into him.\n\nSuch was the serenity of the Bolton household that a stranger in it\nwould never have suspected there was any opposition to Ruth's going to\nthe Medical School. And she went quietly to take her residence in town,\nand began her attendance of the lectures, as if it were the most\nnatural thing in the world. She did not heed, if she heard, the busy and\nwondering gossip of relations and acquaintances, gossip that has no less\ncurrency among the Friends than elsewhere because it is whispered slyly\nand creeps about in an undertone.\n\nRuth was absorbed, and for the first time in her life thoroughly happy;\nhappy in the freedom of her life, and in the keen enjoyment of the\ninvestigation that broadened its field day by day. She was in high\nspirits when she came home to spend First Days; the house was full of\nher gaiety and her merry laugh, and the children wished that Ruth would\nnever go away again. But her mother noticed, with a little anxiety, the\nsometimes flushed face, and the sign of an eager spirit in the kindling\neyes, and, as well, the serious air of determination and endurance in\nher face at unguarded moments.\n\nThe college was a small one and it sustained itself not without\ndifficulty in this city, which is so conservative, and is yet the\norigin of so many radical movements. There were not more than a dozen\nattendants on the lectures all together, so that the enterprise had\nthe air of an experiment, and the fascination of pioneering for those\nengaged in it. There was one woman physician driving about town in\nher carriage, attacking the most violent diseases in all quarters with\npersistent courage, like a modern Bellona in her war chariot, who\nwas popularly supposed to gather in fees to the amount ten to twenty\nthousand dollars a year. Perhaps some of these students looked forward\nto the near day when they would support such a practice and a husband\nbesides, but it is unknown that any of them ever went further than\npractice in hospitals and in their own nurseries, and it is feared that\nsome of them were quite as ready as their sisters, in emergencies, to\n\u201ccall a man.\u201d\n\nIf Ruth had any exaggerated expectations of a professional life, she\nkept them to herself, and was known to her fellows of the class simply\nas a cheerful, sincere student, eager in her investigations, and never\nimpatient at anything, except an insinuation that women had not as much\nmental capacity for science as men.\n\n\u201cThey really say,\u201d said one young Quaker sprig to another youth of\nhis age, \u201cthat Ruth Bolton is really going to be a saw-bones, attends\nlectures, cuts up bodies, and all that. She's cool enough for a surgeon,\nanyway.\u201d He spoke feelingly, for he had very likely been weighed in\nRuth's calm eyes sometime, and thoroughly scared by the little laugh\nthat accompanied a puzzling reply to one of his conversational nothings.\nSuch young gentlemen, at this time, did not come very distinctly into\nRuth's horizon, except as amusing circumstances.\n\nAbout the details of her student life, Ruth said very little to her\nfriends, but they had reason to know, afterwards, that it required all\nher nerve and the almost complete exhaustion of her physical strength,\nto carry her through. She began her anatomical practice upon detached\nportions of the human frame, which were brought into the demonstrating\nroom--dissecting the eye, the ear, and a small tangle of muscles and\nnerves--an occupation which had not much more savor of death in it than\nthe analysis of a portion of a plant out of which the life went when it\nwas plucked up by the roots. Custom inures the most sensitive persons\nto that which is at first most repellant; and in the late war we saw the\nmost delicate women, who could not at home endure the sight of blood,\nbecome so used to scenes of carnage, that they walked the hospitals and\nthe margins of battle-fields, amid the poor remnants of torn humanity,\nwith as perfect self-possession as if they were strolling in a flower\ngarden.\n\nIt happened that Ruth was one evening deep in a line of investigation\nwhich she could not finish or understand without demonstration, and so\neager was she in it, that it seemed as if she could not wait till the\nnext day. She, therefore, persuaded a fellow student, who was reading\nthat evening with her, to go down to the dissecting room of the college,\nand ascertain what they wanted to know by an hour's work there. Perhaps,\nalso, Ruth wanted to test her own nerve, and to see whether the power of\nassociation was stronger in her mind than her own will.\n\nThe janitor of the shabby and comfortless old building admitted the\ngirls, not without suspicion, and gave them lighted candles, which they\nwould need, without other remark than \u201cthere's a new one, Miss,\u201d as the\ngirls went up the broad stairs.\n\nThey climbed to the third story, and paused before a door, which they\nunlocked, and which admitted them into a long apartment, with a row of\nwindows on one side and one at the end. The room was without light, save\nfrom the stars and the candles the girls carried, which revealed to them\ndimly two long and several small tables, a few benches and chairs, a\ncouple of skeletons hanging on the wall, a sink, and cloth-covered heaps\nof something upon the tables here and there.\n\nThe windows were open, and the cool night wind came in strong enough to\nflutter a white covering now and then, and to shake the loose casements.\nBut all the sweet odors of the night could not take from the room a\nfaint suggestion of mortality.\n\nThe young ladies paused a moment. The room itself was familiar enough,\nbut night makes almost any chamber eerie, and especially such a room of\ndetention as this where the mortal parts of the unburied might--almost\nbe supposed to be, visited, on the sighing night winds, by the wandering\nspirits of their late tenants.\n\nOpposite and at some distance across the roofs of lower buildings, the\ngirls saw a tall edifice, the long upper story of which seemed to be a\ndancing hall. The windows of that were also open, and through them they\nheard the scream of the jiggered and tortured violin, and the pump,\npump of the oboe, and saw the moving shapes of men and women in quick\ntransition, and heard the prompter's drawl.\n\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d said Ruth, \u201cwhat the girls dancing there would think if they\nsaw us, or knew that there was such a room as this so near them.\u201d\n\nShe did not speak very loud, and, perhaps unconsciously, the girls drew\nnear to each other as they approached the long table in the centre of\nthe room. A straight object lay upon it, covered with a sheet. This was\ndoubtless \u201cthe new one\u201d of which the janitor spoke. Ruth advanced, and\nwith a not very steady hand lifted the white covering from the upper\npart of the figure and turned it down. Both the girls started. It was a\nnegro. The black face seemed to defy the pallor of death, and asserted\nan ugly life-likeness that was frightful.\n\nRuth was as pale as the white sheet, and her comrade whispered, \u201cCome\naway, Ruth, it is awful.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it was the wavering light of the candles, perhaps it was only\nthe agony from a death of pain, but the repulsive black face seemed\nto wear a scowl that said, \u201cHaven't you yet done with the outcast,\npersecuted black man, but you must now haul him from his grave, and send\neven your women to dismember his body?\u201d\n\nWho is this dead man, one of thousands who died yesterday, and will be\ndust anon, to protest that science shall not turn his worthless carcass\nto some account?\n\nRuth could have had no such thought, for with a pity in her sweet face,\nthat for the moment overcame fear and disgust, she reverently replaced\nthe covering, and went away to her own table, as her companion did\nto hers. And there for an hour they worked at their several problems,\nwithout speaking, but not without an awe of the presence there, \u201cthe new\none,\u201d and not without an awful sense of life itself, as they heard the\npulsations of the music and the light laughter from the dancing-hall.\n\nWhen, at length, they went away, and locked the dreadful room behind\nthem, and came out into the street, where people were passing, they, for\nthe first time, realized, in the relief they felt, what a nervous strain\nthey had been under.\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nWhile Ruth was thus absorbed in her new occupation, and the spring was\nwearing away, Philip and his friends were still detained at the Southern\nHotel. The great contractors had concluded their business with the state\nand railroad officials and with the lesser contractors, and departed for\nthe East. But the serious illness of one of the engineers kept Philip\nand Henry in the city and occupied in alternate watchings.\n\nPhilip wrote to Ruth of the new acquaintance they had made, Col.\nSellers, an enthusiastic and hospitable gentleman, very much interested\nin the development of the country, and in their success. They had not\nhad an opportunity to visit at his place \u201cup in the country\u201d yet, but\nthe Colonel often dined with them, and in confidence, confided to them\nhis projects, and seemed to take a great liking to them, especially to\nhis friend Harry. It was true that he never seemed to have ready money,\nbut he was engaged in very large operations.\n\nThe correspondence was not very brisk between these two young persons,\nso differently occupied; for though Philip wrote long letters, he got\nbrief ones in reply, full of sharp little observations however, such as\none concerning Col. Sellers, namely, that such men dined at their house\nevery week.\n\nRuth's proposed occupation astonished Philip immensely, but while he\nargued it and discussed it, he did not dare hint to her his fear that\nit would interfere with his most cherished plans. He too sincerely\nrespected Ruth's judgment to make any protest, however, and he would\nhave defended her course against the world.\n\nThis enforced waiting at St. Louis was very irksome to Philip. His money\nwas running away, for one thing, and he longed to get into the field,\nand see for himself what chance there was for a fortune or even an\noccupation. The contractors had given the young men leave to join\nthe engineer corps as soon as they could, but otherwise had made\nno provision for them, and in fact had left them with only the most\nindefinite expectations of something large in the future.\n\nHarry was entirely happy; in his circumstances. He very soon knew\neverybody, from the governor of the state down to the waiters at the\nhotel. He had the Wall street slang at his tongue's end; he always\ntalked like a capitalist, and entered with enthusiasm into all the land\nand railway schemes with which the air was thick.\n\nCol. Sellers and Harry talked together by the hour and by the day. Harry\ninformed his new friend that he was going out with the engineer corps of\nthe Salt Lick Pacific Extension, but that wasn't his real business.\n\n\u201cI'm to have, with another party,\u201d said Harry, \u201ca big contract in the\nroad, as soon as it is let; and, meantime, I'm with the engineers to spy\nout the best land and the depot sites.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's everything,\u201d suggested the Colonel, \u201cin knowing where to\ninvest. I've known people throwaway their money because they were too\nconsequential to take Sellers' advice. Others, again, have made their\npile on taking it. I've looked over the ground; I've been studying it\nfor twenty years. You can't put your finger on a spot in the map of\nMissouri that I don't know as if I'd made it. When you want to place\nanything,\u201d continued the Colonel, confidently, \u201cjust let Beriah Sellers\nknow. That's all.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I haven't got much in ready money I can lay my hands on now, but if\na fellow could do anything with fifteen or twenty thousand dollars, as a\nbeginning, I shall draw for that when I see the right opening.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that's something, that's something, fifteen or twenty thousand\ndollars, say twenty--as an advance,\u201d said the Colonel reflectively, as\nif turning over his mind for a project that could be entered on with\nsuch a trifling sum.\n\n\u201cI'll tell you what it is--but only to you Mr. Brierly, only to you,\nmind; I've got a little project that I've been keeping. It looks small,\nlooks small on paper, but it's got a big future. What should you say,\nsir, to a city, built up like the rod of Aladdin had touched it, built\nup in two years, where now you wouldn't expect it any more than you'd\nexpect a light-house on the top of Pilot Knob? and you could own the\nland! It can be done, sir. It can be done!\u201d\n\nThe Colonel hitched up his chair close to Harry, laid his hand on his\nknee, and, first looking about him, said in a low voice, \u201cThe Salt Lick\nPacific Extension is going to run through Stone's Landing! The Almighty\nnever laid out a cleaner piece of level prairie for a city; and it's the\nnatural center of all that region of hemp and tobacco.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat makes you think the road will go there? It's twenty miles, on the\nmap, off the straight line of the road?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can't tell what is the straight line till the engineers have been\nover it. Between us, I have talked with Jeff Thompson, the division\nengineer. He understands the wants of Stone's Landing, and the claims\nof the inhabitants--who are to be there. Jeff says that a railroad is\nfor--the accommodation of the people and not for the benefit of gophers;\nand if, he don't run this to Stone's Landing he'll be damned! You\nought to know Jeff; he's one of the most enthusiastic engineers in this\nwestern country, and one of the best fellows that ever looked through\nthe bottom of a glass.\u201d\n\nThe recommendation was not undeserved. There was nothing that Jeff\nwouldn't do, to accommodate a friend, from sharing his last dollar with\nhim, to winging him in a duel. When he understood from Col. Sellers.\nhow the land lay at Stone's Landing, he cordially shook hands with that\ngentleman, asked him to drink, and fairly roared out, \u201cWhy, God bless\nmy soul, Colonel, a word from one Virginia gentleman to another is 'nuff\nced.' There's Stone's Landing been waiting for a railroad more than four\nthousand years, and damme if she shan't have it.\u201d\n\nPhilip had not so much faith as Harry in Stone's Landing, when the\nlatter opened the project to him, but Harry talked about it as if he\nalready owned that incipient city.\n\nHarry thoroughly believed in all his projects and inventions, and lived\nday by day in their golden atmosphere. Everybody liked the young fellow,\nfor how could they help liking one of such engaging manners and large\nfortune? The waiters at the hotel would do more for him than for any\nother guest, and he made a great many acquaintances among the people\nof St. Louis, who liked his sensible and liberal views about the\ndevelopment of the western country, and about St. Louis. He said it\nought to be the national capital. Harry made partial arrangements with\nseveral of the merchants for furnishing supplies for his contract on the\nSalt Lick Pacific Extension; consulted the maps with the engineers, and\nwent over the profiles with the contractors, figuring out estimates for\nbids. He was exceedingly busy with those things when he was not at\nthe bedside of his sick acquaintance, or arranging the details of his\nspeculation with Col. Sellers.\n\nMeantime the days went along and the weeks, and the money in Harry's\npocket got lower and lower. He was just as liberal with what he had as\nbefore, indeed it was his nature to be free with his money or with that\nof others, and he could lend or spend a dollar with an air that made it\nseem like ten. At length, at the end of one week, when his hotel bill\nwas presented, Harry found not a cent in his pocket to meet it. He\ncarelessly remarked to the landlord that he was not that day in\nfunds, but he would draw on New York, and he sat down and wrote to the\ncontractors in that city a glowing letter about the prospects of the\nroad, and asked them to advance a hundred or two, until he got at work.\nNo reply came. He wrote again, in an unoffended business like tone,\nsuggesting that he had better draw at three days. A short answer came to\nthis, simply saying that money was very tight in Wall street just then,\nand that he had better join the engineer corps as soon as he could.\n\nBut the bill had to be paid, and Harry took it to Philip, and asked him\nif he thought he hadn't better draw on his uncle. Philip had not much\nfaith in Harry's power of \u201cdrawing,\u201d and told him that he would pay the\nbill himself. Whereupon Harry dismissed the matter then and thereafter\nfrom his thoughts, and, like a light-hearted good fellow as he was, gave\nhimself no more trouble about his board-bills. Philip paid them, swollen\nas they were with a monstrous list of extras; but he seriously counted\nthe diminishing bulk of his own hoard, which was all the money he had in\nthe world. Had he not tacitly agreed to share with Harry to the last in\nthis adventure, and would not the generous fellow divide with him if he,\nPhilip, were in want and Harry had anything?\n\nThe fever at length got tired of tormenting the stout young engineer,\nwho lay sick at the hotel, and left him, very thin, a little sallow but\nan \u201cacclimated\u201d man. Everybody said he was \u201cacclimated\u201d now, and said it\ncheerfully. What it is to be acclimated to western fevers no two persons\nexactly agree.\n\nSome say it is a sort of vaccination that renders death by some\nmalignant type of fever less probable. Some regard it as a sort of\ninitiation, like that into the Odd Fellows, which renders one liable to\nhis regular dues thereafter. Others consider it merely the acquisition\nof a habit of taking every morning before breakfast a dose of bitters,\ncomposed of whiskey and assafoetida, out of the acclimation jug.\n\nJeff Thompson afterwards told Philip that he once asked Senator\nAtchison, then acting Vice-President of the United States, about the\npossibility of acclimation; he thought the opinion of the second officer\nof our great government would be valuable on this point. They were\nsitting together on a bench before a country tavern, in the free\nconverse permitted by our democratic habits.\n\n\u201cI suppose, Senator, that you have become acclimated to this country?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the Vice-President, crossing his legs, pulling his\nwide-awake down over his forehead, causing a passing chicken to\nhop quickly one side by the accuracy of his aim, and speaking with\nsenatorial deliberation, \u201cI think I have. I've been here twenty-five\nyears, and dash, dash my dash to dash, if I haven't entertained\ntwenty-five separate and distinct earthquakes, one a year. The niggro is\nthe only person who can stand the fever and ague of this region.\u201d\n\nThe convalescence of the engineer was the signal for breaking up\nquarters at St. Louis, and the young fortune-hunters started up the\nriver in good spirits. It was only the second time either of them had\nbeen upon a Mississippi steamboat, and nearly everything they saw\nhad the charm of novelty. Col. Sellers was at the landing to bid them\ngood-bye.\n\n\u201cI shall send you up that basket of champagne by the next boat; no, no;\nno thanks; you'll find it not bad in camp,\u201d he cried out as the plank\nwas hauled in. \u201cMy respects to Thompson. Tell him to sight for Stone's.\nLet me know, Mr. Brierly, when you are ready to locate; I'll come over\nfrom Hawkeye. Goodbye.\u201d\n\nAnd the last the young fellows saw of the Colonel, he was waving his\nhat, and beaming prosperity and good luck.\n\nThe voyage was delightful, and was not long enough to become monotonous.\nThe travelers scarcely had time indeed to get accustomed to the\nsplendors of the great saloon where the tables were spread for meals,\na marvel of paint and gilding, its ceiling hung with fancifully cut\ntissue-paper of many colors, festooned and arranged in endless patterns.\nThe whole was more beautiful than a barber's shop. The printed bill\nof fare at dinner was longer and more varied, the proprietors justly\nboasted, than that of any hotel in New York. It must have been the work\nof an author of talent and imagination, and it surely was not his fault\nif the dinner itself was to a certain extent a delusion, and if the\nguests got something that tasted pretty much the same whatever dish they\nordered; nor was it his fault if a general flavor of rose in all the\ndessert dishes suggested that they had passed through the barber's\nsaloon on their way from the kitchen.\n\nThe travelers landed at a little settlement on the left bank, and at\nonce took horses for the camp in the interior, carrying their clothes\nand blankets strapped behind the saddles. Harry was dressed as we have\nseen him once before, and his long and shining boots attracted not\na little the attention of the few persons they met on the road, and\nespecially of the bright faced wenches who lightly stepped along the\nhighway, picturesque in their colored kerchiefs, carrying light baskets,\nor riding upon mules and balancing before them a heavier load.\n\nHarry sang fragments of operas and talked about their fortune. Philip\neven was excited by the sense of freedom and adventure, and the beauty\nof the landscape. The prairie, with its new grass and unending acres of\nbrilliant flowers--chiefly the innumerable varieties of phlox--bore the\nlook of years of cultivation, and the occasional open groves of white\noaks gave it a park-like appearance. It was hardly unreasonable to\nexpect to see at any moment, the gables and square windows of an\nElizabethan mansion in one of the well kept groves.\n\nTowards sunset of the third day, when the young gentlemen thought they\nought to be near the town of Magnolia, near which they had been directed\nto find the engineers' camp, they descried a log house and drew up\nbefore it to enquire the way. Half the building was store, and half was\ndwelling house. At the door of the latter stood a negress with a bright\nturban on her head, to whom Philip called,\n\n\u201cCan you tell me, auntie, how far it is to the town of Magnolia?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, bress you chile,\u201d laughed the woman, \u201cyou's dere now.\u201d\n\nIt was true. This log house was the compactly built town, and all\ncreation was its suburbs. The engineers' camp was only two or three\nmiles distant.\n\n\u201cYou's boun' to find it,\u201d directed auntie, \u201cif you don't keah nuffin\n'bout de road, and go fo' de sun-down.\u201d\n\nA brisk gallop brought the riders in sight of the twinkling light of\nthe camp, just as the stars came out. It lay in a little hollow, where\na small stream ran through a sparse grove of young white oaks. A half\ndozen tents were pitched under the trees, horses and oxen were corraled\nat a little distance, and a group of men sat on camp stools or lay on\nblankets about a bright fire. The twang of a banjo became audible\nas they drew nearer, and they saw a couple of negroes, from some\nneighboring plantation, \u201cbreaking down\u201d a juba in approved style, amid\nthe \u201chi, hi's\u201d of the spectators.\n\nMr. Jeff Thompson, for it was the camp of this redoubtable engineer,\ngave the travelers a hearty welcome, offered them ground room in his\nown tent, ordered supper, and set out a small jug, a drop from which he\ndeclared necessary on account of the chill of the evening.\n\n\u201cI never saw an Eastern man,\u201d said Jeff, \u201cwho knew how to drink from\na jug with one hand. It's as easy as lying. So.\u201d He grasped the handle\nwith the right hand, threw the jug back upon his arm, and applied\nhis lips to the nozzle. It was an act as graceful as it was simple.\n\u201cBesides,\u201d said Mr. Thompson, setting it down, \u201cit puts every man on his\nhonor as to quantity.\u201d\n\nEarly to turn in was the rule of the camp, and by nine o'clock everybody\nwas under his blanket, except Jeff himself, who worked awhile at his\ntable over his field-book, and then arose, stepped outside the tent\ndoor and sang, in a strong and not unmelodious tenor, the Star Spangled\nBanner from beginning to end. It proved to be his nightly practice to\nlet off the unexpended steam of his conversational powers, in the words\nof this stirring song.\n\nIt was a long time before Philip got to sleep. He saw the fire light,\nhe saw the clear stars through the tree-tops, he heard the gurgle of the\nstream, the stamp of the horses, the occasional barking of the dog which\nfollowed the cook's wagon, the hooting of an owl; and when these failed\nhe saw Jeff, standing on a battlement, mid the rocket's red glare, and\nheard him sing, \u201cOh, say, can you see?\u201d It was the first time he had\never slept on the ground.\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n     ----\u201cWe have view'd it,\n     And measur'd it within all, by the scale\n     The richest tract of land, love, in the kingdom!\n     There will be made seventeen or eighteeen millions,\n     Or more, as't may be handled!\u201d\n\nThe Devil is an Ass.\n\nNobody dressed more like an engineer than Mr. Henry Brierly. The\ncompleteness of his appointments was the envy of the corps, and the\ngay fellow himself was the admiration of the camp servants, axemen,\nteamsters and cooks.\n\n\u201cI reckon you didn't git them boots no wher's this side o' Sent Louis?\u201d\n queried the tall Missouri youth who acted as commissary's assistant.\n\n\u201cNo, New York.\u201d\n\n\u201cYas, I've heern o' New York,\u201d continued the butternut lad, attentively\nstudying each item of Harry's dress, and endeavoring to cover his design\nwith interesting conversation. \u201c'N there's Massachusetts.\u201d,\n\n\u201cIt's not far off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've heern Massachusetts was a-----of a place. Les, see, what state's\nMassachusetts in?\u201d\n\n\u201cMassachusetts,\u201d kindly replied Harry, \u201cis in the state of Boston.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbolish'n wan't it? They must a cost right smart,\u201d referring to the\nboots.\n\nHarry shouldered his rod and went to the field, tramped over the prairie\nby day, and figured up results at night, with the utmost cheerfulness\nand industry, and plotted the line on the profile paper, without,\nhowever, the least idea of engineering practical or theoretical. Perhaps\nthere was not a great deal of scientific knowledge in the entire corps,\nnor was very much needed. They were making, what is called a preliminary\nsurvey, and the chief object of a preliminary survey was to get up an\nexcitement about the road, to interest every town in that part of the\nstate in it, under the belief that the road would run through it, and to\nget the aid of every planter upon the prospect that a station would be\non his land.\n\nMr. Jeff Thompson was the most popular engineer who could be found\nfor this work. He did not bother himself much about details or\npracticabilities of location, but ran merrily along, sighting from the\ntop of one divide to the top of another, and striking \u201cplumb\u201d every town\nsite and big plantation within twenty or thirty miles of his route. In\nhis own language he \u201cjust went booming.\u201d\n\nThis course gave Harry an opportunity, as he said, to learn the\npractical details of engineering, and it gave Philip a chance to see the\ncountry, and to judge for himself what prospect of a fortune it offered.\nBoth he and Harry got the \u201crefusal\u201d of more than one plantation as they\nwent along, and wrote urgent letters to their eastern correspondents,\nupon the beauty of the land and the certainty that it would quadruple in\nvalue as soon as the road was finally located. It seemed strange to them\nthat capitalists did not flock out there and secure this land.\n\nThey had not been in the field over two weeks when Harry wrote to his\nfriend Col. Sellers that he'd better be on the move, for the line was\ncertain to go to Stone's Landing. Any one who looked at the line on\nthe map, as it was laid down from day to day, would have been uncertain\nwhich way it was going; but Jeff had declared that in his judgment the\nonly practicable route from the point they then stood on was to follow\nthe divide to Stone's Landing, and it was generally understood that that\ntown would be the next one hit.\n\n\u201cWe'll make it, boys,\u201d said the chief, \u201cif we have to go in a balloon.\u201d\n\nAnd make it they did. In less than a week, this indomitable engineer had\ncarried his moving caravan over slues and branches, across bottoms and\nalong divides, and pitched his tents in the very heart of the city of\nStone's Landing.\n\n\u201cWell, I'll be dashed,\u201d was heard the cheery voice of Mr. Thompson, as\nhe stepped outside the tent door at sunrise next morning. \u201cIf this don't\nget me. I say, yon Grayson, get out your sighting iron and see if you\ncan find old Sellers' town. Blame me if we wouldn't have run plumb by it\nif twilight had held on a little longer. Oh! Sterling, Brierly, get up\nand see the city. There's a steamboat just coming round the bend.\u201d And\nJeff roared with laughter. \u201cThe mayor'll be round here to breakfast.\u201d\n\nThe fellows turned out of the tents, rubbing their eyes, and stared\nabout them. They were camped on the second bench of the narrow bottom of\na crooked, sluggish stream, that was some five rods wide in the present\ngood stage of water. Before them were a dozen log cabins, with stick\nand mud chimneys, irregularly disposed on either side of a not very\nwell defined road, which did not seem to know its own mind exactly, and,\nafter straggling through the town, wandered off over the rolling prairie\nin an uncertain way, as if it had started for nowhere and was quite\nlikely to reach its destination. Just as it left the town, however, it\nwas cheered and assisted by a guide-board, upon which was the legend \u201c10\nMils to Hawkeye.\u201d\n\nThe road had never been made except by the travel over it, and at this\nseason--the rainy June--it was a way of ruts cut in the black soil, and\nof fathomless mud-holes. In the principal street of the city, it had\nreceived more attention; for hogs, great and small, rooted about in\nit and wallowed in it, turning the street into a liquid quagmire which\ncould only be crossed on pieces of plank thrown here and there.\n\nAbout the chief cabin, which was the store and grocery of this mart of\ntrade, the mud was more liquid than elsewhere, and the rude platform\nin front of it and the dry-goods boxes mounted thereon were places\nof refuge for all the loafers of the place. Down by the stream was a\ndilapidated building which served for a hemp warehouse, and a shaky\nwharf extended out from it, into the water. In fact a flat-boat was\nthere moored by it, it's setting poles lying across the gunwales. Above\nthe town the stream was crossed by a crazy wooden bridge, the supports\nof which leaned all ways in the soggy soil; the absence of a plank here\nand there in the flooring made the crossing of the bridge faster than a\nwalk an offense not necessary to be prohibited by law.\n\n\u201cThis, gentlemen,\u201d said Jeff, \u201cis Columbus River, alias Goose Run. If it\nwas widened, and deepened, and straightened, and made, long enough, it\nwould be one of the finest rivers in the western country.\u201d\n\nAs the sun rose and sent his level beams along the stream, the thin\nstratum of mist, or malaria, rose also and dispersed, but the light was\nnot able to enliven the dull water nor give any hint of its apparently\nfathomless depth. Venerable mud-turtles crawled up and roosted upon the\nold logs in the stream, their backs glistening in the sun, the first\ninhabitants of the metropolis to begin the active business of the day.\n\nIt was not long, however, before smoke began to issue from the city\nchimneys; and before the engineers had finished their breakfast they\nwere the object of the curious inspection of six or eight boys and men,\nwho lounged into the camp and gazed about them with languid interest,\ntheir hands in their pockets every one.\n\n\u201cGood morning; gentlemen,\u201d called out the chief engineer, from the\ntable.\n\n\u201cGood mawning,\u201d drawled out the spokesman of the party. \u201cI allow\nthish-yers the railroad, I heern it was a-comin'.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, this is the railroad; all but the rails and the ironhorse.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon you kin git all the rails you want oaten my white oak timber\nover, thar,\u201d replied the first speaker, who appeared to be a man of\nproperty and willing to strike up a trade.\n\n\u201cYou'll have to negotiate with the contractors about the rails, sir,\u201d\n said Jeff; \u201chere's Mr. Brierly, I've no doubt would like to buy your\nrails when the time comes.\u201d\n\n\u201cO,\u201d said the man, \u201cI thought maybe you'd fetch the whole bilin along\nwith you. But if you want rails, I've got em, haint I Eph.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeaps,\u201d said Eph, without taking his eyes off the group at the table.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Thompson, rising from his seat and moving towards his\ntent, \u201cthe railroad has come to Stone's Landing, sure; I move we take a\ndrink on it all round.\u201d\n\nThe proposal met with universal favor. Jeff gave prosperity to Stone's\nLanding and navigation to Goose Run, and the toast was washed down with\ngusto, in the simple fluid of corn; and with the return compliment that\na rail road was a good thing, and that Jeff Thompson was no slouch.\n\nAbout ten o'clock a horse and wagon was descried making a slow approach\nto the camp over the prairie. As it drew near, the wagon was seen to\ncontain a portly gentleman, who hitched impatiently forward on his seat,\nshook the reins and gently touched up his horse, in the vain attempt to\ncommunicate his own energy to that dull beast, and looked eagerly at the\ntents. When the conveyance at length drew up to Mr. Thompson's door, the\ngentleman descended with great deliberation, straightened himself\nup, rubbed his hands, and beaming satisfaction from every part of his\nradiant frame, advanced to the group that was gathered to welcome him,\nand which had saluted him by name as soon as he came within hearing.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Napoleon, gentlemen, welcome. I am proud to see you here Mr.\nThompson. You are, looking well Mr. Sterling. This is the country, sir.\nRight glad to see you Mr. Brierly. You got that basket of champagne? No?\nThose blasted river thieves! I'll never send anything more by 'em. The\nbest brand, Roederer. The last I had in my cellar, from a lot sent me\nby Sir George Gore--took him out on a buffalo hunt, when he visited our\ncountry. Is always sending me some trifle. You haven't looked about any\nyet, gentlemen? It's in the rough yet, in the rough. Those buildings\nwill all have to come down. That's the place for the public square,\nCourt House, hotels, churches, jail--all that sort of thing. About where\nwe stand, the deepo. How does that strike your engineering eye, Mr.\nThompson? Down yonder the business streets, running to the wharves. The\nUniversity up there, on rising ground, sightly place, see the river for\nmiles. That's Columbus river, only forty-nine miles to the Missouri. You\nsee what it is, placid, steady, no current to interfere with navigation,\nwants widening in places and dredging, dredge out the harbor and raise\na levee in front of the town; made by nature on purpose for a mart. Look\nat all this country, not another building within ten miles, no other\nnavigable stream, lay of the land points right here; hemp, tobacco,\ncorn, must come here. The railroad will do it, Napoleon won't know\nitself in a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon't now evidently,\u201d said Philip aside to Harry. \u201cHave you breakfasted\nColonel?\u201d\n\n\u201cHastily. Cup of coffee. Can't trust any coffee I don't import\nmyself. But I put up a basket of provisions,--wife would put in a few\ndelicacies, women always will, and a half dozen of that Burgundy, I was\ntelling you of Mr. Briefly. By the way, you never got to dine with me.\u201d\n And the Colonel strode away to the wagon and looked under the seat for\nthe basket.\n\nApparently it was not there. For the Colonel raised up the flap, looked\nin front and behind, and then exclaimed,\n\n\u201cConfound it. That comes of not doing a thing yourself. I trusted to the\nwomen folks to set that basket in the wagon, and it ain't there.\u201d\n\nThe camp cook speedily prepared a savory breakfast for the Colonel,\nbroiled chicken, eggs, corn-bread, and coffee, to which he did ample\njustice, and topped off with a drop of Old Bourbon, from Mr. Thompson's\nprivate store, a brand which he said he knew well, he should think it\ncame from his own sideboard.\n\nWhile the engineer corps went to the field, to run back a couple of\nmiles and ascertain, approximately, if a road could ever get down to the\nLanding, and to sight ahead across the Run, and see if it could ever get\nout again, Col. Sellers and Harry sat down and began to roughly map out\nthe city of Napoleon on a large piece of drawing paper.\n\n\u201cI've got the refusal of a mile square here,\u201d said the Colonel, \u201cin\nour names, for a year, with a quarter interest reserved for the four\nowners.\u201d\n\nThey laid out the town liberally, not lacking room, leaving space\nfor the railroad to come in, and for the river as it was to be when\nimproved.\n\nThe engineers reported that the railroad could come in, by taking a\nlittle sweep and crossing the stream on a high bridge, but the grades\nwould be steep. Col. Sellers said he didn't care so much about the\ngrades, if the road could only be made to reach the elevators on the\nriver. The next day Mr. Thompson made a hasty survey of the stream for a\nmile or two, so that the Colonel and Harry were enabled to show on\ntheir map how nobly that would accommodate the city. Jeff took a little\nwriting from the Colonel and Harry for a prospective share but Philip\ndeclined to join in, saying that he had no money, and didn't want to\nmake engagements he couldn't fulfill.\n\nThe next morning the camp moved on, followed till it was out of sight\nby the listless eyes of the group in front of the store, one of whom\nremarked that, \u201che'd be doggoned if he ever expected to see that\nrailroad any mo'.\u201d\n\nHarry went with the Colonel to Hawkeye to complete their arrangements,\na part of which was the preparation of a petition to congress for the\nimprovement of the navigation of Columbus River.\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nEight years have passed since the death of Mr. Hawkins. Eight years are\nnot many in the life of a nation or the history of a state, but they may\nbe years of destiny that shall fix the current of the century following.\nSuch years were those that followed the little scrimmage on Lexington\nCommon. Such years were those that followed the double-shotted demand\nfor the surrender of Fort Sumter. History is never done with inquiring\nof these years, and summoning witnesses about them, and trying to\nunderstand their significance.\n\nThe eight years in America from 1860 to 1868 uprooted institutions that\nwere centuries old, changed the politics of a people, transformed the\nsocial life of half the country, and wrought so profoundly upon the\nentire national character that the influence cannot be measured short of\ntwo or three generations.\n\nAs we are accustomed to interpret the economy of providence, the life of\nthe individual is as nothing to that of the nation or the race; but who\ncan say, in the broader view and the more intelligent weight of values,\nthat the life of one man is not more than that of a nationality, and\nthat there is not a tribunal where the tragedy of one human soul shall\nnot seem more significant than the overturning of any human institution\nwhatever?\n\nWhen one thinks of the tremendous forces of the upper and the nether\nworld which play for the mastery of the soul of a woman during the few\nyears in which she passes from plastic girlhood to the ripe maturity of\nwomanhood, he may well stand in awe before the momentous drama.\n\nWhat capacities she has of purity, tenderness, goodness; what capacities\nof vileness, bitterness and evil. Nature must needs be lavish with the\nmother and creator of men, and centre in her all the possibilities of\nlife. And a few critical years can decide whether her life is to be\nfull of sweetness and light, whether she is to be the vestal of a holy\ntemple, or whether she will be the fallen priestess of a desecrated\nshrine. There are women, it is true, who seem to be capable neither of\nrising much nor of falling much, and whom a conventional life saves from\nany special development of character.\n\nBut Laura was not one of them. She had the fatal gift of beauty, and\nthat more fatal gift which does not always accompany mere beauty, the\npower of fascination, a power that may, indeed, exist without beauty.\nShe had will, and pride and courage and ambition, and she was left to\nbe very much her own guide at the age when romance comes to the aid of\npassion, and when the awakening powers of her vigorous mind had little\nobject on which to discipline themselves.\n\nThe tremendous conflict that was fought in this girl's soul none of\nthose about her knew, and very few knew that her life had in it anything\nunusual or romantic or strange.\n\nThose were troublous days in Hawkeye as well as in most other Missouri\ntowns, days of confusion, when between Unionist and Confederate\noccupations, sudden maraudings and bush-whackings and raids, individuals\nescaped observation or comment in actions that would have filled the\ntown with scandal in quiet times.\n\nFortunately we only need to deal with Laura's life at this period\nhistorically, and look back upon such portions of it as will serve to\nreveal the woman as she was at the time of the arrival of Mr. Harry\nBrierly in Hawkeye.\n\nThe Hawkins family were settled there, and had a hard enough struggle\nwith poverty and the necessity of keeping up appearances in accord\nwith their own family pride and the large expectations they secretly\ncherished of a fortune in the Knobs of East Tennessee. How pinched they\nwere perhaps no one knew but Clay, to whom they looked for almost their\nwhole support. Washington had been in Hawkeye off and on, attracted away\noccasionally by some tremendous speculation, from which he invariably\nreturned to Gen. Boswell's office as poor as he went. He was the\ninventor of no one knew how many useless contrivances, which were not\nworth patenting, and his years had been passed in dreaming and planning\nto no purpose; until he was now a man of about thirty, without a\nprofession or a permanent occupation, a tall, brown-haired, dreamy\nperson of the best intentions and the frailest resolution. Probably\nhowever the eight years had been happier to him than to any others in\nhis circle, for the time had been mostly spent in a blissful dream of\nthe coming of enormous wealth.\n\nHe went out with a company from Hawkeye to the war, and was not wanting\nin courage, but he would have been a better soldier if he had been less\nengaged in contrivances for circumventing the enemy by strategy unknown\nto the books.\n\nIt happened to him to be captured in one of his self-appointed\nexpeditions, but the federal colonel released him, after a short\nexamination, satisfied that he could most injure the confederate forces\nopposed to the Unionists by returning him to his regiment. Col. Sellers\nwas of course a prominent man during the war. He was captain of the home\nguards in Hawkeye, and he never left home except upon one occasion, when\non the strength of a rumor, he executed a flank movement and fortified\nStone's Landing, a place which no one unacquainted with the country\nwould be likely to find.\n\n\u201cGad,\u201d said the Colonel afterwards, \u201cthe Landing is the key to upper\nMissouri, and it is the only place the enemy never captured. If other\nplaces had been defended as well as that was, the result would have been\ndifferent, sir.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel had his own theories about war as he had in other things. If\neverybody had stayed at home as he did, he said, the South never would\nhave been conquered. For what would there have been to conquer? Mr.\nJeff Davis was constantly writing him to take command of a corps in the\nconfederate army, but Col. Sellers said, no, his duty was at home. And\nhe was by no means idle. He was the inventor of the famous air torpedo,\nwhich came very near destroying the Union armies in Missouri, and the\ncity of St. Louis itself.\n\nHis plan was to fill a torpedo with Greek fire and poisonous and deadly\nmissiles, attach it to a balloon, and then let it sail away over the\nhostile camp and explode at the right moment, when the time-fuse burned\nout. He intended to use this invention in the capture of St. Louis,\nexploding his torpedoes over the city, and raining destruction upon it\nuntil the army of occupation would gladly capitulate. He was unable to\nprocure the Greek fire, but he constructed a vicious torpedo which would\nhave answered the purpose, but the first one prematurely exploded in his\nwood-house, blowing it clean away, and setting fire to his house. The\nneighbors helped him put out the conflagration, but they discouraged any\nmore experiments of that sort.\n\nThe patriotic old gentleman, however, planted so much powder and so\nmany explosive contrivances in the roads leading into Hawkeye, and then\nforgot the exact spots of danger, that people were afraid to travel\nthe highways, and used to come to town across the fields. The Colonel's\nmotto was, \u201cMillions for defence but not one cent for tribute.\u201d\n\nWhen Laura came to Hawkeye she might have forgotten the annoyances of\nthe gossips of Murpheysburg and have out lived the bitterness that was\ngrowing in her heart, if she had been thrown less upon herself, or if\nthe surroundings of her life had been more congenial and helpful.\nBut she had little society, less and less as she grew older that was\ncongenial to her, and her mind preyed upon itself; and the mystery of\nher birth at once chagrined her and raised in her the most extravagant\nexpectations. She was proud and she felt the sting of poverty. She could\nnot but be conscious of her beauty also, and she was vain of that, and\ncame to take a sort of delight in the exercise of her fascinations upon\nthe rather loutish young men who came in her way and whom she despised.\n\nThere was another world opened to her--a world of books. But it was not\nthe best world of that sort, for the small libraries she had access to\nin Hawkeye were decidedly miscellaneous, and largely made up of romances\nand fictions which fed her imagination with the most exaggerated notions\nof life, and showed her men and women in a very false sort of heroism.\nFrom these stories she learned what a woman of keen intellect and some\nculture joined to beauty and fascination of manner, might expect to\naccomplish in society as she read of it; and along with these ideas she\nimbibed other very crude ones in regard to the emancipation of woman.\n\nThere were also other books--histories, biographies of distinguished\npeople, travels in far lands, poems, especially those of Byron, Scott\nand Shelley and Moore, which she eagerly absorbed, and appropriated\ntherefrom what was to her liking. Nobody in Hawkeye had read so much\nor, after a fashion, studied so diligently as Laura. She passed for an\naccomplished girl, and no doubt thought herself one, as she was, judged\nby any standard near her.\n\nDuring the war there came to Hawkeye a confederate officer, Col. Selby,\nwho was stationed there for a time, in command of that district. He was\na handsome, soldierly man of thirty years, a graduate of the University\nof Virginia, and of distinguished family, if his story might be\nbelieved, and, it was evident, a man of the world and of extensive\ntravel and adventure.\n\nTo find in such an out of the way country place a woman like Laura was\na piece of good luck upon which Col. Selby congratulated himself. He was\nstudiously polite to her and treated her with a consideration to which\nshe was unaccustomed. She had read of such men, but she had never seen\none before, one so high-bred, so noble in sentiment, so entertaining in\nconversation, so engaging in manner.\n\nIt is a long story; unfortunately it is an old story, and it need not\nbe dwelt on. Laura loved him, and believed that his love for her was as\npure and deep as her own. She worshipped him and would have counted her\nlife a little thing to give him, if he would only love her and let her\nfeed the hunger of her heart upon him.\n\nThe passion possessed her whole being, and lifted her up, till she\nseemed to walk on air. It was all true, then, the romances she had read,\nthe bliss of love she had dreamed of. Why had she never noticed before\nhow blithesome the world was, how jocund with love; the birds sang it,\nthe trees whispered it to her as she passed, the very flowers beneath\nher feet strewed the way as for a bridal march.\n\nWhen the Colonel went away they were engaged to be married, as soon as\nhe could make certain arrangements which he represented to be necessary,\nand quit the army. He wrote to her from Harding, a small town in the\nsouthwest corner of the state, saying that he should be held in the\nservice longer than he had expected, but that it would not be more than\na few months, then he should be at liberty to take her to Chicago where\nhe had property, and should have business, either now or as soon as the\nwar was over, which he thought could not last long. Meantime why should\nthey be separated? He was established in comfortable quarters, and if\nshe could find company and join him, they would be married, and gain so\nmany more months of happiness.\n\nWas woman ever prudent when she loved? Laura went to Harding, the\nneighbors supposed to nurse Washington who had fallen ill there. Her\nengagement was, of course, known in Hawkeye, and was indeed a matter\nof pride to her family. Mrs. Hawkins would have told the first inquirer\nthat. Laura had gone to be married; but Laura had cautioned her; she did\nnot want to be thought of, she said, as going in search of a husband;\nlet the news come back after she was married.\n\nSo she traveled to Harding on the pretence we have mentioned, and was\nmarried. She was married, but something must have happened on that very\nday or the next that alarmed her. Washington did not know then or after\nwhat it was, but Laura bound him not to send news of her marriage to\nHawkeye yet, and to enjoin her mother not to speak of it. Whatever cruel\nsuspicion or nameless dread this was, Laura tried bravely to put it\naway, and not let it cloud her happiness.\n\nCommunication that summer, as may be imagined, was neither regular nor\nfrequent between the remote confederate camp at Harding and Hawkeye,\nand Laura was in a measure lost sight of--indeed, everyone had troubles\nenough of his own without borrowing from his neighbors.\n\nLaura had given herself utterly to her husband, and if he had faults,\nif he was selfish, if he was sometimes coarse, if he was dissipated, she\ndid not or would not see it. It was the passion of her life, the time\nwhen her whole nature went to flood tide and swept away all barriers.\nWas her husband ever cold or indifferent? She shut her eyes to\neverything but her sense of possession of her idol.\n\nThree months passed. One morning her husband informed her that he had\nbeen ordered South, and must go within two hours.\n\n\u201cI can be ready,\u201d said Laura, cheerfully.\n\n\u201cBut I can't take you. You must go back to Hawkeye.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan't-take-me?\u201d Laura asked, with wonder in her eyes. \u201cI can't live\nwithout you. You said-----\u201d\n\n\u201cO bother what I said,\u201d--and the Colonel took up his sword to buckle it\non, and then continued coolly, \u201cthe fact is Laura, our romance is played\nout.\u201d\n\nLaura heard, but she did not comprehend. She caught his arm and cried,\n\u201cGeorge, how can you joke so cruelly? I will go any where with you. I\nwill wait any where. I can't go back to Hawkeye.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, go where you like. Perhaps,\u201d continued he with a sneer, \u201cyou\nwould do as well to wait here, for another colonel.\u201d\n\nLaura's brain whirled. She did not yet comprehend. \u201cWhat does this mean?\nWhere are you going?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means,\u201d said the officer, in measured words, \u201cthat you haven't\nanything to show for a legal marriage, and that I am going to New\nOrleans.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's a lie, George, it's a lie. I am your wife. I shall go. I shall\nfollow you to New Orleans.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps my wife might not like it!\u201d\n\nLaura raised her head, her eyes flamed with fire, she tried to utter a\ncry, and fell senseless on the floor.\n\nWhen she came to herself the Colonel was gone. Washington Hawkins stood\nat her bedside. Did she come to herself? Was there anything left in her\nheart but hate and bitterness, a sense of an infamous wrong at the hands\nof the only man she had ever loved?\n\nShe returned to Hawkeye. With the exception of Washington and his\nmother, no one knew what had happened. The neighbors supposed that the\nengagement with Col. Selby had fallen through. Laura was ill for a\nlong time, but she recovered; she had that resolution in her that could\nconquer death almost. And with her health came back her beauty, and an\nadded fascination, a something that might be mistaken for sadness.

R.\n90.RESULT OF A STRAIGHT LINE\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nMr. Harry Brierly drew his pay as an engineer while he was living at the\nCity Hotel in Hawkeye. Mr. Thompson had been kind enough to say that\nit didn't make any difference whether he was with the corps or not; and\nalthough Harry protested to the Colonel daily and to Washington Hawkins\nthat he must go back at once to the line and superintend the lay-out\nwith reference to his contract, yet he did not go, but wrote instead\nlong letters to Philip, instructing him to keep his eye out, and to let\nhim know when any difficulty occurred that required his presence.\n\nMeantime Harry blossomed out in the society of Hawkeye, as he did in any\nsociety where fortune cast him and he had the slightest opportunity to\nexpand. Indeed the talents of a rich and accomplished young fellow\nlike Harry were not likely to go unappreciated in such a place. A land\noperator, engaged in vast speculations, a favorite in the select circles\nof New York, in correspondence with brokers and bankers, intimate with\npublic men at Washington, one who could play the guitar and touch\nthe banjo lightly, and who had an eye for a pretty girl, and knew the\nlanguage of flattery, was welcome everywhere in Hawkeye. Even Miss Laura\nHawkins thought it worth while to use her fascinations upon him, and\nto endeavor to entangle the volatile fellow in the meshes of her\nattractions.\n\n\u201cGad,\u201d says Harry to the Colonel, \u201cshe's a superb creature, she'd make a\nstir in New York, money or no money. There are men I know would give her\na railroad or an opera house, or whatever she wanted--at least they'd\npromise.\u201d\n\nHarry had a way of looking at women as he looked at anything else in the\nworld he wanted, and he half resolved to appropriate Miss Laura, during\nhis stay in Hawkeye. Perhaps the Colonel divined his thoughts, or was\noffended at Harry's talk, for he replied,\n\n\u201cNo nonsense, Mr. Brierly. Nonsense won't do in Hawkeye, not with my\nfriends. The Hawkins' blood is good blood, all the way from Tennessee.\nThe Hawkinses are under the weather now, but their Tennessee property is\nmillions when it comes into market.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, Colonel. Not the least offense intended. But you can see she\nis a fascinating woman. I was only thinking, as to this appropriation,\nnow, what such a woman could do in Washington. All correct, too,\nall correct. Common thing, I assure you in Washington; the wives of\nsenators, representatives, cabinet officers, all sorts of wives, and\nsome who are not wives, use their influence. You want an appointment? Do\nyou go to Senator X? Not much. You get on the right side of his wife.\nIs it an appropriation? You'd go straight to the Committee, or to the\nInterior office, I suppose? You'd learn better than that. It takes a\nwoman to get any thing through the Land Office: I tell you, Miss Laura\nwould fascinate an appropriation right through the Senate and the House\nof Representatives in one session, if she was in Washington, as your\nfriend, Colonel, of course as your friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you have her sign our petition?\u201d asked the Colonel, innocently.\n\nHarry laughed. \u201cWomen don't get anything by petitioning Congress; nobody\ndoes, that's for form. Petitions are referred somewhere, and that's the\nlast of them; you can't refer a handsome woman so easily, when she is\npresent. They prefer 'em mostly.\u201d\n\nThe petition however was elaborately drawn up, with a glowing\ndescription of Napoleon and the adjacent country, and a statement of the\nabsolute necessity to the prosperity of that region and of one of the\nstations on the great through route to the Pacific, of the immediate\nimprovement of Columbus River; to this was appended a map of the city\nand a survey of the river. It was signed by all the people at Stone's\nLanding who could write their names, by Col. Beriah Sellers, and\nthe Colonel agreed to have the names headed by all the senators and\nrepresentatives from the state and by a sprinkling of ex-governors and\nex-members of congress. When completed it was a formidable document. Its\npreparation and that of more minute plots of the new city consumed the\nvaluable time of Sellers and Harry for many weeks, and served to keep\nthem both in the highest spirits.\n\nIn the eyes of Washington Hawkins, Harry was a superior being, a man who\nwas able to bring things to pass in a way that excited his enthusiasm.\nHe never tired of listening to his stories of what he had done and of\nwhat he was going to do. As for Washington, Harry thought he was a man\nof ability and comprehension, but \u201ctoo visionary,\u201d he told the Colonel.\nThe Colonel said he might be right, but he had never noticed anything\nvisionary about him.\n\n\u201cHe's got his plans, sir. God bless my soul, at his age, I was full of\nplans. But experience sobers a man, I never touch any thing now that\nhasn't been weighed in my judgment; and when Beriah Sellers puts his\njudgment on a thing, there it is.\u201d\n\nWhatever might have been Harry's intentions with regard to Laura, he saw\nmore and more of her every day, until he got to be restless and nervous\nwhen he was not with her.\n\nThat consummate artist in passion allowed him to believe that the\nfascination was mainly on his side, and so worked upon his vanity,\nwhile inflaming his ardor, that he scarcely knew what he was about. Her\ncoolness and coyness were even made to appear the simple precautions\nof a modest timidity, and attracted him even more than the little\ntendernesses into which she was occasionally surprised. He could\nnever be away from her long, day or evening; and in a short time their\nintimacy was the town talk. She played with him so adroitly that Harry\nthought she was absorbed in love for him, and yet he was amazed that he\ndid not get on faster in his conquest.\n\nAnd when he thought of it, he was piqued as well. A country girl, poor\nenough, that was evident; living with her family in a cheap and most\nunattractive frame house, such as carpenters build in America, scantily\nfurnished and unadorned; without the adventitious aids of dress or\njewels or the fine manners of society--Harry couldn't understand it.\nBut she fascinated him, and held him just beyond the line of absolute\nfamiliarity at the same time. While he was with her she made him forget\nthat the Hawkins' house was nothing but a wooden tenement, with four\nsmall square rooms on the ground floor and a half story; it might have\nbeen a palace for aught he knew.\n\nPerhaps Laura was older than Harry. She was, at any rate, at that ripe\nage when beauty in woman seems more solid than in the budding period of\ngirlhood, and she had come to understand her powers perfectly, and to\nknow exactly how much of the susceptibility and archness of the girl\nit was profitable to retain. She saw that many women, with the best\nintentions, make a mistake of carrying too much girlishness into\nwomanhood. Such a woman would have attracted Harry at any time, but only\na woman with a cool brain and exquisite art could have made him lose\nhis head in this way; for Harry thought himself a man of the world. The\nyoung fellow never dreamed that he was merely being experimented on; he\nwas to her a man of another society and another culture, different from\nthat she had any knowledge of except in books, and she was not unwilling\nto try on him the fascinations of her mind and person.\n\nFor Laura had her dreams. She detested the narrow limits in which her\nlot was cast, she hated poverty. Much of her reading had been of modern\nworks of fiction, written by her own sex, which had revealed to her\nsomething of her own powers and given her indeed, an exaggerated notion\nof the influence, the wealth, the position a woman may attain who has\nbeauty and talent and ambition and a little culture, and is not too\nscrupulous in the use of them. She wanted to be rich, she wanted luxury,\nshe wanted men at her feet, her slaves, and she had not--thanks to some\nof the novels she had read--the nicest discrimination between notoriety\nand reputation; perhaps she did not know how fatal notoriety usually is\nto the bloom of womanhood.\n\nWith the other Hawkins children Laura had been brought up in the belief\nthat they had inherited a fortune in the Tennessee Lands. She did not\nby any means share all the delusion of the family; but her brain was\nnot seldom busy with schemes about it. Washington seemed to her only to\ndream of it and to be willing to wait for its riches to fall upon him\nin a golden shower; but she was impatient, and wished she were a man to\ntake hold of the business.\n\n\u201cYou men must enjoy your schemes and your activity and liberty to go\nabout the world,\u201d she said to Harry one day, when he had been talking of\nNew York and Washington and his incessant engagements.\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d replied that martyr to business, \u201cit's all well enough, if\nyou don't have too much of it, but it only has one object.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf a woman doesn't know, it's useless to tell her. What do you suppose\nI am staying in Hawkeye for, week after week, when I ought to be with my\ncorps?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose it's your business with Col. Sellers about Napoleon, you've\nalways told me so,\u201d answered Laura, with a look intended to contradict\nher words.\n\n\u201cAnd now I tell you that is all arranged, I suppose you'll tell me I\nought to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d exclaimed Laura, touching his arm and letting her pretty hand\nrest there a moment. \u201cWhy should I want you to go away? The only person\nin Hawkeye who understands me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you refuse to understand me,\u201d replied Harry, flattered but still\npetulant. \u201cYou are like an iceberg, when we are alone.\u201d\n\nLaura looked up with wonder in her great eyes, and something like a\nblush suffusing her face, followed by a look of langour that penetrated\nHarry's heart as if it had been longing.\n\n\u201cDid I ever show any want of confidence in you, Harry?\u201d And she gave\nhim her hand, which Harry pressed with effusion--something in her manner\ntold him that he must be content with that favor.\n\nIt was always so. She excited his hopes and denied him, inflamed his\npassion and restrained it, and wound him in her toils day by day. To\nwhat purpose? It was keen delight to Laura to prove that she had power\nover men.\n\nLaura liked to hear about life at the east, and especially about the\nluxurious society in which Mr. Brierly moved when he was at home. It\npleased her imagination to fancy herself a queen in it.\n\n\u201cYou should be a winter in Washington,\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cBut I have no acquaintances there.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon't know any of the families of the congressmen? They like to have a\npretty woman staying with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot one.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuppose Col. Sellers should, have business there; say, about this\nColumbus River appropriation?\u201d\n\n\u201cSellers!\u201d and Laura laughed.\n\n\u201cYou needn't laugh. Queerer things have happened. Sellers knows\neverybody from Missouri, and from the West, too, for that matter. He'd\nintroduce you to Washington life quick enough. It doesn't need a crowbar\nto break your way into society there as it does in Philadelphia. It's\ndemocratic, Washington is. Money or beauty will open any door. If I were\na handsome woman, I shouldn't want any better place than the capital to\npick up a prince or a fortune.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d replied Laura. \u201cBut I prefer the quiet of home, and the\nlove of those I know;\u201d and her face wore a look of sweet contentment and\nunworldliness that finished Mr. Harry Brierly for the day.\n\nNevertheless, the hint that Harry had dropped fell upon good ground, and\nbore fruit an hundred fold; it worked in her mind until she had built\nup a plan on it, and almost a career for herself. Why not, she said, why\nshouldn't I do as other women have done? She took the first opportunity\nto see Col. Sellers, and to sound him about the Washington visit. How\nwas he getting on with his navigation scheme, would it be likely to take\nhim from home to Jefferson City; or to Washington, perhaps?\n\n\u201cWell, maybe. If the people of Napoleon want me to go to Washington,\nand look after that matter, I might tear myself from my home. It's been\nsuggested to me, but--not a word of it to Mrs. Sellers and the children.\nMaybe they wouldn't like to think of their father in Washington. But\nDilworthy, Senator Dilworthy, says to me, 'Colonel, you are the man, you\ncould influence more votes than any one else on such a measure, an old\nsettler, a man of the people, you know the wants of Missouri; you've a\nrespect for religion too, says he, and know how the cause of the gospel\ngoes with improvements: Which is true enough, Miss Laura, and hasn't\nbeen enough thought of in connection with Napoleon. He's an able man,\nDilworthy, and a good man. A man has got to be good to succeed as he\nhas. He's only been in Congress a few years, and he must be worth a\nmillion. First thing in the morning when he stayed with me he asked\nabout family prayers, whether we had 'em before or after breakfast. I\nhated to disappoint the Senator, but I had to out with it, tell him\nwe didn't have 'em, not steady. He said he understood, business\ninterruptions and all that, some men were well enough without, but as\nfor him he never neglected the ordinances of religion. He doubted if\nthe Columbus River appropriation would succeed if we did not invoke the\nDivine Blessing on it.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it is unnecessary to say to the reader that Senator Dilworthy\nhad not stayed with Col. Sellers while he was in Hawkeye; this visit to\nhis house being only one of the Colonel's hallucinations--one of those\ninstant creations of his fertile fancy, which were always flashing into\nhis brain and out of his mouth in the course of any conversation and\nwithout interrupting the flow of it.\n\nDuring the summer Philip rode across the country and made a short visit\nin Hawkeye, giving Harry an opportunity to show him the progress that\nhe and the Colonel had made in their operation at Stone's Landing,\nto introduce him also to Laura, and to borrow a little money when he\ndeparted. Harry bragged about his conquest, as was his habit, and took\nPhilip round to see his western prize.\n\nLaura received Mr. Philip with a courtesy and a slight hauteur that\nrather surprised and not a little interested him. He saw at once that\nshe was older than Harry, and soon made up his mind that she was leading\nhis friend a country dance to which he was unaccustomed. At least he\nthought he saw that, and half hinted as much to Harry, who flared up at\nonce; but on a second visit Philip was not so sure, the young lady was\ncertainly kind and friendly and almost confiding with Harry, and treated\nPhilip with the greatest consideration. She deferred to his opinions,\nand listened attentively when he talked, and in time met his frank\nmanner with an equal frankness, so that he was quite convinced that\nwhatever she might feel towards Harry, she was sincere with him. Perhaps\nhis manly way did win her liking. Perhaps in her mind, she compared him\nwith Harry, and recognized in him a man to whom a woman might give her\nwhole soul, recklessly and with little care if she lost it. Philip\nwas not invincible to her beauty nor to the intellectual charm of her\npresence.\n\nThe week seemed very short that he passed in Hawkeye, and when he bade\nLaura good by, he seemed to have known her a year.\n\n\u201cWe shall see you again, Mr. Sterling,\u201d she said as she gave him her\nhand, with just a shade of sadness in her handsome eyes.\n\nAnd when he turned away she followed him with a look that might have\ndisturbed his serenity, if he had not at the moment had a little square\nletter in his breast pocket, dated at Philadelphia, and signed \u201cRuth.\u201d\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nThe visit of Senator Abner Dilworthy was an event in Hawkeye. When a\nSenator, whose place is in Washington moving among the Great and guiding\nthe destinies of the nation, condescends to mingle among the people and\naccept the hospitalities of such a place as Hawkeye, the honor is not\nconsidered a light one. All parties are flattered by it and politics are\nforgotten in the presence of one so distinguished among his fellows.\n\nSenator Dilworthy, who was from a neighboring state, had been a Unionist\nin the darkest days of his country, and had thriven by it, but was that\nany reason why Col. Sellers, who had been a confederate and had not\nthriven by it, should give him the cold shoulder?\n\nThe Senator was the guest of his old friend Gen. Boswell, but it\nalmost appeared that he was indebted to Col. Sellers for the unreserved\nhospitalities of the town. It was the large hearted Colonel who, in a\nmanner, gave him the freedom of the city.\n\n\u201cYou are known here, sir,\u201d said the Colonel, \u201cand Hawkeye is proud of\nyou. You will find every door open, and a welcome at every hearthstone.\nI should insist upon your going to my house, if you were not claimed by\nyour older friend Gen. Boswell. But you will mingle with our people, and\nyou will see here developments that will surprise you.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel was so profuse in his hospitality that he must have made the\nimpression upon himself that he had entertained the Senator at his own\nmansion during his stay; at any rate, he afterwards always spoke of him\nas his guest, and not seldom referred to the Senator's relish of certain\nviands on his table. He did, in fact, press him to dine upon the morning\nof the day the Senator was going away.\n\nSenator Dilworthy was large and portly, though not tall--a pleasant\nspoken man, a popular man with the people.\n\nHe took a lively interest in the town and all the surrounding country,\nand made many inquiries as to the progress of agriculture, of education,\nand of religion, and especially as to the condition of the emancipated\nrace.\n\n\u201cProvidence,\u201d he said, \u201chas placed them in our hands, and although you\nand I, General, might have chosen a different destiny for them, under\nthe Constitution, yet Providence knows best.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can't do much with 'em,\u201d interrupted Col. Sellers. \u201cThey are a\nspeculating race, sir, disinclined to work for white folks without\nsecurity, planning how to live by only working for themselves. Idle,\nsir, there's my garden just a ruin of weeds. Nothing practical in 'em.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is some truth in your observation, Colonel, but you must educate\nthem.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou educate the niggro and you make him more speculating than he was\nbefore. If he won't stick to any industry except for himself now, what\nwill he do then?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, Colonel, the negro when educated will be more able to make his\nspeculations fruitful.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever, sir, never. He would only have a wider scope to injure himself.\nA niggro has no grasp, sir. Now, a white man can conceive great\noperations, and carry them out; a niggro can't.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill,\u201d replied the Senator, \u201cgranting that he might injure himself in\na worldly point of view, his elevation through education would multiply\nhis chances for the hereafter--which is the important thing after all,\nColonel. And no matter what the result is, we must fulfill our duty by\nthis being.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'd elevate his soul,\u201d promptly responded the Colonel; \u201cthat's just it;\nyou can't make his soul too immortal, but I wouldn't touch him, himself.\nYes, sir! make his soul immortal, but don't disturb the niggro as he\nis.\u201d\n\nOf course one of the entertainments offered the Senator was a public\nreception, held in the court house, at which he made a speech to his\nfellow citizens. Col. Sellers was master of ceremonies. He escorted the\nband from the city hotel to Gen. Boswell's; he marshalled the procession\nof Masons, of Odd Fellows, and of Firemen, the Good Templars, the Sons\nof Temperance, the Cadets of Temperance, the Daughters of Rebecca,\nthe Sunday School children, and citizens generally, which followed the\nSenator to the court house; he bustled about the room long after every\none else was seated, and loudly cried \u201cOrder!\u201d in the dead silence which\npreceded the introduction of the Senator by Gen. Boswell. The occasion\nwas one to call out his finest powers of personal appearance, and one he\nlong dwelt on with pleasure.\n\nThis not being an edition of the Congressional Globe it is impossible to\ngive Senator Dilworthy's speech in full. He began somewhat as follows:\n\n\u201cFellow citizens: It gives me great pleasure to thus meet and mingle\nwith you, to lay aside for a moment the heavy duties of an official and\nburdensome station, and confer in familiar converse with my friends in\nyour great state. The good opinion of my fellow citizens of all sections\nis the sweetest solace in all my anxieties. I look forward with longing\nto the time when I can lay aside the cares of office--\u201d [\u201cdam sight,\u201d\n shouted a tipsy fellow near the door. Cries of \u201cput him out.\u201d]\n\n\u201cMy friends, do not remove him. Let the misguided man stay. I see that\nhe is a victim of that evil which is swallowing up public virtue and\nsapping the foundation of society. As I was saying, when I can lay down\nthe cares of office and retire to the sweets of private life in some\nsuch sweet, peaceful, intelligent, wide-awake and patriotic place as\nHawkeye (applause). I have traveled much, I have seen all parts of our\nglorious union, but I have never seen a lovelier village than yours,\nor one that has more signs of commercial and industrial and religious\nprosperity--(more applause).\u201d\n\nThe Senator then launched into a sketch of our great country, and dwelt\nfor an hour or more upon its prosperity and the dangers which threatened\nit.\n\nHe then touched reverently upon the institutions of religion, and upon\nthe necessity of private purity, if we were to have any public morality.\n\u201cI trust,\u201d he said, \u201cthat there are children within the sound of my\nvoice,\u201d and after some remarks to them, the Senator closed with an\napostrophe to \u201cthe genius of American Liberty, walking with the Sunday\nSchool in one hand and Temperance in the other up the glorified steps of\nthe National Capitol.\u201d\n\nCol. Sellers did not of course lose the opportunity to impress upon so\ninfluential a person as the Senator the desirability of improving the\nnavigation of Columbus river. He and Mr. Brierly took the Senator over\nto Napoleon and opened to him their plan. It was a plan that the Senator\ncould understand without a great deal of explanation, for he seemed to\nbe familiar with the like improvements elsewhere. When, however, they\nreached Stone's Landing the Senator looked about him and inquired,\n\n\u201cIs this Napoleon?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the nucleus, the nucleus,\u201d said the Colonel, unrolling his map.\n\u201cHere is the deepo, the church, the City Hall and so on.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, I see. How far from here is Columbus River? Does that stream\nempty----\u201d\n\n\u201cThat, why, that's Goose Run. Thar ain't no Columbus, thout'n it's over\nto Hawkeye,\u201d interrupted one of the citizens, who had come out to stare\nat the strangers. \u201cA railroad come here last summer, but it haint been\nhere no mo'.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d the Colonel hastened to explain, \u201cin the old records\nColumbus River is called Goose Run. You see how it sweeps round the\ntown--forty-nine miles to the Missouri; sloop navigation all the way\npretty much drains this whole country; when it's improved steamboats\nwill run right up here. It's got to be enlarged, deepened. You see by\nthe map. Columbus River. This country must have water communication!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou'll want a considerable appropriation, Col. Sellers.\n\n\u201cI should say a million; is that your figure Mr. Brierly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to our surveys,\u201d said Harry, \u201ca million would do it; a\nmillion spent on the river would make Napoleon worth two millions at\nleast.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d nodded the Senator. \u201cBut you'd better begin by asking only for\ntwo or three hundred thousand, the usual way. You can begin to sell town\nlots on that appropriation you know.\u201d\n\nThe Senator, himself, to do him justice, was not very much interested in\nthe country or the stream, but he favored the appropriation, and he gave\nthe Colonel and Mr. Brierly to understand that he would endeavor to get\nit through. Harry, who thought he was shrewd and understood Washington,\nsuggested an interest.\n\nBut he saw that the Senator was wounded by the suggestion.\n\n\u201cYou will offend me by repeating such an observation,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhatever I do will be for the public interest. It will require a\nportion of the appropriation for necessary expenses, and I am sorry to\nsay that there are members who will have to be seen. But you can reckon\nupon my humble services.\u201d\n\nThis aspect of the subject was not again alluded to. The Senator\npossessed himself of the facts, not from his observation of the ground,\nbut from the lips of Col. Sellers, and laid the appropriation scheme\naway among his other plans for benefiting the public.\n\nIt was on this visit also that the Senator made the acquaintance of\nMr. Washington Hawkins, and was greatly taken with his innocence, his\nguileless manner and perhaps with his ready adaptability to enter upon\nany plan proposed.\n\nCol. Sellers was pleased to see this interest that Washington had\nawakened, especially since it was likely to further his expectations\nwith regard to the Tennessee lands; the Senator having remarked to the\nColonel, that he delighted to help any deserving young man, when the\npromotion of a private advantage could at the same time be made to\ncontribute to the general good. And he did not doubt that this was an\nopportunity of that kind.\n\nThe result of several conferences with Washington was that the Senator\nproposed that he should go to Washington with him and become his private\nsecretary and the secretary of his committee; a proposal which was\neagerly accepted.\n\nThe Senator spent Sunday in Hawkeye and attended church. He cheered\nthe heart of the worthy and zealous minister by an expression of his\nsympathy in his labors, and by many inquiries in regard to the religious\nstate of the region. It was not a very promising state, and the good man\nfelt how much lighter his task would be, if he had the aid of such a man\nas Senator Dilworthy.\n\n\u201cI am glad to see, my dear sir,\u201d said the Senator, \u201cthat you give them\nthe doctrines. It is owing to a neglect of the doctrines, that there is\nsuch a fearful falling away in the country. I wish that we might have\nyou in Washington--as chaplain, now, in the senate.\u201d\n\nThe good man could not but be a little flattered, and if sometimes,\nthereafter, in his discouraging work, he allowed the thought that he\nmight perhaps be called to Washington as chaplain of the Senate, to\ncheer him, who can wonder. The Senator's commendation at least did one\nservice for him, it elevated him in the opinion of Hawkeye.\n\nLaura was at church alone that day, and Mr. Brierly walked home with\nher. A part of their way lay with that of General Boswell and Senator\nDilworthy, and introductions were made. Laura had her own reasons for\nwishing to know the Senator, and the Senator was not a man who could\nbe called indifferent to charms such as hers. That meek young lady\nso commended herself to him in the short walk, that he announced his\nintentions of paying his respects to her the next day, an intention\nwhich Harry received glumly; and when the Senator was out of hearing he\ncalled him \u201can old fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cFie,\u201d said Laura, \u201cI do believe you are jealous, Harry. He is a very\npleasant man. He said you were a young man of great promise.\u201d\n\nThe Senator did call next day, and the result of his visit was that he\nwas confirmed in his impression that there was something about him very\nattractive to ladies. He saw Laura again and again during his stay, and\nfelt more and more the subtle influence of her feminine beauty, which\nevery man felt who came near her.\n\nHarry was beside himself with rage while the Senator remained in town;\nhe declared that women were always ready to drop any man for higher\ngame; and he attributed his own ill-luck to the Senator's appearance.\nThe fellow was in fact crazy about her beauty and ready to beat his\nbrains out in chagrin. Perhaps Laura enjoyed his torment, but she\nsoothed him with blandishments that increased his ardor, and she smiled\nto herself to think that he had, with all his protestations of love,\nnever spoken of marriage. Probably the vivacious fellow never had\nthought of it. At any rate when he at length went away from Hawkeye he\nwas no nearer it. But there was no telling to what desperate lengths his\npassion might not carry him.\n\nLaura bade him good bye with tender regret, which, however, did not\ndisturb her peace or interfere with her plans. The visit of Senator\nDilworthy had become of more importance to her, and it by and by bore\nthe fruit she longed for, in an invitation to visit his family in the\nNational Capital during the winter session of Congress.\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n     O lift your natures up:\n     Embrace our aims: work out your freedom. Girls,\n     Knowledge is now no more a fountain sealed;\n     Drink deep until the habits of the slave,\n     The sins of emptiness, gossip and spite\n     And slander, die.\n\n     The Princess.\n\nWhether medicine is a science, or only an empirical method of getting\na living out of the ignorance of the human race, Ruth found before her\nfirst term was over at the medical school that there were other things\nshe needed to know quite as much as that which is taught in medical\nbooks, and that she could never satisfy her aspirations without more\ngeneral culture.\n\n\u201cDoes your doctor know any thing--I don't mean about medicine, but about\nthings in general, is he a man of information and good sense?\u201d once\nasked an old practitioner. \u201cIf he doesn't know anything but medicine the\nchance is he doesn't know that.\u201d\n\nThe close application to her special study was beginning to tell\nupon Ruth's delicate health also, and the summer brought with it only\nweariness and indisposition for any mental effort.\n\nIn this condition of mind and body the quiet of her home and the\nunexciting companionship of those about her were more than ever\ntiresome.\n\nShe followed with more interest Philip's sparkling account of his life\nin the west, and longed for his experiences, and to know some of those\npeople of a world so different from here, who alternately amused and\ndispleased him. He at least was learning the world, the good and the bad\nof it, as must happen to every one who accomplishes anything in it.\n\nBut what, Ruth wrote, could a woman do, tied up by custom, and cast\ninto particular circumstances out of which it was almost impossible\nto extricate herself? Philip thought that he would go some day and\nextricate Ruth, but he did not write that, for he had the instinct to\nknow that this was not the extrication she dreamed of, and that she must\nfind out by her own experience what her heart really wanted.\n\nPhilip was not a philosopher, to be sure, but he had the old fashioned\nnotion, that whatever a woman's theories of life might be, she would\ncome round to matrimony, only give her time. He could indeed recall to\nmind one woman--and he never knew a nobler--whose whole soul was devoted\nand who believed that her life was consecrated to a certain benevolent\nproject in singleness of life, who yielded to the touch of matrimony, as\nan icicle yields to a sunbeam.\n\nNeither at home nor elsewhere did Ruth utter any complaint, or admit any\nweariness or doubt of her ability to pursue the path she had marked\nout for herself. But her mother saw clearly enough her struggle with\ninfirmity, and was not deceived by either her gaiety or by the cheerful\ncomposure which she carried into all the ordinary duties that fell to\nher. She saw plainly enough that Ruth needed an entire change of scene\nand of occupation, and perhaps she believed that such a change, with the\nknowledge of the world it would bring, would divert Ruth from a course\nfor which she felt she was physically entirely unfitted.\n\nIt therefore suited the wishes of all concerned, when autumn came,\nthat Ruth should go away to school. She selected a large New England\nSeminary, of which she had often heard Philip speak, which was attended\nby both sexes and offered almost collegiate advantages of education.\nThither she went in September, and began for the second time in the year\na life new to her.\n\nThe Seminary was the chief feature of Fallkill, a village of two to\nthree thousand inhabitants. It was a prosperous school, with three\nhundred students, a large corps of teachers, men and women, and with a\nvenerable rusty row of academic buildings on the shaded square of the\ntown. The students lodged and boarded in private families in the place,\nand so it came about that while the school did a great deal to support\nthe town, the town gave the students society and the sweet influences of\nhome life. It is at least respectful to say that the influences of home\nlife are sweet.\n\nRuth's home, by the intervention of Philip, was in a family--one of the\nrare exceptions in life or in fiction--that had never known better days.\nThe Montagues, it is perhaps well to say, had intended to come over\nin the Mayflower, but were detained at Delft Haven by the illness of a\nchild. They came over to Massachusetts Bay in another vessel, and thus\nescaped the onus of that brevet nobility under which the successors of\nthe Mayflower Pilgrims have descended. Having no factitious weight of\ndignity to carry, the Montagues steadily improved their condition from\nthe day they landed, and they were never more vigorous or prosperous\nthan at the date of this narrative. With character compacted by the\nrigid Puritan discipline of more than two centuries, they had retained\nits strength and purity and thrown off its narrowness, and were now\nblossoming under the generous modern influences. Squire Oliver Montague,\na lawyer who had retired from the practice of his profession except\nin rare cases, dwelt in a square old fashioned New England mansion a\nquarter of a mile away from the green.\n\nIt was called a mansion because it stood alone with ample fields about\nit, and had an avenue of trees leading to it from the road, and on the\nwest commanded a view of a pretty little lake with gentle slopes and\nnodding were now blossoming under the generous modern influences. But\nit was just a plain, roomy house, capable of extending to many guests an\nunpretending hospitality.\n\nThe family consisted of the Squire and his wife, a son and a daughter\nmarried and not at home, a son in college at Cambridge, another son at\nthe Seminary, and a daughter Alice, who was a year or more older\nthan Ruth. Having only riches enough to be able to gratify reasonable\ndesires, and yet make their gratifications always a novelty and a\npleasure, the family occupied that just mean in life which is so rarely\nattained, and still more rarely enjoyed without discontent.\n\nIf Ruth did not find so much luxury in the house as in her own home,\nthere were evidences of culture, of intellectual activity and of a zest\nin the affairs of all the world, which greatly impressed her. Every room\nhad its book-cases or book-shelves, and was more or less a library; upon\nevery table was liable to be a litter of new books, fresh periodicals\nand daily newspapers.\n\nThere were plants in the sunny windows and some choice engravings on the\nwalls, with bits of color in oil or water-colors; the piano was sure\nto be open and strewn with music; and there were photographs and\nlittle souvenirs here and there of foreign travel. An absence of any\n\u201cwhat-pots\u201d in the corners with rows of cheerful shells, and Hindoo\ngods, and Chinese idols, and nests of useless boxes of lacquered wood,\nmight be taken as denoting a languidness in the family concerning\nforeign missions, but perhaps unjustly.\n\nAt any rate the life of the world flowed freely into this hospitable\nhouse, and there was always so much talk there of the news of the day,\nof the new books and of authors, of Boston radicalism and New York\ncivilization, and the virtue of Congress, that small gossip stood a very\npoor chance.\n\nAll this was in many ways so new to Ruth that she seemed to have passed\ninto another world, in which she experienced a freedom and a mental\nexhilaration unknown to her before. Under this influence she entered\nupon her studies with keen enjoyment, finding for a time all the\nrelaxation she needed, in the charming social life at the Montague\nhouse.\n\nIt is strange, she wrote to Philip, in one of her occasional letters,\nthat you never told me more about this delightful family, and scarcely\nmentioned Alice who is the life of it, just the noblest girl, unselfish,\nknows how to do so many things, with lots of talent, with a dry humor,\nand an odd way of looking at things, and yet quiet and even serious\noften--one of your \u201ccapable\u201d New England girls. We shall be great\nfriends. It had never occurred to Philip that there was any thing\nextraordinary about the family that needed mention. He knew dozens of\ngirls like Alice, he thought to himself, but only one like Ruth.\n\nGood friends the two girls were from the beginning. Ruth was a study to\nAlice; the product of a culture entirely foreign to her experience,\nso much a child in some things, so much a woman in others; and Ruth in\nturn, it must be confessed, probing Alice sometimes with her serious\ngrey eyes, wondered what her object in life was, and whether she had\nany purpose beyond living as she now saw her. For she could scarcely\nconceive of a life that should not be devoted to the accomplishment of\nsome definite work, and she had no doubt that in her own case everything\nelse would yield to the professional career she had marked out.\n\n\u201cSo you know Philip Sterling,\u201d said Ruth one day as the girls sat at\ntheir sewing. Ruth never embroidered, and never sewed when she could\navoid it. Bless her.\n\n\u201cOh yes, we are old friends. Philip used to come to Fallkill often while\nhe was in college. He was once rusticated here for a term.\u201d\n\n\u201cRusticated?\u201d\n\n\u201cSuspended for some College scrape. He was a great favorite here.\nFather and he were famous friends. Father said that Philip had no end of\nnonsense in him and was always blundering into something, but he was a\nroyal good fellow and would come out all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you think he was fickle?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, I never thought whether he was or not,\u201d replied Alice looking up.\n\u201cI suppose he was always in love with some girl or another, as college\nboys are. He used to make me his confidant now and then, and be terribly\nin the dumps.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did he come to you?\u201d pursued Ruth, \u201cyou were younger than he.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm sure I don't know. He was at our house a good deal. Once at a\npicnic by the lake, at the risk of his own life, he saved sister Millie\nfrom drowning, and we all liked to have him here. Perhaps he thought\nas he had saved one sister, the other ought to help him when he was in\ntrouble. I don't know.\u201d\n\nThe fact was that Alice was a person who invited confidences, because\nshe never betrayed them, and gave abundant sympathy in return. There\nare persons, whom we all know, to whom human confidences, troubles and\nheart-aches flow as naturally as streams to a placid lake.\n\nThis is not a history of Fallkill, nor of the Montague family, worthy as\nboth are of that honor, and this narrative cannot be diverted into long\nloitering with them. If the reader visits the village to-day, he will\ndoubtless be pointed out the Montague dwelling, where Ruth lived, the\ncross-lots path she traversed to the Seminary, and the venerable chapel\nwith its cracked bell.\n\nIn the little society of the place, the Quaker girl was a favorite, and\nno considerable social gathering or pleasure party was thought complete\nwithout her. There was something in this seemingly transparent and yet\ndeep character, in her childlike gaiety and enjoyment of the society\nabout her, and in her not seldom absorption in herself, that would have\nmade her long remembered there if no events had subsequently occurred to\nrecall her to mind.\n\nTo the surprise of Alice, Ruth took to the small gaieties of the village\nwith a zest of enjoyment that seemed foreign to one who had devoted\nher life to a serious profession from the highest motives. Alice liked\nsociety well enough, she thought, but there was nothing exciting in that\nof Fallkill, nor anything novel in the attentions of the well-bred young\ngentlemen one met in it. It must have worn a different aspect to Ruth,\nfor she entered into its pleasures at first with curiosity, and then\nwith interest and finally with a kind of staid abandon that no one\nwould have deemed possible for her. Parties, picnics, rowing-matches,\nmoonlight strolls, nutting expeditions in the October woods,--Alice\ndeclared that it was a whirl of dissipation. The fondness of Ruth, which\nwas scarcely disguised, for the company of agreeable young fellows, who\ntalked nothings, gave Alice opportunity for no end of banter.\n\n\u201cDo you look upon them as I subjects, dear?\u201d she would ask.\n\nAnd Ruth laughed her merriest laugh, and then looked sober again.\nPerhaps she was thinking, after all, whether she knew herself.\n\nIf you should rear a duck in the heart of the Sahara, no doubt it would\nswim if you brought it to the Nile.\n\nSurely no one would have predicted when Ruth left Philadelphia that she\nwould become absorbed to this extent, and so happy, in a life so unlike\nthat she thought she desired. But no one can tell how a woman will act\nunder any circumstances. The reason novelists nearly always fail in\ndepicting women when they make them act, is that they let them do what\nthey have observed some woman has done at sometime or another. And that\nis where they make a mistake; for a woman will never do again what has\nbeen done before. It is this uncertainty that causes women, considered\nas materials for fiction, to be so interesting to themselves and to\nothers.\n\nAs the fall went on and the winter, Ruth did not distinguish herself\ngreatly at the Fallkill Seminary as a student, a fact that apparently\ngave her no anxiety, and did not diminish her enjoyment of a new sort of\npower which had awakened within her.\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nIn mid-winter, an event occurred of unusual interest to the inhabitants\nof the Montague house, and to the friends of the young ladies who sought\ntheir society.\n\nThis was the arrival at the Sassacua Hotel of two young gentlemen from\nthe west.\n\nIt is the fashion in New England to give Indian names to the public\nhouses, not that the late lamented savage knew how to keep a hotel, but\nthat his warlike name may impress the traveler who humbly craves shelter\nthere, and make him grateful to the noble and gentlemanly clerk if he is\nallowed to depart with his scalp safe.\n\nThe two young gentlemen were neither students for the Fallkill Seminary,\nnor lecturers on physiology, nor yet life assurance solicitors, three\nsuppositions that almost exhausted the guessing power of the people at\nthe hotel in respect to the names of \u201cPhilip Sterling and Henry Brierly,\nMissouri,\u201d on the register. They were handsome enough fellows, that was\nevident, browned by out-door exposure, and with a free and lordly way\nabout them that almost awed the hotel clerk himself. Indeed, he very\nsoon set down Mr. Brierly as a gentleman of large fortune, with enormous\ninterests on his shoulders. Harry had a way of casually mentioning\nwestern investments, through lines, the freighting business, and the\nroute through the Indian territory to Lower California, which was\ncalculated to give an importance to his lightest word.\n\n\u201cYou've a pleasant town here, sir, and the most comfortable looking\nhotel I've seen out of New York,\u201d said Harry to the clerk; \u201cwe shall\nstay here a few days if you can give us a roomy suite of apartments.\u201d\n\nHarry usually had the best of everything, wherever he went, as such\nfellows always do have in this accommodating world. Philip would have\nbeen quite content with less expensive quarters, but there was no\nresisting Harry's generosity in such matters.\n\nRailroad surveying and real-estate operations were at a standstill\nduring the winter in Missouri, and the young men had taken advantage of\nthe lull to come east, Philip to see if there was any disposition in his\nfriends, the railway contractors, to give him a share in the Salt\nLick Union Pacific Extension, and Harry to open out to his uncle\nthe prospects of the new city at Stone's Landing, and to procure\ncongressional appropriations for the harbor and for making Goose Run\nnavigable. Harry had with him a map of that noble stream and of the\nharbor, with a perfect net-work of railroads centering in it, pictures\nof wharves, crowded with steamboats, and of huge grain-elevators on the\nbank, all of which grew out of the combined imaginations of Col. Sellers\nand Mr. Brierly. The Colonel had entire confidence in Harry's influence\nwith Wall street, and with congressmen, to bring about the consummation\nof their scheme, and he waited his return in the empty house at Hawkeye,\nfeeding his pinched family upon the most gorgeous expectations with a\nreckless prodigality.\n\n\u201cDon't let 'em into the thing more than is necessary,\u201d says the Colonel\nto Harry; \u201cgive 'em a small interest; a lot apiece in the suburbs of the\nLanding ought to do a congressman, but I reckon you'll have to mortgage\na part of the city itself to the brokers.\u201d\n\nHarry did not find that eagerness to lend money on Stone's Landing in\nWall street which Col. Sellers had expected, (it had seen too many such\nmaps as he exhibited), although his uncle and some of the brokers looked\nwith more favor on the appropriation for improving the navigation of\nColumbus River, and were not disinclined to form a company for that\npurpose. An appropriation was a tangible thing, if you could get hold of\nit, and it made little difference what it was appropriated for, so long\nas you got hold of it.\n\nPending these weighty negotiations, Philip has persuaded Harry to take\na little run up to Fallkill, a not difficult task, for that young man\nwould at any time have turned his back upon all the land in the West\nat sight of a new and pretty face, and he had, it must be confessed, a\nfacility in love making which made it not at all an interference with\nthe more serious business of life. He could not, to be sure, conceive\nhow Philip could be interested in a young lady who was studying\nmedicine, but he had no objection to going, for he did not doubt that\nthere were other girls in Fallkill who were worth a week's attention.\n\nThe young men were received at the house of the Montagues with the\nhospitality which never failed there.\n\n\u201cWe are glad to see you again,\u201d exclaimed the Squire heartily, \u201cyou are\nwelcome Mr. Brierly, any friend of Phil's is welcome at our house.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's more like home to me, than any place except my own home,\u201d cried\nPhilip, as he looked about the cheerful house and went through a general\nhand-shaking.\n\n\u201cIt's a long time, though, since you have been here to say so,\u201d Alice\nsaid, with her father's frankness of manner; \u201cand I suspect we owe the\nvisit now to your sudden interest in the Fallkill Seminary.\u201d\n\nPhilip's color came, as it had an awkward way of doing in his tell-tale\nface, but before he could stammer a reply, Harry came in with,\n\n\u201cThat accounts for Phil's wish to build a Seminary at Stone's Landing,\nour place in Missouri, when Col. Sellers insisted it should be a\nUniversity. Phil appears to have a weakness for Seminaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would have been better for your friend Sellers,\u201d retorted Philip,\n\u201cif he had had a weakness for district schools. Col. Sellers, Miss\nAlice, is a great friend of Harry's, who is always trying to build a\nhouse by beginning at the top.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose it's as easy to build a University on paper as a Seminary,\nand it looks better,\u201d was Harry's reflection; at which the Squire\nlaughed, and said he quite agreed with him. The old gentleman understood\nStone's Landing a good deal better than he would have done after an\nhour's talk with either of it's expectant proprietors.\n\nAt this moment, and while Philip was trying to frame a question that\nhe found it exceedingly difficult to put into words, the door opened\nquietly, and Ruth entered. Taking in the group with a quick glance, her\neye lighted up, and with a merry smile she advanced and shook hands with\nPhilip. She was so unconstrained and sincerely cordial, that it made\nthat hero of the west feel somehow young, and very ill at ease.\n\nFor months and months he had thought of this meeting and pictured it\nto himself a hundred times, but he had never imagined it would be like\nthis. He should meet Ruth unexpectedly, as she was walking alone from\nthe school, perhaps, or entering the room where he was waiting for her,\nand she would cry \u201cOh! Phil,\u201d and then check herself, and perhaps blush,\nand Philip calm but eager and enthusiastic, would reassure her by his\nwarm manner, and he would take her hand impressively, and she would look\nup timidly, and, after his long absence, perhaps he would be permitted\nto-- Good heavens, how many times he had come to this point, and\nwondered if it could happen so. Well, well; he had never supposed that\nhe should be the one embarrassed, and above all by a sincere and cordial\nwelcome.\n\n\u201cWe heard you were at the Sassacus House,\u201d were Ruth's first words; \u201cand\nthis I suppose is your friend?\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d Philip at length blundered out, \u201cthis is Mr.\nBrierly of whom I have written you.\u201d\n\nAnd Ruth welcomed Harry with a friendliness that Philip thought was due\nto his friend, to be sure, but which seemed to him too level with her\nreception of himself, but which Harry received as his due from the other\nsex.\n\nQuestions were asked about the journey and about the West, and the\nconversation became a general one, until Philip at length found himself\ntalking with the Squire in relation to land and railroads and things he\ncouldn't keep his mind on especially as he heard Ruth and Harry in an\nanimated discourse, and caught the words \u201cNew York,\u201d and \u201copera,\u201d and\n\u201creception,\u201d and knew that Harry was giving his imagination full range\nin the world of fashion.\n\nHarry knew all about the opera, green room and all (at least he said\nso) and knew a good many of the operas and could make very entertaining\nstories of their plots, telling how the soprano came in here, and\nthe basso here, humming the beginning of their\nairs--tum-ti-tum-ti-ti--suggesting the profound dissatisfaction of the\nbasso recitative--down-among-the-dead-men--and touching off the whole\nwith an airy grace quite captivating; though he couldn't have sung a\nsingle air through to save himself, and he hadn't an ear to know whether\nit was sung correctly. All the same he doted on the opera, and kept a\nbox there, into which he lounged occasionally to hear a favorite scene\nand meet his society friends.\n\nIf Ruth was ever in the city he should be happy to place his box at the\ndisposal of Ruth and her friends. Needless to say that she was delighted\nwith the offer.\n\nWhen she told Philip of it, that discreet young fellow only smiled, and\nsaid that he hoped she would be fortunate enough to be in New York some\nevening when Harry had not already given the use of his private box to\nsome other friend.\n\nThe Squire pressed the visitors to let him send for their trunks and\nurged them to stay at his house, and Alice joined in the invitation, but\nPhilip had reasons for declining. They staid to supper however, and in\nthe evening Philip had a long talk apart with Ruth, a delightful hour to\nhim, in which she spoke freely of herself as of old, of her studies at\nPhiladelphia and of her plans, and she entered into his adventures and\nprospects in the West with a genuine and almost sisterly interest; an\ninterest, however, which did not exactly satisfy Philip--it was too\ngeneral and not personal enough to suit him. And with all her freedom\nin speaking of her own hopes, Philip could not, detect any reference\nto himself in them; whereas he never undertook anything that he did not\nthink of Ruth in connection with it, he never made a plan that had not\nreference to her, and he never thought of anything as complete if she\ncould not share it. Fortune, reputation these had no value to him except\nin Ruth's eyes, and there were times when it seemed to him that if Ruth\nwas not on this earth, he should plunge off into some remote wilderness\nand live in a purposeless seclusion.\n\n\u201cI hoped,\u201d said Philip; \u201cto get a little start in connection with this\nnew railroad, and make a little money, so that I could come east and\nengage in something more suited to my tastes. I shouldn't like to live\nin the West. Would you?\n\n\u201cIt never occurred to me whether I would or not,\u201d was the unembarrassed\nreply. \u201cOne of our graduates went to Chicago, and has a nice practice\nthere. I don't know where I shall go. It would mortify mother dreadfully\nto have me driving about Philadelphia in a doctor's gig.\u201d\n\nPhilip laughed at the idea of it. \u201cAnd does it seem as necessary to you\nto do it as it did before you came to Fallkill?\u201d\n\nIt was a home question, and went deeper than Philip knew, for Ruth at\nonce thought of practicing her profession among the young gentlemen\nand ladies of her acquaintance in the village; but she was reluctant to\nadmit to herself that her notions of a career had undergone any change.\n\n\u201cOh, I don't think I should come to Fallkill to practice, but I must do\nsomething when I am through school; and why not medicine?\u201d\n\nPhilip would like to have explained why not, but the explanation would\nbe of no use if it were not already obvious to Ruth.\n\nHarry was equally in his element whether instructing Squire Montague\nabout the investment of capital in Missouri, the improvement of Columbus\nRiver, the project he and some gentlemen in New York had for making a\nshorter Pacific connection with the Mississippi than the present one;\nor diverting Mrs. Montague with his experience in cooking in camp; or\ndrawing for Miss Alice an amusing picture of the social contrasts of New\nEngland and the border where he had been. Harry was a very entertaining\nfellow, having his imagination to help his memory, and telling his\nstories as if he believed them--as perhaps he did. Alice was greatly\namused with Harry and listened so seriously to his romancing that\nhe exceeded his usual limits. Chance allusions to his bachelor\nestablishment in town and the place of his family on the Hudson, could\nnot have been made by a millionaire, more naturally.\n\n\u201cI should think,\u201d queried Alice, \u201cyou would rather stay in New York than\nto try the rough life at the West you have been speaking of.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, adventure,\u201d says Harry, \u201cI get tired of New York. And besides I got\ninvolved in some operations that I had to see through. Parties in New\nYork only last week wanted me to go down into Arizona in a big diamond\ninterest. I told them, no, no speculation for me. I've got my interests\nin Missouri; and I wouldn't leave Philip, as long as he stays there.\u201d\n\nWhen the young gentlemen were on their way back to the hotel, Mr.\nPhilip, who was not in very good humor, broke out,\n\n\u201cWhat the deuce, Harry, did you go on in that style to the Montagues\nfor?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on?\u201d cried Harry. \u201cWhy shouldn't I try to make a pleasant evening?\nAnd besides, ain't I going to do those things? What difference does it\nmake about the mood and tense of a mere verb? Didn't uncle tell me only\nlast Saturday, that I might as well go down to Arizona and hunt for\ndiamonds? A fellow might as well make a good impression as a poor one.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense. You'll get to believing your own romancing by and by.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you'll see. When Sellers and I get that appropriation, I'll show\nyou an establishment in town and another on the Hudson and a box at the\nopera.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it will be like Col. Sellers' plantation at Hawkeye. Did you ever\nsee that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, don't be cross, Phil. She's just superb, that little woman. You\nnever told me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho's just superb?\u201d growled Philip, fancying this turn of the\nconversation less than the other.\n\n\u201cWell, Mrs. Montague, if you must know.\u201d And Harry stopped to light a\ncigar, and then puffed on in silence. The little quarrel didn't last\nover night, for Harry never appeared to cherish any ill-will half a\nsecond, and Philip was too sensible to continue a row about nothing; and\nhe had invited Harry to come with him.\n\nThe young gentlemen stayed in Fallkill a week, and were every day at the\nMontagues, and took part in the winter gaieties of the village. There\nwere parties here and there to which the friends of Ruth and the\nMontagues were of course invited, and Harry in the generosity of his\nnature, gave in return a little supper at the hotel, very simple indeed,\nwith dancing in the hall, and some refreshments passed round. And Philip\nfound the whole thing in the bill when he came to pay it.\n\nBefore the week was over Philip thought he had a new light on the\ncharacter of Ruth. Her absorption in the small gaieties of the society\nthere surprised him. He had few opportunities for serious conversation\nwith her. There was always some butterfly or another flitting about, and\nwhen Philip showed by his manner that he was not pleased, Ruth laughed\nmerrily enough and rallied him on his soberness--she declared he was\ngetting to be grim and unsocial. He talked indeed more with Alice than\nwith Ruth, and scarcely concealed from her the trouble that was in his\nmind. It needed, in fact, no word from him, for she saw clearly enough\nwhat was going forward, and knew her sex well enough to know there was\nno remedy for it but time.\n\n\u201cRuth is a dear girl, Philip, and has as much firmness of purpose as\never, but don't you see she has just discovered that she is fond of\nsociety? Don't you let her see you are selfish about it, is my advice.\u201d\n\nThe last evening they were to spend in Fallkill, they were at the\nMontagues, and Philip hoped that he would find Ruth in a different mood.\nBut she was never more gay, and there was a spice of mischief in her\neye and in her laugh. \u201cConfound it,\u201d said Philip to himself, \u201cshe's in a\nperfect twitter.\u201d\n\nHe would have liked to quarrel with her, and fling himself out of the\nhouse in tragedy style, going perhaps so far as to blindly wander off\nmiles into the country and bathe his throbbing brow in the chilling rain\nof the stars, as people do in novels; but he had no opportunity. For\nRuth was as serenely unconscious of mischief as women can be at times,\nand fascinated him more than ever with her little demurenesses and\nhalf-confidences. She even said \u201cThee\u201d to him once in reproach for a\ncutting speech he began. And the sweet little word made his heart beat\nlike a trip-hammer, for never in all her life had she said \u201cthee\u201d to him\nbefore.\n\nWas she fascinated with Harry's careless 'bon homie' and gay assurance?\nBoth chatted away in high spirits, and made the evening whirl along in\nthe most mirthful manner. Ruth sang for Harry, and that young gentleman\nturned the leaves for her at the piano, and put in a bass note now and\nthen where he thought it would tell.\n\nYes, it was a merry evening, and Philip was heartily glad when it was\nover, and the long leave-taking with the family was through with.\n\n\u201cFarewell Philip. Good night Mr. Brierly,\u201d Ruth's clear voice sounded\nafter them as they went down the walk.\n\nAnd she spoke Harry's name last, thought Philip.\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n     \u201cO see ye not yon narrow road\n     So thick beset wi' thorns and briers?\n     That is the Path of Righteousness,\n     Though after it but few inquires.\n\n     \u201cAnd see ye not yon braid, braid road,\n     That lies across the lily leven?\n     That is the Path of Wickedness,\n     Though some call it the road to Heaven.\u201d\n\n     Thomas the Rhymer.\n\nPhillip and Harry reached New York in very different states of mind.\nHarry was buoyant. He found a letter from Col. Sellers urging him to go\nto Washington and confer with Senator Dilworthy. The petition was in his\nhands.\n\nIt had been signed by everybody of any importance in Missouri, and would\nbe presented immediately.\n\n\u201cI should go on myself,\u201d wrote the Colonel, \u201cbut I am engaged in the\ninvention of a process for lighting such a city as St. Louis by means\nof water; just attach my machine to the water-pipes anywhere and the\ndecomposition of the fluid begins, and you will have floods of light for\nthe mere cost of the machine. I've nearly got the lighting part, but I\nwant to attach to it a heating, cooking, washing and ironing\napparatus. It's going to be the great thing, but we'd better keep this\nappropriation going while I am perfecting it.\u201d\n\nHarry took letters to several congressmen from his uncle and from Mr.\nDuff Brown, each of whom had an extensive acquaintance in both houses\nwhere they were well known as men engaged in large private operations\nfor the public good and men, besides, who, in the slang of the day,\nunderstood the virtues of \u201caddition, division and silence.\u201d\n\nSenator Dilworthy introduced the petition into the Senate with the\nremark that he knew, personally, the signers of it, that they were\nmen interested, it was true, in the improvement of the country, but\nhe believed without any selfish motive, and that so far as he knew the\nsigners were loyal. It pleased him to see upon the roll the names of\nmany colored citizens, and it must rejoice every friend of humanity to\nknow that this lately emancipated race were intelligently taking part\nin the development of the resources of their native land. He moved the\nreference of the petition to the proper committee.\n\nSenator Dilworthy introduced his young friend to influential members, as\na person who was very well informed about the Salt Lick Extension of the\nPacific, and was one of the Engineers who had made a careful survey of\nColumbus River; and left him to exhibit his maps and plans and to show\nthe connection between the public treasury, the city of Napoleon and\nlegislation for the benefit off the whole country.\n\nHarry was the guest of Senator Dilworthy. There was scarcely any good\nmovement in which the Senator was not interested. His house was open to\nall the laborers in the field of total abstinence, and much of his time\nwas taken up in attending the meetings of this cause. He had a Bible\nclass in the Sunday school of the church which he attended, and he\nsuggested to Harry that he might take a class during the time he\nremained in Washington. Mr. Washington Hawkins had a class. Harry asked\nthe Senator if there was a class of young ladies for him to teach, and\nafter that the Senator did not press the subject.\n\nPhilip, if the truth must be told, was not well satisfied with his\nwestern prospects, nor altogether with the people he had fallen in with.\nThe railroad contractors held out large but rather indefinite promises.\nOpportunities for a fortune he did not doubt existed in Missouri, but\nfor himself he saw no better means for livelihood than the mastery of\nthe profession he had rather thoughtlessly entered upon. During the\nsummer he had made considerable practical advance in the science of\nengineering; he had been diligent, and made himself to a certain extent\nnecessary to the work he was engaged on. The contractors called him into\ntheir consultations frequently, as to the character of the country he\nhad been over, and the cost of constructing the road, the nature of the\nwork, etc.\n\nStill Philip felt that if he was going to make either reputation or\nmoney as an engineer, he had a great deal of hard study before him, and\nit is to his credit that he did not shrink from it. While Harry was in\nWashington dancing attendance upon the national legislature and making\nthe acquaintance of the vast lobby that encircled it, Philip devoted\nhimself day and night, with an energy and a concentration he was capable\nof, to the learning and theory of his profession, and to the science of\nrailroad building. He wrote some papers at this time for the \u201cPlow, the\nLoom and the Anvil,\u201d upon the strength of materials, and especially upon\nbridge-building, which attracted considerable attention, and were copied\ninto the English \u201cPractical Magazine.\u201d They served at any rate to raise\nPhilip in the opinion of his friends the contractors, for practical men\nhave a certain superstitious estimation of ability with the pen, and\nthough they may a little despise the talent, they are quite ready to\nmake use of it.\n\nPhilip sent copies of his performances to Ruth's father and to other\ngentlemen whose good opinion he coveted, but he did not rest upon his\nlaurels. Indeed, so diligently had he applied himself, that when it came\ntime for him to return to the West, he felt himself, at least in theory,\ncompetent to take charge of a division in the field.\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nThe capital of the Great Republic was a new world to country-bred\nWashington Hawkins. St. Louis was a greater city, but its floating\npopulation did not hail from great distances, and so it had the general\nfamily aspect of the permanent population; but Washington gathered its\npeople from the four winds of heaven, and so the manners, the faces and\nthe fashions there, presented a variety that was infinite. Washington\nhad never been in \u201csociety\u201d in St. Louis, and he knew nothing of the\nways of its wealthier citizens and had never inspected one of their\ndwellings. Consequently, everything in the nature of modern fashion and\ngrandeur was a new and wonderful revelation to him.\n\nWashington is an interesting city to any of us. It seems to become more\nand more interesting the oftener we visit it. Perhaps the reader has\nnever been there? Very well. You arrive either at night, rather too late\nto do anything or see anything until morning, or you arrive so early in\nthe morning that you consider it best to go to your hotel and sleep an\nhour or two while the sun bothers along over the Atlantic. You cannot\nwell arrive at a pleasant intermediate hour, because the railway\ncorporation that keeps the keys of the only door that leads into the\ntown or out of it take care of that. You arrive in tolerably good\nspirits, because it is only thirty-eight miles from Baltimore to the\ncapital, and so you have only been insulted three times (provided you\nare not in a sleeping car--the average is higher there): once when you\nrenewed your ticket after stopping over in Baltimore; once when you were\nabout to enter the \u201cladies' car\u201d without knowing it was a lady's car;\nand once when you asked the conductor at what hour you would reach\nWashington.\n\nYou are assailed by a long rank of hackmen who shake their whips in your\nface as you step out upon the sidewalk; you enter what they regard as a\n\u201ccarriage,\u201d in the capital, and you wonder why they do not take it out\nof service and put it in the museum: we have few enough antiquities, and\nit is little to our credit that we make scarcely any effort to preserve\nthe few we have.\n\nYou reach your hotel, presently--and here let us draw the curtain of\ncharity--because of course you have gone to the wrong one. You being a\nstranger, how could you do otherwise? There are a hundred and eighteen\nbad hotels, and only one good one. The most renowned and popular hotel\nof them all is perhaps the worst one known to history.\n\nIt is winter, and night. When you arrived, it was snowing. When you\nreached the hotel, it was sleeting. When you went to bed, it was\nraining. During the night it froze hard, and the wind blew some chimneys\ndown. When you got up in the morning, it was foggy. When you finished\nyour breakfast at ten o'clock and went out, the sunshine was brilliant,\nthe weather balmy and delicious, and the mud and slush deep and\nall-pervading. You will like the climate when you get used to it.\n\nYou naturally wish to view the city; so you take an umbrella, an\novercoat, and a fan, and go forth. The prominent features you soon\nlocate and get familiar with; first you glimpse the ornamental upper\nworks of a long, snowy palace projecting above a grove of trees, and a\ntall, graceful white dome with a statue on it surmounting the palace and\npleasantly contrasting with the background of blue sky. That building is\nthe capitol; gossips will tell you that by the original estimates it was\nto cost $12,000,000, and that the government did come within $21,200,000\nof building it for that sum.\n\nYou stand at the back of the capitol to treat yourself to a view, and it\nis a very noble one. You understand, the capitol stands upon the verge\nof a high piece of table land, a fine commanding position, and its front\nlooks out over this noble situation for a city--but it don't see it,\nfor the reason that when the capitol extension was decided upon, the\nproperty owners at once advanced their prices to such inhuman figures\nthat the people went down and built the city in the muddy low marsh\nbehind the temple of liberty; so now the lordly front of the building,\nwith, its imposing colonades, its projecting graceful wings, its\npicturesque groups of statuary, and its long terraced ranges of steps,\nflowing down in white marble waves to the ground, merely looks out upon\na sorrowful little desert of cheap boarding houses.\n\nSo you observe, that you take your view from the back of the capitol.\nAnd yet not from the airy outlooks of the dome, by the way, because to\nget there you must pass through the great rotunda: and to do that, you\nwould have to see the marvelous Historical Paintings that hang there,\nand the bas-reliefs--and what have you done that you should suffer\nthus? And besides, you might have to pass through the old part of the\nbuilding, and you could not help seeing Mr. Lincoln, as petrified by\na young lady artist for $10,000--and you might take his marble\nemancipation proclamation, which he holds out in his hand and\ncontemplates, for a folded napkin; and you might conceive from his\nexpression and his attitude, that he is finding fault with the washing.\nWhich is not the case. Nobody knows what is the matter with him; but\neverybody feels for him. Well, you ought not to go into the dome anyhow,\nbecause it would be utterly impossible to go up there without seeing the\nfrescoes in it--and why should you be interested in the delirium tremens\nof art?\n\nThe capitol is a very noble and a very beautiful building, both within\nand without, but you need not examine it now. Still, if you greatly\nprefer going into the dome, go. Now your general glance gives you\npicturesque stretches of gleaming water, on your left, with a sail here\nand there and a lunatic asylum on shore; over beyond the water, on a\ndistant elevation, you see a squat yellow temple which your eye dwells\nupon lovingly through a blur of unmanly moisture, for it recalls your\nlost boyhood and the Parthenons done in molasses candy which made it\nblest and beautiful. Still in the distance, but on this side of the\nwater and close to its edge, the Monument to the Father of his Country\ntowers out of the mud--sacred soil is the customary term. It has the\naspect of a factory chimney with the top broken off. The skeleton of a\ndecaying scaffolding lingers about its summit, and tradition says that\nthe spirit of Washington often comes down and sits on those rafters to\nenjoy this tribute of respect which the nation has reared as the symbol\nof its unappeasable gratitude.\n\nThe Monument is to be finished, some day, and at that time our\nWashington will have risen still higher in the nation's veneration,\nand will be known as the Great-Great-Grandfather of his Country. The\nmemorial Chimney stands in a quiet pastoral locality that is full of\nreposeful expression. With a glass you can see the cow-sheds about its\nbase, and the contented sheep nimbling pebbles in the desert solitudes\nthat surround it, and the tired pigs dozing in the holy calm of its\nprotecting shadow.\n\nNow you wrench your gaze loose, and you look down in front of you and\nsee the broad Pennsylvania Avenue stretching straight ahead for a mile\nor more till it brings up against the iron fence in front of a pillared\ngranite pile, the Treasury building-an edifice that would command\nrespect in any capital. The stores and hotels that wall in this broad\navenue are mean, and cheap, and dingy, and are better left without\ncomment. Beyond the Treasury is a fine large white barn, with wide\nunhandsome grounds about it. The President lives there. It is ugly\nenough outside, but that is nothing to what it is inside. Dreariness,\nflimsiness, bad taste reduced to mathematical completeness is what the\ninside offers to the eye, if it remains yet what it always has been.\n\nThe front and right hand views give you the city at large. It is a\nwide stretch of cheap little brick houses, with here and there a\nnoble architectural pile lifting itself out of the midst--government\nbuildings, these. If the thaw is still going on when you come down and\ngo about town, you will wonder at the short-sightedness of the city\nfathers, when you come to inspect the streets, in that they do not\ndilute the mud a little more and use them for canals.\n\nIf you inquire around a little, you will find that there are more\nboardinghouses to the square acre in Washington than there are in any\nother city in the land, perhaps. If you apply for a home in one of them,\nit will seem odd to you to have the landlady inspect you with a severe\neye and then ask you if you are a member of Congress. Perhaps, just as\na pleasantry, you will say yes. And then she will tell you that she is\n\u201cfull.\u201d Then you show her her advertisement in the morning paper, and\nthere she stands, convicted and ashamed. She will try to blush, and it\nwill be only polite in you to take the effort for the deed. She shows\nyou her rooms, now, and lets you take one--but she makes you pay in\nadvance for it. That is what you will get for pretending to be a member\nof Congress. If you had been content to be merely a private citizen,\nyour trunk would have been sufficient security for your board. If you\nare curious and inquire into this thing, the chances are that your\nlandlady will be ill-natured enough to say that the person and property\nof a Congressman are exempt from arrest or detention, and that with the\ntears in her eyes she has seen several of the people's representatives\nwalk off to their several States and Territories carrying her\nunreceipted board bills in their pockets for keepsakes. And before you\nhave been in Washington many weeks you will be mean enough to believe\nher, too.\n\nOf course you contrive to see everything and find out everything. And\none of the first and most startling things you find out is, that every\nindividual you encounter in the City of Washington almost--and certainly\nevery separate and distinct individual in the public employment, from\nthe highest bureau chief, clear down to the maid who scrubs Department\nhalls, the night watchmen of the public buildings and the darkey boy\nwho purifies the Department spittoons--represents Political Influence.\nUnless you can get the ear of a Senator, or a Congressman, or a Chief of\na Bureau or Department, and persuade him to use his \u201cinfluence\u201d in\nyour behalf, you cannot get an employment of the most trivial nature in\nWashington. Mere merit, fitness and capability, are useless baggage to\nyou without \u201cinfluence.\u201d The population of Washington consists pretty\nmuch entirely of government employees and the people who board them.\nThere are thousands of these employees, and they have gathered there\nfrom every corner of the Union and got their berths through the\nintercession (command is nearer the word) of the Senators and\nRepresentatives of their respective States. It would be an odd\ncircumstance to see a girl get employment at three or four dollars a\nweek in one of the great public cribs without any political grandee to\nback her, but merely because she was worthy, and competent, and a good\ncitizen of a free country that \u201ctreats all persons alike.\u201d Washington\nwould be mildly thunderstruck at such a thing as that. If you are a\nmember of Congress, (no offence,) and one of your constituents who\ndoesn't know anything, and does not want to go into the bother of\nlearning something, and has no money, and no employment, and can't earn\na living, comes besieging you for help, do you say, \u201cCome, my friend,\nif your services were valuable you could get employment elsewhere--don't\nwant you here?\u201d Oh, no: You take him to a Department and say, \u201cHere,\ngive this person something to pass away the time at--and a salary\u201d--and\nthe thing is done. You throw him on his country. He is his country's\nchild, let his country support him. There is something good and motherly\nabout Washington, the grand old benevolent National Asylum for the\nHelpless.\n\nThe wages received by this great hive of employees are placed at the\nliberal figure meet and just for skilled and competent labor. Such of\nthem as are immediately employed about the two Houses of Congress, are\nnot only liberally paid also, but are remembered in the customary\nExtra Compensation bill which slides neatly through, annually, with\nthe general grab that signalizes the last night of a session, and thus\ntwenty per cent. is added to their wages, for--for fun, no doubt.\n\nWashington Hawkins' new life was an unceasing delight to him.\nSenator Dilworthy lived sumptuously, and Washington's quarters were\ncharming--gas; running water, hot and cold; bath-room, coal-fires, rich\ncarpets, beautiful pictures on the walls; books on religion, temperance,\npublic charities and financial schemes; trim colored servants, dainty\nfood--everything a body could wish for. And as for stationery, there\nwas no end to it; the government furnished it; postage stamps were not\nneeded--the Senator's frank could convey a horse through the mails, if\nnecessary.\n\nAnd then he saw such dazzling company. Renowned generals and admirals\nwho had seemed but colossal myths when he was in the far west, went\nin and out before him or sat at the Senator's table, solidified into\npalpable flesh and blood; famous statesmen crossed his path daily; that\nonce rare and awe-inspiring being, a Congressman, was become a common\nspectacle--a spectacle so common, indeed, that he could contemplate it\nwithout excitement, even without embarrassment; foreign ministers were\nvisible to the naked eye at happy intervals; he had looked upon the\nPresident himself, and lived. And more; this world of enchantment teemed\nwith speculation--the whole atmosphere was thick with it--and that\nindeed was Washington Hawkins' native air; none other refreshed his\nlungs so gratefully. He had found paradise at last.\n\nThe more he saw of his chief the Senator, the more he honored him, and\nthe more conspicuously the moral grandeur of his character appeared to\nstand out. To possess the friendship and the kindly interest of such a\nman, Washington said in a letter to Louise, was a happy fortune for a\nyoung man whose career had been so impeded and so clouded as his.\n\nThe weeks drifted by;--Harry Brierly flirted, danced, added lustre\nto the brilliant Senatorial receptions, and diligently \u201cbuzzed\u201d and\n\u201cbutton-holed\u201d Congressmen in the interest of the Columbus River scheme;\nmeantime Senator Dilworthy labored hard in the same interest--and in\nothers of equal national importance. Harry wrote frequently to Sellers,\nand always encouragingly; and from these letters it was easy to see that\nHarry was a pet with all Washington, and was likely to carry the thing\nthrough; that the assistance rendered him by \u201cold Dilworthy\u201d was pretty\nfair--pretty fair; \u201cand every little helps, you know,\u201d said Harry.\n\nWashington wrote Sellers officially, now and then. In one of his letters\nit appeared that whereas no member of the House committee favored the\nscheme at first, there was now needed but one more vote to compass a\nmajority report. Closing sentence:\n\n\u201cProvidence seems to further our efforts.\u201d (Signed,) \u201cABNER DILWORTHY,\nU. S. S.,\n\nper WASHINGTON HAWKINS, P. S.\u201d\n\nAt the end of a week, Washington was able to send the happy news,\nofficially, as usual,--that the needed vote had been added and the bill\nfavorably reported from the Committee. Other letters recorded its perils\nin Committee of the whole, and by and by its victory, by just the skin\nof its teeth, on third reading and final passage. Then came letters\ntelling of Mr. Dilworthy's struggles with a stubborn majority in his own\nCommittee in the Senate; of how these gentlemen succumbed, one by one,\ntill a majority was secured.\n\nThen there was a hiatus. Washington watched every move on the board,\nand he was in a good position to do this, for he was clerk of this\ncommittee, and also one other. He received no salary as private\nsecretary, but these two clerkships, procured by his benefactor, paid\nhim an aggregate of twelve dollars a day, without counting the twenty\npercent extra compensation which would of course be voted to him on the\nlast night of the session.\n\nHe saw the bill go into Committee of the whole and struggle for its life\nagain, and finally worry through. In the fullness of time he noted its\nsecond reading, and by and by the day arrived when the grand ordeal\ncame, and it was put upon its final passage. Washington listened with\nbated breath to the \u201cAye!\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cAye!\u201d of the voters, for a few\ndread minutes, and then could bear the suspense no longer. He ran down\nfrom the gallery and hurried home to wait.\n\nAt the end of two or three hours the Senator arrived in the bosom of\nhis family, and dinner was waiting. Washington sprang forward, with the\neager question on his lips, and the Senator said:\n\n\u201cWe may rejoice freely, now, my son--Providence has crowned our efforts\nwith success.\u201d\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nWashington sent grand good news to Col. Sellers that night. To Louise he\nwrote:\n\n\u201cIt is beautiful to hear him talk when his heart is full of thankfulness\nfor some manifestation of the Divine favor. You shall know him, some day\nmy Louise, and knowing him you will honor him, as I do.\u201d\n\nHarry wrote:\n\n\u201cI pulled it through, Colonel, but it was a tough job, there is no\nquestion about that. There was not a friend to the measure in the House\ncommittee when I began, and not a friend in the Senate committee except\nold Dil himself, but they were all fixed for a majority report when I\nhauled off my forces. Everybody here says you can't get a thing like\nthis through Congress without buying committees for straight-out cash on\ndelivery, but I think I've taught them a thing or two--if I could only\nmake them believe it. When I tell the old residenters that this thing\nwent through without buying a vote or making a promise, they say,\n'That's rather too thin.' And when I say thin or not thin it's a fact,\nanyway, they say, 'Come, now, but do you really believe that?' and when\nI say I don't believe anything about it, I know it, they smile and\nsay, 'Well, you are pretty innocent, or pretty blind, one or the\nother--there's no getting around that.' Why they really do believe that\nvotes have been bought--they do indeed. But let them keep on thinking\nso. I have found out that if a man knows how to talk to women, and has\na little gift in the way of argument with men, he can afford to play for\nan appropriation against a money bag and give the money bag odds in\nthe game. We've raked in $200,000 of Uncle Sam's money, say what they\nwill--and there is more where this came from, when we want it, and I\nrather fancy I am the person that can go in and occupy it, too, if I do\nsay it myself, that shouldn't, perhaps. I'll be with you within a week.\nScare up all the men you can, and put them to work at once. When I get\nthere I propose to make things hum.\u201d\n\nThe great news lifted Sellers into the clouds. He went to work on the\ninstant. He flew hither and thither making contracts, engaging men, and\nsteeping his soul in the ecstasies of business. He was the happiest man\nin Missouri. And Louise was the happiest woman; for presently came a\nletter from Washington which said:\n\n\u201cRejoice with me, for the long agony is over! We have waited patiently\nand faithfully, all these years, and now at last the reward is at hand.\nA man is to pay our family $40,000 for the Tennessee Land! It is but a\nlittle sum compared to what we could get by waiting, but I do so long\nto see the day when I can call you my own, that I have said to myself,\nbetter take this and enjoy life in a humble way than wear out our best\ndays in this miserable separation. Besides, I can put this money into\noperations here that will increase it a hundred fold, yes, a thousand\nfold, in a few months. The air is full of such chances, and I know our\nfamily would consent in a moment that I should put in their shares with\nmine. Without a doubt we shall be worth half a million dollars in a year\nfrom this time--I put it at the very lowest figure, because it is\nalways best to be on the safe side--half a million at the very lowest\ncalculation, and then your father will give his consent and we can marry\nat last. Oh, that will be a glorious day. Tell our friends the good\nnews--I want all to share it.\u201d\n\nAnd she did tell her father and mother, but they said, let it be\nkept still for the present. The careful father also told her to write\nWashington and warn him not to speculate with the money, but to wait a\nlittle and advise with one or two wise old heads. She did this. And she\nmanaged to keep the good news to herself, though it would seem that the\nmost careless observer might have seen by her springing step and her\nradiant countenance that some fine piece of good fortune had descended\nupon her.\n\nHarry joined the Colonel at Stone's Landing, and that dead place sprang\ninto sudden life. A swarm of men were hard at work, and the dull air\nwas filled with the cheery music of labor. Harry had been constituted\nengineer-in-general, and he threw the full strength of his powers into\nhis work. He moved among his hirelings like a king. Authority seemed to\ninvest him with a new splendor. Col. Sellers, as general superintendent\nof a great public enterprise, was all that a mere human being could\nbe--and more. These two grandees went at their imposing \u201cimprovement\u201d\n with the air of men who had been charged with the work of altering the\nfoundations of the globe.\n\nThey turned their first attention to straightening the river just above\nthe Landing, where it made a deep bend, and where the maps and plans\nshowed that the process of straightening would not only shorten distance\nbut increase the \u201cfall.\u201d They started a cut-off canal across the\npeninsula formed by the bend, and such another tearing up of the earth\nand slopping around in the mud as followed the order to the men, had\nnever been seen in that region before. There was such a panic among\nthe turtles that at the end of six hours there was not one to be found\nwithin three miles of Stone's Landing. They took the young and the aged,\nthe decrepit and the sick upon their backs and left for tide-water\nin disorderly procession, the tadpoles following and the bull-frogs\nbringing up the rear.\n\nSaturday night came, but the men were obliged to wait, because the\nappropriation had not come. Harry said he had written to hurry up the\nmoney and it would be along presently. So the work continued, on Monday.\nStone's Landing was making quite a stir in the vicinity, by this time.\nSellers threw a lot or two on the market, \u201cas a feeler,\u201d and they sold\nwell. He re-clothed his family, laid in a good stock of provisions, and\nstill had money left. He started a bank account, in a small way--and\nmentioned the deposit casually to friends; and to strangers, too; to\neverybody, in fact; but not as a new thing--on the contrary, as a matter\nof life-long standing. He could not keep from buying trifles every day\nthat were not wholly necessary, it was such a gaudy thing to get out his\nbank-book and draw a check, instead of using his old customary formula,\n\u201cCharge it!\u201d Harry sold a lot or two, also--and had a dinner party or\ntwo at Hawkeye and a general good time with the money. Both men held on\npretty strenuously for the coming big prices, however.\n\nAt the end of a month things were looking bad. Harry had besieged the\nNew York headquarters of the Columbus River Slack-water Navigation\nCompany with demands, then commands, and finally appeals, but to no\npurpose; the appropriation did not come; the letters were not even\nanswered. The workmen were clamorous, now. The Colonel and Harry retired\nto consult.\n\n\u201cWhat's to be done?\u201d said the Colonel.\n\n\u201cHang'd if I know.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompany say anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a word.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou telegraphed yesterday?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and the day before, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo answer?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone-confound them!\u201d\n\nThen there was a long pause. Finally both spoke at once:\n\n\u201cI've got it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI've got it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat's yours?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cGive the boys thirty-day orders on the Company for the back pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's it-that's my own idea to a dot. But then--but then----\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I know,\u201d said the Colonel; \u201cI know they can't wait for the orders\nto go to New York and be cashed, but what's the reason they can't get\nthem discounted in Hawkeye?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course they can. That solves the difficulty. Everybody knows the\nappropriation's been made and the Company's perfectly good.\u201d\n\nSo the orders were given and the men appeased, though they grumbled\na little at first. The orders went well enough for groceries and such\nthings at a fair discount, and the work danced along gaily for a time.\nTwo or three purchasers put up frame houses at the Landing and moved in,\nand of course a far-sighted but easy-going journeyman printer\nwandered along and started the \u201cNapoleon Weekly Telegraph and Literary\nRepository\u201d--a paper with a Latin motto from the Unabridged dictionary,\nand plenty of \u201cfat\u201d conversational tales and double-leaded poetry--all\nfor two dollars a year, strictly in advance. Of course the merchants\nforwarded the orders at once to New York--and never heard of them again.\n\nAt the end of some weeks Harry's orders were a drug in the\nmarket--nobody would take them at any discount whatever. The second\nmonth closed with a riot.--Sellers was absent at the time, and Harry\nbegan an active absence himself with the mob at his heels. But being on\nhorseback, he had the advantage. He did not tarry in Hawkeye, but went\non, thus missing several appointments with creditors. He was far on his\nflight eastward, and well out of danger when the next morning dawned. He\ntelegraphed the Colonel to go down and quiet the laborers--he was\nbound east for money--everything would be right in a week--tell the men\nso--tell them to rely on him and not be afraid.\n\nSellers found the mob quiet enough when he reached the Landing. They\nhad gutted the Navigation office, then piled the beautiful engraved\nstock-books and things in the middle of the floor and enjoyed the\nbonfire while it lasted. They had a liking for the Colonel, but still\nthey had some idea of hanging him, as a sort of make-shift that might\nanswer, after a fashion, in place of more satisfactory game.\n\nBut they made the mistake of waiting to hear what he had to say first.\nWithin fifteen minutes his tongue had done its work and they were all\nrich men.--He gave every one of them a lot in the suburbs of the city of\nStone's Landing, within a mile and a half of the future post office and\nrailway station, and they promised to resume work as soon as Harry got\neast and started the money along. Now things were blooming and pleasant\nagain, but the men had no money, and nothing to live on. The Colonel\ndivided with them the money he still had in bank--an act which had\nnothing surprising about it because he was generally ready to divide\nwhatever he had with anybody that wanted it, and it was owing to this\nvery trait that his family spent their days in poverty and at times were\npinched with famine.\n\nWhen the men's minds had cooled and Sellers was gone, they hated\nthemselves for letting him beguile them with fine speeches, but it\nwas too late, now--they agreed to hang him another time--such time as\nProvidence should appoint.\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nRumors of Ruth's frivolity and worldliness at Fallkill traveled to\nPhiladelphia in due time, and occasioned no little undertalk among the\nBolton relatives.\n\nHannah Shoecraft told another cousin that, for her part, she never\nbelieved that Ruth had so much more \u201cmind\u201d than other people; and Cousin\nHulda added that she always thought Ruth was fond of admiration, and\nthat was the reason she was unwilling to wear plain clothes and attend\nMeeting. The story that Ruth was \u201cengaged\u201d to a young gentleman of\nfortune in Fallkill came with the other news, and helped to give point\nto the little satirical remarks that went round about Ruth's desire to\nbe a doctor!\n\nMargaret Bolton was too wise to be either surprised or alarmed by these\nrumors. They might be true; she knew a woman's nature too well to\nthink them improbable, but she also knew how steadfast Ruth was in her\npurposes, and that, as a brook breaks into ripples and eddies and dances\nand sports by the way, and yet keeps on to the sea, it was in Ruth's\nnature to give back cheerful answer to the solicitations of friendliness\nand pleasure, to appear idly delaying even, and sporting in the\nsunshine, while the current of her resolution flowed steadily on.\n\nThat Ruth had this delight in the mere surface play of life that she\ncould, for instance, be interested in that somewhat serious by-play\ncalled \u201cflirtation,\u201d or take any delight in the exercise of those\nlittle arts of pleasing and winning which are none the less genuine and\ncharming because they are not intellectual, Ruth, herself, had never\nsuspected until she went to Fallkill. She had believed it her duty to\nsubdue her gaiety of temperament, and let nothing divert her from what\nare called serious pursuits: In her limited experience she brought\neverything to the judgment of her own conscience, and settled the\naffairs of all the world in her own serene judgment hall. Perhaps her\nmother saw this, and saw also that there was nothing in the Friends'\nsociety to prevent her from growing more and more opinionated.\n\nWhen Ruth returned to Philadelphia, it must be confessed--though it\nwould not have been by her--that a medical career did seem a little less\nnecessary for her than formerly; and coming back in a glow of triumph,\nas it were, and in the consciousness of the freedom and life in a lively\nsociety and in new and sympathetic friendship, she anticipated pleasure\nin an attempt to break up the stiffness and levelness of the society\nat home, and infusing into it something of the motion and sparkle which\nwere so agreeable at Fallkill. She expected visits from her new friends,\nshe would have company, the new books and the periodicals about which\nall the world was talking, and, in short, she would have life.\n\nFor a little while she lived in this atmosphere which she had brought\nwith her. Her mother was delighted with this change in her, with\nthe improvement in her health and the interest she exhibited in home\naffairs. Her father enjoyed the society of his favorite daughter as he\ndid few things besides; he liked her mirthful and teasing ways, and\nnot less a keen battle over something she had read. He had been a great\nreader all his life, and a remarkable memory had stored his mind with\nencyclopaedic information. It was one of Ruth's delights to cram herself\nwith some out of the way subject and endeavor to catch her father; but\nshe almost always failed. Mr. Bolton liked company, a house full of it,\nand the mirth of young people, and he would have willingly entered\ninto any revolutionary plans Ruth might have suggested in relation to\nFriends' society.\n\nBut custom and the fixed order are stronger than the most enthusiastic\nand rebellious young lady, as Ruth very soon found. In spite of all\nher brave efforts, her frequent correspondence, and her determined\nanimation, her books and her music, she found herself settling into the\nclutches of the old monotony, and as she realized the hopelessness of\nher endeavors, the medical scheme took new hold of her, and seemed to\nher the only method of escape.\n\n\u201cMother, thee does not know how different it is in Fallkill, how much\nmore interesting the people are one meets, how much more life there is.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut thee will find the world, child, pretty much all the same, when\nthee knows it better. I thought once as thee does now, and had as little\nthought of being a Friend as thee has. Perhaps when thee has seen more,\nthee will better appreciate a quiet life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThee married young. I shall not marry young, and perhaps not at all,\u201d\n said Ruth, with a look of vast experience.\n\n\u201cPerhaps thee doesn't know thee own mind; I have known persons of thy\nage who did not. Did thee see anybody whom thee would like to live with\nalways in Fallkill?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot always,\u201d replied Ruth with a little laugh. \u201cMother, I think I\nwouldn't say 'always' to any one until I have a profession and am as\nindependent as he is. Then my love would be a free act, and not in any\nway a necessity.\u201d\n\nMargaret Bolton smiled at this new-fangled philosophy. \u201cThee will find\nthat love, Ruth, is a thing thee won't reason about, when it comes,\nnor make any bargains about. Thee wrote that Philip Sterling was at\nFallkill.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and Henry Brierly, a friend of his; a very amusing young fellow\nand not so serious-minded as Philip, but a bit of a fop maybe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd thee preferred the fop to the serious-minded?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn't prefer anybody; but Henry Brierly was good company, which\nPhilip wasn't always.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid thee know thee father had been in correspondence with Philip?\u201d\n\nRuth looked up surprised and with a plain question in her eyes.\n\n\u201cOh, it's not about thee.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d and if there was any shade of disappointment in her tone,\nprobably Ruth herself did not know it.\n\n\u201cIt's about some land up in the country. That man Bigler has got father\ninto another speculation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat odious man! Why will father have anything to do with him? Is it\nthat railroad?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Father advanced money and took land as security, and whatever has\ngone with the money and the bonds, he has on his hands a large tract of\nwild land.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what has Philip to do with that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has good timber, if it could ever be got out, and father says that\nthere must be coal in it; it's in a coal region. He wants Philip to\nsurvey it, and examine it for indications of coal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's another of father's fortunes, I suppose,\u201d said Ruth. \u201cHe has put\naway so many fortunes for us that I'm afraid we never shall find them.\u201d\n\nRuth was interested in it nevertheless, and perhaps mainly because\nPhilip was to be connected with the enterprise. Mr. Bigler came to\ndinner with her father next day, and talked a great deal about Mr.\nBolton's magnificent tract of land, extolled the sagacity that led him\nto secure such a property, and led the talk along to another railroad\nwhich would open a northern communication to this very land.\n\n\u201cPennybacker says it's full of coal, he's no doubt of it, and a railroad\nto strike the Erie would make it a fortune.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuppose you take the land and work the thing up, Mr. Bigler; you may\nhave the tract for three dollars an acre.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou'd throw it away, then,\u201d replied Mr. Bigler, \u201cand I'm not the man to\ntake advantage of a friend. But if you'll put a mortgage on it for the\nnorthern road, I wouldn't mind taking an interest, if Pennybacker is\nwilling; but Pennybacker, you know, don't go much on land, he sticks to\nthe legislature.\u201d And Mr. Bigler laughed.\n\nWhen Mr. Bigler had gone, Ruth asked her father about Philip's\nconnection with the land scheme.\n\n\u201cThere's nothing definite,\u201d said Mr. Bolton. \u201cPhilip is showing aptitude\nfor his profession. I hear the best reports of him in New York, though\nthose sharpers don't intend to do anything but use him. I've written and\noffered him employment in surveying and examining the land. We want to\nknow what it is. And if there is anything in it that his enterprise can\ndig out, he shall have an interest. I should be glad to give the young\nfellow a lift.\u201d\n\nAll his life Eli Bolton had been giving young fellows a lift, and\nshouldering the loses when things turned out unfortunately. His ledger,\ntake-it-altogether, would not show a balance on the right side; but\nperhaps the losses on his books will turn out to be credits in a world\nwhere accounts are kept on a different basis. The left hand of the\nledger will appear the right, looked at from the other side.\n\nPhilip, wrote to Ruth rather a comical account of the bursting up of\nthe city of Napoleon and the navigation improvement scheme, of Harry's\nflight and the Colonel's discomfiture. Harry left in such a hurry that\nhe hadn't even time to bid Miss Laura Hawkins good-bye, but he had no\ndoubt that Harry would console himself with the next pretty face he\nsaw--a remark which was thrown in for Ruth's benefit. Col. Sellers\nhad in all probability, by this time, some other equally brilliant\nspeculation in his brain.\n\nAs to the railroad, Philip had made up his mind that it was merely kept\non foot for speculative purposes in Wall street, and he was about to\nquit it. Would Ruth be glad to hear, he wondered, that he was coming\nEast? For he was coming, in spite of a letter from Harry in New York,\nadvising him to hold on until he had made some arrangements in regard\nto contracts, he to be a little careful about Sellers, who was somewhat\nvisionary, Harry said.\n\nThe summer went on without much excitement for Ruth. She kept up a\ncorrespondence with Alice, who promised a visit in the fall, she read,\nshe earnestly tried to interest herself in home affairs and such people\nas came to the house; but she found herself falling more and more\ninto reveries, and growing weary of things as they were. She felt\nthat everybody might become in time like two relatives from a Shaker\nestablishment in Ohio, who visited the Boltons about this time, a father\nand son, clad exactly alike, and alike in manners. The son; however, who\nwas not of age, was more unworldly and sanctimonious than his father;\nhe always addressed his parent as \u201cBrother Plum,\u201d and bore himself,\naltogether in such a superior manner that Ruth longed to put bent\npins in his chair. Both father and son wore the long, single breasted\ncollarless coats of their society, without buttons, before or behind,\nbut with a row of hooks and eyes on either side in front. It was Ruth's\nsuggestion that the coats would be improved by a single hook and eye\nsewed on in the small of the back where the buttons usually are.\n\nAmusing as this Shaker caricature of the Friends was, it oppressed Ruth\nbeyond measure; and increased her feeling of being stifled.\n\nIt was a most unreasonable feeling. No home could be pleasanter than\nRuth's. The house, a little out of the city; was one of those elegant\ncountry residences which so much charm visitors to the suburbs of\nPhiladelphia. A modern dwelling and luxurious in everything that wealth\ncould suggest for comfort, it stood in the midst of exquisitely kept\nlawns, with groups of trees, parterres of flowers massed in colors, with\ngreenhouse, grapery and garden; and on one side, the garden sloped away\nin undulations to a shallow brook that ran over a pebbly bottom and sang\nunder forest trees. The country about was the perfection of cultivated\nlandscape, dotted with cottages, and stately mansions of Revolutionary\ndate, and sweet as an English country-side, whether seen in the soft\nbloom of May or in the mellow ripeness of late October.\n\nIt needed only the peace of the mind within, to make it a paradise. One\nriding by on the Old Germantown road, and seeing a young girl swinging\nin the hammock on the piazza and, intent upon some volume of old poetry\nor the latest novel, would no doubt have envied a life so idyllic. He\ncould not have imagined that the young girl was reading a volume of\nreports of clinics and longing to be elsewhere.\n\nRuth could not have been more discontented if all the wealth about her\nhad been as unsubstantial as a dream. Perhaps she so thought it.\n\n\u201cI feel,\u201d she once said to her father, \u201cas if I were living in a house\nof cards.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd thee would like to turn it into a hospital?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. But tell me father,\u201d continued Ruth, not to be put off, \u201cis thee\nstill going on with that Bigler and those other men who come here and\nentice thee?\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton smiled, as men do when they talk with women about \u201cbusiness\u201d.\n\u201cSuch men have their uses, Ruth. They keep the world active, and I owe a\ngreat many of my best operations to such men. Who knows, Ruth, but this\nnew land purchase, which I confess I yielded a little too much to Bigler\nin, may not turn out a fortune for thee and the rest of the children?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, father, thee sees every thing in a rose-colored light. I do believe\nthee wouldn't have so readily allowed me to begin the study of medicine,\nif it hadn't had the novelty of an experiment to thee.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd is thee satisfied with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf thee means, if I have had enough of it, no. I just begin to see what\nI can do in it, and what a noble profession it is for a woman. Would\nthee have me sit here like a bird on a bough and wait for somebody to\ncome and put me in a cage?\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton was not sorry to divert the talk from his own affairs, and\nhe did not think it worth while to tell his family of a performance that\nvery day which was entirely characteristic of him.\n\nRuth might well say that she felt as if she were living in a house of\ncards, although the Bolton household had no idea of the number of perils\nthat hovered over them, any more than thousands of families in America\nhave of the business risks and contingences upon which their prosperity\nand luxury hang.\n\nA sudden call upon Mr. Bolton for a large sum of money, which must be\nforthcoming at once, had found him in the midst of a dozen ventures,\nfrom no one of which a dollar could be realized. It was in vain that he\napplied to his business acquaintances and friends; it was a period\nof sudden panic and no money. \u201cA hundred thousand! Mr. Bolton,\u201d said\nPlumly. \u201cGood God, if you should ask me for ten, I shouldn't know where\nto get it.\u201d\n\nAnd yet that day Mr. Small (Pennybacker, Bigler and Small) came to Mr.\nBolton with a piteous story of ruin in a coal operation, if he could\nnot raise ten thousand dollars. Only ten, and he was sure of a fortune.\nWithout it he was a beggar. Mr. Bolton had already Small's notes for a\nlarge amount in his safe, labeled \u201cdoubtful;\u201d he had helped him again\nand again, and always with the same result. But Mr. Small spoke with a\nfaltering voice of his family, his daughter in school, his wife ignorant\nof his calamity, and drew such a picture of their agony, that Mr. Bolton\nput by his own more pressing necessity, and devoted the day to scraping\ntogether, here and there, ten thousand dollars for this brazen beggar,\nwho had never kept a promise to him nor paid a debt.\n\nBeautiful credit! The foundation of modern society. Who shall say that\nthis is not the golden age of mutual trust, of unlimited reliance upon\nhuman promises? That is a peculiar condition of society which enables\na whole nation to instantly recognize point and meaning in the familiar\nnewspaper anecdote, which puts into the mouth of a distinguished\nspeculator in lands and mines this remark:--\u201cI wasn't worth a cent two\nyears ago, and now I owe two millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nIt was a hard blow to poor Sellers to see the work on his darling\nenterprise stop, and the noise and bustle and confusion that had been\nsuch refreshment to his soul, sicken and die out. It was hard to come\ndown to humdrum ordinary life again after being a General Superintendent\nand the most conspicuous man in the community. It was sad to see his\nname disappear from the newspapers; sadder still to see it resurrected\nat intervals, shorn of its aforetime gaudy gear of compliments and\nclothed on with rhetorical tar and feathers.\n\nBut his friends suffered more on his account than he did. He was a cork\nthat could not be kept under the water many moments at a time.\n\nHe had to bolster up his wife's spirits every now and then. On one of\nthese occasions he said:\n\n\u201cIt's all right, my dear, all right; it will all come right in a little\nwhile. There's $200,000 coming, and that will set things booming again:\nHarry seems to be having some difficulty, but that's to be expected--you\ncan't move these big operations to the tune of Fisher's Hornpipe, you\nknow. But Harry will get it started along presently, and then you'll\nsee! I expect the news every day now.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Beriah, you've been expecting it every day, all along, haven't\nyou?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes; yes--I don't know but I have. But anyway, the longer it's\ndelayed, the nearer it grows to the time when it will start--same as\nevery day you live brings you nearer to--nearer--\u201d\n\n\u201cThe grave?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, no--not that exactly; but you can't understand these things,\nPolly dear--women haven't much head for business, you know. You make\nyourself perfectly comfortable, old lady, and you'll see how we'll trot\nthis right along. Why bless you, let the appropriation lag, if it wants\nto--that's no great matter--there's a bigger thing than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBigger than $200,000, Beriah?\u201d\n\n\u201cBigger, child?--why, what's $200,000? Pocket money! Mere pocket money!\nLook at the railroad! Did you forget the railroad? It ain't many months\ntill spring; it will be coming right along, and the railroad swimming\nright along behind it. Where'll it be by the middle of summer? Just stop\nand fancy a moment--just think a little--don't anything suggest itself?\nBless your heart, you dear women live right in the present all the\ntime--but a man, why a man lives----\n\n\u201cIn the future, Beriah? But don't we live in the future most too much,\nBeriah? We do somehow seem to manage to live on next year's crop of corn\nand potatoes as a general thing while this year is still dragging along,\nbut sometimes it's not a robust diet,--Beriah. But don't look that\nway, dear--don't mind what I say. I don't mean to fret, I don't mean to\nworry; and I don't, once a month, do I, dear? But when I get a little\nlow and feel bad, I get a bit troubled and worrisome, but it don't mean\nanything in the world. It passes right away. I know you're doing all\nyou can, and I don't want to seem repining and ungrateful--for I'm not,\nBeriah--you know I'm not, don't you?\u201d\n\n\u201cLord bless you, child, I know you are the very best little woman that\never lived--that ever lived on the whole face of the Earth! And I know\nthat I would be a dog not to work for you and think for you and\nscheme for you with all my might. And I'll bring things all right yet,\nhoney--cheer up and don't you fear. The railroad----\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I had forgotten the railroad, dear, but when a body gets blue, a\nbody forgets everything. Yes, the railroad--tell me about the railroad.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha, my girl, don't you see? Things ain't so dark, are they? Now I\ndidn't forget the railroad. Now just think for a moment--just figure up\na little on the future dead moral certainties. For instance, call this\nwaiter St. Louis.\n\n\u201cAnd we'll lay this fork (representing the railroad) from St. Louis to\nthis potato, which is Slouchburg:\n\n\u201cThen with this carving knife we'll continue the railroad from\nSlouchburg to Doodleville, shown by the black pepper:\n\n\u201cThen we run along the--yes--the comb--to the tumbler that's Brimstone:\n\n\u201cThence by the pipe to Belshazzar, which is the salt-cellar:\n\n\u201cThence to, to--that quill--Catfish--hand me the pincushion, Marie\nAntoinette:\n\n\u201cThence right along these shears to this horse, Babylon:\n\n\u201cThen by the spoon to Bloody Run--thank you, the ink:\n\n\u201cThence to Hail Columbia--snuffers, Polly, please move that cup and\nsaucer close up, that's Hail Columbia:\n\n\u201cThen--let me open my knife--to Hark-from-the-Tomb, where we'll put\nthe candle-stick--only a little distance from Hail Columbia to\nHark-from-the-Tomb--down-grade all the way.\n\n\u201cAnd there we strike Columbus River--pass me two or three skeins of\nthread to stand for the river; the sugar bowl will do for Hawkeye, and\nthe rat trap for Stone's Landing--Napoleon, I mean--and you can see how\nmuch better Napoleon is located than Hawkeye. Now here you are with your\nrailroad complete, and showing its continuation to Hallelujah and thence\nto Corruptionville.\n\n\u201cNow then--there you are! It's a beautiful road, beautiful. Jeff\nThompson can out-engineer any civil engineer that ever sighted through\nan aneroid, or a theodolite, or whatever they call it--he calls it\nsometimes one and sometimes the other just whichever levels off his\nsentence neatest, I reckon. But ain't it a ripping road, though? I tell\nyou, it'll make a stir when it gets along. Just see what a country it\ngoes through. There's your onions at Slouchburg--noblest onion country\nthat graces God's footstool; and there's your turnip country all around\nDoodleville--bless my life, what fortunes are going to be made there\nwhen they get that contrivance perfected for extracting olive oil out of\nturnips--if there's any in them; and I reckon there is, because Congress\nhas made an appropriation of money to test the thing, and they wouldn't\nhave done that just on conjecture, of course. And now we come to the\nBrimstone region--cattle raised there till you can't rest--and corn, and\nall that sort of thing. Then you've got a little stretch along through\nBelshazzar that don't produce anything now--at least nothing but\nrocks--but irrigation will fetch it. Then from Catfish to Babylon it's\na little swampy, but there's dead loads of peat down under there\nsomewhere. Next is the Bloody Run and Hail Columbia country--tobacco\nenough can be raised there to support two such railroads. Next is the\nsassparilla region. I reckon there's enough of that truck along in there\non the line of the pocket-knife, from Hail Columbia to Hark-from-the\nTomb to fat up all the consumptives in all the hospitals from Halifax\nto the Holy Land. It just grows like weeds! I've got a little belt of\nsassparilla land in there just tucked away unobstrusively waiting for my\nlittle Universal Expectorant to get into shape in my head. And I'll fix\nthat, you know. One of these days I'll have all the nations of the earth\nexpecto--\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Beriah, dear--\u201d\n\n\u201cDon't interrupt me; Polly--I don't want you to lose the run of the\nmap--well, take your toy-horse, James Fitz-James, if you must have\nit--and run along with you. Here, now--the soap will do for Babylon.\nLet me see--where was I? Oh yes--now we run down to Stone's\nLan--Napoleon--now we run down to Napoleon. Beautiful road. Look at\nthat, now. Perfectly straight line-straight as the way to the grave.\n\nAnd see where it leaves Hawkeye-clear out in the cold, my dear, clear\nout in the cold. That town's as bound to die as--well if I owned it I'd\nget its obituary ready, now, and notify the mourners. Polly, mark my\nwords--in three years from this, Hawkeye'll be a howling wilderness.\nYou'll see. And just look at that river--noblest stream that meanders\nover the thirsty earth!--calmest, gentlest artery that refreshes her\nweary bosom! Railroad goes all over it and all through it--wades right\nalong on stilts. Seventeen bridges in three miles and a half--forty-nine\nbridges from Hark-from-the-Tomb to Stone's Landing altogether--forty\nnine bridges, and culverts enough to culvert creation itself!\nHadn't skeins of thread enough to represent them all--but you get\nan idea--perfect trestle-work of bridges for seventy two miles: Jeff\nThompson and I fixed all that, you know; he's to get the contracts and\nI'm to put them through on the divide. Just oceans of money in those\nbridges. It's the only part of the railroad I'm interested in,--down\nalong the line--and it's all I want, too. It's enough, I should judge.\nNow here we are at Napoleon. Good enough country plenty good enough--all\nit wants is population. That's all right--that will come. And it's\nno bad country now for calmness and solitude, I can tell you--though\nthere's no money in that, of course. No money, but a man wants rest, a\nman wants peace--a man don't want to rip and tear around all the time.\nAnd here we go, now, just as straight as a string for Hallelujah--it's a\nbeautiful angle--handsome up grade all the way--and then away you go to\nCorruptionville, the gaudiest country for early carrots and cauliflowers\nthat ever--good missionary field, too. There ain't such another\nmissionary field outside the jungles of Central Africa. And\npatriotic?--why they named it after Congress itself. Oh, I warn you, my\ndear, there's a good time coming, and it'll be right along before you\nknow what you're about, too. That railroad's fetching it. You see what\nit is as far as I've got, and if I had enough bottles and soap and\nboot-jacks and such things to carry it along to where it joins onto the\nUnion Pacific, fourteen hundred miles from here, I should exhibit to\nyou in that little internal improvement a spectacle of inconceivable\nsublimity. So, don't you see? We've got the rail road to fall back\non; and in the meantime, what are we worrying about that $200,000\nappropriation for? That's all right. I'd be willing to bet anything that\nthe very next letter that comes from Harry will--\u201d\n\nThe eldest boy entered just in the nick of time and brought a letter,\nwarm from the post-office.\n\n\u201cThings do look bright, after all, Beriah. I'm sorry I was blue, but it\ndid seem as if everything had been going against us for whole ages. Open\nthe letter--open it quick, and let's know all about it before we stir\nout of our places. I am all in a fidget to know what it says.\u201d\n\nThe letter was opened, without any unnecessary delay.\n\n\n\nPart 4.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII Visit to Headquarters in Wall Street--How Appropriations\nAre Obtained and Their Cost\n\nCHAPTER XXIX Philip's Experience With the Rail--Road Conductor--Surveys\nHis Mining Property\n\nCHAPTER XXX Laura and Col Sellers Go To Washington On Invitation of\nSenator Dilworthy\n\nCHAPTER XXXI Philip and Harry at the Boltons'--Philip Seriously\nInjured--Ruth's First Case of Surgery\n\nCHAPTER XXXII Laura Becomes a Famous Belle at Washington\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII Society in Washington--The Antiques, the Parvenus, and\nthe Middle Aristocracy\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV Grand Scheme For Disposing of the Tennessee Land--Laura\nand Washington Hawkins Enjoying the Reputation of Being Millionaires\n\nCHAPTER XXXV About Senators--Their Privileges and Habits\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI An Hour in a Book Store\n\nILLUSTRATIONS\n\n91.AT HEADQUARTERS 92.TOUCHING A WEAK SPOT 93.CHAIRMAN OF\nCOMMITTEE, $10,000, 94.MALE LOBBYIST, $3,000 255 95.FEMALE LOBBYIST,\n$3,000 96.HIGH MORAL SENATOR, $3,000 97.COUNTRY MEMBER, $500\n98.DOCUMENTARY PROOF 99.COLONEL SELLERS DESPONDENT 100.TAIL PIECE\n101.THE MONARCH OF ALL HE SURVEYS 102.PHILIP THRUST FROM THE R.\nR.

The porter returned in a minute; and asked whom he would\nlike to see?\n\n\u201cThe president of the company, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is busy with some gentlemen, sir; says he will be done with them\ndirectly.\u201d\n\nThat a copper-plate card with \u201cEngineer-in-Chief\u201d on it should be\nreceived with such tranquility as this, annoyed Mr. Brierly not a\nlittle. But he had to submit. Indeed his annoyance had time to augment a\ngood deal; for he was allowed to cool his heels a full half hour in the\nante-room before those gentlemen emerged and he was ushered into the\npresence. He found a stately dignitary occupying a very official\nchair behind a long green morocco-covered table, in a room sumptuously\ncarpeted and furnished, and well garnished with pictures.\n\n\u201cGood morning, sir; take a seat--take a seat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you sir,\u201d said Harry, throwing as much chill into his manner as\nhis ruffled dignity prompted.\n\n\u201cWe perceive by your reports and the reports of the Chief\nSuperintendent, that you have been making gratifying progress with the\nwork.--We are all very much pleased.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed? We did not discover it from your letters--which we have not\nreceived; nor by the treatment our drafts have met with--which were not\nhonored; nor by the reception of any part of the appropriation, no part\nof it having come to hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, my dear Mr. Brierly, there must be some mistake, I am sure we\nwrote you and also Mr. Sellers, recently--when my clerk comes he will\nshow copies--letters informing you of the ten per cent. assessment.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, certainly, we got those letters. But what we wanted was money to\ncarry on the work--money to pay the men.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly, certainly--true enough--but we credited you both for a large\npart of your assessments--I am sure that was in our letters.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course that was in--I remember that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, very well then. Now we begin to understand each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don't see that we do. There's two months' wages due the men,\nand----\u201d\n\n\u201cHow? Haven't you paid the men?\u201d\n\n\u201cPaid them! How are we going to pay them when you don't honor our\ndrafts?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, my dear sir, I cannot see how you can find any fault with us. I\nam sure we have acted in a perfectly straight forward business way.--Now\nlet us look at the thing a moment. You subscribed for 100 shares of the\ncapital stock, at $1,000 a share, I believe?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Mr. Sellers took a like amount?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well. No concern can get along without money. We levied a ten per\ncent. assessment. It was the original understanding that you and Mr.\nSellers were to have the positions you now hold, with salaries of $600\na month each, while in active service. You were duly elected to these\nplaces, and you accepted them. Am I right?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well. You were given your instructions and put to work. By your\nreports it appears that you have expended the sum of $9,610 upon the\nsaid work. Two months salary to you two officers amounts altogether\nto $2,400--about one-eighth of your ten per cent. assessment, you see;\nwhich leaves you in debt to the company for the other seven-eighths\nof the assessment--viz, something over $8,000 apiece. Now instead of\nrequiring you to forward this aggregate of $16,000 or $17,000 to New\nYork, the company voted unanimously to let you pay it over to the\ncontractors, laborers from time to time, and give you credit on the\nbooks for it. And they did it without a murmur, too, for they were\npleased with the progress you had made, and were glad to pay you that\nlittle compliment--and a very neat one it was, too, I am sure. The\nwork you did fell short of $10,000, a trifle. Let me see--$9,640 from\n$20,000--salary $2,400 added--ah yes, the balance due the company from\nyourself and Mr. Sellers is $7,960, which I will take the responsibility\nof allowing to stand for the present, unless you prefer to draw a check\nnow, and thus----\u201d\n\n\u201cConfound it, do you mean to say that instead of the company owing us\n$2,400, we owe the company $7,960?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that we owe the men and the contractors nearly ten thousand dollars\nbesides?\u201d\n\n\u201cOwe them! Oh bless my soul, you can't mean that you have not paid these\npeople?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I do mean it!\u201d\n\nThe president rose and walked the floor like a man in bodily pain. His\nbrows contracted, he put his hand up and clasped his forehead, and kept\nsaying, \u201cOh, it is, too bad, too bad, too bad! Oh, it is bound to be\nfound out--nothing can prevent it--nothing!\u201d\n\nThen he threw himself into his chair and said:\n\n\u201cMy dear Mr. Brierson, this is dreadful--perfectly dreadful. It will\nbe found out. It is bound to tarnish the good name of the company; our\ncredit will be seriously, most seriously impaired. How could you be so\nthoughtless--the men ought to have been paid though it beggared us all!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey ought, ought they? Then why the devil--my name is not Bryerson, by\nthe way--why the mischief didn't the compa--why what in the nation\never became of the appropriation? Where is that appropriation?--if a\nstockholder may make so bold as to ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe appropriation?--that paltry $200,000, do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course--but I didn't know that $200,000 was so very paltry. Though\nI grant, of course, that it is not a large sum, strictly speaking. But\nwhere is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear sir, you surprise me. You surely cannot have had a large\nacquaintance with this sort of thing. Otherwise you would not have\nexpected much of a result from a mere INITIAL appropriation like that.\nIt was never intended for anything but a mere nest egg for the future\nand real appropriations to cluster around.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed? Well, was it a myth, or was it a reality? Whatever become of\nit?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy the--matter is simple enough. A Congressional appropriation costs\nmoney. Just reflect, for instance--a majority of the House Committee,\nsay $10,000 apiece--$40,000; a majority of the Senate Committee, the\nsame each--say $40,000; a little extra to one or two chairman of one or\ntwo such committees, say $10,000 each--$20,000; and there's $100,000\nof the money gone, to begin with. Then, seven male lobbyists, at $3,000\neach--$21,000; one female lobbyist, $10,000; a high moral Congressman\nor Senator here and there--the high moral ones cost more, because they.\ngive tone to a measure--say ten of these at $3,000 each, is $30,000;\nthen a lot of small-fry country members who won't vote for anything\nwhatever without pay--say twenty at $500 apiece, is $10,000; a lot\nof dinners to members--say $10,000 altogether; lot of jimcracks for\nCongressmen's wives and children--those go a long way--you can't spend\ntoo much money in that line--well, those things cost in a lump,\nsay $10,000--along there somewhere; and then comes your printed\ndocuments--your maps, your tinted engravings, your pamphlets, your\nilluminated show cards, your advertisements in a hundred and fifty\npapers at ever so much a line--because you've got to keep the papers all\nright or you are gone up, you know. Oh, my dear sir, printing bills\nare destruction itself. Ours so far amount to--let me see--10; 52; 22;\n13;--and then there's 11; 14; 33--well, never mind the details, the\ntotal in clean numbers foots up $118,254.42 thus far!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes indeed. Printing's no bagatelle, I can tell you. And then\nthere's your contributions, as a company, to Chicago fires and Boston\nfires, and orphan asylums and all that sort of thing--head the list,\nyou see, with the company's full name and a thousand dollars set\nopposite--great card, sir--one of the finest advertisements in the\nworld--the preachers mention it in the pulpit when it's a religious\ncharity--one of the happiest advertisements in the world is your\nbenevolent donation. Ours have amounted to sixteen thousand dollars and\nsome cents up to this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes. Perhaps the biggest thing we've done in the advertising line\nwas to get an officer of the U. S. government, of perfectly Himmalayan\nofficial altitude, to write up our little internal improvement for a\nreligious paper of enormous circulation--I tell you that makes our bonds\ngo handsomely among the pious poor. Your religious paper is by far\nthe best vehicle for a thing of this kind, because they'll 'lead' your\narticle and put it right in the midst of the reading matter; and if it's\ngot a few Scripture quotations in it, and some temperance platitudes\nand a bit of gush here and there about Sunday Schools, and a sentimental\nsnuffle now and then about 'God's precious ones, the honest hard-handed\npoor,' it works the nation like a charm, my dear sir, and never a man\nsuspects that it is an advertisement; but your secular paper sticks you\nright into the advertising columns and of course you don't take a trick.\nGive me a religious paper to advertise in, every time; and if you'll\njust look at their advertising pages, you'll observe that other people\nthink a good deal as I do--especially people who have got little\nfinancial schemes to make everybody rich with. Of course I mean your\ngreat big metropolitan religious papers that know how to serve God and\nmake money at the same time--that's your sort, sir, that's your sort--a\nreligious paper that isn't run to make money is no use to us, sir, as an\nadvertising medium--no use to anybody--in our line of business. I guess\nour next best dodge was sending a pleasure trip of newspaper reporters\nout to Napoleon. Never paid them a cent; just filled them up with\nchampagne and the fat of the land, put pen, ink and paper before them\nwhile they were red-hot, and bless your soul when you come to read their\nletters you'd have supposed they'd been to heaven. And if a sentimental\nsqueamishness held one or two of them back from taking a less rosy view\nof Napoleon, our hospitalities tied his tongue, at least, and he said\nnothing at all and so did us no harm. Let me see--have I stated all\nthe expenses I've been at? No, I was near forgetting one or two items.\nThere's your official salaries--you can't get good men for nothing.\nSalaries cost pretty lively. And then there's your big\nhigh-sounding millionaire names stuck into your advertisements as\nstockholders--another card, that--and they are stockholders, too, but\nyou have to give them the stock and non-assessable at that--so they're\nan expensive lot. Very, very expensive thing, take it all around, is\na big internal improvement concern--but you see that yourself, Mr.\nBryerman--you see that, yourself, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut look here. I think you are a little mistaken about it's ever having\ncost anything for Congressional votes. I happen to know something about\nthat. I've let you say your say--now let me say mine. I don't wish to\nseem to throw any suspicion on anybody's statements, because we are all\nliable to be mistaken. But how would it strike you if I were to say that\nI was in Washington all the time this bill was pending? and what if I\nadded that I put the measure through myself? Yes, sir, I did that little\nthing. And moreover, I never paid a dollar for any man's vote and never\npromised one. There are some ways of doing a thing that are as good as\nothers which other people don't happen to think about, or don't have the\nknack of succeeding in, if they do happen to think of them. My dear sir,\nI am obliged to knock some of your expenses in the head--for never a\ncent was paid a Congressman or Senator on the part of this Navigation\nCompany.\u201d\n\nThe president smiled blandly, even sweetly, all through this harangue,\nand then said:\n\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery word of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell it does seem to alter the complexion of things a little. You are\nacquainted with the members down there, of course, else you could not\nhave worked to such advantage?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know them all, sir. I know their wives, their children, their\nbabies--I even made it a point to be on good terms with their lackeys. I\nknow every Congressman well--even familiarly.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good. Do you know any of their signatures? Do you know their\nhandwriting?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy I know their handwriting as well as I know my own--have\nhad correspondence enough with them, I should think. And their\nsignatures--why I can tell their initials, even.\u201d\n\nThe president went to a private safe, unlocked it and got out some\nletters and certain slips of paper. Then he said:\n\n\u201cNow here, for instance; do you believe that that is a genuine letter?\nDo you know this signature here?--and this one? Do you know who those\ninitials represent--and are they forgeries?\u201d\n\nHarry was stupefied. There were things there that made his brain swim.\nPresently, at the bottom of one of the letters he saw a signature that\nrestored his equilibrium; it even brought the sunshine of a smile to his\nface.\n\nThe president said:\n\n\u201cThat one amuses you. You never suspected him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I ought to have suspected him, but I don't believe it ever\nreally occurred to me. Well, well, well--how did you ever have the nerve\nto approach him, of all others?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy my friend, we never think of accomplishing anything without his\nhelp. He is our mainstay. But how do those letters strike you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey strike me dumb! What a stone-blind idiot I have been!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, take it all around, I suppose you had a pleasant time in\nWashington,\u201d said the president, gathering up the letters; \u201cof course\nyou must have had. Very few men could go there and get a money bill\nthrough without buying a single--\u201d\n\n\u201cCome, now, Mr. President, that's plenty of that! I take back everything\nI said on that head. I'm a wiser man to-day than I was yesterday, I can\ntell you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you are. In fact I am satisfied you are. But now I showed you\nthese things in confidence, you understand. Mention facts as much as\nyou want to, but don't mention names to anybody. I can depend on you for\nthat, can't I?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, of course. I understand the necessity of that. I will not betray\nthe names. But to go back a bit, it begins to look as if you never saw\nany of that appropriation at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe saw nearly ten thousand dollars of it--and that was all. Several\nof us took turns at log-rolling in Washington, and if we had charged\nanything for that service, none of that $10,000 would ever have reached\nNew York.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you hadn't levied the assessment you would have been in a close\nplace I judge?\u201d\n\n\u201cClose? Have you figured up the total of the disbursements I told you\nof?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I didn't think of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, lets see:\n\nSpent in Washington, say, $191,000 Printing, advertising, etc, say\n$118,000 Charity, say, $16,000\n\n Total, $325,000\n\nThe money to do that with, comes from-- Appropriation, $200,000\n\nTen per cent assessment on capital of $1,000,000 $100,000\n\n Total, $300,000\n\n\u201cWhich leaves us in debt some $25,000 at this moment. Salaries of home\nofficers are still going on; also printing and advertising. Next month\nwill show a state of things!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then--burst up, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy no means. Levy another assessment\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I see. That's dismal.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy isn't it? What's the road out?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother appropriation, don't you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cBother the appropriations. They cost more than they come to.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the next one. We'll call for half a million--get it and go for a\nmillion the very next month.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but the cost of it!\u201d\n\nThe president smiled, and patted his secret letters affectionately. He\nsaid:\n\n\u201cAll these people are in the next Congress. We shan't have to pay them\na cent. And what is more, they will work like beavers for us--perhaps it\nmight be to their advantage.\u201d\n\nHarry reflected profoundly a while. Then he said:\n\n\u201cWe send many missionaries to lift up the benighted races of other\nlands. How much cheaper and better it would be if those people could\nonly come here and drink of our civilization at its fountain head.\u201d\n\n\u201cI perfectly agree with you, Mr. Beverly. Must you go? Well, good\nmorning. Look in, when you are passing; and whenever I can give you any\ninformation about our affairs and prospects, I shall be glad to do it.\u201d\n\nHarry's letter was not a long one, but it contained at least the\ncalamitous figures that came out in the above conversation. The\nColonel found himself in a rather uncomfortable place--no $1,200 salary\nforthcoming; and himself held responsible for half of the $9,640 due the\nworkmen, to say nothing of being in debt to the company to the extent of\nnearly $4,000. Polly's heart was nearly broken; the \u201cblues\u201d returned in\nfearful force, and she had to go out of the room to hide the tears that\nnothing could keep back now.\n\nThere was mourning in another quarter, too, for Louise had a letter.\nWashington had refused, at the last moment, to take $40,000 for the\nTennessee Land, and had demanded $150,000! So the trade fell through,\nand now Washington was wailing because he had been so foolish. But he\nwrote that his man might probably return to the city soon, and then he\nmeant to sell to him, sure, even if he had to take $10,000. Louise had a\ngood cry--several of them, indeed--and the family charitably forebore to\nmake any comments that would increase her grief.\n\nSpring blossomed, summer came, dragged its hot weeks by, and the\nColonel's spirits rose, day by day, for the railroad was making good\nprogress. But by and by something happened. Hawkeye had always declined\nto subscribe anything toward the railway, imagining that her large\nbusiness would be a sufficient compulsory influence; but now Hawkeye was\nfrightened; and before Col. Sellers knew what he was about, Hawkeye,\nin a panic, had rushed to the front and subscribed such a sum that\nNapoleon's attractions suddenly sank into insignificance and the\nrailroad concluded to follow a comparatively straight coarse instead of\ngoing miles out of its way to build up a metropolis in the muddy desert\nof Stone's Landing.\n\nThe thunderbolt fell. After all the Colonel's deep planning; after all\nhis brain work and tongue work in drawing public attention to his pet\nproject and enlisting interest in it; after all his faithful hard toil\nwith his hands, and running hither and thither on his busy feet; after\nall his high hopes and splendid prophecies, the fates had turned their\nbacks on him at last, and all in a moment his air-castles crumbled to\nruins about him. Hawkeye rose from her fright triumphant and rejoicing,\nand down went Stone's Landing! One by one its meagre parcel of\ninhabitants packed up and moved away, as the summer waned and fall\napproached. Town lots were no longer salable, traffic ceased, a deadly\nlethargy fell upon the place once more, the \u201cWeekly Telegraph\u201d faded\ninto an early grave, the wary tadpole returned from exile, the bullfrog\nresumed his ancient song, the tranquil turtle sunned his back upon bank\nand log and drowsed his grateful life away as in the old sweet days of\nyore.\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nPhilip Sterling was on his way to Ilium, in the state of Pennsylvania.\nIlium was the railway station nearest to the tract of wild land which\nMr. Bolton had commissioned him to examine.\n\nOn the last day of the journey as the railway train Philip was on was\nleaving a large city, a lady timidly entered the drawing-room car, and\nhesitatingly took a chair that was at the moment unoccupied. Philip saw\nfrom the window that a gentleman had put her upon the car just as it was\nstarting. In a few moments the conductor entered, and without waiting an\nexplanation, said roughly to the lady,\n\n\u201cNow you can't sit there. That seat's taken. Go into the other car.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not intend to take the seat,\u201d said the lady rising, \u201cI only sat\ndown a moment till the conductor should come and give me a seat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere aint any. Car's full. You'll have to leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, sir,\u201d said the lady, appealingly, \u201cI thought--\u201d\n\n\u201cCan't help what you thought--you must go into the other car.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe train is going very fast, let me stand here till we stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lady can have my seat,\u201d cried Philip, springing up.\n\nThe conductor turned towards Philip, and coolly and deliberately\nsurveyed him from head to foot, with contempt in every line of his face,\nturned his back upon him without a word, and said to the lady,\n\n\u201cCome, I've got no time to talk. You must go now.\u201d\n\nThe lady, entirely disconcerted by such rudeness, and frightened, moved\ntowards the door, opened it and stepped out. The train was swinging\nalong at a rapid rate, jarring from side to side; the step was a long\none between the cars and there was no protecting grating. The lady\nattempted it, but lost her balance, in the wind and the motion of the\ncar, and fell! She would inevitably have gone down under the wheels, if\nPhilip, who had swiftly followed her, had not caught her arm and drawn\nher up. He then assisted her across, found her a seat, received her\nbewildered thanks, and returned to his car.\n\nThe conductor was still there, taking his tickets, and growling\nsomething about imposition. Philip marched up to him, and burst out\nwith,\n\n\u201cYou are a brute, an infernal brute, to treat a woman that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps you'd like to make a fuss about it,\u201d sneered the conductor.\n\nPhilip's reply was a blow, given so suddenly and planted so squarely in\nthe conductor's face, that it sent him reeling over a fat passenger, who\nwas looking up in mild wonder that any one should dare to dispute with a\nconductor, and against the side of the car.\n\nHe recovered himself, reached the bell rope, \u201cDamn you, I'll learn you,\u201d\n stepped to the door and called a couple of brakemen, and then, as the\nspeed slackened; roared out,\n\n\u201cGet off this train.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall not get off. I have as much right here as you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe'll see,\u201d said the conductor, advancing with the brakemen. The\npassengers protested, and some of them said to each other, \u201cThat's too\nbad,\u201d as they always do in such cases, but none of them offered to take\na hand with Philip. The men seized him, wrenched him from his seat,\ndragged him along the aisle, tearing his clothes, thrust him from the\ncar, and, then flung his carpet-bag, overcoat and umbrella after him.\nAnd the train went on.\n\nThe conductor, red in the face and puffing from his exertion, swaggered\nthrough the car, muttering \u201cPuppy, I'll learn him.\u201d The passengers, when\nhe had gone, were loud in their indignation, and talked about signing a\nprotest, but they did nothing more than talk.\n\nThe next morning the Hooverville Patriot and Clarion had this \u201citem\u201d:--\n\nSLIGHTUALLY OVERBOARD.\n\n\u201cWe learn that as the down noon express was leaving H---- yesterday a\nlady! (God save the mark) attempted to force herself into the already\nfull palatial car. Conductor Slum, who is too old a bird to be caught\nwith chaff, courteously informed her that the car was full, and when\nshe insisted on remaining, he persuaded her to go into the car where\nshe belonged. Thereupon a young sprig, from the East, blustered like a\nShanghai rooster, and began to sass the conductor with his chin music.\nThat gentleman delivered the young aspirant for a muss one of his\nelegant little left-handers, which so astonished him that he began\nto feel for his shooter. Whereupon Mr. Slum gently raised the youth,\ncarried him forth, and set him down just outside the car to cool off.\nWhether the young blood has yet made his way out of Bascom's swamp,\nwe have not learned. Conductor Slum is one of the most gentlemanly and\nefficient officers on the road; but he ain't trifled with, not much. We\nlearn that the company have put a new engine on the seven o'clock train,\nand newly upholstered the drawing-room car throughout. It spares no\neffort for the comfort of the traveling public.\u201d\n\nPhilip never had been before in Bascom's swamp, and there was nothing\ninviting in it to detain him. After the train got out of the way he\ncrawled out of the briars and the mud, and got upon the track. He was\nsomewhat bruised, but he was too angry to mind that. He plodded along\nover the ties in a very hot condition of mind and body. In the scuffle,\nhis railway check had disappeared, and he grimly wondered, as he noticed\nthe loss, if the company would permit him to walk over their track if\nthey should know he hadn't a ticket.\n\nPhilip had to walk some five miles before he reached a little station,\nwhere he could wait for a train, and he had ample time for reflection.\nAt first he was full of vengeance on the company. He would sue it. He\nwould make it pay roundly. But then it occurred to him that he did not\nknow the name of a witness he could summon, and that a personal fight\nagainst a railway corporation was about the most hopeless in the world.\nHe then thought he would seek out that conductor, lie in wait for him at\nsome station, and thrash him, or get thrashed himself.\n\nBut as he got cooler, that did not seem to him a project worthy of a\ngentleman exactly. Was it possible for a gentleman to get even with such\na fellow as that conductor on the letter's own plane? And when he came\nto this point, he began to ask himself, if he had not acted very much\nlike a fool. He didn't regret striking the fellow--he hoped he had\nleft a mark on him. But, after all, was that the best way? Here was he,\nPhilip Sterling, calling himself a gentleman, in a brawl with a vulgar\nconductor, about a woman he had never seen before. Why should he have\nput himself in such a ridiculous position? Wasn't it enough to have\noffered the lady his seat, to have rescued her from an accident, perhaps\nfrom death? Suppose he had simply said to the conductor, \u201cSir, your\nconduct is brutal, I shall report you.\u201d The passengers, who saw the\naffair, might have joined in a report against the conductor, and he\nmight really have accomplished something. And, now! Philip looked at his\ntorn clothes, and thought with disgust of his haste in getting into a\nfight with such an autocrat.\n\nAt the little station where Philip waited for the next train, he met a\nman--who turned out to be a justice of the peace in that neighborhood,\nand told him his adventure. He was a kindly sort of man, and seemed very\nmuch interested.\n\n\u201cDum 'em,\u201d said he, when he had heard the story.\n\n\u201cDo you think any thing can be done, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cWal, I guess tain't no use. I hain't a mite of doubt of every word you\nsay. But suin's no use. The railroad company owns all these people along\nhere, and the judges on the bench too. Spiled your clothes! Wal, 'least\nsaid's soonest mended.' You haint no chance with the company.\u201d\n\nWhen next morning, he read the humorous account in the Patriot and\nClarion, he saw still more clearly what chance he would have had before\nthe public in a fight with the railroad company.\n\nStill Philip's conscience told him that it was his plain duty to carry\nthe matter into the courts, even with the certainty of defeat. He\nconfessed that neither he nor any citizen had a right to consult his\nown feelings or conscience in a case where a law of the land had been\nviolated before his own eyes. He confessed that every citizen's first\nduty in such case is to put aside his own business and devote his time\nand his best efforts to seeing that the infraction is promptly punished;\nand he knew that no country can be well governed unless its citizens as\na body keep religiously before their minds that they are the guardians\nof the law, and that the law officers are only the machinery for its\nexecution, nothing more. As a finality he was obliged to confess that he\nwas a bad citizen, and also that the general laxity of the time, and\nthe absence of a sense of duty toward any part of the community but the\nindividual himself were ingrained in him, and he was no better than the\nrest of the people.\n\nThe result of this little adventure was that Philip did not reach Ilium\ntill daylight the next morning, when he descended sleepy and sore, from\na way train, and looked about him. Ilium was in a narrow mountain gorge,\nthrough which a rapid stream ran. It consisted of the plank platform\non which he stood, a wooden house, half painted, with a dirty piazza\n(unroofed) in front, and a sign board hung on a slanting pole--bearing\nthe legend, \u201cHotel. P. Dusenheimer,\u201d a sawmill further down the stream,\na blacksmith-shop, and a store, and three or four unpainted dwellings of\nthe slab variety.\n\nAs Philip approached the hotel he saw what appeared to be a wild beast\ncrouching on the piazza. It did not stir, however, and he soon found\nthat it was only a stuffed skin. This cheerful invitation to the tavern\nwas the remains of a huge panther which had been killed in the region\na few weeks before. Philip examined his ugly visage and strong crooked\nfore-arm, as he was waiting admittance, having pounded upon the door.\n\n\u201cYait a bit. I'll shoost--put on my trowsers,\u201d shouted a voice from the\nwindow, and the door was soon opened by the yawning landlord.\n\n\u201cMorgen! Didn't hear d' drain oncet. Dem boys geeps me up zo spate. Gom\nright in.\u201d\n\nPhilip was shown into a dirty bar-room. It was a small room, with a\nstove in the middle, set in a long shallow box of sand, for the benefit\nof the \u201cspitters,\u201d a bar across one end--a mere counter with a sliding\nglass-case behind it containing a few bottles having ambitious labels,\nand a wash-sink in one corner. On the walls were the bright yellow and\nblack handbills of a traveling circus, with pictures of acrobats\nin human pyramids, horses flying in long leaps through the air, and\nsylph-like women in a paradisaic costume, balancing themselves upon the\ntips of their toes on the bare backs of frantic and plunging steeds, and\nkissing their hands to the spectators meanwhile.\n\nAs Philip did not desire a room at that hour, he was invited to wash\nhimself at the nasty sink, a feat somewhat easier than drying his face,\nfor the towel that hung in a roller over the sink was evidently as much\na fixture as the sink itself, and belonged, like the suspended brush and\ncomb, to the traveling public. Philip managed to complete his toilet by\nthe use of his pocket-handkerchief, and declining the hospitality of the\nlandlord, implied in the remark, \u201cYou won'd dake notin'?\u201d he went into\nthe open air to wait for breakfast.\n\nThe country he saw was wild but not picturesque. The mountain before\nhim might be eight hundred feet high, and was only a portion of a long\nunbroken range, savagely wooded, which followed the stream. Behind the\nhotel, and across the brawling brook, was another level-topped, wooded\nrange exactly like it. Ilium itself, seen at a glance, was old enough to\nbe dilapidated, and if it had gained anything by being made a wood and\nwater station of the new railroad, it was only a new sort of grime\nand rawness. P. Dusenheimer, standing in the door of his uninviting\ngroggery, when the trains stopped for water; never received from\nthe traveling public any patronage except facetious remarks upon his\npersonal appearance. Perhaps a thousand times he had heard the remark,\n\u201cIlium fuit,\u201d followed in most instances by a hail to himself as\n\u201cAEneas,\u201d with the inquiry \u201cWhere is old Anchises?\u201d At first he had\nreplied, \u201cDere ain't no such man;\u201d but irritated by its senseless\nrepetition, he had latterly dropped into the formula of, \u201cYou be dam.\u201d\n\nPhilip was recalled from the contemplation of Ilium by the rolling and\ngrowling of the gong within the hotel, the din and clamor increasing\ntill the house was apparently unable to contain it; when it burst out of\nthe front door and informed the world that breakfast was on the table.\n\nThe dining room was long, low and narrow, and a narrow table extended\nits whole length. Upon this was spread a cloth which from appearance\nmight have been as long in use as the towel in the barroom. Upon the\ntable was the usual service, the heavy, much nicked stone ware, the row\nof plated and rusty castors, the sugar bowls with the zinc\ntea-spoons sticking up in them, the piles of yellow biscuits, the\ndiscouraged-looking plates of butter. The landlord waited, and Philip\nwas pleased to observe the change in his manner. In the barroom he was\nthe conciliatory landlord. Standing behind his guests at table, he had\nan air of peremptory patronage, and the voice in which he shot out the\ninquiry, as he seized Philip's plate, \u201cBeefsteak or liver?\u201d quite took\naway Philip's power of choice. He begged for a glass of milk, after\ntrying that green hued compound called coffee, and made his breakfast\nout of that and some hard crackers which seemed to have been imported\ninto Ilium before the introduction of the iron horse, and to have\nwithstood a ten years siege of regular boarders, Greeks and others.\n\nThe land that Philip had come to look at was at least five miles distant\nfrom Ilium station. A corner of it touched the railroad, but the rest\nwas pretty much an unbroken wilderness, eight or ten thousand acres of\nrough country, most of it such a mountain range as he saw at Ilium.\n\nHis first step was to hire three woodsmen to accompany him. By their\nhelp he built a log hut, and established a camp on the land, and then\nbegan his explorations, mapping down his survey as he went along, noting\nthe timber, and the lay of the land, and making superficial observations\nas to the prospect of coal.\n\nThe landlord at Ilium endeavored to persuade Philip to hire the services\nof a witch-hazel professor of that region, who could walk over the land\nwith his wand and tell him infallibly whether it contained coal, and\nexactly where the strata ran. But Philip preferred to trust to his own\nstudy of the country, and his knowledge of the geological formation. He\nspent a month in traveling over the land and making calculations; and\nmade up his mind that a fine vein of coal ran through the mountain about\na mile from the railroad, and that the place to run in a tunnel was half\nway towards its summit.\n\nActing with his usual promptness, Philip, with the consent of Mr.\nBolton, broke ground there at once, and, before snow came, had some rude\nbuildings up, and was ready for active operations in the spring. It\nwas true that there were no outcroppings of coal at the place, and the\npeople at Ilium said he \u201cmought as well dig for plug terbaccer there;\u201d\n but Philip had great faith in the uniformity of nature's operations in\nages past, and he had no doubt that he should strike at this spot the\nrich vein that had made the fortune of the Golden Briar Company.\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nOnce more Louise had good news from her Washington--Senator Dilworthy\nwas going to sell the Tennessee Land to the government! Louise told\nLaura in confidence. She had told her parents, too, and also several\nbosom friends; but all of these people had simply looked sad when they\nheard the news, except Laura. Laura's face suddenly brightened under\nit--only for an instant, it is true, but poor Louise was grateful for\neven that fleeting ray of encouragement. When next Laura was alone, she\nfell into a train of thought something like this:\n\n\u201cIf the Senator has really taken hold of this matter, I may look for\nthat invitation to his house at any moment. I am perishing to go! I do\nlong to know whether I am only simply a large-sized pigmy among these\npigmies here, who tumble over so easily when one strikes them, or\nwhether I am really--.\u201d Her thoughts drifted into other channels, for\na season. Then she continued:--\u201cHe said I could be useful in the great\ncause of philanthropy, and help in the blessed work of uplifting the\npoor and the ignorant, if he found it feasible to take hold of our\nLand. Well, that is neither here nor there; what I want, is to go to\nWashington and find out what I am. I want money, too; and if one\nmay judge by what she hears, there are chances there for a--.\u201d For a\nfascinating woman, she was going to say, perhaps, but she did not.\n\nAlong in the fall the invitation came, sure enough. It came officially\nthrough brother Washington, the private Secretary, who appended a\npostscript that was brimming with delight over the prospect of seeing\nthe Duchess again. He said it would be happiness enough to look upon\nher face once more--it would be almost too much happiness when to it was\nadded the fact that she would bring messages with her that were fresh\nfrom Louise's lips.\n\nIn Washington's letter were several important enclosures. For instance,\nthere was the Senator's check for $2,000--\u201cto buy suitable clothing in\nNew York with!\u201d It was a loan to be refunded when the Land was sold.\nTwo thousand--this was fine indeed. Louise's father was called rich, but\nLaura doubted if Louise had ever had $400 worth of new clothing at one\ntime in her life. With the check came two through tickets--good on\nthe railroad from Hawkeye to Washington via New York--and they were\n\u201cdead-head\u201d tickets, too, which had been given to Senator Dilworthy by\nthe railway companies. Senators and representatives were paid thousands\nof dollars by the government for traveling expenses, but they\nalways traveled \u201cdeadhead\u201d both ways, and then did as any honorable,\nhigh-minded men would naturally do--declined to receive the mileage\ntendered them by the government. The Senator had plenty of railway\npasses, and could easily spare two to Laura--one for herself and one for\na male escort. Washington suggested that she get some old friend of the\nfamily to come with her, and said the Senator would \u201cdeadhead\u201d him home\nagain as soon as he had grown tired of the sights of the capital. Laura\nthought the thing over. At first she was pleased with the idea, but\npresently she began to feel differently about it. Finally she said, \u201cNo,\nour staid, steady-going Hawkeye friends' notions and mine differ about\nsome things--they respect me, now, and I respect them--better leave\nit so--I will go alone; I am not afraid to travel by myself.\u201d And so\ncommuning with herself, she left the house for an afternoon walk.\n\nAlmost at the door she met Col. Sellers. She told him about her\ninvitation to Washington.\n\n\u201cBless me!\u201d said the Colonel. \u201cI have about made up my mind to go there\nmyself. You see we've got to get another appropriation through, and the\nCompany want me to come east and put it through Congress. Harry's there,\nand he'll do what he can, of course; and Harry's a good fellow and\nalways does the very best he knows how, but then he's young--rather\nyoung for some parts of such work, you know--and besides he talks too\nmuch, talks a good deal too much; and sometimes he appears to be a\nlittle bit visionary, too, I think the worst thing in the world for a\nbusiness man. A man like that always exposes his cards, sooner or later.\nThis sort of thing wants an old, quiet, steady hand--wants an old cool\nhead, you know, that knows men, through and through, and is used to\nlarge operations. I'm expecting my salary, and also some dividends\nfrom the company, and if they get along in time, I'll go along with you\nLaura--take you under my wing--you mustn't travel alone. Lord I wish I\nhad the money right now. --But there'll be plenty soon--plenty.\u201d\n\nLaura reasoned with herself that if the kindly, simple-hearted Colonel\nwas going anyhow, what could she gain by traveling alone and throwing\naway his company? So she told him she accepted his offer gladly,\ngratefully. She said it would be the greatest of favors if he would go\nwith her and protect her--not at his own expense as far as railway fares\nwere concerned, of course; she could not expect him to put himself to so\nmuch trouble for her and pay his fare besides. But he wouldn't hear of\nher paying his fare--it would be only a pleasure to him to serve her.\nLaura insisted on furnishing the tickets; and finally, when argument\nfailed, she said the tickets cost neither her nor any one else a\ncent--she had two of them--she needed but one--and if he would not take\nthe other she would not go with him. That settled the matter. He took\nthe ticket. Laura was glad that she had the check for new clothing,\nfor she felt very certain of being able to get the Colonel to borrow a\nlittle of the money to pay hotel bills with, here and there.\n\nShe wrote Washington to look for her and Col. Sellers toward the end of\nNovember; and at about the time set the two travelers arrived safe in\nthe capital of the nation, sure enough.\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\n     She, the gracious lady, yet no paines did spare\n     To doe him ease, or doe him remedy:\n     Many restoratives of vertues rare\n     And costly cordialles she did apply,\n     To mitigate his stubborne malady.\n\n     Spenser's Faerie Queens.\n\nMr. Henry Brierly was exceedingly busy in New York, so he wrote Col.\nSellers, but he would drop everything and go to Washington.\n\nThe Colonel believed that Harry was the prince of lobbyists, a little\ntoo sanguine, may be, and given to speculation, but, then, he knew\neverybody; the Columbus River navigation scheme was got through almost\nentirely by his aid. He was needed now to help through another scheme,\na benevolent scheme in which Col. Sellers, through the Hawkinses, had a\ndeep interest.\n\n\u201cI don't care, you know,\u201d he wrote to Harry, \u201cso much about the\nniggroes. But if the government will buy this land, it will set up the\nHawkins family--make Laura an heiress--and I shouldn't wonder if\nBeriah Sellers would set up his carriage again. Dilworthy looks at it\ndifferent, of course. He's all for philanthropy, for benefiting the\ncolored race. There's old Balsam, was in the Interior--used to be the\nRev. Orson Balsam of Iowa--he's made the riffle on the Injun; great\nInjun pacificator and land dealer. Balaam'a got the Injun to himself,\nand I suppose that Senator Dilworthy feels that there is nothing left\nhim but the colored man. I do reckon he is the best friend the colored\nman has got in Washington.\u201d\n\nThough Harry was in a hurry to reach Washington, he stopped in\nPhiladelphia; and prolonged his visit day after day, greatly to the\ndetriment of his business both in New York and Washington. The society\nat the Bolton's might have been a valid excuse for neglecting business\nmuch more important than his. Philip was there; he was a partner with\nMr. Bolton now in the new coal venture, concerning which there was much\nto be arranged in preparation for the Spring work, and Philip lingered\nweek after week in the hospitable house. Alice was making a winter\nvisit. Ruth only went to town twice a week to attend lectures, and the\nhousehold was quite to Mr. Bolton's taste, for he liked the cheer of\ncompany and something going on evenings. Harry was cordially asked to\nbring his traveling-bag there, and he did not need urging to do so. Not\neven the thought of seeing Laura at the capital made him restless in the\nsociety of the two young ladies; two birds in hand are worth one in the\nbush certainly.\n\nPhilip was at home--he sometimes wished he were not so much so. He felt\nthat too much or not enough was taken for granted. Ruth had met him,\nwhen he first came, with a cordial frankness, and her manner continued\nentirely unrestrained. She neither sought his company nor avoided it,\nand this perfectly level treatment irritated him more than any other\ncould have done. It was impossible to advance much in love-making with\none who offered no obstacles, had no concealments and no embarrassments,\nand whom any approach to sentimentality would be quite likely to set\ninto a fit of laughter.\n\n\u201cWhy, Phil,\u201d she would say, \u201cwhat puts you in the dumps to day? You are\nas solemn as the upper bench in Meeting. I shall have to call Alice to\nraise your spirits; my presence seems to depress you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's not your presence, but your absence when you are present,\u201d began\nPhilip, dolefully, with the idea that he was saying a rather deep thing.\n\u201cBut you won't understand me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I confess I cannot. If you really are so low, as to think I am\nabsent when I am present, it's a frightful case of aberration; I shall\nask father to bring out Dr. Jackson. Does Alice appear to be present\nwhen she is absent?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlice has some human feeling, anyway. She cares for something besides\nmusty books and dry bones. I think, Ruth, when I die,\u201d said Philip,\nintending to be very grim and sarcastic, \u201cI'll leave you my skeleton.\nYou might like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might be more cheerful than you are at times,\u201d Ruth replied with a\nlaugh. \u201cBut you mustn't do it without consulting Alice. She might not\nlike it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know why you should bring Alice up on every occasion. Do you\nthink I am in love with her?\u201d\n\n\u201cBless you, no. It never entered my head. Are you? The thought of Philip\nSterling in love is too comical. I thought you were only in love with\nthe Ilium coal mine, which you and father talk about half the time.\u201d\n\nThis is a specimen of Philip's wooing. Confound the girl, he would say\nto himself, why does she never tease Harry and that young Shepley who\ncomes here?\n\nHow differently Alice treated him. She at least never mocked him, and it\nwas a relief to talk with one who had some sympathy with him. And he did\ntalk to her, by the hour, about Ruth. The blundering fellow poured all\nhis doubts and anxieties into her ear, as if she had been the impassive\noccupant of one of those little wooden confessionals in the Cathedral on\nLogan Square. Has a confessor, if she is young and pretty, any feeling?\nDoes it mend the matter by calling her your sister?\n\nPhilip called Alice his good sister, and talked to her about love and\nmarriage, meaning Ruth, as if sisters could by no possibility have any\npersonal concern in such things. Did Ruth ever speak of him? Did she\nthink Ruth cared for him? Did Ruth care for anybody at Fallkill? Did she\ncare for anything except her profession? And so on.\n\nAlice was loyal to Ruth, and if she knew anything she did not betray her\nfriend. She did not, at any rate, give Philip too much encouragement.\nWhat woman, under the circumstances, would?\n\n\u201cI can tell you one thing, Philip,\u201d she said, \u201cif ever Ruth Bolton\nloves, it will be with her whole soul, in a depth of passion that will\nsweep everything before it and surprise even herself.\u201d\n\nA remark that did not much console Philip, who imagined that only some\ngrand heroism could unlock the sweetness of such a heart; and Philip\nfeared that he wasn't a hero. He did not know out of what materials a\nwoman can construct a hero, when she is in the creative mood.\n\nHarry skipped into this society with his usual lightness and gaiety.\nHis good nature was inexhaustible, and though he liked to relate his own\nexploits, he had a little tact in adapting himself to the tastes of his\nhearers. He was not long in finding out that Alice liked to hear about\nPhilip, and Harry launched out into the career of his friend in the\nWest, with a prodigality of invention that would have astonished\nthe chief actor. He was the most generous fellow in the world, and\npicturesque conversation was the one thing in which he never was\nbankrupt. With Mr. Bolton he was the serious man of business, enjoying\nthe confidence of many of the monied men in New York, whom Mr. Bolton\nknew, and engaged with them in railway schemes and government contracts.\nPhilip, who had so long known Harry, never could make up his mind that\nHarry did not himself believe that he was a chief actor in all these\nlarge operations of which he talked so much.\n\nHarry did not neglect to endeavor to make himself agreeable to Mrs.\nBolton, by paying great attention to the children, and by professing the\nwarmest interest in the Friends' faith. It always seemed to him the\nmost peaceful religion; he thought it must be much easier to live by an\ninternal light than by a lot of outward rules; he had a dear Quaker aunt\nin Providence of whom Mrs. Bolton constantly reminded him. He insisted\nupon going with Mrs. Bolton and the children to the Friends Meeting on\nFirst Day, when Ruth and Alice and Philip, \u201cworld's people,\u201d went to a\nchurch in town, and he sat through the hour of silence with his hat on,\nin most exemplary patience. In short, this amazing actor succeeded so\nwell with Mrs. Bolton, that she said to Philip one day,\n\n\u201cThy friend, Henry Brierly, appears to be a very worldly minded young\nman. Does he believe in anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Philip laughing, \u201che believes in more things than any\nother person I ever saw.\u201d\n\nTo Ruth, Harry seemed to be very congenial. He was never moody for one\nthing, but lent himself with alacrity to whatever her fancy was. He was\ngay or grave as the need might be. No one apparently could enter more\nfully into her plans for an independent career.\n\n\u201cMy father,\u201d said Harry, \u201cwas bred a physician, and practiced a little\nbefore he went into Wall street. I always had a leaning to the study.\nThere was a skeleton hanging in the closet of my father's study when\nI was a boy, that I used to dress up in old clothes. Oh, I got quite\nfamiliar with the human frame.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must have,\u201d said Philip. \u201cWas that where you learned to play the\nbones? He is a master of those musical instruments, Ruth; he plays well\nenough to go on the stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhilip hates science of any kind, and steady application,\u201d retorted\nHarry. He didn't fancy Philip's banter, and when the latter had gone\nout, and Ruth asked,\n\n\u201cWhy don't you take up medicine, Mr. Brierly?\u201d\n\nHarry said, \u201cI have it in mind. I believe I would begin attending\nlectures this winter if it weren't for being wanted in Washington. But\nmedicine is particularly women's province.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy so?\u201d asked Ruth, rather amused.\n\n\u201cWell, the treatment of disease is a good deal a matter of sympathy. A\nwoman's intuition is better than a man's. Nobody knows anything, really,\nyou know, and a woman can guess a good deal nearer than a man.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are very complimentary to my sex.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Harry frankly; \u201cI should want to choose my doctor; an ugly\nwoman would ruin me, the disease would be sure to strike in and kill\nme at sight of her. I think a pretty physician, with engaging manners,\nwould coax a fellow to live through almost anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid you are a scoffer, Mr. Brierly.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, I am quite sincere. Wasn't it old what's his name that\nsaid only the beautiful is useful?\u201d\n\nWhether Ruth was anything more than diverted with Harry's company,\nPhilip could not determine. He scorned at any rate to advance his own\ninterest by any disparaging communications about Harry, both because he\ncould not help liking the fellow himself, and because he may have known\nthat he could not more surely create a sympathy for him in Ruth's mind.\nThat Ruth was in no danger of any serious impression he felt pretty\nsure, felt certain of it when he reflected upon her severe occupation\nwith her profession. Hang it, he would say to himself, she is nothing\nbut pure intellect anyway. And he only felt uncertain of it when she was\nin one of her moods of raillery, with mocking mischief in her eyes. At\nsuch times she seemed to prefer Harry's society to his. When Philip was\nmiserable about this, he always took refuge with Alice, who was never\nmoody, and who generally laughed him out of his sentimental nonsense. He\nfelt at his ease with Alice, and was never in want of something to talk\nabout; and he could not account for the fact that he was so often dull\nwith Ruth, with whom, of all persons in the world, he wanted to appear\nat his best.\n\nHarry was entirely satisfied with his own situation. A bird of passage\nis always at its ease, having no house to build, and no responsibility.\nHe talked freely with Philip about Ruth, an almighty fine girl, he said,\nbut what the deuce she wanted to study medicine for, he couldn't see.\n\nThere was a concert one night at the Musical Fund Hall and the four had\narranged to go in and return by the Germantown cars. It was Philip's\nplan, who had engaged the seats, and promised himself an evening with\nRuth, walking with her, sitting by her in the hall, and enjoying the\nfeeling of protecting that a man always has of a woman in a public\nplace. He was fond of music, too, in a sympathetic way; at least, he\nknew that Ruth's delight in it would be enough for him.\n\nPerhaps he meant to take advantage of the occasion to say some very\nserious things. His love for Ruth was no secret to Mrs. Bolton, and he\nfelt almost sure that he should have no opposition in the family.\nMrs. Bolton had been cautious in what she said, but Philip inferred\neverything from her reply to his own questions, one day, \u201cHas thee ever\nspoken thy mind to Ruth?\u201d\n\nWhy shouldn't he speak his mind, and end his doubts? Ruth had been\nmore tricksy than usual that day, and in a flow of spirits quite\ninconsistent, it would seem, in a young lady devoted to grave studies.\n\nHad Ruth a premonition of Philip's intention, in his manner? It may be,\nfor when the girls came down stairs, ready to walk to the cars; and met\nPhilip and Harry in the hall, Ruth said, laughing,\n\n\u201cThe two tallest must walk together\u201d and before Philip knew how it\nhappened Ruth had taken Harry's arm, and his evening was spoiled. He had\ntoo much politeness and good sense and kindness to show in his manner\nthat he was hit. So he said to Harry,\n\n\u201cThat's your disadvantage in being short.\u201d And he gave Alice no reason\nto feel during the evening that she would not have been his first choice\nfor the excursion. But he was none the less chagrined, and not a little\nangry at the turn the affair took.\n\nThe Hall was crowded with the fashion of the town. The concert was one\nof those fragmentary drearinesses that people endure because they are\nfashionable; tours de force on the piano, and fragments from operas,\nwhich have no meaning without the setting, with weary pauses of waiting\nbetween; there is the comic basso who is so amusing and on such familiar\nterms with the audience, and always sings the Barber; the attitudinizing\ntenor, with his languishing \u201cOh, Summer Night;\u201d the soprano with her\n\u201cBatti Batti,\u201d who warbles and trills and runs and fetches her breath,\nand ends with a noble scream that brings down a tempest of applause in\nthe midst of which she backs off the stage smiling and bowing. It was\nthis sort of concert, and Philip was thinking that it was the most\nstupid one he ever sat through, when just as the soprano was in the\nmidst of that touching ballad, \u201cComin' thro' the Rye\u201d (the soprano\nalways sings \u201cComin' thro' the Rye\u201d on an encore)--the Black Swan used\nto make it irresistible, Philip remembered, with her arch, \u201cIf a body\nkiss a body\u201d there was a cry of \u201cFire!\u201d\n\nThe hall is long and narrow, and there is only one place of egress.\nInstantly the audience was on its feet, and a rush began for the door.\nMen shouted, women screamed, and panic seized the swaying mass. A\nsecond's thought would have convinced every one that getting out was\nimpossible, and that the only effect of a rush would be to crash people\nto death. But a second's thought was not given. A few cried:\n\n\u201cSit down, sit down,\u201d but the mass was turned towards the door. Women\nwere down and trampled on in the aisles, and stout men, utterly lost to\nself-control, were mounting the benches, as if to run a race over the\nmass to the entrance.\n\nPhilip who had forced the girls to keep their seats saw, in a flash, the\nnew danger, and sprang to avert it. In a second more those infuriated\nmen would be over the benches and crushing Ruth and Alice under their\nboots. He leaped upon the bench in front of them and struck out before\nhim with all his might, felling one man who was rushing on him, and\nchecking for an instant the movement, or rather parting it, and causing\nit to flow on either side of him. But it was only for an instant; the\npressure behind was too great, and, the next Philip was dashed backwards\nover the seat.\n\nAnd yet that instant of arrest had probably saved the girls, for as\nPhilip fell, the orchestra struck up \u201cYankee Doodle\u201d in the liveliest\nmanner. The familiar tune caught the ear of the mass, which paused in\nwonder, and gave the conductor's voice a chance to be heard--\u201cIt's a\nfalse alarm!\u201d\n\nThe tumult was over in a minute, and the next, laughter was heard, and\nnot a few said, \u201cI knew it wasn't anything.\u201d \u201cWhat fools people are at\nsuch a time.\u201d\n\nThe concert was over, however. A good many people were hurt, some of\nthem seriously, and among them Philip Sterling was found bent across the\nseat, insensible, with his left arm hanging limp and a bleeding wound on\nhis head.\n\nWhen he was carried into the air he revived, and said it was nothing.\nA surgeon was called, and it was thought best to drive at once to the\nBolton's, the surgeon supporting Philip, who did not speak the whole\nway. His arm was set and his head dressed, and the surgeon said he would\ncome round all right in his mind by morning; he was very weak. Alice\nwho was not much frightened while the panic lasted in the hall, was very\nmuch unnerved by seeing Philip so pale and bloody. Ruth assisted the\nsurgeon with the utmost coolness and with skillful hands helped to dress\nPhilip's wounds. And there was a certain intentness and fierce energy in\nwhat she did that might have revealed something to Philip if he had been\nin his senses.\n\nBut he was not, or he would not have murmured \u201cLet Alice do it, she is\nnot too tall.\u201d\n\nIt was Ruth's first case.\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nWashington's delight in his beautiful sister was measureless. He said\nthat she had always been the queenliest creature in the land, but\nthat she was only commonplace before, compared to what she was now, so\nextraordinary was the improvement wrought by rich fashionable attire.\n\n\u201cBut your criticisms are too full of brotherly partiality to be depended\non, Washington. Other people will judge differently.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed they won't. You'll see. There will never be a woman in\nWashington that can compare with you. You'll be famous within a\nfortnight, Laura. Everybody will want to know you. You wait--you'll\nsee.\u201d\n\nLaura wished in her heart that the prophecy might come true; and\nprivately she even believed it might--for she had brought all the women\nwhom she had seen since she left home under sharp inspection, and the\nresult had not been unsatisfactory to her.\n\nDuring a week or two Washington drove about the city every day with her\nand familiarized her with all of its salient features. She was beginning\nto feel very much at home with the town itself, and she was also fast\nacquiring ease with the distinguished people she met at the Dilworthy\ntable, and losing what little of country timidity she had brought with\nher from Hawkeye. She noticed with secret pleasure the little start of\nadmiration that always manifested itself in the faces of the guests\nwhen she entered the drawing-room arrayed in evening costume: she took\ncomforting note of the fact that these guests directed a very liberal\nshare of their conversation toward her; she observed with surprise,\nthat famous statesmen and soldiers did not talk like gods, as a general\nthing, but said rather commonplace things for the most part; and she\nwas filled with gratification to discover that she, on the contrary, was\nmaking a good many shrewd speeches and now and then a really brilliant\none, and furthermore, that they were beginning to be repeated in social\ncircles about the town.\n\nCongress began its sittings, and every day or two Washington escorted\nher to the galleries set apart for lady members of the households\nof Senators and Representatives. Here was a larger field and a wider\ncompetition, but still she saw that many eyes were uplifted toward her\nface, and that first one person and then another called a neighbor's\nattention to her; she was not too dull to perceive that the speeches of\nsome of the younger statesmen were delivered about as much and perhaps\nmore at her than to the presiding officer; and she was not sorry to see\nthat the dapper young Senator from Iowa came at once and stood in the\nopen space before the president's desk to exhibit his feet as soon\nas she entered the gallery, whereas she had early learned from common\nreport that his usual custom was to prop them on his desk and enjoy them\nhimself with a selfish disregard of other people's longings.\n\nInvitations began to flow in upon her and soon she was fairly \u201cin\nsociety.\u201d \u201cThe season\u201d was now in full bloom, and the first select\nreception was at hand--that is to say, a reception confined to invited\nguests. Senator Dilworthy had become well convinced, by this time, that\nhis judgment of the country-bred Missouri girl had not deceived him--it\nwas plain that she was going to be a peerless missionary in the field of\nlabor he designed her for, and therefore it would be perfectly safe and\nlikewise judicious to send her forth well panoplied for her work.--So\nhe had added new and still richer costumes to her wardrobe, and assisted\ntheir attractions with costly jewelry--loans on the future land sale.\n\nThis first select reception took place at a cabinet minister's--or\nrather a cabinet secretary's mansion. When Laura and the Senator\narrived, about half past nine or ten in the evening, the place was\nalready pretty well crowded, and the white-gloved negro servant at the\ndoor was still receiving streams of guests.--The drawing-rooms were\nbrilliant with gaslight, and as hot as ovens. The host and hostess stood\njust within the door of entrance; Laura was presented, and then she\npassed on into the maelstrom of be-jeweled and richly attired low-necked\nladies and white-kid-gloved and steel pen-coated gentlemen and wherever\nshe moved she was followed by a buzz of admiration that was grateful to\nall her senses--so grateful, indeed, that her white face was tinged and\nits beauty heightened by a perceptible suffusion of color. She caught\nsuch remarks as, \u201cWho is she?\u201d \u201cSuperb woman!\u201d \u201cThat is the new beauty\nfrom the west,\u201d etc., etc.\n\nWhenever she halted, she was presently surrounded by Ministers,\nGenerals, Congressmen, and all manner of aristocratic people.\nIntroductions followed, and then the usual original question, \u201cHow do\nyou like Washington, Miss Hawkins?\u201d supplemented by that other usual\noriginal question, \u201cIs this your first visit?\u201d\n\nThese two exciting topics being exhausted, conversation generally\ndrifted into calmer channels, only to be interrupted at frequent\nintervals by new introductions and new inquiries as to how Laura liked\nthe capital and whether it was her first visit or not. And thus for\nan hour or more the Duchess moved through the crush in a rapture of\nhappiness, for her doubts were dead and gone, now she knew she could\nconquer here. A familiar face appeared in the midst of the multitude and\nHarry Brierly fought his difficult way to her side, his eyes shouting\ntheir gratification, so to speak:\n\n\u201cOh, this is a happiness! Tell me, my dear Miss Hawkins--\u201d\n\n\u201cSh! I know what you are going to ask. I do like Washington--I like it\never so much!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but I was going to ask--\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I am coming to it, coming to it as fast as I can. It is my first\nvisit. I think you should know that yourself.\u201d\n\nAnd straightway a wave of the crowd swept her beyond his reach.\n\n\u201cNow what can the girl mean? Of course she likes Washington--I'm not\nsuch a dummy as to have to ask her that. And as to its being her first\nvisit, why bang it, she knows that I knew it was. Does she think I have\nturned idiot? Curious girl, anyway. But how they do swarm about her! She\nis the reigning belle of Washington after this night. She'll know five\nhundred of the heaviest guns in the town before this night's nonsense is\nover. And this isn't even the beginning. Just as I used to say--she'll\nbe a card in the matter of--yes sir! She shall turn the men's heads\nand I'll turn the women's! What a team that will be in politics here. I\nwouldn't take a quarter of a million for what I can do in this present\nsession--no indeed I wouldn't. Now, here--I don't altogether like this.\nThat insignificant secretary of legation is--why, she's smiling on him\nas if he--and now on the Admiral! Now she's illuminating that stuffy\nCongressman from Massachusetts--vulgar ungrammatcal shovel-maker--greasy\nknave of spades. I don't like this sort of thing. She doesn't appear to\nbe much distressed about me--she hasn't looked this way once. All right,\nmy bird of Paradise, if it suits you, go on. But I think I know your\nsex. I'll go to smiling around a little, too, and see what effect that\nwill have on you.\u201d\n\nAnd he did \u201csmile around a little,\u201d and got as near to her as he could\nto watch the effect, but the scheme was a failure--he could not get her\nattention. She seemed wholly unconscious of him, and so he could not\nflirt with any spirit; he could only talk disjointedly; he could not\nkeep his eyes on the charmers he talked to; he grew irritable, jealous,\nand very unhappy. He gave up his enterprise, leaned his shoulder against\na fluted pilaster and pouted while he kept watch upon Laura's every\nmovement. His other shoulder stole the bloom from many a lovely cheek\nthat brushed him in the surging crush, but he noted it not. He was too\nbusy cursing himself inwardly for being an egotistical imbecile. An hour\nago he had thought to take this country lass under his protection and\nshow her \u201clife\u201d and enjoy her wonder and delight--and here she was,\nimmersed in the marvel up to her eyes, and just a trifle more at home in\nit than he was himself. And now his angry comments ran on again:\n\n\u201cNow she's sweetening old Brother Balaam; and he--well he is inviting\nher to the Congressional prayer-meeting, no doubt--better let old\nDilworthy alone to see that she doesn't overlook that. And now its\nSplurge, of New York; and now its Batters of New Hampshire--and now the\nVice President! Well I may as well adjourn. I've got enough.\u201d\n\nBut he hadn't. He got as far as the door--and then struggled back to\ntake one more look, hating himself all the while for his weakness.\n\nToward midnight, when supper was announced, the crowd thronged to the\nsupper room where a long table was decked out with what seemed a rare\nrepast, but which consisted of things better calculated to feast the eye\nthan the appetite. The ladies were soon seated in files along the wall,\nand in groups here and there, and the colored waiters filled the plates\nand glasses and the male guests moved hither and thither conveying them\nto the privileged sex.\n\nHarry took an ice and stood up by the table with other gentlemen, and\nlistened to the buzz of conversation while he ate.\n\nFrom these remarks he learned a good deal about Laura that was news to\nhim. For instance, that she was of a distinguished western family;\nthat she was highly educated; that she was very rich and a great\nlanded heiress; that she was not a professor of religion, and yet was a\nChristian in the truest and best sense of the word, for her whole heart\nwas devoted to the accomplishment of a great and noble enterprise--none\nother than the sacrificing of her landed estates to the uplifting of the\ndown-trodden negro and the turning of his erring feet into the way of\nlight and righteousness. Harry observed that as soon as one listener\nhad absorbed the story, he turned about and delivered it to his next\nneighbor and the latter individual straightway passed it on. And thus he\nsaw it travel the round of the gentlemen and overflow rearward among the\nladies. He could not trace it backward to its fountain head, and so he\ncould not tell who it was that started it.\n\nOne thing annoyed Harry a great deal; and that was the reflection\nthat he might have been in Washington days and days ago and thrown his\nfascinations about Laura with permanent effect while she was new and\nstrange to the capital, instead of dawdling in Philadelphia to no\npurpose. He feared he had \u201cmissed a trick,\u201d as he expressed it.\n\nHe only found one little opportunity of speaking again with Laura before\nthe evening's festivities ended, and then, for the first time in years,\nhis airy self-complacency failed him, his tongue's easy confidence\nforsook it in a great measure, and he was conscious of an unheroic\ntimidity. He was glad to get away and find a place where he could\ndespise himself in private and try to grow his clipped plumes again.\n\nWhen Laura reached home she was tired but exultant, and Senator\nDilworthy was pleased and satisfied. He called Laura \u201cmy daughter,\u201d next\nmorning, and gave her some \u201cpin money,\u201d as he termed it, and she sent\na hundred and fifty dollars of it to her mother and loaned a trifle to\nCol. Sellers. Then the Senator had a long private conference with Laura,\nand unfolded certain plans of his for the good of the country, and\nreligion, and the poor, and temperance, and showed her how she could\nassist him in developing these worthy and noble enterprises.\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nLaura soon discovered that there were three distinct aristocracies\nin Washington. One of these, (nick-named the Antiques,) consisted of\ncultivated, high-bred old families who looked back with pride upon an\nancestry that had been always great in the nation's councils and its\nwars from the birth of the republic downward. Into this select circle it\nwas difficult to gain admission. No. 2 was the aristocracy of the middle\nground--of which, more anon. No. 3 lay beyond; of it we will say a word\nhere. We will call it the Aristocracy of the Parvenus--as, indeed, the\ngeneral public did. Official position, no matter how obtained, entitled\na man to a place in it, and carried his family with him, no matter\nwhence they sprang. Great wealth gave a man a still higher and nobler\nplace in it than did official position. If this wealth had been\nacquired by conspicuous ingenuity, with just a pleasant little spice of\nillegality about it, all the better. This aristocracy was \u201cfast,\u201d and\nnot averse to ostentation.\n\nThe aristocracy of the Antiques ignored the aristocracy of the Parvenus;\nthe Parvenus laughed at the Antiques, (and secretly envied them.)\n\nThere were certain important \u201csociety\u201d customs which one in Laura's\nposition needed to understand. For instance, when a lady of any\nprominence comes to one of our cities and takes up her residence, all\nthe ladies of her grade favor her in turn with an initial call, giving\ntheir cards to the servant at the door by way of introduction. They come\nsingly, sometimes; sometimes in couples; and always in elaborate full\ndress. They talk two minutes and a quarter and then go. If the lady\nreceiving the call desires a further acquaintance, she must return the\nvisit within two weeks; to neglect it beyond that time means \u201clet the\nmatter drop.\u201d But if she does return the visit within two weeks, it then\nbecomes the other party's privilege to continue the acquaintance or drop\nit. She signifies her willingness to continue it by calling again any\ntime within twelve-months; after that, if the parties go on calling upon\neach other once a year, in our large cities, that is sufficient, and\nthe acquaintanceship holds good. The thing goes along smoothly, now. The\nannual visits are made and returned with peaceful regularity and bland\nsatisfaction, although it is not necessary that the two ladies shall\nactually see each other oftener than once every few years. Their cards\npreserve the intimacy and keep the acquaintanceship intact.\n\nFor instance, Mrs. A. pays her annual visit, sits in her carriage and\nsends in her card with the lower right hand corner turned down, which\nsignifies that she has \u201ccalled in person;\u201d Mrs. B: sends down word that\nshe is \u201cengaged\u201d or \u201cwishes to be excused\u201d--or if she is a Parvenu and\nlow-bred, she perhaps sends word that she is \u201cnot at home.\u201d Very good;\nMrs. A. drives on happy and content. If Mrs. A.'s daughter marries, or\na child is born to the family, Mrs. B. calls, sends in her card with\nthe upper left hand corner turned down, and then goes along about her\naffairs--for that inverted corner means \u201cCongratulations.\u201d If Mrs. B.'s\nhusband falls downstairs and breaks his neck, Mrs. A. calls, leaves her\ncard with the upper right hand corner turned down, and then takes her\ndeparture; this corner means \u201cCondolence.\u201d It is very necessary to get\nthe corners right, else one may unintentionally condole with a friend on\na wedding or congratulate her upon a funeral. If either lady is about to\nleave the city, she goes to the other's house and leaves her card with\n\u201cP. P. C.\u201d engraved under the name--which signifies, \u201cPay Parting Call.\u201d\n But enough of etiquette. Laura was early instructed in the mysteries\nof society life by a competent mentor, and thus was preserved from\ntroublesome mistakes.\n\nThe first fashionable call she received from a member of the ancient\nnobility, otherwise the Antiques, was of a pattern with all she received\nfrom that limb of the aristocracy afterward. This call was paid by Mrs.\nMajor-General Fulke-Fulkerson and daughter. They drove up at one in the\nafternoon in a rather antiquated vehicle with a faded coat of arms on\nthe panels, an aged white-wooled negro coachman on the box and a younger\ndarkey beside him--the footman. Both of these servants were dressed in\ndull brown livery that had seen considerable service.\n\nThe ladies entered the drawing-room in full character; that is to say,\nwith Elizabethan stateliness on the part of the dowager, and an easy\ngrace and dignity on the part of the young lady that had a nameless\nsomething about it that suggested conscious superiority. The dresses of\nboth ladies were exceedingly rich, as to material, but as notably modest\nas to color and ornament. All parties having seated themselves, the\ndowager delivered herself of a remark that was not unusual in its form,\nand yet it came from her lips with the impressiveness of Scripture:\n\n\u201cThe weather has been unpropitious of late, Miss Hawkins.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has indeed,\u201d said Laura. \u201cThe climate seems to be variable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is its nature of old, here,\u201d said the daughter--stating it\napparently as a fact, only, and by her manner waving aside all personal\nresponsibility on account of it. \u201cIs it not so, mamma?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so, my child. Do you like winter, Miss Hawkins?\u201d She said \u201clike\u201d\n as if she had an idea that its dictionary meaning was \u201capprove of.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot as well as summer--though I think all seasons have their charms.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a very just remark. The general held similar views. He considered\nsnow in winter proper; sultriness in summer legitimate; frosts in the\nautumn the same, and rains in spring not objectionable. He was not an\nexacting man. And I call to mind now that he always admired thunder. You\nremember, child, your father always admired thunder?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe adored it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo doubt it reminded him of battle,\u201d said Laura.\n\n\u201cYes, I think perhaps it did. He had a great respect for Nature. He\noften said there was something striking about the ocean. You remember\nhis saying that, daughter?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, often, Mother. I remember it very well.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hurricanes... He took a great interest in hurricanes. And animals.\nDogs, especially--hunting dogs. Also comets. I think we all have our\npredilections. I think it is this that gives variety to our tastes.\u201d\n\nLaura coincided with this view.\n\n\u201cDo you find it hard and lonely to be so far from your home and friends,\nMiss Hawkins?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do find it depressing sometimes, but then there is so much about\nme here that is novel and interesting that my days are made up more of\nsunshine than shadow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWashington is not a dull city in the season,\u201d said the young lady. \u201cWe\nhave some very good society indeed, and one need not be at a loss for\nmeans to pass the time pleasantly. Are you fond of watering-places, Miss\nHawkins?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have really had no experience of them, but I have always felt a\nstrong desire to see something of fashionable watering-place life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe of Washington are unfortunately situated in that respect,\u201d said the\ndowager. \u201cIt is a tedious distance to Newport. But there is no help for\nit.\u201d\n\nLaura said to herself, \u201cLong Branch and Cape May are nearer than\nNewport; doubtless these places are low; I'll feel my way a little and\nsee.\u201d Then she said aloud:\n\n\u201cWhy I thought that Long Branch--\u201d\n\nThere was no need to \u201cfeel\u201d any further--there was that in both faces\nbefore her which made that truth apparent. The dowager said:\n\n\u201cNobody goes there, Miss Hawkins--at least only persons of no position\nin society. And the President.\u201d She added that with tranquility.\n\n\u201cNewport is damp, and cold, and windy and excessively disagreeable,\u201d\n said the daughter, \u201cbut it is very select. One cannot be fastidious\nabout minor matters when one has no choice.\u201d\n\nThe visit had spun out nearly three minutes, now. Both ladies rose with\ngrave dignity, conferred upon Laura a formal invitation to call, and\nthen retired from the conference. Laura remained in the drawing-room and\nleft them to pilot themselves out of the house--an inhospitable thing,\nit seemed to her, but then she was following her instructions. She\nstood, steeped in reverie, a while, and then she said:\n\n\u201cI think I could always enjoy icebergs--as scenery but not as company.\u201d\n\nStill, she knew these two people by reputation, and was aware that they\nwere not ice-bergs when they were in their own waters and amid their\nlegitimate surroundings, but on the contrary were people to be respected\nfor their stainless characters and esteemed for their social virtues\nand their benevolent impulses. She thought it a pity that they had to be\nsuch changed and dreary creatures on occasions of state.\n\nThe first call Laura received from the other extremity of the Washington\naristocracy followed close upon the heels of the one we have just been\ndescribing. The callers this time were the Hon. Mrs. Oliver Higgins,\nthe Hon. Mrs. Patrique Oreille (pronounced O-relay,) Miss Bridget\n(pronounced Breezhay) Oreille, Mrs. Peter Gashly, Miss Gashly, and Miss\nEmmeline Gashly.\n\nThe three carriages arrived at the same moment from different\ndirections. They were new and wonderfully shiny, and the brasses on the\nharness were highly polished and bore complicated monograms. There were\nshowy coats of arms, too, with Latin mottoes. The coachmen and footmen\nwere clad in bright new livery, of striking colors, and they had black\nrosettes with shaving-brushes projecting above them, on the sides of\ntheir stove-pipe hats.\n\nWhen the visitors swept into the drawing-room they filled the place with\na suffocating sweetness procured at the perfumer's. Their costumes,\nas to architecture, were the latest fashion intensified; they were\nrainbow-hued; they were hung with jewels--chiefly diamonds. It would\nhave been plain to any eye that it had cost something to upholster these\nwomen.\n\nThe Hon. Mrs. Oliver Higgins was the wife of a delegate from a distant\nterritory--a gentleman who had kept the principal \u201csaloon,\u201d and sold\nthe best whiskey in the principal village in his wilderness, and so,\nof course, was recognized as the first man of his commonwealth and its\nfittest representative.\n\nHe was a man of paramount influence at home, for he was public spirited,\nhe was chief of the fire department, he had an admirable command of\nprofane language, and had killed several \u201cparties.\u201d His shirt fronts\nwere always immaculate; his boots daintily polished, and no man could\nlift a foot and fire a dead shot at a stray speck of dirt on it with a\nwhite handkerchief with a finer grace than he; his watch chain weighed a\npound; the gold in his finger ring was worth forty five dollars; he wore\na diamond cluster-pin and he parted his hair behind. He had always been\nregarded as the most elegant gentleman in his territory, and it was\nconceded by all that no man thereabouts was anywhere near his equal\nin the telling of an obscene story except the venerable white-haired\ngovernor himself. The Hon. Higgins had not come to serve his country\nin Washington for nothing. The appropriation which he had engineered\nthrough Congress for the maintenance of the Indians in his Territory\nwould have made all those savages rich if it had ever got to them.\n\nThe Hon. Mrs. Higgins was a picturesque woman, and a fluent talker, and\nshe held a tolerably high station among the Parvenus. Her English was\nfair enough, as a general thing--though, being of New York origin, she\nhad the fashion peculiar to many natives of that city of pronouncing saw\nand law as if they were spelt sawr and lawr.\n\nPetroleum was the agent that had suddenly transformed the Gashlys from\nmodest hard-working country village folk into \u201cloud\u201d aristocrats and\nornaments of the city.\n\nThe Hon. Patrique Oreille was a wealthy Frenchman from Cork. Not that he\nwas wealthy when he first came from Cork, but just the reverse. When\nhe first landed in New York with his wife, he had only halted at Castle\nGarden for a few minutes to receive and exhibit papers showing that he\nhad resided in this country two years--and then he voted the democratic\nticket and went up town to hunt a house. He found one and then went to\nwork as assistant to an architect and builder, carrying a hod all day\nand studying politics evenings. Industry and economy soon enabled him\nto start a low rum shop in a foul locality, and this gave him political\ninfluence. In our country it is always our first care to see that\nour people have the opportunity of voting for their choice of men to\nrepresent and govern them--we do not permit our great officials to\nappoint the little officials. We prefer to have so tremendous a power\nas that in our own hands. We hold it safest to elect our judges and\neverybody else. In our cities, the ward meetings elect delegates to the\nnominating conventions and instruct them whom to nominate. The publicans\nand their retainers rule the ward meetings (for everybody else hates\nthe worry of politics and stays at home); the delegates from the ward\nmeetings organize as a nominating convention and make up a list\nof candidates--one convention offering a democratic and another a\nrepublican list of incorruptibles; and then the great meek public come\nforward at the proper time and make unhampered choice and bless Heaven\nthat they live in a free land where no form of despotism can ever\nintrude.\n\nPatrick O'Riley (as his name then stood) created friends and influence\nvery fast, for he was always on hand at the police courts to give straw\nbail for his customers or establish an alibi for them in case they had\nbeen beating anybody to death on his premises. Consequently he presently\nbecame a political leader, and was elected to a petty office under the\ncity government. Out of a meager salary he soon saved money enough to\nopen quite a stylish liquor saloon higher up town, with a faro bank\nattached and plenty of capital to conduct it with. This gave him fame\nand great respectability. The position of alderman was forced upon him,\nand it was just the same as presenting him a gold mine. He had fine\nhorses and carriages, now, and closed up his whiskey mill.\n\nBy and by he became a large contractor for city work, and was a bosom\nfriend of the great and good Wm. M. Weed himself, who had stolen\n$20,600,000 from the city and was a man so envied, so honored,--so\nadored, indeed, that when the sheriff went to his office to arrest\nhim as a felon, that sheriff blushed and apologized, and one of the\nillustrated papers made a picture of the scene and spoke of the matter\nin such a way as to show that the editor regretted that the offense of\nan arrest had been offered to so exalted a personage as Mr. Weed.\n\nMr. O'Riley furnished shingle nails to the new Court House at three\nthousand dollars a keg, and eighteen gross of 60-cent thermometers at\nfifteen hundred dollars a dozen; the controller and the board of audit\npassed the bills, and a mayor, who was simply ignorant but not criminal,\nsigned them. When they were paid, Mr. O'Riley's admirers gave him a\nsolitaire diamond pin of the size of a filbert, in imitation of the\nliberality of Mr. Weed's friends, and then Mr. O'Riley retired from\nactive service and amused himself with buying real estate at enormous\nfigures and holding it in other people's names. By and by the\nnewspapers came out with exposures and called Weed and O'Riley\n\u201cthieves,\u201d--whereupon the people rose as one man (voting repeatedly)\nand elected the two gentlemen to their proper theatre of action, the New\nYork legislature. The newspapers clamored, and the courts proceeded to\ntry the new legislators for their small irregularities. Our admirable\njury system enabled the persecuted ex-officials to secure a jury of nine\ngentlemen from a neighboring asylum and three graduates from Sing-Sing,\nand presently they walked forth with characters vindicated. The\nlegislature was called upon to spew them forth--a thing which the\nlegislature declined to do. It was like asking children to repudiate\ntheir own father. It was a legislature of the modern pattern.\n\nBeing now wealthy and distinguished, Mr. O'Riley, still bearing the\nlegislative \u201cHon.\u201d attached to his name (for titles never die in\nAmerica, although we do take a republican pride in poking fun at such\ntrifles), sailed for Europe with his family. They traveled all about,\nturning their noses up at every thing, and not finding it a difficult\nthing to do, either, because nature had originally given those features\na cast in that direction; and finally they established themselves in\nParis, that Paradise of Americans of their sort.--They staid there two\nyears and learned to speak English with a foreign accent--not that it\nhadn't always had a foreign accent (which was indeed the case) but now\nthe nature of it was changed. Finally they returned home and became\nultra fashionables. They landed here as the Hon. Patrique Oreille and\nfamily, and so are known unto this day.\n\nLaura provided seats for her visitors and they immediately launched\nforth into a breezy, sparkling conversation with that easy confidence\nwhich is to be found only among persons accustomed to high life.\n\n\u201cI've been intending to call sooner, Miss Hawkins,\u201d said the Hon. Mrs.\nOreille, \u201cbut the weather's been so horrid. How do you like Washington?\u201d\n\nLaura liked it very well indeed.\n\nMrs. Gashly--\u201cIs it your first visit?\u201d\n\nYes, it was her first.\n\nAll--\u201cIndeed?\u201d\n\nMrs. Oreille--\u201cI'm afraid you'll despise the weather, Miss Hawkins. It's\nperfectly awful. It always is. I tell Mr. Oreille I can't and I won't\nput up with any such a climate. If we were obliged to do it, I wouldn't\nmind it; but we are not obliged to, and so I don't see the use of it.\nSometimes its real pitiful the way the childern pine for Parry--don't\nlook so sad, Bridget, 'ma chere'--poor child, she can't hear Parry\nmentioned without getting the blues.\u201d\n\nMrs. Gashly--\u201cWell I should think so, Mrs. Oreille. A body lives in\nParis, but a body, only stays here. I dote on Paris; I'd druther scrimp\nalong on ten thousand dollars a year there, than suffer and worry here\non a real decent income.\u201d\n\nMiss Gashly--\u201cWell then, I wish you'd take us back, mother; I'm sure I\nhate this stoopid country enough, even if it is our dear native land.\u201d\n\nMiss Emmeline Gashly--\u201cWhat and leave poor Johnny Peterson behind?\u201d [An\nairy genial laugh applauded this sally].\n\nMiss Gashly--\u201cSister, I should think you'd be ashamed of yourself!\u201d\n\nMiss Emmeline--\u201cOh, you needn't ruffle your feathers so: I was\nonly joking. He don't mean anything by coming to the house every\nevening--only comes to see mother. Of course that's all!\u201d [General\nlaughter].\n\nMiss G. prettily confused--\u201cEmmeline, how can you!\u201d\n\nMrs. G.--\u201cLet your sister alone, Emmeline. I never saw such a tease!\u201d\n\nMrs. Oreille--\u201cWhat lovely corals you have, Miss Hawkins! Just look\nat them, Bridget, dear. I've a great passion for corals--it's a pity\nthey're getting a little common. I have some elegant ones--not as\nelegant as yours, though--but of course I don't wear them now.\u201d\n\nLaura--\u201cI suppose they are rather common, but still I have a great\naffection for these, because they were given to me by a dear old\nfriend of our family named Murphy. He was a very charming man, but very\neccentric. We always supposed he was an Irishman, but after he got rich\nhe went abroad for a year or two, and when he came back you would have\nbeen amused to see how interested he was in a potato.\n\nHe asked what it was! Now you know that when Providence shapes a mouth\nespecially for the accommodation of a potato you can detect that fact at\na glance when that mouth is in repose--foreign travel can never remove\nthat sign. But he was a very delightful gentleman, and his little foible\ndid not hurt him at all. We all have our shams--I suppose there is a\nsham somewhere about every individual, if we could manage to ferret\nit out. I would so like to go to France. I suppose our society here\ncompares very favorably with French society does it not, Mrs. Oreille?\u201d\n\nMrs. O.--\u201cNot by any means, Miss Hawkins! French society is much more\nelegant--much more so.\u201d\n\nLaura--\u201cI am sorry to hear that. I suppose ours has deteriorated of\nlate.\u201d\n\nMrs. O.--\u201cVery much indeed. There are people in society here that have\nreally no more money to live on than what some of us pay for servant\nhire. Still I won't say but what some of them are very good people--and\nrespectable, too.\u201d\n\nLaura--\u201cThe old families seem to be holding themselves aloof, from what\nI hear. I suppose you seldom meet in society now, the people you used to\nbe familiar with twelve or fifteen years ago?\u201d\n\nMrs. O.--\u201cOh, no-hardly ever.\u201d\n\nMr. O'Riley kept his first rum-mill and protected his customers from\nthe law in those days, and this turn of the conversation was rather\nuncomfortable to madame than otherwise.\n\nHon. Mrs. Higgins--\u201cIs Francois' health good now, Mrs. Oreille?\u201d\n\nMrs. O.--(Thankful for the intervention)--\u201cNot very. A body couldn't\nexpect it. He was always delicate--especially his lungs--and this odious\nclimate tells on him strong, now, after Parry, which is so mild.\u201d\n\nMrs. H:--\u201cI should think so. Husband says Percy'll die if he don't have\na change; and so I'm going to swap round a little and see what can be\ndone. I saw a lady from Florida last week, and she recommended Key\nWest. I told her Percy couldn't abide winds, as he was threatened with a\npulmonary affection, and then she said try St. Augustine. It's an awful\ndistance--ten or twelve hundred mile, they say but then in a case of\nthis kind--a body can't stand back for trouble, you know.\u201d\n\nMrs. O.--\u201cNo, of course that's off. If Francois don't get better soon\nwe've got to look out for some other place, or else Europe. We've\nthought some of the Hot Springs, but I don't know. It's a great\nresponsibility and a body wants to go cautious. Is Hildebrand about\nagain, Mrs. Gashly?\u201d\n\nMrs. G.--\u201cYes, but that's about all. It was indigestion, you know, and\nit looks as if it was chronic. And you know I do dread dyspepsia. We've\nall been worried a good deal about him. The doctor recommended baked\napple and spoiled meat, and I think it done him good. It's about the\nonly thing that will stay on his stomach now-a-days. We have Dr. Shovel\nnow. Who's your doctor, Mrs. Higgins?\u201d\n\nMrs. H.--\u201cWell, we had Dr. Spooner a good while, but he runs so much to\nemetics, which I think are weakening, that we changed off and took Dr.\nLeathers. We like him very much. He has a fine European reputation, too.\nThe first thing he suggested for Percy was to have him taken out in the\nback yard for an airing, every afternoon, with nothing at all on.\u201d\n\nMrs. O. and Mrs. G.--\u201cWhat!\u201d\n\nMrs. H.--\u201cAs true as I'm sitting here. And it actually helped him for\ntwo or three days; it did indeed. But after that the doctor said it\nseemed to be too severe and so he has fell back on hot foot-baths at\nnight and cold showers in the morning. But I don't think there can be\nany good sound help for him in such a climate as this. I believe we are\ngoing to lose him if we don't make a change.\u201d\n\nMrs. O. \u201cI suppose you heard of the fright we had two weeks ago last\nSaturday? No? Why that is strange--but come to remember, you've all\nbeen away to Richmond. Francois tumbled from the sky light--in the\nsecond-story hall clean down to the first floor--\u201d\n\nEverybody--\u201cMercy!\u201d\n\nMrs. O.--\u201cYes indeed--and broke two of his ribs--\u201d\n\nEverybody--\u201cWhat!\u201d\n\nMrs. O. \u201cJust as true as you live. First we thought he must be injured\ninternally. It was fifteen minutes past 8 in the evening. Of course we\nwere all distracted in a moment--everybody was flying everywhere, and\nnobody doing anything worth anything. By and by I flung out next door\nand dragged in Dr. Sprague; President of the Medical University no time\nto go for our own doctor of course--and the minute he saw Francois he\nsaid, 'Send for your own physician, madam;' said it as cross as a bear,\ntoo, and turned right on his heel, and cleared out without doing a\nthing!\u201d\n\nEverybody--\u201cThe mean, contemptible brute!\u201d\n\nMrs. O--\u201cWell you may say it. I was nearly out of my wits by this time.\nBut we hurried off the servants after our own doctor and telegraphed\nmother--she was in New York and rushed down on the first train; and when\nthe doctor got there, lo and behold you he found Francois had broke one\nof his legs, too!\u201d\n\nEverybody--\u201cGoodness!\u201d\n\nMrs. O.--\u201cYes. So he set his leg and bandaged it up, and fixed his ribs\nand gave him a dose of something to quiet down his excitement and put\nhim to sleep--poor thing he was trembling and frightened to death and it\nwas pitiful to see him. We had him in my bed--Mr. Oreille slept in the\nguest room and I laid down beside Francois--but not to sleep bless you\nno. Bridget and I set up all night, and the doctor staid till two in the\nmorning, bless his old heart.--When mother got there she was so used up\nwith anxiety, that she had to go to bed and have the doctor; but when\nshe found that Francois was not in immediate danger she rallied, and\nby night she was able to take a watch herself. Well for three days and\nnights we three never left that bedside only to take an hour's nap at\na time. And then the doctor said Francois was out of danger and if ever\nthere was a thankful set, in this world, it was us.\u201d\n\nLaura's respect for these women had augmented during this conversation,\nnaturally enough; affection and devotion are qualities that are able to\nadorn and render beautiful a character that is otherwise unattractive,\nand even repulsive.\n\nMrs. Gashly--\u201cI do believe I should a died if I had been in your place,\nMrs. Oreille. The time Hildebrand was so low with the pneumonia Emmeline\nand me were all alone with him most of the time and we never took a\nminute's sleep for as much as two days and nights. It was at Newport and\nwe wouldn't trust hired nurses. One afternoon he had a fit, and jumped\nup and run out on the portico of the hotel with nothing in the world on\nand the wind a blowing like ice and we after him scared to death;\nand when the ladies and gentlemen saw that he had a fit, every lady\nscattered for her room and not a gentleman lifted his hand to help, the\nwretches! Well after that his life hung by a thread for as much as ten\ndays, and the minute he was out of danger Emmeline and me just went to\nbed sick and worn out. I never want to pass through such a time again.\nPoor dear Francois--which leg did he break, Mrs. Oreille!\u201d\n\nMrs. O.--\u201cIt was his right hand hind leg. Jump down, Francois dear, and\nshow the ladies what a cruel limp you've got yet.\u201d\n\nFrancois demurred, but being coaxed and delivered gently upon the floor,\nhe performed very satisfactorily, with his \u201cright hand hind leg\u201d in the\nair. All were affected--even Laura--but hers was an affection of the\nstomach. The country-bred girl had not suspected that the little whining\nten-ounce black and tan reptile, clad in a red embroidered pigmy\nblanket and reposing in Mrs. Oreille's lap all through the visit was the\nindividual whose sufferings had been stirring the dormant generosities\nof her nature. She said:\n\n\u201cPoor little creature! You might have lost him!\u201d\n\nMrs. O.--\u201cO pray don't mention it, Miss Hawkins--it gives me such a\nturn!\u201d\n\nLaura--\u201cAnd Hildebrand and Percy--are they--are they like this one?\u201d\n\nMrs. G.--\u201cNo, Hilly has considerable Skye blood in him, I believe.\u201d\n\nMrs. H.--\u201cPercy's the same, only he is two months and ten days older and\nhas his ears cropped. His father, Martin Farquhar Tupper, was sickly,\nand died young, but he was the sweetest disposition.--His mother had\nheart disease but was very gentle and resigned, and a wonderful ratter.\u201d As impossible and exasperating as this conversation may sound to a person who is not an idiot, it is scarcely in any respect an exaggeration of one which one of us actually listened to in an American drawing room--otherwise we could not venture to put such a chapter into a book which, professes to deal with social possibilities.--THE AUTHORS.]\nSo carried away had the visitors become by their interest attaching to\nthis discussion of family matters, that their stay had been prolonged to\na very improper and unfashionable length; but they suddenly recollected\nthemselves now and took their departure.\n\nLaura's scorn was boundless. The more she thought of these people and\ntheir extraordinary talk, the more offensive they seemed to her; and\nyet she confessed that if one must choose between the two extreme\naristocracies it might be best, on the whole, looking at things from a\nstrictly business point of view, to herd with the Parvenus; she was in\nWashington solely to compass a certain matter and to do it at any cost,\nand these people might be useful to her, while it was plain that her\npurposes and her schemes for pushing them would not find favor in the\neyes of the Antiques. If it came to choice--and it might come to that,\nsooner or later--she believed she could come to a decision without much\ndifficulty or many pangs.\n\nBut the best aristocracy of the three Washington castes, and really the\nmost powerful, by far, was that of the Middle Ground: It was made up of\nthe families of public men from nearly every state in the Union--men\nwho held positions in both the executive and legislative branches of the\ngovernment, and whose characters had been for years blemishless, both\nat home and at the capital. These gentlemen and their households were\nunostentatious people; they were educated and refined; they troubled\nthemselves but little about the two other orders of nobility, but moved\nserenely in their wide orbit, confident in their own strength and\nwell aware of the potency of their influence. They had no troublesome\nappearances to keep up, no rivalries which they cared to distress\nthemselves about, no jealousies to fret over. They could afford to mind\ntheir own affairs and leave other combinations to do the same or\ndo otherwise, just as they chose. They were people who were beyond\nreproach, and that was sufficient.\n\nSenator Dilworthy never came into collision with any of these factions.\nHe labored for them all and with them all. He said that all men\nwere brethren and all were entitled to the honest unselfish help and\ncountenance of a Christian laborer in the public vineyard.\n\nLaura concluded, after reflection, to let circumstances determine\nthe course it might be best for her to pursue as regarded the several\naristocracies.\n\nNow it might occur to the reader that perhaps Laura had been somewhat\nrudely suggestive in her remarks to Mrs. Oreille when the subject of\ncorals was under discussion, but it did not occur to Laura herself. She\nwas not a person of exaggerated refinement; indeed, the society and\nthe influences that had formed her character had not been of a nature\ncalculated to make her so; she thought that \u201cgive and take was fair\nplay,\u201d and that to parry an offensive thrust with a sarcasm was a neat\nand legitimate thing to do. She sometimes talked to people in a way\nwhich some ladies would consider, actually shocking; but Laura rather\nprided herself upon some of her exploits of that character. We are sorry\nwe cannot make her a faultless heroine; but we cannot, for the reason\nthat she was human.\n\nShe considered herself a superior conversationist. Long ago, when the\npossibility had first been brought before her mind that some day she\nmight move in Washington society, she had recognized the fact that\npracticed conversational powers would be a necessary weapon in that\nfield; she had also recognized the fact that since her dealings there\nmust be mainly with men, and men whom she supposed to be exceptionally\ncultivated and able, she would need heavier shot in her magazine than\nmere brilliant \u201csociety\u201d nothings; whereupon she had at once entered\nupon a tireless and elaborate course of reading, and had never since\nceased to devote every unoccupied moment to this sort of preparation.\nHaving now acquired a happy smattering of various information, she used\nit with good effect--she passed for a singularly well informed woman in\nWashington. The quality of her literary tastes had necessarily undergone\nconstant improvement under this regimen, and as necessarily, also the\nduality of her language had improved, though it cannot be denied that\nnow and then her former condition of life betrayed itself in just\nperceptible inelegancies of expression and lapses of grammar.\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nWhen Laura had been in Washington three months, she was still the same\nperson, in one respect, that she was when she first arrived there--that\nis to say, she still bore the name of Laura Hawkins. Otherwise she was\nperceptibly changed.--\n\nShe had arrived in a state of grievous uncertainty as to what manner of\nwoman she was, physically and intellectually, as compared with eastern\nwomen; she was well satisfied, now, that her beauty was confessed, her\nmind a grade above the average, and her powers of fascination rather\nextraordinary. So she was at ease upon those points. When she arrived,\nshe was possessed of habits of economy and not possessed of money; now\nshe dressed elaborately, gave but little thought to the cost of things,\nand was very well fortified financially. She kept her mother and\nWashington freely supplied with money, and did the same by Col.\nSellers--who always insisted upon giving his note for loans--with\ninterest; he was rigid upon that; she must take interest; and one of the\nColonel's greatest satisfactions was to go over his accounts and note\nwhat a handsome sum this accruing interest amounted to, and what a\ncomfortable though modest support it would yield Laura in case reverses\nshould overtake her.\n\nIn truth he could not help feeling that he was an efficient shield for\nher against poverty; and so, if her expensive ways ever troubled him for\na brief moment, he presently dismissed the thought and said to himself,\n\u201cLet her go on--even if she loses everything she is still safe--this\ninterest will always afford her a good easy income.\u201d\n\nLaura was on excellent terms with a great many members of Congress, and\nthere was an undercurrent of suspicion in some quarters that she was one\nof that detested class known as \u201clobbyists;\u201d but what belle could escape\nslander in such a city? Fairminded people declined to condemn her on\nmere suspicion, and so the injurious talk made no very damaging headway.\nShe was very gay, now, and very celebrated, and she might well expect to\nbe assailed by many kinds of gossip. She was growing used to celebrity,\nand could already sit calm and seemingly unconscious, under the fire of\nfifty lorgnettes in a theatre, or even overhear the low voice \u201cThat's\nshe!\u201d as she passed along the street without betraying annoyance.\n\nThe whole air was full of a vague vast scheme which was to eventuate in\nfilling Laura's pockets with millions of money; some had one idea of the\nscheme, and some another, but nobody had any exact knowledge upon the\nsubject. All that any one felt sure about, was that Laura's landed\nestates were princely in value and extent, and that the government was\nanxious to get hold of them for public purposes, and that Laura was\nwilling to make the sale but not at all anxious about the matter and\nnot at all in a hurry. It was whispered that Senator Dilworthy was a\nstumbling block in the way of an immediate sale, because he was\nresolved that the government should not have the lands except with the\nunderstanding that they should be devoted to the uplifting of the negro\nrace; Laura did not care what they were devoted to, it was said, (a\nworld of very different gossip to the contrary notwithstanding,) but\nthere were several other heirs and they would be guided entirely by the\nSenator's wishes; and finally, many people averred that while it would\nbe easy to sell the lands to the government for the benefit of the\nnegro, by resorting to the usual methods of influencing votes, Senator\nDilworthy was unwilling to have so noble a charity sullied by any taint\nof corruption--he was resolved that not a vote should be bought. Nobody\ncould get anything definite from Laura about these matters, and so\ngossip had to feed itself chiefly upon guesses. But the effect of it\nall was, that Laura was considered to be very wealthy and likely to be\nvastly more so in a little while. Consequently she was much courted and\nas much envied: Her wealth attracted many suitors. Perhaps they came\nto worship her riches, but they remained to worship her. Some of the\nnoblest men of the time succumbed to her fascinations. She frowned upon\nno lover when he made his first advances, but by and by when she was\nhopelessly enthralled, he learned from her own lips that she had formed\na resolution never to marry. Then he would go away hating and cursing\nthe whole sex, and she would calmly add his scalp to her string, while\nshe mused upon the bitter day that Col. Selby trampled her love and her\npride in the dust. In time it came to be said that her way was paved\nwith broken hearts.\n\nPoor Washington gradually woke up to the fact that he too was an\nintellectual marvel as well as his gifted sister. He could not conceive\nhow it had come about (it did not occur to him that the gossip about his\nfamily's great wealth had any thing to do with it). He could not account\nfor it by any process of reasoning, and was simply obliged to accept the\nfact and give up trying to solve the riddle. He found himself dragged\ninto society and courted, wondered at and envied very much as if he\nwere one of those foreign barbers who flit over here now and then with\na self-conferred title of nobility and marry some rich fool's absurd\ndaughter. Sometimes at a dinner party or a reception he would find\nhimself the centre of interest, and feel unutterably uncomfortable in\nthe discovery. Being obliged to say something, he would mine his brain\nand put in a blast and when the smoke and flying debris had cleared away\nthe result would be what seemed to him but a poor little intellectual\nclod of dirt or two, and then he would be astonished to see everybody as\nlost in admiration as if he had brought up a ton or two of virgin gold.\nEvery remark he made delighted his hearers and compelled their applause;\nhe overheard people say he was exceedingly bright--they were chiefly\nmammas and marriageable young ladies. He found that some of his good\nthings were being repeated about the town. Whenever he heard of an\ninstance of this kind, he would keep that particular remark in mind and\nanalyze it at home in private. At first he could not see that the remark\nwas anything better than a parrot might originate; but by and by he\nbegan to feel that perhaps he underrated his powers; and after that he\nused to analyze his good things with a deal of comfort, and find in\nthem a brilliancy which would have been unapparent to him in earlier\ndays--and then he would make a note of that good thing and say it again\nthe first time he found himself in a new company. Presently he had\nsaved up quite a repertoire of brilliancies; and after that he confined\nhimself to repeating these and ceased to originate any more, lest he\nmight injure his reputation by an unlucky effort.\n\nHe was constantly having young ladies thrust upon his notice at\nreceptions, or left upon his hands at parties, and in time he began to\nfeel that he was being deliberately persecuted in this way; and after\nthat he could not enjoy society because of his constant dread of these\nfemale ambushes and surprises. He was distressed to find that nearly\nevery time he showed a young lady a polite attention he was straightway\nreported to be engaged to her; and as some of these reports got into the\nnewspapers occasionally, he had to keep writing to Louise that they\nwere lies and she must believe in him and not mind them or allow them to\ngrieve her.\n\nWashington was as much in the dark as anybody with regard to the great\nwealth that was hovering in the air and seemingly on the point of\ntumbling into the family pocket. Laura would give him no satisfaction.\nAll she would say, was:\n\n\u201cWait. Be patient. You will see.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut will it be soon, Laura?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will not be very long, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what makes you think so?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have reasons--and good ones. Just wait, and be patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut is it going to be as much as people say it is?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do they say it is?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, ever so much. Millions!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it will be a great sum.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how great, Laura? Will it be millions?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you may call it that. Yes, it will be millions. There, now--does\nthat satisfy you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSplendid! I can wait. I can wait patiently--ever so patiently. Once I\nwas near selling the land for twenty thousand dollars; once for thirty\nthousand dollars; once after that for seven thousand dollars; and once\nfor forty thousand dollars--but something always told me not to do it.\nWhat a fool I would have been to sell it for such a beggarly trifle! It\nis the land that's to bring the money, isn't it Laura? You can tell me\nthat much, can't you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I don't mind saying that much. It is the land.\n\n\u201cBut mind--don't ever hint that you got it from me. Don't mention me in\nthe matter at all, Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right--I won't. Millions! Isn't it splendid! I mean to look around\nfor a building lot; a lot with fine ornamental shrubbery and all\nthat sort of thing. I will do it to-day. And I might as well see an\narchitect, too, and get him to go to work at a plan for a house. I don't\nintend to spare any expense; I mean to have the noblest house that money\ncan build.\u201d Then after a pause--he did not notice Laura's smiles\n\u201cLaura, would you lay the main hall in encaustic tiles, or just in fancy\npatterns of hard wood?\u201d\n\nLaura laughed a good old-fashioned laugh that had more of her former\nnatural self about it than any sound that had issued from her mouth in\nmany weeks. She said:\n\n\u201cYou don't change, Washington. You still begin to squander a fortune\nright and left the instant you hear of it in the distance; you never\nwait till the foremost dollar of it arrives within a hundred miles of\nyou,\u201d --and she kissed her brother good bye and left him weltering in\nhis dreams, so to speak.\n\nHe got up and walked the floor feverishly during two hours; and when he\nsat down he had married Louise, built a house, reared a family, married\nthem off, spent upwards of eight hundred thousand dollars on mere\nluxuries, and died worth twelve millions.\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nLaura went down stairs, knocked at/the study door, and entered, scarcely\nwaiting for the response. Senator Dilworthy was alone--with an open\nBible in his hand, upside down. Laura smiled, and said, forgetting her\nacquired correctness of speech,\n\n\u201cIt is only me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, come in, sit down,\u201d and the Senator closed the book and laid it\ndown. \u201cI wanted to see you. Time to report progress from the committee\nof the whole,\u201d and the Senator beamed with his own congressional wit.\n\n\u201cIn the committee of the whole things are working very well. We have\nmade ever so much progress in a week. I believe that you and I together\ncould run this government beautifully, uncle.\u201d\n\nThe Senator beamed again. He liked to be called \u201cuncle\u201d by this\nbeautiful woman.\n\n\u201cDid you see Hopperson last night after the congressional prayer\nmeeting?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. He came. He's a kind of--\u201d\n\n\u201cEh? he is one of my friends, Laura. He's a fine man, a very fine man.\nI don't know any man in congress I'd sooner go to for help in any\nChristian work. What did he say?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, he beat around a little. He said he should like to help the negro,\nhis heart went out to the negro, and all that--plenty of them say\nthat but he was a little afraid of the Tennessee Land bill; if Senator\nDilworthy wasn't in it, he should suspect there was a fraud on the\ngovernment.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said that, did he?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. And he said he felt he couldn't vote for it. He was shy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot shy, child, cautious. He's a very cautious man. I have been with\nhim a great deal on conference committees. He wants reasons, good ones.\nDidn't you show him he was in error about the bill?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did. I went over the whole thing. I had to tell him some of the side\narrangements, some of the--\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn't mention me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no. I told him you were daft about the negro and the philanthropy\npart of it, as you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaft is a little strong, Laura. But you know that I wouldn't touch this\nbill if it were not for the public good, and for the good of the colored\nrace; much as I am interested in the heirs of this property, and would\nlike to have them succeed.\u201d\n\nLaura looked a little incredulous, and the Senator proceeded.\n\n\u201cDon't misunderstand me, I don't deny that it is for the interest of\nall of us that this bill should go through, and it will. I have no\nconcealments from you. But I have one principle in my public life, which\nI should like you to keep in mind; it has always been my guide. I never\npush a private interest if it is not Justified and ennobled by some\nlarger public good. I doubt if a Christian would be justified in working\nfor his own salvation if it was not to aid in the salvation of his\nfellow men.\u201d\n\nThe Senator spoke with feeling, and then added,\n\n\u201cI hope you showed Hopperson that our motives were pure?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and he seemed to have a new light on the measure: I think will\nvote for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope so; his name will give tone and strength to it. I knew you would\nonly have to show him that it was just and pure, in order to secure his\ncordial support.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I convinced him. Yes, I am perfectly sure he will vote right\nnow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's good, that's good,\u201d said the Senator; smiling, and rubbing his\nhands. \u201cIs there anything more?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou'll find some changes in that I guess,\u201d handing the Senator a\nprinted list of names. \u201cThose checked off are all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh--'m--'m,\u201d running his eye down the list. \u201cThat's encouraging. What\nis the 'C' before some of the names, and the 'B. B.'?\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are my private marks. That 'C' stands for 'convinced,' with\nargument. The 'B. B.' is a general sign for a relative. You see it\nstands before three of the Hon. Committee. I expect to see the chairman\nof the committee to-day, Mr. Buckstone.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you must, he ought to be seen without any delay. Buckstone is a\nworldly sort of a fellow, but he has charitable impulses. If we secure\nhim we shall have a favorable report by the committee, and it will be\na great thing to be able to state that fact quietly where it will do\ngood.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I saw Senator Balloon\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will help us, I suppose? Balloon is a whole-hearted fellow. I can't\nhelp loving that man, for all his drollery and waggishness. He puts on\nan air of levity sometimes, but there aint a man in the senate knows the\nscriptures as he does. He did not make any objections?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot exactly, he said--shall I tell you what he said?\u201d asked Laura\nglancing furtively at him.\n\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said he had no doubt it was a good thing; if Senator Dilworthy was\nin it, it would pay to look into it.\u201d\n\nThe Senator laughed, but rather feebly, and said, \u201cBalloon is always\nfull of his jokes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI explained it to him. He said it was all right, he only wanted a word\nwith you,\u201d, continued Laura. \u201cHe is a handsome old gentleman, and he is\ngallant for an old man.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy daughter,\u201d said the Senator, with a grave look, \u201cI trust there was\nnothing free in his manner?\u201d\n\n\u201cFree?\u201d repeated Laura, with indignation in her face. \u201cWith me!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, child. I meant nothing, Balloon talks a little freely\nsometimes, with men. But he is right at heart. His term expires next\nyear and I fear we shall lose him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe seemed to be packing the day I was there. His rooms were full of\ndry goods boxes, into which his servant was crowding all manner of old\nclothes and stuff: I suppose he will paint 'Pub. Docs' on them and frank\nthem home. That's good economy, isn't it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, but child, all Congressmen do that. It may not be strictly\nhonest, indeed it is not unless he had some public documents mixed in\nwith the clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's a funny world. Good-bye, uncle. I'm going to see that chairman.\u201d\n\nAnd humming a cheery opera air, she departed to her room to dress for\ngoing out. Before she did that, however, she took out her note book and\nwas soon deep in its contents; marking, dashing, erasing, figuring, and\ntalking to herself.\n\n\u201cFree! I wonder what Dilworthy does think of me anyway? One . . . two .\n. . eight . . . seventeen . . . twenty-one . . . 'm'm . . . it takes a\nheap for a majority. Wouldn't Dilworthy open his eyes if he knew some\nof the things Balloon did say to me. There . . . . Hopperson's influence\nought to count twenty . . . the sanctimonious old curmudgeon. Son-in-law\n. . . sinecure in the negro institution. . . . That about gauges him. .\n. . The three committeemen . . . sons-in-law. Nothing like a son-in-law\nhere in Washington or a brother-in-law. . . . And everybody has 'em. .\n. .Let's see: . . . sixty-one. . . . with places . . . twenty-five . .\n. persuaded--it is getting on; . . . . we'll have two-thirds of Congress\nin time . . . Dilworthy must surely know I understand him. Uncle\nDilworthy . . . . Uncle Balloon!--Tells very amusing stories . . .\nwhen ladies are not present . . . I should think so . . . .'m . . . 'm.\nEighty-five. There. I must find that chairman. Queer. . . . Buckstone\nacts. . . . Seemed to be in love . . . . . I was sure of it. He promised\nto come here . . . and he hasn't. . . . Strange. Very strange . . . . I\nmust chance to meet him to-day.\u201d\n\nLaura dressed and went out, thinking she was perhaps too early for Mr.\nBuckstone to come from the house, but as he lodged near the bookstore\nshe would drop in there and keep a look out for him.\n\nWhile Laura is on her errand to find Mr. Buckstone, it may not be out\nof the way to remark that she knew quite as much of Washington life as\nSenator Dilworthy gave her credit for, and more than she thought proper\nto tell him. She was acquainted by this time with a good many of the\nyoung fellows of Newspaper Row; and exchanged gossip with them to their\nmutual advantage.\n\nThey were always talking in the Row, everlastingly gossiping, bantering\nand sarcastically praising things, and going on in a style which was a\ncurious commingling of earnest and persiflage. Col. Sellers liked this\ntalk amazingly, though he was sometimes a little at sea in it--and\nperhaps that didn't lessen the relish of the conversation to the\ncorrespondents.\n\nIt seems that they had got hold of the dry-goods box packing story about\nBalloon, one day, and were talking it over when the Colonel came in. The\nColonel wanted to know all about it, and Hicks told him. And then Hicks\nwent on, with a serious air,\n\n\u201cColonel, if you register a letter, it means that it is of value,\ndoesn't it? And if you pay fifteen cents for registering it, the\ngovernment will have to take extra care of it and even pay you back its\nfull value if it is lost. Isn't that so?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I suppose it's so.\u201d.\n\n\u201cWell Senator Balloon put fifteen cents worth of stamps on each of those\nseven huge boxes of old clothes, and shipped that ton of second-hand\nrubbish, old boots and pantaloons and what not through the mails as\nregistered matter! It was an ingenious thing and it had a genuine touch\nof humor about it, too. I think there is more real talent among our\npublic men of to-day than there was among those of old times--a far more\nfertile fancy, a much happier ingenuity. Now, Colonel, can you picture\nJefferson, or Washington or John Adams franking their wardrobes through\nthe mails and adding the facetious idea of making the government\nresponsible for the cargo for the sum of one dollar and five cents?\nStatesmen were dull creatures in those days. I have a much greater\nadmiration for Senator Balloon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Balloon is a man of parts, there is no denying it\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so. He is spoken of for the post of Minister to China, or\nAustria, and I hope will be appointed. What we want abroad is good\nexamples of the national character.\n\n\u201cJohn Jay and Benjamin Franklin were well enough in their day, but the\nnation has made progress since then. Balloon is a man we know and can\ndepend on to be true to himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and Balloon has had a good deal of public experience. He is an old\nfriend of mine. He was governor of one of the territories a while, and\nwas very satisfactory.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed he was. He was ex-officio Indian agent, too. Many a man would\nhave taken the Indian appropriation and devoted the money to feeding and\nclothing the helpless savages, whose land had been taken from them by\nthe white man in the interests of civilization; but Balloon knew their\nneeds better. He built a government saw-mill on the reservation with the\nmoney, and the lumber sold for enormous prices--a relative of his did\nall the work free of charge--that is to say he charged nothing more than\nthe lumber would bring.\u201d \u201cBut the poor Injuns--not that I care much for\nInjuns--what did he do for them?\u201d\n\n\u201cGave them the outside slabs to fence in the reservation with. Governor\nBalloon was nothing less than a father to the poor Indians. But Balloon\nis not alone, we have many truly noble statesmen in our country's\nservice like Balloon. The Senate is full of them. Don't you think so\nColonel?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I dunno. I honor my country's public servants as much as any one\ncan. I meet them, Sir, every day, and the more I see of them the more I\nesteem them and the more grateful I am that our institutions give us the\nopportunity of securing their services. Few lands are so blest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is true, Colonel. To be sure you can buy now and then a Senator or\na Representative but they do not know it is wrong, and so they are not\nashamed of it. They are gentle, and confiding and childlike, and in my\nopinion these are qualities that ennoble them far more than any amount\nof sinful sagacity could. I quite agree with you, Col. Sellers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d--hesitated the Colonel--\u201cI am afraid some of them do buy their\nseats--yes, I am afraid they do--but as Senator Dilworthy himself said\nto me, it is sinful,--it is very wrong--it is shameful; Heaven protect\nme from such a charge. That is what Dilworthy said. And yet when you\ncome to look at it you cannot deny that we would have to go without the\nservices of some of our ablest men, sir, if the country were opposed\nto--to--bribery. It is a harsh term. I do not like to use it.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel interrupted himself at this point to meet an engagement with\nthe Austrian minister, and took his leave with his usual courtly bow.\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nIn due time Laura alighted at the book store, and began to look at the\ntitles of the handsome array of books on the counter. A dapper clerk\nof perhaps nineteen or twenty years, with hair accurately parted and\nsurprisingly slick, came bustling up and leaned over with a pretty smile\nand an affable--\n\n\u201cCan I--was there any particular book you wished to see?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you Taine's England?\u201d\n\n\u201cBeg pardon?\u201d\n\n\u201cTaine's Notes on England.\u201d\n\nThe young gentleman scratched the side of his nose with a cedar pencil\nwhich he took down from its bracket on the side of his head, and\nreflected a moment:\n\n\u201cAh--I see,\u201d [with a bright smile]--\u201cTrain, you mean--not Taine. George\nFrancis Train. No, ma'm we--\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean Taine--if I may take the liberty.\u201d\n\nThe clerk reflected again--then:\n\n\u201cTaine . . . . Taine . . . . Is it hymns?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it isn't hymns. It is a volume that is making a deal of talk just\nnow, and is very widely known--except among parties who sell it.\u201d\n\nThe clerk glanced at her face to see if a sarcasm might not lurk\nsomewhere in that obscure speech, but the gentle simplicity of the\nbeautiful eyes that met his, banished that suspicion. He went away and\nconferred with the proprietor. Both appeared to be non-plussed. They\nthought and talked, and talked and thought by turns. Then both came\nforward and the proprietor said:\n\n\u201cIs it an American book, ma'm?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it is an American reprint of an English translation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! Yes--yes--I remember, now. We are expecting it every day. It isn't\nout yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you must be mistaken, because you advertised it a week ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy no--can that be so?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I am sure of it. And besides, here is the book itself, on the\ncounter.\u201d\n\nShe bought it and the proprietor retired from the field. Then she asked\nthe clerk for the Autocrat of the Breakfast Table--and was pained to see\nthe admiration her beauty had inspired in him fade out of his face. He\nsaid with cold dignity, that cook books were somewhat out of their line,\nbut he would order it if she desired it. She said, no, never mind.\nThen she fell to conning the titles again, finding a delight in the\ninspection of the Hawthornes, the Longfellows, the Tennysons, and other\nfavorites of her idle hours. Meantime the clerk's eyes were busy, and no\ndoubt his admiration was returning again--or may be he was only gauging\nher probable literary tastes by some sagacious system of admeasurement\nonly known to his guild. Now he began to \u201cassist\u201d her in making a\nselection; but his efforts met with no success--indeed they only annoyed\nher and unpleasantly interrupted her meditations. Presently, while she\nwas holding a copy of \u201cVenetian Life\u201d in her hand and running over a\nfamiliar passage here and there, the clerk said, briskly, snatching up\na paper-covered volume and striking the counter a smart blow with it to\ndislodge the dust:\n\n\u201cNow here is a work that we've sold a lot of. Everybody that's read it\nlikes it\u201d--and he intruded it under her nose; \u201cit's a book that I can\nrecommend--'The Pirate's Doom, or the Last of the Buccaneers.' I think\nit's one of the best things that's come out this season.\u201d\n\nLaura pushed it gently aside with her hand and went on and went on\nfilching from \u201cVenetian Life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe I do not want it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe clerk hunted around awhile, glancing at one title and then another,\nbut apparently not finding what he wanted.\n\nHowever, he succeeded at last. Said he:\n\n\u201cHave you ever read this, ma'm? I am sure you'll like it. It's by the\nauthor of 'The Hooligans of Hackensack.' It is full of love troubles and\nmysteries and all sorts of such things. The heroine strangles her own\nmother. Just glance at the title please,--'Gonderil the Vampire, or The\nDance of Death.' And here is 'The Jokist's Own Treasury, or, The Phunny\nPhellow's Bosom Phriend.' The funniest thing!--I've read it four times,\nma'm, and I can laugh at the very sight of it yet. And 'Gonderil,'--I\nassure you it is the most splendid book I ever read. I know you will\nlike these books, ma'm, because I've read them myself and I know what\nthey are.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I was perplexed--but I see how it is, now. You must have thought\nI asked you to tell me what sort of books I wanted--for I am apt to say\nthings which I don't really mean, when I am absent minded. I suppose I\ndid ask you, didn't I?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo ma'm,--but I--\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I must have done it, else you would not have offered your\nservices, for fear it might be rude. But don't be troubled--it was all\nmy fault. I ought not to have been so heedless--I ought not to have\nasked you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you didn't ask me, ma'm. We always help customers all we can. You\nsee our experience--living right among books all the time--that sort of\nthing makes us able to help a customer make a selection, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow does it, indeed? It is part of your business, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes'm, we always help.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow good it is of you. Some people would think it rather obtrusive,\nperhaps, but I don't--I think it is real kindness--even charity. Some\npeople jump to conclusions without any thought--you have noticed that?\u201d\n\n\u201cO yes,\u201d said the clerk, a little perplexed as to whether to feel\ncomfortable or the reverse; \u201cOh yes, indeed, I've often noticed that,\nma'm.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, they jump to conclusions with an absurd heedlessness. Now some\npeople would think it odd that because you, with the budding tastes\nand the innocent enthusiasms natural to your time of life, enjoyed the\nVampires and the volume of nursery jokes, you should imagine that an\nolder person would delight in them too--but I do not think it odd at\nall. I think it natural--perfectly natural in you. And kind, too. You\nlook like a person who not only finds a deep pleasure in any little\nthing in the way of literature that strikes you forcibly, but is willing\nand glad to share that pleasure with others--and that, I think, is noble\nand admirable--very noble and admirable. I think we ought all to share\nour pleasures with others, and do what we can to make each other happy,\ndo not you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes. Oh, yes, indeed. Yes, you are quite right, ma'm.\u201d\n\nBut he was getting unmistakably uncomfortable, now, notwithstanding\nLaura's confiding sociability and almost affectionate tone.\n\n\u201cYes, indeed. Many people would think that what a bookseller--or perhaps\nhis clerk--knows about literature as literature, in contradistinction to\nits character as merchandise, would hardly, be of much assistance to a\nperson--that is, to an adult, of course--in the selection of food for\nthe mind--except of course wrapping paper, or twine, or wafers, or\nsomething like that--but I never feel that way. I feel that whatever\nservice you offer me, you offer with a good heart, and I am as grateful\nfor it as if it were the greatest boon to me. And it is useful to me--it\nis bound to be so. It cannot be otherwise. If you show me a book which\nyou have read--not skimmed over or merely glanced at, but read--and you\ntell me that you enjoyed it and that you could read it three or four\ntimes, then I know what book I want--\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you!--th--\u201d\n\n--\u201cto avoid. Yes indeed. I think that no information ever comes amiss\nin this world. Once or twice I have traveled in the cars--and there you\nknow, the peanut boy always measures you with his eye, and hands you out\na book of murders if you are fond of theology; or Tupper or a dictionary\nor T. S. Arthur if you are fond of poetry; or he hands you a volume\nof distressing jokes or a copy of the American Miscellany if you\nparticularly dislike that sort of literary fatty degeneration of the\nheart--just for the world like a pleasant spoken well-meaning gentleman\nin any bookstore. But here I am running on as if business men had\nnothing to do but listen to women talk. You must pardon me, for I was\nnot thinking.--And you must let me thank you again for helping me. I\nread a good deal, and shall be in nearly every day and I would be sorry\nto have you think me a customer who talks too much and buys too little.\nMight I ask you to give me the time? Ah-two-twenty-two. Thank you very\nmuch. I will set mine while I have the opportunity.\u201d\n\nBut she could not get her watch open, apparently. She tried, and tried\nagain. Then the clerk, trembling at his own audacity, begged to be\nallowed to assist. She allowed him. He succeeded, and was radiant under\nthe sweet influences of her pleased face and her seductively worded\nacknowledgements with gratification. Then he gave her the exact time\nagain, and anxiously watched her turn the hands slowly till they reached\nthe precise spot without accident or loss of life, and then he looked\nas happy as a man who had helped a fellow being through a momentous\nundertaking, and was grateful to know that he had not lived in vain.\nLaura thanked him once more. The words were music to his ear; but what\nwere they compared to the ravishing smile with which she flooded his\nwhole system? When she bowed her adieu and turned away, he was no longer\nsuffering torture in the pillory where she had had him trussed up\nduring so many distressing moments, but he belonged to the list of her\nconquests and was a flattered and happy thrall, with the dawn-light of\nlove breaking over the eastern elevations of his heart.\n\nIt was about the hour, now, for the chairman of the House Committee on\nBenevolent Appropriations to make his appearance, and Laura stepped to\nthe door to reconnoiter. She glanced up the street, and sure enough--\n\n\n\nPart 5.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII Representative Buckstone and Laura's Strategic Coquetry\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII Reception Day in Washington--Laura Again Meets Col.\nSelby and the Effect Upon Her\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX Col.

Such disappointments seldom occur in\nnovels, but are always happening in real life.\n\nShe was obliged to make a new plan. She sent him a note, and asked him\nto call in the evening--which he did.\n\nShe received the Hon. Mr. Buckstone with a sunny smile, and said:\n\n\u201cI don't know how I ever dared to send you a note, Mr. Buckstone, for\nyou have the reputation of not being very partial to our sex.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy I am sure my reputation does me wrong, then, Miss Hawkins. I have\nbeen married once--is that nothing in my favor?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes--that is, it may be and it may not be. If you have known what\nperfection is in woman, it is fair to argue that inferiority cannot\ninterest you now.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if that were the case it could not affect you, Miss Hawkins,\u201d said\nthe chairman gallantly. \u201cFame does not place you in the list of ladies\nwho rank below perfection.\u201d This happy speech delighted Mr. Buckstone as\nmuch as it seemed to delight Laura. But it did not confuse him as much\nas it apparently did her.\n\n\u201cI wish in all sincerity that I could be worthy of such a felicitous\ncompliment as that. But I am a woman, and so I am gratified for it just\nas it is, and would not have it altered.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it is not merely a compliment--that is, an empty complement--it is\nthe truth. All men will endorse that.\u201d\n\nLaura looked pleased, and said:\n\n\u201cIt is very kind of you to say it. It is a distinction indeed, for a\ncountry-bred girl like me to be so spoken of by people of brains and\nculture. You are so kind that I know you will pardon my putting you to\nthe trouble to come this evening.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed it was no trouble. It was a pleasure. I am alone in the world\nsince I lost my wife, and I often long for the society of your sex, Miss\nHawkins, notwithstanding what people may say to the contrary.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is pleasant to hear you say that. I am sure it must be so. If I\nfeel lonely at times, because of my exile from old friends, although\nsurrounded by new ones who are already very dear to me, how much more\nlonely must you feel, bereft as you are, and with no wholesome relief\nfrom the cares of state that weigh you down. For your own sake, as\nwell as for the sake of others, you ought to go into society oftener. I\nseldom see you at a reception, and when I do you do not usually give me\nvery much of your attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never imagined that you wished it or I would have been very glad to\nmake myself happy in that way.--But one seldom gets an opportunity to\nsay more than a sentence to you in a place like that. You are always the\ncentre of a group--a fact which you may have noticed yourself. But if\none might come here--\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed you would always find a hearty welcome, Mr. Buckstone. I\nhave often wished you would come and tell me more about Cairo and the\nPyramids, as you once promised me you would.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, do you remember that yet, Miss Hawkins? I thought ladies' memories\nwere more fickle than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, they are not so fickle as gentlemen's promises. And besides, if I\nhad been inclined to forget, I--did you not give me something by way of\na remembrancer?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I?\u201d\n\n\u201cThink.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does seem to me that I did; but I have forgotten what it was now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever, never call a lady's memory fickle again! Do you recognize this?\u201d\n\n\u201cA little spray of box! I am beaten--I surrender. But have you kept that\nall this time?\u201d\n\nLaura's confusion was very pretty. She tried to hide it, but the more\nshe tried the more manifest it became and withal the more captivating to\nlook upon. Presently she threw the spray of box from her with an annoyed\nair, and said:\n\n\u201cI forgot myself. I have been very foolish. I beg that you will forget\nthis absurd thing.\u201d\n\nMr. Buckstone picked up the spray, and sitting down by Laura's side on\nthe sofa, said:\n\n\u201cPlease let me keep it, Miss Hawkins. I set a very high value upon it\nnow.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it to me, Mr. Buckstone, and do not speak so. I have been\nsufficiently punished for my thoughtlessness. You cannot take pleasure\nin adding to my distress. Please give it to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed I do not wish to distress you. But do not consider the matter so\ngravely; you have done yourself no wrong. You probably forgot that you\nhad it; but if you had given it to me I would have kept it--and not\nforgotten it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not talk so, Mr. Buckstone. Give it to me, please, and forget the\nmatter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would not be kind to refuse, since it troubles you so, and so I\nrestore it. But if you would give me part of it and keep the rest--\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that you might have something to remind you of me when you wished to\nlaugh at my foolishness?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, by no means, no! Simply that I might remember that I had once\nassisted to discomfort you, and be reminded to do so no more.\u201d\n\nLaura looked up, and scanned his face a moment. She was about to break\nthe twig, but she hesitated and said:\n\n\u201cIf I were sure that you--\u201d She threw the spray away, and continued:\n\u201cThis is silly! We will change the subject. No, do not insist--I must\nhave my way in this.\u201d\n\nThen Mr. Buckstone drew off his forces and proceeded to make a wily\nadvance upon the fortress under cover of carefully-contrived artifices\nand stratagems of war. But he contended with an alert and suspicious\nenemy; and so at the end of two hours it was manifest to him that he had\nmade but little progress. Still, he had made some; he was sure of that.\n\nLaura sat alone and communed with herself;\n\n\u201cHe is fairly hooked, poor thing. I can play him at my leisure and land\nhim when I choose. He was all ready to be caught, days and days ago--I\nsaw that, very well. He will vote for our bill--no fear about that; and\nmoreover he will work for it, too, before I am done with him. If he had\na woman's eyes he would have noticed that the spray of box had grown\nthree inches since he first gave it to me, but a man never sees anything\nand never suspects. If I had shown him a whole bush he would have\nthought it was the same. Well, it is a good night's work: the committee\nis safe. But this is a desperate game I am playing in these days--a\nwearing, sordid, heartless game. If I lose, I lose everything--even\nmyself. And if I win the game, will it be worth its cost after all? I do\nnot know. Sometimes I doubt. Sometimes I half wish I had not begun.\nBut no matter; I have begun, and I will never turn back; never while I\nlive.\u201d\n\nMr. Buckstone indulged in a reverie as he walked homeward:\n\n\u201cShe is shrewd and deep, and plays her cards with considerable\ndiscretion--but she will lose, for all that. There is no hurry; I shall\ncome out winner, all in good time. She is the most beautiful woman in\nthe world; and she surpassed herself to-night. I suppose I must vote\nfor that bill, in the end maybe; but that is not a matter of much\nconsequence the government can stand it. She is bent on capturing me,\nthat is plain; but she will find by and by that what she took for a\nsleeping garrison was an ambuscade.\u201d\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\n     Now this surprising news caus'd her fall in 'a trance,\n     Life as she were dead, no limbs she could advance,\n     Then her dear brother came, her from the ground he took\n     And she spake up and said, O my poor heart is broke.\n\n     The Barnardcastle Tragedy.\n\n\u201cDon't you think he is distinguished looking?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! That gawky looking person, with Miss Hawkins?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere. He's just speaking to Mrs. Schoonmaker. Such high-bred\nnegligence and unconsciousness. Nothing studied. See his fine eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery. They are moving this way now. Maybe he is coming here. But he\nlooks as helpless as a rag baby. Who is he, Blanche?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is he? And you've been here a week, Grace, and don't know? He's the\ncatch of the season. That's Washington Hawkins--her brother.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery old family, old Kentucky family I believe. He's got enormous\nlanded property in Tennessee, I think. The family lost everything,\nslaves and that sort of thing, you know, in the war. But they have a\ngreat deal of land, minerals, mines and all that. Mr. Hawkins and his\nsister too are very much interested in the amelioration of the condition\nof the colored race; they have some plan, with Senator Dilworthy, to\nconvert a large part of their property to something another for the\nfreedmen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don't say so? I thought he was some guy from Pennsylvania. But\nhe is different from others. Probably he has lived all his life on his\nplantation.\u201d\n\nIt was a day reception of Mrs. Representative Schoonmaker, a sweet\nwoman, of simple and sincere manners. Her house was one of the most\npopular in Washington. There was less ostentation there than in some\nothers, and people liked to go where the atmosphere reminded them of the\npeace and purity of home. Mrs. Schoonmaker was as natural and unaffected\nin Washington society as she was in her own New York house, and kept up\nthe spirit of home-life there, with her husband and children. And that\nwas the reason, probably, why people of refinement liked to go there.\n\nWashington is a microcosm, and one can suit himself with any sort of\nsociety within a radius of a mile. To a large portion of the people who\nfrequent Washington or dwell there, the ultra fashion, the shoddy, the\njobbery are as utterly distasteful as they would be in a refined New\nEngland City. Schoonmaker was not exactly a leader in the House, but he\nwas greatly respected for his fine talents and his honesty. No one would\nhave thought of offering to carry National Improvement Directors Relief\nstock for him.\n\nThese day receptions were attended by more women than men, and those\ninterested in the problem might have studied the costumes of the ladies\npresent, in view of this fact, to discover whether women dress more\nfor the eyes of women or for effect upon men. It is a very important\nproblem, and has been a good deal discussed, and its solution would\nform one fixed, philosophical basis, upon which to estimate woman's\ncharacter. We are inclined to take a medium ground, and aver that woman\ndresses to please herself, and in obedience to a law of her own nature.\n\n\u201cThey are coming this way,\u201d said Blanche. People who made way for them\nto pass, turned to look at them. Washington began to feel that the eyes\nof the public were on him also, and his eyes rolled about, now towards\nthe ceiling, now towards the floor, in an effort to look unconscious.\n\n\u201cGood morning, Miss Hawkins. Delighted. Mr. Hawkins. My friend, Miss\nMedlar.\u201d\n\nMr. Hawkins, who was endeavoring to square himself for a bow, put his\nfoot through the train of Mrs. Senator Poplin, who looked round with a\nscowl, which turned into a smile as she saw who it was. In extricating\nhimself, Mr. Hawkins, who had the care of his hat as well as the\nintroduction on his mind, shambled against Miss Blanche, who said\npardon, with the prettiest accent, as if the awkwardness were her own.\nAnd Mr. Hawkins righted himself.\n\n\u201cDon't you find it very warm to-day, Mr. Hawkins?\u201d said Blanche, by way\nof a remark.\n\n\u201cIt's awful hot,\u201d said Washington.\n\n\u201cIt's warm for the season,\u201d continued Blanche pleasantly. \u201cBut I suppose\nyou are accustomed to it,\u201d she added, with a general idea that the\nthermometer always stands at 90 deg. in all parts of the late slave\nstates. \u201cWashington weather generally cannot be very congenial to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's congenial,\u201d said Washington brightening up, \u201cwhen it's not\ncongealed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's very good. Did you hear, Grace, Mr. Hawkins says it's congenial\nwhen it's not congealed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is, dear?\u201d said Grace, who was talking with Laura.\n\nThe conversation was now finely under way. Washington launched out an\nobservation of his own.\n\n\u201cDid you see those Japs, Miss Leavitt?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, aren't they queer. But so high-bred, so picturesque. Do you\nthink that color makes any difference, Mr. Hawkins? I used to be so\nprejudiced against color.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you? I never was. I used to think my old mammy was handsome.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow interesting your life must have been! I should like to hear about\nit.\u201d\n\nWashington was about settling himself into his narrative style, when\nMrs. Gen. McFingal caught his eye.\n\n\u201cHave you been at the Capitol to-day, Mr. Hawkins?\u201d\n\nWashington had not. \u201cIs anything uncommon going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say it was very exciting. The Alabama business you know. Gen.\nSutler, of Massachusetts, defied England, and they say he wants war.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants to make himself conspicuous more like,\u201d said Laura. \u201cHe\nalways, you have noticed, talks with one eye on the gallery, while the\nother is on the speaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, my husband says, its nonsense to talk of war, and wicked. He\nknows what war is. If we do have war, I hope it will be for the patriots\nof Cuba. Don't you think we want Cuba, Mr. Hawkins?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we want it bad,\u201d said Washington. \u201cAnd Santo Domingo. Senator\nDilworthy says, we are bound to extend our religion over the isles of\nthe sea. We've got to round out our territory, and--\u201d\n\nWashington's further observations were broken off by Laura, who whisked\nhim off to another part of the room, and reminded him that they must\nmake their adieux.\n\n\u201cHow stupid and tiresome these people are,\u201d she said. \u201cLet's go.\u201d\n\nThey were turning to say good-by to the hostess, when Laura's attention\nwas arrested by the sight of a gentleman who was just speaking to Mrs.\nSchoonmaker. For a second her heart stopped beating. He was a handsome\nman of forty and perhaps more, with grayish hair and whiskers, and he\nwalked with a cane, as if he were slightly lame. He might be less than\nforty, for his face was worn into hard lines, and he was pale.\n\nNo. It could not be, she said to herself. It is only a resemblance. But\nas the gentleman turned and she saw his full face, Laura put out her\nhand and clutched Washington's arm to prevent herself from falling.\n\nWashington, who was not minding anything, as usual, looked 'round in\nwonder. Laura's eyes were blazing fire and hatred; he had never seen her\nlook so before; and her face, was livid.\n\n\u201cWhy, what is it, sis? Your face is as white as paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's he, it's he. Come, come,\u201d and she dragged him away.\n\n\u201cIt's who?\u201d asked Washington, when they had gained the carriage.\n\n\u201cIt's nobody, it's nothing. Did I say he? I was faint with the heat.\nDon't mention it. Don't you speak of it,\u201d she added earnestly, grasping\nhis arm.\n\nWhen she had gained her room she went to the glass and saw a pallid and\nhaggard face.\n\n\u201cMy God,\u201d she cried, \u201cthis will never do. I should have killed him, if\nI could. The scoundrel still lives, and dares to come here. I ought to\nkill him. He has no right to live. How I hate him. And yet I loved him.\nOh heavens, how I did love that man. And why didn't he kill me? He\nmight better. He did kill all that was good in me. Oh, but he shall not\nescape. He shall not escape this time. He may have forgotten. He will\nfind that a woman's hate doesn't forget. The law? What would the law do\nbut protect him and make me an outcast? How all Washington would gather\nup its virtuous skirts and avoid me, if it knew. I wonder if he hates me\nas I do him?\u201d\n\nSo Laura raved, in tears and in rage by turns, tossed in a tumult of\npassion, which she gave way to with little effort to control.\n\nA servant came to summon her to dinner. She had a headache. The hour\ncame for the President's reception. She had a raving headache, and the\nSenator must go without her.\n\nThat night of agony was like another night she recalled. How vividly it\nall came back to her. And at that time she remembered she thought she\nmight be mistaken. He might come back to her. Perhaps he loved her,\na little, after all. Now, she knew he did not. Now, she knew he was a\ncold-blooded scoundrel, without pity. Never a word in all these years.\nShe had hoped he was dead. Did his wife live, she wondered. She caught\nat that--and it gave a new current to her thoughts. Perhaps, after\nall--she must see him. She could not live without seeing him. Would he\nsmile as in the old days when she loved him so; or would he sneer as\nwhen she last saw him? If he looked so, she hated him. If he should call\nher \u201cLaura, darling,\u201d and look SO! She must find him. She must end her\ndoubts.\n\nLaura kept her room for two days, on one excuse and another--a nervous\nheadache, a cold--to the great anxiety of the Senator's household.\nCallers, who went away, said she had been too gay--they did not say\n\u201cfast,\u201d though some of them may have thought it. One so conspicuous and\nsuccessful in society as Laura could not be out of the way two days,\nwithout remarks being made, and not all of them complimentary.\n\nWhen she came down she appeared as usual, a little pale may be, but\nunchanged in manner. If there were any deepened lines about the eyes\nthey had been concealed. Her course of action was quite determined.\n\nAt breakfast she asked if any one had heard any unusual noise during the\nnight? Nobody had. Washington never heard any noise of any kind after\nhis eyes were shut. Some people thought he never did when they were open\neither.\n\nSenator Dilworthy said he had come in late. He was detained in a little\nconsultation after the Congressional prayer meeting. Perhaps it was his\nentrance.\n\nNo, Laura said. She heard that. It was later. She might have been\nnervous, but she fancied somebody was trying to get into the house.\n\nMr. Brierly humorously suggested that it might be, as none of the\nmembers were occupied in night session.\n\nThe Senator frowned, and said he did not like to hear that kind of\nnewspaper slang. There might be burglars about.\n\nLaura said that very likely it was only her nervousness. But she\nthought she would feel safer if Washington would let her take one of his\npistols. Washington brought her one of his revolvers, and instructed her\nin the art of loading and firing it.\n\nDuring the morning Laura drove down to Mrs. Schoonmaker's to pay a\nfriendly call.\n\n\u201cYour receptions are always delightful,\u201d she said to that lady, \u201cthe\npleasant people all seem to come here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's pleasant to hear you say so, Miss Hawkins. I believe my friends\nlike to come here. Though society in Washington is mixed; we have a\nlittle of everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose, though, you don't see much of the old rebel element?\u201d said\nLaura with a smile.\n\nIf this seemed to Mrs. Schoonmaker a singular remark for a lady to make,\nwho was meeting \u201crebels\u201d in society every day, she did not express it in\nany way, but only said,\n\n\u201cYou know we don't say 'rebel' anymore. Before we came to Washington I\nthought rebels would look unlike other people. I find we are very much\nalike, and that kindness and good nature wear away prejudice. And then\nyou know there are all sorts of common interests. My husband sometimes\nsays that he doesn't see but confederates are just as eager to get\nat the treasury as Unionists. You know that Mr. Schoonmaker is on the\nappropriations.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he know many Southerners?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes. There were several at my reception the other day. Among others\na confederate Colonel--a stranger--handsome man with gray hair, probably\nyou didn't notice him, uses a cane in walking. A very agreeable man. I\nwondered why he called. When my husband came home and looked over the\ncards, he said he had a cotton claim. A real southerner. Perhaps\nyou might know him if I could think of his name. Yes, here's his\ncard--Louisiana.\u201d\n\nLaura took the card, looked at it intently till she was sure of the\naddress, and then laid it down, with,\n\n\u201cNo, he is no friend of ours.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, Laura wrote and dispatched the following note. It was in\na round hand, unlike her flowing style, and it was directed to a number\nand street in Georgetown:--\n\n\u201cA Lady at Senator Dilworthy's would like to see Col. George Selby,\non business connected with the Cotton Claims. Can he call Wednesday at\nthree o'clock P. M.?\u201d On Wednesday at 3 P. M, no one of the family was\nlikely to be in the house except Laura.\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nCol. Selby had just come to Washington, and taken lodgings in\nGeorgetown. His business was to get pay for some cotton that was\ndestroyed during the war. There were many others in Washington on the\nsame errand, some of them with claims as difficult to establish as his.\nA concert of action was necessary, and he was not, therefore, at all\nsurprised to receive the note from a lady asking him to call at Senator\nDilworthy's.\n\nAt a little after three on Wednesday he rang the bell of the Senator's\nresidence. It was a handsome mansion on the Square opposite the\nPresident's house. The owner must be a man of great wealth, the Colonel\nthought; perhaps, who knows, said he with a smile, he may have got some\nof my cotton in exchange for salt and quinine after the capture of New\nOrleans. As this thought passed through his mind he was looking at the\nremarkable figure of the Hero of New Orleans, holding itself by main\nstrength from sliding off the back of the rearing bronze horse, and\nlifting its hat in the manner of one who acknowledges the playing of\nthat martial air: \u201cSee, the Conquering Hero Comes!\u201d \u201cGad,\u201d said the\nColonel to himself, \u201cOld Hickory ought to get down and give his seat to\nGen. Sutler--but they'd have to tie him on.\u201d\n\nLaura was in the drawing room. She heard the bell, she heard the steps\nin the hall, and the emphatic thud of the supporting cane. She had risen\nfrom her chair and was leaning against the piano, pressing her left\nhand against the violent beating of her heart. The door opened and the\nColonel entered, standing in the full light of the opposite window.\nLaura was more in the shadow and stood for an instant, long enough for\nthe Colonel to make the inward observation that she was a magnificent\nWoman. She then advanced a step.\n\n\u201cCol. Selby, is it not?\u201d\n\nThe Colonel staggered back, caught himself by a chair, and turned\ntowards her a look of terror.\n\n\u201cLaura? My God!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, your wife!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, it can't be. How came you here? I thought you were--\u201d\n\n\u201cYou thought I was dead? You thought you were rid of me? Not so long as\nyou live, Col. Selby, not so long as you live,\u201d Laura in her passion was\nhurried on to say.\n\nNo man had ever accused Col. Selby of cowardice. But he was a coward\nbefore this woman. May be he was not the man he once was. Where was his\ncoolness? Where was his sneering, imperturbable manner, with which he\ncould have met, and would have met, any woman he had wronged, if he had\nonly been forewarned. He felt now that he must temporize, that he\nmust gain time. There was danger in Laura's tone. There was something\nfrightful in her calmness. Her steady eyes seemed to devour him.\n\n\u201cYou have ruined my life,\u201d she said; \u201cand I was so young, so ignorant,\nand loved you so. You betrayed me, and left me, mocking me and trampling\nme into the dust, a soiled cast-off. You might better have killed me\nthen. Then I should not have hated you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaura,\u201d said the Colonel, nerving himself, but still pale, and speaking\nappealingly, \u201cdon't say that. Reproach me. I deserve it. I was a\nscoundrel. I was everything monstrous. But your beauty made me crazy.\nYou are right. I was a brute in leaving you as I did. But what could I\ndo? I was married, and--\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your wife still lives?\u201d asked Laura, bending a little forward in\nher eagerness.\n\nThe Colonel noticed the action, and he almost said \u201cno,\u201d but he thought\nof the folly of attempting concealment.\n\n\u201cYes. She is here.\u201d\n\nWhat little color had wandered back into Laura's face forsook it again.\nHer heart stood still, her strength seemed going from her limbs. Her\nlast hope was gone. The room swam before her for a moment, and the\nColonel stepped towards her, but she waved him back, as hot anger again\ncoursed through her veins, and said,\n\n\u201cAnd you dare come with her, here, and tell me of it, here and mock me\nwith it! And you think I will have it; George? You think I will let you\nlive with that woman? You think I am as powerless as that day I fell\ndead at your feet?\u201d\n\nShe raged now. She was in a tempest of excitement. And she advanced\ntowards him with a threatening mien. She would kill me if she could,\nthought the Colonel; but he thought at the same moment, how beautiful\nshe is. He had recovered his head now. She was lovely when he knew her,\nthen a simple country girl. Now she was dazzling, in the fullness of\nripe womanhood, a superb creature, with all the fascination that a woman\nof the world has for such a man as Col. Selby. Nothing of this was lost\non him. He stepped quickly to her, grasped both her hands in his, and\nsaid,\n\n\u201cLaura, stop! think! Suppose I loved you yet! Suppose I hated my fate!\nWhat can I do? I am broken by the war. I have lost everything almost. I\nhad as lief be dead and done with it.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel spoke with a low remembered voice that thrilled through\nLaura. He was looking into her eyes as he had looked in those old days,\nwhen no birds of all those that sang in the groves where they walked\nsang a note of warning. He was wounded. He had been punished. Her\nstrength forsook her with her rage, and she sank upon a chair, sobbing,\n\n\u201cOh! my God, I thought I hated him!\u201d\n\nThe Colonel knelt beside her. He took her hand and she let him keep it.\nShe looked down into his face, with a pitiable tenderness, and said in a\nweak voice.\n\n\u201cAnd you do love me a little?\u201d\n\nThe Colonel vowed and protested. He kissed her hand and her lips. He\nswore his false soul into perdition.\n\nShe wanted love, this woman. Was not her love for George Selby deeper\nthan any other woman's could be? Had she not a right to him? Did he not\nbelong to her by virtue of her overmastering passion? His wife--she was\nnot his wife, except by the law. She could not be. Even with the law she\ncould have no right to stand between two souls that were one. It was an\ninfamous condition in society that George should be tied to her.\n\nLaura thought this, believed it; because she desired to believe it. She\ncame to it as an original proposition founded on the requirements of her\nown nature. She may have heard, doubtless she had, similar theories that\nwere prevalent at that day, theories of the tyranny of marriage and of\nthe freedom of marriage. She had even heard women lecturers say, that\nmarriage should only continue so long as it pleased either party to\nit--for a year, or a month, or a day. She had not given much heed to\nthis, but she saw its justice now in a dash of revealing desire. It must\nbe right. God would not have permitted her to love George Selby as she\ndid, and him to love her, if it was right for society to raise up\na barrier between them. He belonged to her. Had he not confessed it\nhimself?\n\nNot even the religious atmosphere of Senator Dilworthy's house had been\nsufficient to instill into Laura that deep Christian principle which had\nbeen somehow omitted in her training. Indeed in that very house had she\nnot heard women, prominent before the country and besieging Congress,\nutter sentiments that fully justified the course she was marking out for\nherself.\n\nThey were seated now, side by side, talking with more calmness.\nLaura was happy, or thought she was. But it was that feverish sort of\nhappiness which is snatched out of the black shadow of falsehood, and\nis at the moment recognized as fleeting and perilous, and indulged\ntremblingly. She loved. She was loved. That is happiness certainly. And\nthe black past and the troubled present and the uncertain future could\nnot snatch that from her.\n\nWhat did they say as they sat there? What nothings do people usually\nsay in such circumstances, even if they are three-score and ten? It was\nenough for Laura to hear his voice and be near him. It was enough for\nhim to be near her, and avoid committing himself as much as he could.\nEnough for him was the present also. Had there not always been some way\nout of such scrapes?\n\nAnd yet Laura could not be quite content without prying into tomorrow.\nHow could the Colonel manage to free himself from his wife? Would it be\nlong? Could he not go into some State where it would not take much time?\nHe could not say exactly. That they must think of. That they must talk\nover. And so on. Did this seem like a damnable plot to Laura against\nthe life, maybe, of a sister, a woman like herself? Probably not. It was\nright that this man should be hers, and there were some obstacles in the\nway. That was all. There are as good reasons for bad actions as for\ngood ones,--to those who commit them. When one has broken the tenth\ncommandment, the others are not of much account.\n\nWas it unnatural, therefore, that when George Selby departed, Laura\nshould watch him from the window, with an almost joyful heart as he went\ndown the sunny square? \u201cI shall see him to-morrow,\u201d she said, \u201cand the\nnext day, and the next. He is mine now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn the woman,\u201d said the Colonel as he picked his way down the steps.\n\u201cOr,\u201d he added, as his thoughts took a new turn, \u201cI wish my wife was in\nNew Orleans.\u201d\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\n     Open your ears; for which of you will stop,\n     The vent of hearing when loud Rumor speaks?\n     I, from the orient to the drooping west,\n     Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold\n     The acts commenced on this ball of earth:\n     Upon my tongues continual slanders ride;\n     The which in every language I pronounce,\n     Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.\n\n     King Henry IV.\n\nAs may be readily believed, Col. Beriah Sellers was by this time one\nof the best known men in Washington. For the first time in his life his\ntalents had a fair field.\n\nHe was now at the centre of the manufacture of gigantic schemes,\nof speculations of all sorts, of political and social gossip. The\natmosphere was full of little and big rumors and of vast, undefined\nexpectations. Everybody was in haste, too, to push on his private plan,\nand feverish in his haste, as if in constant apprehension that tomorrow\nwould be Judgment Day. Work while Congress is in session, said the\nuneasy spirit, for in the recess there is no work and no device.\n\nThe Colonel enjoyed this bustle and confusion amazingly; he thrived in\nthe air of indefinite expectation. All his own schemes took larger shape\nand more misty and majestic proportions; and in this congenial air,\nthe Colonel seemed even to himself to expand into something large and\nmysterious. If he respected himself before, he almost worshipped Beriah\nSellers now, as a superior being. If he could have chosen an official\nposition out of the highest, he would have been embarrassed in the\nselection. The presidency of the republic seemed too limited and cramped\nin the constitutional restrictions. If he could have been Grand Llama\nof the United States, that might have come the nearest to his idea of a\nposition. And next to that he would have luxuriated in the irresponsible\nomniscience of the Special Correspondent.\n\nCol. Sellers knew the President very well, and had access to\nhis presence when officials were kept cooling their heels in the\nWaiting-room. The President liked to hear the Colonel talk, his voluble\nease was a refreshment after the decorous dullness of men who only\ntalked business and government, and everlastingly expounded their\nnotions of justice and the distribution of patronage. The Colonel was as\nmuch a lover of farming and of horses as Thomas Jefferson was. He\ntalked to the President by the hour about his magnificent stud, and his\nplantation at Hawkeye, a kind of principality--he represented it. He\nurged the President to pay him a visit during the recess, and see his\nstock farm.\n\n\u201cThe President's table is well enough,\u201d he used to say, to the loafers\nwho gathered about him at Willard's, \u201cwell enough for a man on a salary,\nbut God bless my soul, I should like him to see a little old-fashioned\nhospitality--open house, you know. A person seeing me at home might\nthink I paid no attention to what was in the house, just let things\nflow in and out. He'd be mistaken. What I look to is quality, sir. The\nPresident has variety enough, but the quality! Vegetables of course\nyou can't expect here. I'm very particular about mine. Take celery,\nnow--there's only one spot in this country where celery will grow. But\nI am surprised about the wines. I should think they were manufactured\nin the New York Custom House. I must send the President some from my\ncellar. I was really mortified the other day at dinner to see Blacque\nBey leave his standing in the glasses.\u201d\n\nWhen the Colonel first came to Washington he had thoughts of taking the\nmission to Constantinople, in order to be on the spot to look after the\ndissemination of his Eye Water, but as that invention; was not yet quite\nready, the project shrank a little in the presence of vaster schemes.\nBesides he felt that he could do the country more good by remaining\nat home. He was one of the Southerners who were constantly quoted as\nheartily \u201caccepting the situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm whipped,\u201d he used to say with a jolly laugh, \u201cthe government was\ntoo many for me; I'm cleaned out, done for, except my plantation and\nprivate mansion. We played for a big thing, and lost it, and I don't\nwhine, for one. I go for putting the old flag on all the vacant lots. I\nsaid to the President, says I, 'Grant, why don't you take Santo Domingo,\nannex the whole thing, and settle the bill afterwards. That's my way.\nI'd take the job to manage Congress. The South would come into it.\nYou've got to conciliate the South, consolidate the two debts, pay 'em\noff in greenbacks, and go ahead. That's my notion. Boutwell's got the\nright notion about the value of paper, but he lacks courage. I should\nlike to run the treasury department about six months. I'd make things\nplenty, and business look up.'\u201d\n\nThe Colonel had access to the departments. He knew all the senators and\nrepresentatives, and especially, the lobby. He was consequently a great\nfavorite in Newspaper Row, and was often lounging in the offices there,\ndropping bits of private, official information, which were immediately,\ncaught up and telegraphed all over the country. But it used to surprise\neven the Colonel when he read it, it was embellished to that degree that\nhe hardly recognized it, and the hint was not lost on him. He began\nto exaggerate his heretofore simple conversation to suit the newspaper\ndemand.\n\nPeople used to wonder in the winters of 187- and 187-, where the\n\u201cSpecials\u201d got that remarkable information with which they every morning\nsurprised the country, revealing the most secret intentions of the\nPresident and his cabinet, the private thoughts of political leaders,\nthe hidden meaning of every movement. This information was furnished by\nCol. Sellers.\n\nWhen he was asked, afterwards, about the stolen copy of the Alabama\nTreaty which got into the \u201cNew York Tribune,\u201d he only looked mysterious,\nand said that neither he nor Senator Dilworthy knew anything about it.\nBut those whom he was in the habit of meeting occasionally felt almost\ncertain that he did know.\n\nIt must not be supposed that the Colonel in his general patriotic labors\nneglected his own affairs. The Columbus River Navigation Scheme absorbed\nonly a part of his time, so he was enabled to throw quite a strong\nreserve force of energy into the Tennessee Land plan, a vast enterprise\ncommensurate with his abilities, and in the prosecution of which he was\ngreatly aided by Mr. Henry Brierly, who was buzzing about the capitol\nand the hotels day and night, and making capital for it in some\nmysterious way.\n\n\u201cWe must create a public opinion,\u201d said Senator Dilworthy. \u201cMy\nonly interest in it is a public one, and if the country wants the\ninstitution, Congress will have to yield.\u201d\n\nIt may have been after a conversation between the Colonel and Senator\nDilworthy that the following special despatch was sent to a New York\nnewspaper:\n\n\u201cWe understand that a philanthropic plan is on foot in relation to the\ncolored race that will, if successful, revolutionize the whole character\nof southern industry. An experimental institution is in contemplation\nin Tennessee which will do for that state what the Industrial School at\nZurich did for Switzerland. We learn that approaches have been made to\nthe heirs of the late Hon. Silas Hawkins of Missouri, in reference to a\nlease of a portion of their valuable property in East Tennessee. Senator\nDilworthy, it is understood, is inflexibly opposed to any arrangement\nthat will not give the government absolute control. Private interests\nmust give way to the public good. It is to be hoped that Col. Sellers,\nwho represents the heirs, will be led to see the matter in this light.\u201d\n When Washington Hawkins read this despatch, he went to the Colonel in\nsome anxiety. He was for a lease, he didn't want to surrender anything.\nWhat did he think the government would offer? Two millions?\n\n\u201cMay be three, may be four,\u201d said the Colonel, \u201cit's worth more than the\nbank of England.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they will not lease,\u201d said Washington, \u201clet 'em make it two millions\nfor an undivided half. I'm not going to throw it away, not the whole of\nit.\u201d\n\nHarry told the Colonel that they must drive the thing through, he\ncouldn't be dallying round Washington when Spring opened. Phil wanted\nhim, Phil had a great thing on hand up in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d inquired the Colonel, always ready to interest himself\nin anything large.\n\n\u201cA mountain of coal; that's all. He's going to run a tunnel into it in\nthe Spring.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he want any capital?\u201d, asked the Colonel, in the tone of a man who\nis given to calculating carefully before he makes an investment.\n\n\u201cNo. Old man Bolton's behind him. He has capital, but I judged that he\nwanted my experience in starting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he wants me, tell him I'll come, after Congress adjourns. I should\nlike to give him a little lift. He lacks enterprise--now, about that\nColumbus River. He doesn't see his chances. But he's a good fellow, and\nyou can tell him that Sellers won't go back on him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d asked Harry, \u201cwho is that rather handsome party that's\nhanging 'round Laura? I see him with her everywhere, at the Capitol,\nin the horse cars, and he comes to Dilworthy's. If he weren't lame, I\nshould think he was going to run off with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that's nothing. Laura knows her business. He has a cotton claim.\nUsed to be at Hawkeye during the war.\n\n\u201cSelby's his name, was a Colonel. Got a wife and family. Very\nrespectable people, the Selby's.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that's all right,\u201d said Harry, \u201cif it's business. But if a woman\nlooked at me as I've seen her at Selby, I should understand it. And it's\ntalked about, I can tell you.\u201d\n\nJealousy had no doubt sharpened this young gentleman's observation.\nLaura could not have treated him with more lofty condescension if she\nhad been the Queen of Sheba, on a royal visit to the great republic.\nAnd he resented it, and was \u201chuffy\u201d when he was with her, and ran her\nerrands, and brought her gossip, and bragged of his intimacy with the\nlovely creature among the fellows at Newspaper Row.\n\nLaura's life was rushing on now in the full stream of intrigue and\nfashionable dissipation. She was conspicuous at the balls of the fastest\nset, and was suspected of being present at those doubtful suppers that\nbegan late and ended early. If Senator Dilworthy remonstrated about\nappearances, she had a way of silencing him. Perhaps she had some hold\non him, perhaps she was necessary to his plan for ameliorating the\ncondition of the colored race.\n\nShe saw Col. Selby, when the public knew and when it did not know. She\nwould see him, whatever excuses he made, and however he avoided her.\nShe was urged on by a fever of love and hatred and jealousy, which\nalternately possessed her. Sometimes she petted him, and coaxed him and\ntried all her fascinations. And again she threatened him and reproached\nhim. What was he doing? Why had he taken no steps to free himself? Why\ndidn't he send his wife home? She should have money soon. They could go\nto Europe--anywhere. What did she care for talk?\n\nAnd he promised, and lied, and invented fresh excuses for delay, like a\ncowardly gambler and roue as he was, fearing to break with her, and half\nthe time unwilling to give her up.\n\n\u201cThat woman doesn't know what fear is,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cand she\nwatches me like a hawk.\u201d\n\nHe told his wife that this woman was a lobbyist, whom he had to tolerate\nand use in getting through his claims, and that he should pay her and\nhave done with her, when he succeeded.\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nHenry Brierly was at the Dilworthy's constantly and on such terms of\nintimacy that he came and went without question. The Senator was not an\ninhospitable man, he liked to have guests in his house, and Harry's gay\nhumor and rattling way entertained him; for even the most devout men and\nbusy statesmen must have hours of relaxation.\n\nHarry himself believed that he was of great service in the University\nbusiness, and that the success of the scheme depended upon him to a\ngreat degree. He spent many hours in talking it over with the Senator\nafter dinner. He went so far as to consider whether it would be worth\nhis while to take the professorship of civil engineering in the new\ninstitution.\n\nBut it was not the Senator's society nor his dinners--at which this\nscapegrace remarked that there was too much grace and too little\nwine--which attracted him to the house. The fact was the poor fellow\nhung around there day after day for the chance of seeing Laura for five\nminutes at a time. For her presence at dinner he would endure the long\nbore of the Senator's talk afterwards, while Laura was off at some\nassembly, or excused herself on the plea of fatigue. Now and then he\naccompanied her to some reception, and rarely, on off nights, he was\nblessed with her company in the parlor, when he sang, and was chatty\nand vivacious and performed a hundred little tricks of imitation and\nventriloquism, and made himself as entertaining as a man could be.\n\nIt puzzled him not a little that all his fascinations seemed to go for\nso little with Laura; it was beyond his experience with women. Sometimes\nLaura was exceedingly kind and petted him a little, and took the trouble\nto exert her powers of pleasing, and to entangle him deeper and deeper.\nBut this, it angered him afterwards to think, was in private; in public\nshe was beyond his reach, and never gave occasion to the suspicion\nthat she had any affair with him. He was never permitted to achieve the\ndignity of a serious flirtation with her in public.\n\n\u201cWhy do you treat me so?\u201d he once said, reproachfully.\n\n\u201cTreat you how?\u201d asked Laura in a sweet voice, lifting her eyebrows.\n\n\u201cYou know well enough. You let other fellows monopolize you in society,\nand you are as indifferent to me as if we were strangers.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I help it if they are attentive, can I be rude? But we are such old\nfriends, Mr. Brierly, that I didn't suppose you would be jealous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I must be a very old friend, then, by your conduct towards me.\nBy the same rule I should judge that Col. Selby must be very new.\u201d\n\nLaura looked up quickly, as if about to return an indignant answer\nto such impertinence, but she only said, \u201cWell, what of Col. Selby,\nsauce-box?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, probably, you'll care for. Your being with him so much is the\ntown talk, that's all?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do people say?\u201d asked Laura calmly.\n\n\u201cOh, they say a good many things. You are offended, though, to have me\nspeak of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in the least. You are my true friend. I feel that I can trust you.\nYou wouldn't deceive me, Harry?\u201d throwing into her eyes a look of trust\nand tenderness that melted away all his petulance and distrust. \u201cWhat do\nthey say?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome say that you've lost your head about him; others that you don't\ncare any more for him than you do for a dozen others, but that he is\ncompletely fascinated with you and about to desert his wife; and others\nsay it is nonsense to suppose you would entangle yourself with a married\nman, and that your intimacy only arises from the matter of the cotton,\nclaims, for which he wants your influence with Dilworthy. But you know\neverybody is talked about more or less in Washington. I shouldn't care;\nbut I wish you wouldn't have so much to do with Selby, Laura,\u201d continued\nHarry, fancying that he was now upon such terms that his, advice, would\nbe heeded.\n\n\u201cAnd you believed these slanders?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't believe anything against you, Laura, but Col. Selby does not\nmean you any good. I know you wouldn't be seen with him if you knew his\nreputation.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know him?\u201d Laura asked, as indifferently as she could.\n\n\u201cOnly a little. I was at his lodgings' in Georgetown a day or two ago,\nwith Col. Sellers. Sellers wanted to talk with him about some patent\nremedy he has, Eye Water, or something of that sort, which he wants to\nintroduce into Europe. Selby is going abroad very soon.\u201d\n\nLaura started; in spite of her self-control.\n\n\u201cAnd his wife!--Does he take his family? Did you see his wife?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. A dark little woman, rather worn--must have been pretty once\nthough. Has three or four children, one of them a baby. They'll all\ngo of course. She said she should be glad enough to get away from\nWashington. You know Selby has got his claim allowed, and they say he\nhas had a run of luck lately at Morrissey's.\u201d\n\nLaura heard all this in a kind of stupor, looking straight at Harry,\nwithout seeing him. Is it possible, she was thinking, that this base\nwretch, after all his promises, will take his wife and children and\nleave me? Is it possible the town is saying all these things about me?\nAnd a look of bitterness coming into her face--does the fool think he\ncan escape so?\n\n\u201cYou are angry with me, Laura,\u201d said Harry, not comprehending in the\nleast what was going on in her mind.\n\n\u201cAngry?\u201d she said, forcing herself to come back to his presence.\n\u201cWith you? Oh no. I'm angry with the cruel world, which, pursues an\nindependent woman as it never does a man. I'm grateful to you Harry; I'm\ngrateful to you for telling me of that odious man.\u201d\n\nAnd she rose from her chair and gave him her pretty hand, which the\nsilly fellow took, and kissed and clung to. And he said many silly\nthings, before she disengaged herself gently, and left him, saying it\nwas time to dress, for dinner.\n\nAnd Harry went away, excited, and a little hopeful, but only a little.\nThe happiness was only a gleam, which departed and left him thoroughly\nmiserable. She never would love him, and she was going to the devil,\nbesides. He couldn't shut his eyes to what he saw, nor his ears to what\nhe heard of her.\n\nWhat had come over this thrilling young lady-killer? It was a pity to\nsee such a gay butterfly broken on a wheel. Was there something good in\nhim, after all, that had been touched? He was in fact madly in love with\nthis woman.\n\nIt is not for us to analyze the passion and say whether it was a worthy\none. It absorbed his whole nature and made him wretched enough. If he\ndeserved punishment, what more would you have? Perhaps this love was\nkindling a new heroism in him.\n\nHe saw the road on which Laura was going clearly enough, though he did\nnot believe the worst he heard of her. He loved her too passionately to\ncredit that for a moment. And it seemed to him that if he could compel\nher to recognize her position, and his own devotion, she might love him,\nand that he could save her. His love was so far ennobled, and become\na very different thing from its beginning in Hawkeye. Whether he ever\nthought that if he could save her from ruin, he could give her up\nhimself, is doubtful. Such a pitch of virtue does not occur often in\nreal life, especially in such natures as Harry's, whose generosity\nand unselfishness were matters of temperament rather than habits or\nprinciples.\n\nHe wrote a long letter to Laura, an incoherent, passionate letter,\npouring out his love as he could not do in her presence, and warning her\nas plainly as he dared of the dangers that surrounded her, and the risks\nshe ran of compromising herself in many ways.\n\nLaura read the letter, with a little sigh may be, as she thought of\nother days, but with contempt also, and she put it into the fire with\nthe thought, \u201cThey are all alike.\u201d\n\nHarry was in the habit of writing to Philip freely, and boasting also\nabout his doings, as he could not help doing and remain himself.\nMixed up with his own exploits, and his daily triumphs as a lobbyist,\nespecially in the matter of the new University, in which Harry was to\nhave something handsome, were amusing sketches of Washington society,\nhints about Dilworthy, stories about Col. Sellers, who had become a\nwell-known character, and wise remarks upon the machinery of private\nlegislation for the public-good, which greatly entertained Philip in his\nconvalescence.\n\nLaura's name occurred very often in these letters, at first in casual\nmention as the belle of the season, carrying everything before her with\nher wit and beauty, and then more seriously, as if Harry did not exactly\nlike so much general admiration of her, and was a little nettled by her\ntreatment of him.\n\nThis was so different from Harry's usual tone about women, that Philip\nwondered a good deal over it. Could it be possible that he was seriously\naffected? Then came stories about Laura, town talk, gossip which Harry\ndenied the truth of indignantly; but he was evidently uneasy, and at\nlength wrote in such miserable spirits that Philip asked him squarely\nwhat the trouble was; was he in love?\n\nUpon this, Harry made a clean breast of it, and told Philip all he\nknew about the Selby affair, and Laura's treatment of him, sometimes\nencouraging him--and then throwing him off, and finally his belief that\nshe would go to the bad if something was not done to arouse her from her\ninfatuation. He wished Philip was in Washington. He knew Laura, and\nshe had a great respect for his character, his opinions, his judgment.\nPerhaps he, as an uninterested person in whom she would have some\nconfidence, and as one of the public, could say some thing to her that\nwould show her where she stood.\n\nPhilip saw the situation clearly enough. Of Laura he knew not much,\nexcept that she was a woman of uncommon fascination, and he thought from\nwhat he had seen of her in Hawkeye, her conduct towards him and towards\nHarry, of not too much principle. Of course he knew nothing of her\nhistory; he knew nothing seriously against her, and if Harry was\ndesperately enamored of her, why should he not win her if he could.\nIf, however, she had already become what Harry uneasily felt she might\nbecome, was it not his duty to go to the rescue of his friend and try to\nsave him from any rash act on account of a woman that might prove to\nbe entirely unworthy of him; for trifler and visionary as he was, Harry\ndeserved a better fate than this.\n\nPhilip determined to go to Washington and see for himself. He had other\nreasons also. He began to know enough of Mr. Bolton's affairs to be\nuneasy. Pennybacker had been there several times during the winter, and\nhe suspected that he was involving Mr. Bolton in some doubtful scheme.\nPennybacker was in Washington, and Philip thought he might perhaps find\nout something about him, and his plans, that would be of service to Mr.\nBolton.\n\nPhilip had enjoyed his winter very well, for a man with his arm broken\nand his head smashed. With two such nurses as Ruth and Alice,\nillness seemed to him rather a nice holiday, and every moment of his\nconvalescence had been precious and all too fleeting. With a young\nfellow of the habits of Philip, such injuries cannot be counted on\nto tarry long, even for the purpose of love-making, and Philip found\nhimself getting strong with even disagreeable rapidity.\n\nDuring his first weeks of pain and weakness, Ruth was unceasing in\nher ministrations; she quietly took charge of him, and with a gentle\nfirmness resisted all attempts of Alice or any one else to share to any\ngreat extent the burden with her. She was clear, decisive and peremptory\nin whatever she did; but often when Philip opened his eyes in those\nfirst days of suffering and found her standing by his bedside, he saw\na look of tenderness in her anxious face that quickened his already\nfeverish pulse, a look that remained in his heart long after he closed\nhis eyes. Sometimes he felt her hand on his forehead, and did not open\nhis eyes for fear she would take it away. He watched for her coming to\nhis chamber; he could distinguish her light footstep from all others.\nIf this is what is meant by women practicing medicine, thought Philip to\nhimself, I like it.\n\n\u201cRuth,\u201d said he one day when he was getting to be quite himself, \u201cI\nbelieve in it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBelieve in what?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, in women physicians.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, I'd better call in Mrs. Dr. Longstreet.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no. One will do, one at a time. I think I should be well tomorrow,\nif I thought I should never have any other.\u201d\n\n\u201cThy physician thinks thee mustn't talk, Philip,\u201d said Ruth putting her\nfinger on his lips.\n\n\u201cBut, Ruth, I want to tell you that I should wish I never had got well\nif--\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, thee must not talk. Thee is wandering again,\u201d and Ruth\nclosed his lips, with a smile on her own that broadened into a merry\nlaugh as she ran away.\n\nPhilip was not weary, however, of making these attempts, he rather\nenjoyed it. But whenever he inclined to be sentimental, Ruth would cut\nhim off, with some such gravely conceived speech as, \u201cDoes thee think\nthat thy physician will take advantage of the condition of a man who is\nas weak as thee is? I will call Alice, if thee has any dying confessions\nto make.\u201d\n\nAs Philip convalesced, Alice more and more took Ruth's place as his\nentertainer, and read to him by the hour, when he did not want to\ntalk--to talk about Ruth, as he did a good deal of the time. Nor was\nthis altogether unsatisfactory to Philip. He was always happy and\ncontented with Alice. She was the most restful person he knew. Better\ninformed than Ruth and with a much more varied culture, and bright and\nsympathetic, he was never weary of her company, if he was not greatly\nexcited by it. She had upon his mind that peaceful influence that Mrs.\nBolton had when, occasionally, she sat by his bedside with her work.\nSome people have this influence, which is like an emanation. They bring\npeace to a house, they diffuse serene content in a room full of mixed\ncompany, though they may say very little, and are apparently unconscious\nof their own power.\n\nNot that Philip did not long for Ruth's presence all the same. Since\nhe was well enough to be about the house, she was busy again with her\nstudies. Now and then her teasing humor came again. She always had a\nplayful shield against his sentiment. Philip used sometimes to declare\nthat she had no sentiment; and then he doubted if he should be pleased\nwith her after all if she were at all sentimental; and he rejoiced that\nshe had, in such matters what he called the airy grace of sanity. She\nwas the most gay serious person he ever saw.\n\nPerhaps he was not so much at rest or so contented with her as with\nAlice. But then he loved her. And what have rest and contentment to do\nwith love?\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nMr. Buckstone's campaign was brief--much briefer than he supposed it\nwould be. He began it purposing to win Laura without being won himself;\nbut his experience was that of all who had fought on that field before\nhim; he diligently continued his effort to win her, but he presently\nfound that while as yet he could not feel entirely certain of having\nwon her, it was very manifest that she had won him. He had made an able\nfight, brief as it was, and that at least was to his credit. He was in\ngood company, now; he walked in a leash of conspicuous captives. These\nunfortunates followed Laura helplessly, for whenever she took a prisoner\nhe remained her slave henceforth. Sometimes they chafed in their\nbondage; sometimes they tore themselves free and said their serfdom\nwas ended; but sooner or later they always came back penitent and\nworshiping. Laura pursued her usual course: she encouraged Mr. Buckstone\nby turns, and by turns she harassed him; she exalted him to the clouds\nat one time, and at another she dragged him down again. She constituted\nhim chief champion of the Knobs University bill, and he accepted the\nposition, at first reluctantly, but later as a valued means of serving\nher--he even came to look upon it as a piece of great good fortune,\nsince it brought him into such frequent contact with her.\n\nThrough him she learned that the Hon. Mr. Trollop was a bitter enemy of\nher bill. He urged her not to attempt to influence Mr. Trollop in any\nway, and explained that whatever she might attempt in that direction\nwould surely be used against her and with damaging effect.\n\nShe at first said she knew Mr. Trollop, \u201cand was aware that he had\na Blank-Blank;\u201d--[**Her private figure of speech for Brother--or\nSon-in-law]--but Mr. Buckstone said that he was not able to conceive\nwhat so curious a phrase as Blank-Blank might mean, and had no wish\nto pry into the matter, since it was probably private, he \u201cwould\nnevertheless venture the blind assertion that nothing would answer\nin this particular case and during this particular session but to be\nexceedingly wary and keep clear away from Mr. Trollop; any other course\nwould be fatal.\u201d\n\nIt seemed that nothing could be done. Laura was seriously troubled.\nEverything was looking well, and yet it was plain that one vigorous and\ndetermined enemy might eventually succeed in overthrowing all her plans.\nA suggestion came into her mind presently and she said:\n\n\u201cCan't you fight against his great Pension bill and bring him to terms?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, never; he and I are sworn brothers on that measure; we work in\nharness and are very loving--I do everything I possibly can for him\nthere. But I work with might and main against his Immigration bill,--as\npertinaciously and as vindictively, indeed, as he works against our\nUniversity. We hate each other through half a conversation and are all\naffection through the other half. We understand each other. He is an\nadmirable worker outside the capitol; he will do more for the Pension\nbill than any other man could do; I wish he would make the great speech\non it which he wants to make--and then I would make another and we would\nbe safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell if he wants to make a great speech why doesn't he do it?\u201d\n\nVisitors interrupted the conversation and Mr. Buckstone took his leave.\nIt was not of the least moment to Laura that her question had not been\nanswered, inasmuch as it concerned a thing which did not interest her;\nand yet, human being like, she thought she would have liked to know. An\nopportunity occurring presently, she put the same question to another\nperson and got an answer that satisfied her. She pondered a good while\nthat night, after she had gone to bed, and when she finally turned over\nto go to sleep, she had thought out a new scheme. The next evening at\nMrs. Gloverson's party, she said to Mr. Buckstone:\n\n\u201cI want Mr. Trollop to make his great speech on the Pension bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you? But you remember I was interrupted, and did not explain to\nyou--\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind, I know. You must make him make that speech. I very\nparticularly desire it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it is easy to say make him do it, but how am I to make him!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is perfectly easy; I have thought it all out.\u201d\n\nShe then went into the details. At length Mr. Buckstone said:\n\n\u201cI see now. I can manage it, I am sure. Indeed I wonder he never thought\nof it himself--there are no end of precedents. But how is this going to\nbenefit you, after I have managed it? There is where the mystery lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I will take care of that. It will benefit me a great deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI only wish I could see how; it is the oddest freak. You seem to go the\nfurthest around to get at a thing--but you are in earnest, aren't you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I am, indeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, I will do it--but why not tell me how you imagine it is\ngoing to help you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, by and by.--Now there is nobody talking to him. Go straight and\ndo it, there's a good fellow.\u201d\n\nA moment or two later the two sworn friends of the Pension bill were\ntalking together, earnestly, and seemingly unconscious of the moving\nthrong about them. They talked an hour, and then Mr. Buckstone came back\nand said:\n\n\u201cHe hardly fancied it at first, but he fell in love with it after a bit.\nAnd we have made a compact, too. I am to keep his secret and he is to\nspare me, in future, when he gets ready to denounce the supporters of\nthe University bill--and I can easily believe he will keep his word on\nthis occasion.\u201d\n\nA fortnight elapsed, and the University bill had gathered to itself\nmany friends, meantime. Senator Dilworthy began to think the harvest\nwas ripe. He conferred with Laura privately. She was able to tell him\nexactly how the House would vote. There was a majority--the bill would\npass, unless weak members got frightened at the last, and deserted--a\nthing pretty likely to occur. The Senator said:\n\n\u201cI wish we had one more good strong man. Now Trollop ought to be on our\nside, for he is a friend of the negro. But he is against us, and is our\nbitterest opponent. If he would simply vote No, but keep quiet and not\nmolest us, I would feel perfectly cheerful and content. But perhaps\nthere is no use in thinking of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy I laid a little plan for his benefit two weeks ago. I think he will\nbe tractable, maybe. He is to come here tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook out for him, my child! He means mischief, sure. It is said that he\nclaims to know of improper practices having been used in the interest of\nthis bill, and he thinks he sees a chance to make a great sensation when\nthe bill comes up. Be wary. Be very, very careful, my dear. Do your very\nablest talking, now. You can convince a man of anything, when you try.\nYou must convince him that if anything improper has been done, you\nat least are ignorant of it and sorry for it. And if you could only\npersuade him out of his hostility to the bill, too--but don't overdo the\nthing; don't seem too anxious, dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won't; I'll be ever so careful. I'll talk as sweetly to him as if he\nwere my own child! You may trust me--indeed you may.\u201d\n\nThe door-bell rang.\n\n\u201cThat is the gentleman now,\u201d said Laura. Senator Dilworthy retired to\nhis study.\n\nLaura welcomed Mr. Trollop, a grave, carefully dressed and very\nrespectable looking man, with a bald head, standing collar and old\nfashioned watch seals.\n\n\u201cPromptness is a virtue, Mr. Trollop, and I perceive that you have it.\nYou are always prompt with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always meet my engagements, of every kind, Miss Hawkins.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a quality which is rarer in the world than it has been, I\nbelieve. I wished to see you on business, Mr. Trollop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI judged so. What can I do for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know my bill--the Knobs University bill?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, I believe it is your bill. I had forgotten. Yes, I know the bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, would you mind telling me your opinion of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, since you seem to ask it without reserve, I am obliged to say\nthat I do not regard it favorably. I have not seen the bill itself, but\nfrom what I can hear, it--it--well, it has a bad look about it. It--\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak it out--never fear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it--they say it contemplates a fraud upon the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Laura tranquilly.\n\n\u201cWell! I say 'Well?' too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, suppose it were a fraud--which I feel able to deny--would it be\nthe first one?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou take a body's breath away! Would you--did you wish me to vote for\nit? Was that what you wanted to see me about?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour instinct is correct. I did want you--I do want you to vote for\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cVote for a fr--for a measure which is generally believed to be at\nleast questionable? I am afraid we cannot come to an understanding, Miss\nHawkins.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I am afraid not--if you have resumed your principles, Mr. Trollop.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you send for me merely to insult me? It is time for me to take my\nleave, Miss Hawkins.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo--wait a moment. Don't be offended at a trifle. Do not be offish and\nunsociable. The Steamship Subsidy bill was a fraud on the government.\nYou voted for it, Mr. Trollop, though you always opposed the measure\nuntil after you had an interview one evening with a certain Mrs.\nMcCarter at her house. She was my agent. She was acting for me. Ah, that\nis right--sit down again. You can be sociable, easily enough if you have\na mind to. Well? I am waiting. Have you nothing to say?\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Hawkins, I voted for that bill because when I came to examine into\nit--\u201d\n\n\u201cAh yes. When you came to examine into it. Well, I only want you to\nexamine into my bill. Mr. Trollop, you would not sell your vote on that\nsubsidy bill--which was perfectly right--but you accepted of some of\nthe stock, with the understanding that it was to stand in your\nbrother-in-law's name.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no pr--I mean, this is, utterly groundless, Miss Hawkins.\u201d But\nthe gentleman seemed somewhat uneasy, nevertheless.\n\n\u201cWell, not entirely so, perhaps. I and a person whom we will call Miss\nBlank (never mind the real name,) were in a closet at your elbow all the\nwhile.\u201d\n\nMr. Trollop winced--then he said with dignity:\n\n\u201cMiss Hawkins is it possible that you were capable of such a thing as\nthat?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was bad; I confess that. It was bad. Almost as bad as selling one's\nvote for--but I forget; you did not sell your vote--you only accepted a\nlittle trifle, a small token of esteem, for your brother-in-law. Oh,\nlet us come out and be frank with each other: I know you, Mr. Trollop.\nI have met you on business three or four times; true, I never offered\nto corrupt your principles--never hinted such a thing; but always when I\nhad finished sounding you, I manipulated you through an agent. Let us\nbe frank. Wear this comely disguise of virtue before the public--it will\ncount there; but here it is out of place. My dear sir, by and by there\nis going to be an investigation into that National Internal Improvement\nDirectors' Relief Measure of a few years ago, and you know very\nwell that you will be a crippled man, as likely as not, when it is\ncompleted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt cannot be shown that a man is a knave merely for owning that stock.\nI am not distressed about the National Improvement Relief Measure.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh indeed I am not trying to distress you. I only wished to make good\nmy assertion that I knew you. Several of you gentlemen bought of that\nstack (without paying a penny down) received dividends from it, (think\nof the happy idea of receiving dividends, and very large ones, too, from\nstock one hasn't paid for!) and all the while your names never appeared\nin the transaction; if ever you took the stock at all, you took it in\nother people's names. Now you see, you had to know one of two things;\nnamely, you either knew that the idea of all this preposterous\ngenerosity was to bribe you into future legislative friendship, or you\ndidn't know it. That is to say, you had to be either a knave or a--well,\na fool--there was no middle ground. You are not a fool, Mr. Trollop.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Hawking you flatter me. But seriously, you do not forget that some\nof the best and purest men in Congress took that stock in that way?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid Senator Blank?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, no--I believe not.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you believe not. Do you suppose he was ever approached, on\nthe subject?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you had approached him, for instance, fortified with the fact that\nsome of the best men in Congress, and the purest, etc., etc.; what would\nhave been the result?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what WOULD have been the result?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe would have shown you the door! For Mr. Blank is neither a knave\nnor a fool. There are other men in the Senate and the House whom no one\nwould have been hardy enough to approach with that Relief Stock in that\npeculiarly generous way, but they are not of the class that you regard\nas the best and purest. No, I say I know you Mr. Trollop. That is to\nsay, one may suggest a thing to Mr. Trollop which it would not do\nto suggest to Mr. Blank. Mr. Trollop, you are pledged to support the\nIndigent Congressmen's Retroactive Appropriation which is to come\nup, either in this or the next session. You do not deny that, even\nin public. The man that will vote for that bill will break the eighth\ncommandment in any other way, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he will not vote for your corrupt measure, nevertheless, madam!\u201d\n exclaimed Mr. Trollop, rising from his seat in a passion.\n\n\u201cAh, but he will. Sit down again, and let me explain why. Oh, come,\ndon't behave so. It is very unpleasant. Now be good, and you shall have\nthe missing page of your great speech. Here it is!\u201d--and she displayed a\nsheet of manuscript.\n\nMr. Trollop turned immediately back from the threshold. It might have\nbeen gladness that flashed into his face; it might have been something\nelse; but at any rate there was much astonishment mixed with it.\n\n\u201cGood! Where did you get it? Give it me!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow there is no hurry. Sit down; sit down and let us talk and be\nfriendly.\u201d\n\nThe gentleman wavered. Then he said:\n\n\u201cNo, this is only a subterfuge. I will go. It is not the missing page.\u201d\n\nLaura tore off a couple of lines from the bottom of the sheet.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d she said, \u201cyou will know whether this is the handwriting or not.\nYou know it is the handwriting. Now if you will listen, you will know\nthat this must be the list of statistics which was to be the 'nub' of\nyour great effort, and the accompanying blast the beginning of the\nburst of eloquence which was continued on the next page--and you will\nrecognize that there was where you broke down.\u201d\n\nShe read the page. Mr. Trollop said:\n\n\u201cThis is perfectly astounding. Still, what is all this to me? It is\nnothing. It does not concern me. The speech is made, and there an end. I\ndid break down for a moment, and in a rather uncomfortable place, since\nI had led up to those statistics with some grandeur; the hiatus was\npleasanter to the House and the galleries than it was to me. But it is\nno matter now. A week has passed; the jests about it ceased three or\nfour days ago. The whole thing is a matter of indifference to me, Miss\nHawkins.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you apologized; and promised the statistics for next day. Why\ndidn't you keep your promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe matter was not of sufficient consequence. The time was gone by to\nproduce an effect with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I hear that other friends of the Soldiers' Pension Bill desire them\nvery much. I think you ought to let them have them.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Hawkins, this silly blunder of my copyist evidently has more\ninterest for you than it has for me. I will send my private secretary to\nyou and let him discuss the subject with you at length.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he copy your speech for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he did. Why all these questions? Tell me--how did you get\nhold of that page of manuscript? That is the only thing that stirs a\npassing interest in my mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm coming to that.\u201d Then she said, much as if she were talking to\nherself: \u201cIt does seem like taking a deal of unnecessary pains, for a\nbody to hire another body to construct a great speech for him and then\ngo and get still another body to copy it before it can be read in the\nHouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Hawkins, what do you mean by such talk as that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy I am sure I mean no harm--no harm to anybody in the world. I am\ncertain that I overheard the Hon. Mr. Buckstone either promise to write\nyour great speech for you or else get some other competent person to do\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is perfectly absurd, madam, perfectly absurd!\u201d and Mr. Trollop\naffected a laugh of derision.\n\n\u201cWhy, the thing has occurred before now. I mean that I have heard that\nCongressmen have sometimes hired literary grubs to build speeches for\nthem.--Now didn't I overhear a conversation like that I spoke of?\u201d\n\n\u201cPshaw! Why of course you may have overheard some such jesting nonsense.\nBut would one be in earnest about so farcical a thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell if it was only a joke, why did you make a serious matter of it?\nWhy did you get the speech written for you, and then read it in the\nHouse without ever having it copied?\u201d\n\nMr. Trollop did not laugh this time; he seemed seriously perplexed. He\nsaid:\n\n\u201cCome, play out your jest, Miss Hawkins. I can't understand what you are\ncontriving--but it seems to entertain you--so please, go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, I assure you; but I hope to make the matter entertaining to\nyou, too. Your private secretary never copied your speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed? Really you seem to know my affairs better than I do myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe I do. You can't name your own amanuensis, Mr. Trollop.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is sad, indeed. Perhaps Miss Hawkins can?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I can. I wrote your speech myself, and you read it from my\nmanuscript. There, now!\u201d\n\nMr. Trollop did not spring to his feet and smite his brow with his hand\nwhile a cold sweat broke out all over him and the color forsook his\nface--no, he only said, \u201cGood God!\u201d and looked greatly astonished.\n\nLaura handed him her commonplace-book and called his attention to the\nfact that the handwriting there and the handwriting of this speech were\nthe same. He was shortly convinced. He laid the book aside and said,\ncomposedly:\n\n\u201cWell, the wonderful tragedy is done, and it transpires that I am\nindebted to you for my late eloquence. What of it? What was all this for\nand what does it amount to after all? What do you propose to do about\nit?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh nothing. It is only a bit of pleasantry. When I overheard that\nconversation I took an early opportunity to ask Mr. Buckstone if he knew\nof anybody who might want a speech written--I had a friend, and so forth\nand so on. I was the friend, myself; I thought I might do you a good\nturn then and depend on you to do me one by and by. I never let Mr.\nBuckstone have the speech till the last moment, and when you hurried\noff to the House with it, you did not know there was a missing page, of\ncourse, but I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now perhaps you think that if I refuse to support your bill, you\nwill make a grand exposure?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I had not thought of that. I only kept back the page for the mere\nfun of the thing; but since you mention it, I don't know but I might do\nsomething if I were angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Miss Hawkins, if you were to give out that you composed my\nspeech, you know very well that people would say it was only your\nraillery, your fondness for putting a victim in the pillory and amusing\nthe public at his expense. It is too flimsy, Miss Hawkins, for a person\nof your fine inventive talent--contrive an abler device than that.\nCome!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is easily done, Mr. Trollop. I will hire a man, and pin this page\non his breast, and label it, 'The Missing Fragment of the Hon. Mr.\nTrollop's Great Speech--which speech was written and composed by Miss\nLaura Hawkins under a secret understanding for one hundred dollars--and\nthe money has not been paid.' And I will pin round about it notes in my\nhandwriting, which I will procure from prominent friends of mine for the\noccasion; also your printed speech in the Globe, showing the connection\nbetween its bracketed hiatus and my Fragment; and I give you my word of\nhonor that I will stand that human bulletin board in the rotunda of the\ncapitol and make him stay there a week! You see you are premature, Mr.\nTrollop, the wonderful tragedy is not done yet, by any means. Come, now,\ndoesn't it improve?\u201d\n\nMr Trollop opened his eyes rather widely at this novel aspect of the\ncase. He got up and walked the floor and gave himself a moment for\nreflection. Then he stopped and studied Laura's face a while, and ended\nby saying:\n\n\u201cWell, I am obliged to believe you would be reckless enough to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don't put me to the test, Mr. Trollop. But let's drop the matter.\nI have had my joke and you've borne the infliction becomingly enough. It\nspoils a jest to harp on it after one has had one's laugh. I would much\nrather talk about my bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo would I, now, my clandestine amanuensis. Compared with some other\nsubjects, even your bill is a pleasant topic to discuss.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good indeed! I thought I could persuade you. Now I am sure you\nwill be generous to the poor negro and vote for that bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I feel more tenderly toward the oppressed colored man than I did.\nShall we bury the hatchet and be good friends and respect each other's\nlittle secrets, on condition that I vote Aye on the measure?\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all my heart, Mr. Trollop. I give you my word of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a bargain. But isn't there something else you could give me,\ntoo?\u201d\n\nLaura looked at him inquiringly a moment, and then she comprehended.\n\n\u201cOh, yes! You may have it now. I haven't any more use for it.\u201d She\npicked up the page of manuscript, but she reconsidered her intention of\nhanding it to him, and said, \u201cBut never mind; I will keep it close; no\none shall see it; you shall have it as soon as your vote is recorded.\u201d\n\nMr. Trollop looked disappointed. But presently made his adieux, and had\ngot as far as the hall, when something occurred to Laura. She said to\nherself, \u201cI don't simply want his vote under compulsion--he might vote\naye, but work against the bill in secret, for revenge; that man is\nunscrupulous enough to do anything. I must have his hearty co-operation\nas well as his vote. There is only one way to get that.\u201d\n\nShe called him back, and said:\n\n\u201cI value your vote, Mr. Trollop, but I value your influence more. You\nare able to help a measure along in many ways, if you choose. I want to\nask you to work for the bill as well as vote for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt takes so much of one's time, Miss Hawkins--and time is money, you\nknow.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I know it is--especially in Congress. Now there is no use in you\nand I dealing in pretenses and going at matters in round-about ways. We\nknow each other--disguises are nonsense. Let us be plain. I will make it\nan object to you to work for the bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon't make it unnecessarily plain, please. There are little proprieties\nthat are best preserved. What do you propose?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, this.\u201d She mentioned the names of several prominent Congressmen.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said she, \u201cthese gentlemen are to vote and work for the bill,\nsimply out of love for the negro--and out of pure generosity I have put\nin a relative of each as a member of the University incorporation. They\nwill handle a million or so of money, officially, but will receive no\nsalaries. A larger number of statesmen are to vote and work for\nthe bill--also out of love for the negro--gentlemen of but moderate\ninfluence, these--and out of pure generosity I am to see that relatives\nof theirs have positions in the University, with salaries, and good\nones, too. You will vote and work for the bill, from mere affection for\nthe negro, and I desire to testify my gratitude becomingly. Make free\nchoice. Have you any friend whom you would like to present with a\nsalaried or unsalaried position in our institution?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I have a brother-in-law--\u201d\n\n\u201cThat same old brother-in-law, you good unselfish provider! I have heard\nof him often, through my agents. How regularly he does 'turn up,' to\nbe sure. He could deal with those millions virtuously, and withal\nwith ability, too--but of course you would rather he had a salaried\nposition?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said the gentleman, facetiously, \u201cwe are very humble, very\nhumble in our desires; we want no money; we labor solely, for\nour country and require no reward but the luxury of an applauding\nconscience. Make him one of those poor hard working unsalaried\ncorporators and let him do every body good with those millions--and go\nhungry himself! I will try to exert a little influence in favor of the\nbill.\u201d\n\nArrived at home, Mr. Trollop sat down and thought it all over--something\nafter this fashion: it is about the shape it might have taken if he had\nspoken it aloud.\n\n\u201cMy reputation is getting a little damaged, and I meant to clear it up\nbrilliantly with an exposure of this bill at the supreme moment, and\nride back into Congress on the eclat of it; and if I had that bit of\nmanuscript, I would do it yet. It would be more money in my pocket in\nthe end, than my brother-in-law will get out of that incorporatorship,\nfat as it is. But that sheet of paper is out of my reach--she will never\nlet that get out of her hands. And what a mountain it is! It blocks up\nmy road, completely. She was going to hand it to me, once. Why didn't\nshe! Must be a deep woman. Deep devil! That is what she is; a beautiful\ndevil--and perfectly fearless, too. The idea of her pinning that paper\non a man and standing him up in the rotunda looks absurd at a first\nglance. But she would do it! She is capable of doing anything. I went\nthere hoping she would try to bribe me--good solid capital that would be\nin the exposure. Well, my prayer was answered; she did try to bribe me;\nand I made the best of a bad bargain and let her. I am checkmated. I\nmust contrive something fresh to get back to Congress on. Very well; a\nbird in the hand is worth two in the bush; I will work for the bill--the\nincorporatorship will be a very good thing.\u201d\n\nAs soon as Mr. Trollop had taken his leave, Laura ran to Senator\nDilworthy and began to speak, but he interrupted her and said\ndistressfully, without even turning from his writing to look at her:\n\n\u201cOnly half an hour! You gave it up early, child. However, it was best,\nit was best--I'm sure it was best--and safest.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it up! I!\u201d\n\nThe Senator sprang up, all aglow:\n\n\u201cMy child, you can't mean that you--\u201d\n\n\u201cI've made him promise on honor to think about a compromise tonight and\ncome and tell me his decision in the morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood! There's hope yet that--\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense, uncle. I've made him engage to let the Tennessee Land bill\nutterly alone!\u201d\n\n\u201cImpossible! You--\u201d\n\n\u201cI've made him promise to vote with us!\u201d\n\n\u201cINCREDIBLE! Abso--\u201d\n\n\u201cI've made him swear that he'll work for us!\u201d\n\n\u201cPRE - - - POSTEROUS!--Utterly pre--break a window, child, before I\nsuffocate!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter, it's true anyway. Now we can march into Congress with drums\nbeating and colors flying!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell--well--well. I'm sadly bewildered, sadly bewildered. I can't\nunderstand it at all--the most extraordinary woman that ever--it's\na great day, it's a great day. There--there--let me put my hand in\nbenediction on this precious head. Ah, my child, the poor negro will\nbless--\u201d\n\n\u201cOh bother the poor negro, uncle! Put it in your speech. Good-night,\ngood-bye--we'll marshal our forces and march with the dawn!\u201d\n\nLaura reflected a while, when she was alone, and then fell to laughing,\npeacefully.\n\n\u201cEverybody works for me,\u201d--so ran her thought. \u201cIt was a good idea to\nmake Buckstone lead Mr. Trollop on to get a great speech written for\nhim; and it was a happy part of the same idea for me to copy the speech\nafter Mr. Buckstone had written it, and then keep back a page. Mr. B.\nwas very complimentary to me when Trollop's break-down in the House\nshowed him the object of my mysterious scheme; I think he will say still\nfiner things when I tell him the triumph the sequel to it has gained for\nus.\n\n\u201cBut what a coward the man was, to believe I would have exposed that\npage in the rotunda, and so exposed myself. However, I don't know--I\ndon't know. I will think a moment. Suppose he voted no; suppose the bill\nfailed; that is to suppose this stupendous game lost forever, that\nI have played so desperately for; suppose people came around pitying\nme--odious! And he could have saved me by his single voice. Yes, I would\nhave exposed him! What would I care for the talk that that would have\nmade about me when I was gone to Europe with Selby and all the world was\nbusy with my history and my dishonor? It would be almost happiness to\nspite somebody at such a time.\u201d\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nThe very next day, sure enough, the campaign opened. In due course,\nthe Speaker of the House reached that Order of Business which is termed\n\u201cNotices of Bills,\u201d and then the Hon. Mr. Buckstone rose in his place\nand gave notice of a bill \u201cTo Found and Incorporate the Knobs Industrial\nUniversity,\u201d and then sat down without saying anything further. The busy\ngentlemen in the reporters' gallery jotted a line in their note-books,\nran to the telegraphic desk in a room which communicated with their own\nwriting-parlor, and then hurried back to their places in the gallery;\nand by the time they had resumed their seats, the line which they had\ndelivered to the operator had been read in telegraphic offices in towns\nand cities hundreds of miles away. It was distinguished by frankness of\nlanguage as well as by brevity:\n\n\u201cThe child is born. Buckstone gives notice of the thieving Knobs\nUniversity job. It is said the noses have been counted and enough votes\nhave been bought to pass it.\u201d\n\nFor some time the correspondents had been posting their several journals\nupon the alleged disreputable nature of the bill, and furnishing daily\nreports of the Washington gossip concerning it. So the next morning,\nnearly every newspaper of character in the land assailed the measure and\nhurled broadsides of invective at Mr. Buckstone. The Washington papers\nwere more respectful, as usual--and conciliatory, also, as usual. They\ngenerally supported measures, when it was possible; but when they\ncould not they \u201cdeprecated\u201d violent expressions of opinion in other\njournalistic quarters.\n\nThey always deprecated, when there was trouble ahead. However, 'The\nWashington Daily Love-Feast' hailed the bill with warm approbation.\nThis was Senator Balaam's paper--or rather, \u201cBrother\u201d Balaam, as he\nwas popularly called, for he had been a clergyman, in his day; and he\nhimself and all that he did still emitted an odor of sanctity now that\nhe had diverged into journalism and politics. He was a power in the\nCongressional prayer meeting, and in all movements that looked to the\nspread of religion and temperance.\n\nHis paper supported the new bill with gushing affection; it was a noble\nmeasure; it was a just measure; it was a generous measure; it was a pure\nmeasure, and that surely should recommend it in these corrupt times;\nand finally, if the nature of the bill were not known at all, the 'Love\nFeast' would support it anyway, and unhesitatingly, for the fact that\nSenator Dilworthy was the originator of the measure was a guaranty that\nit contemplated a worthy and righteous work.\n\nSenator Dilworthy was so anxious to know what the New York papers would\nsay about the bill, that he had arranged to have synopses of their\neditorials telegraphed to him; he could not wait for the papers\nthemselves to crawl along down to Washington by a mail train which has\nnever run over a cow since the road was built; for the reason that it\nhas never been able to overtake one. It carries the usual \u201ccow-catcher\u201d\n in front of the locomotive, but this is mere ostentation. It ought to be\nattached to the rear car, where it could do some good; but instead, no\nprovision is made there for the protection of the traveling public,\nand hence it is not a matter of surprise that cows so frequently climb\naboard that train and among the passengers.\n\nThe Senator read his dispatches aloud at the breakfast table. Laura\nwas troubled beyond measure at their tone, and said that that sort of\ncomment would defeat the bill; but the Senator said:\n\n\u201cOh, not at all, not at all, my child. It is just what we want.\nPersecution is the one thing needful, now--all the other forces are\nsecured. Give us newspaper persecution enough, and we are safe. Vigorous\npersecution will alone carry a bill sometimes, dear; and when you start\nwith a strong vote in the first place, persecution comes in with double\neffect. It scares off some of the weak supporters, true, but it soon\nturns strong ones into stubborn ones. And then, presently, it changes\nthe tide of public opinion. The great public is weak-minded; the great\npublic is sentimental; the great public always turns around and weeps\nfor an odious murderer, and prays for him, and carries flowers to his\nprison and besieges the governor with appeals to his clemency, as soon\nas the papers begin to howl for that man's blood.--In a word, the great\nputty-hearted public loves to 'gush,' and there is no such darling\nopportunity to gush as a case of persecution affords.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, uncle, dear; if your theory is right, let us go into raptures,\nfor nobody can ask a heartier persecution than these editorials are\nfurnishing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not so sure of that, my daughter. I don't entirely like the tone\nof some of these remarks. They lack vim, they lack venom. Here is one\ncalls it a 'questionable measure.' Bah, there is no strength in that.\nThis one is better; it calls it 'highway robbery.' That sounds something\nlike. But now this one seems satisfied to call it an 'iniquitous\nscheme'. 'Iniquitous' does not exasperate anybody; it is weak--puerile.\nThe ignorant will imagine it to be intended for a compliment. But this\nother one--the one I read last--has the true ring: 'This vile, dirty\neffort to rob the public treasury, by the kites and vultures that now\ninfest the filthy den called Congress'--that is admirable, admirable! We\nmust have more of that sort. But it will come--no fear of that; they're\nnot warmed up, yet. A week from now you'll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cUncle, you and Brother Balaam are bosom friends--why don't you get his\npaper to persecute us, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn't worth while, my daughter. His support doesn't hurt a bill.\nNobody reads his editorials but himself. But I wish the New York papers\nwould talk a little plainer. It is annoying to have to wait a week for\nthem to warm up. I expected better things at their hands--and time is\nprecious, now.\u201d\n\nAt the proper hour, according to his previous notice, Mr. Buckstone duly\nintroduced his bill entitled \u201cAn Act to Found and Incorporate the Knobs\nIndustrial University,\u201d moved its proper reference, and sat down.\n\nThe Speaker of the House rattled off this observation:\n\n\u201c'Fnobjectionbilltakuzhlcoixrssoreferred!'\u201d\n\nHabitues of the House comprehended that this long, lightning-heeled\nword signified that if there was no objection, the bill would take the\ncustomary course of a measure of its nature, and be referred to the\nCommittee on Benevolent Appropriations, and that it was accordingly so\nreferred. Strangers merely supposed that the Speaker was taking a gargle\nfor some affection of the throat.\n\nThe reporters immediately telegraphed the introduction of the bill.--And\nthey added:\n\n\u201cThe assertion that the bill will pass was premature. It is said that\nmany favorers of it will desert when the storm breaks upon them from\nthe public press.\u201d The storm came, and during ten days it waxed more and\nmore violent day by day. The great \u201cNegro University Swindle\u201d became the\none absorbing topic of conversation throughout the Union. Individuals\ndenounced it, journals denounced it, public meetings denounced it, the\npictorial papers caricatured its friends, the whole nation seemed to\nbe growing frantic over it. Meantime the Washington correspondents were\nsending such telegrams as these abroad in the land; Under date of--\n\nSATURDAY. \u201cCongressmen Jex and Fluke are wavering; it is believed they\nwill desert the execrable bill.\u201d MONDAY. \u201cJex and Fluke have deserted!\u201d\n THURSDAY. \u201cTubbs and Huffy left the sinking ship last night\u201d Later on:\n\n\u201cThree desertions. The University thieves are getting scared, though\nthey will not own it.\u201d Later:\n\n\u201cThe leaders are growing stubborn--they swear they can carry it, but it\nis now almost certain that they no longer have a majority!\u201d After a day\nor two of reluctant and ambiguous telegrams:\n\n\u201cPublic sentiment seems changing, a trifle in favor of the bill--but\nonly a trifle.\u201d And still later:\n\n\u201cIt is whispered that the Hon. Mr. Trollop has gone over to the pirates.\nIt is probably a canard. Mr. Trollop has all along been the bravest and\nmost efficient champion of virtue and the people against the bill, and\nthe report is without doubt a shameless invention.\u201d Next day:\n\n\u201cWith characteristic treachery, the truckling and pusillanimous reptile,\nCrippled-Speech Trollop, has gone over to the enemy. It is contended,\nnow, that he has been a friend to the bill, in secret, since the day\nit was introduced, and has had bankable reasons for being so; but he\nhimself declares that he has gone over because the malignant persecution\nof the bill by the newspapers caused him to study its provisions with\nmore care than he had previously done, and this close examination\nrevealed the fact that the measure is one in every way worthy of\nsupport. (Pretty thin!) It cannot be denied that this desertion has\nhad a damaging effect. Jex and Fluke have returned to their iniquitous\nallegiance, with six or eight others of lesser calibre, and it is\nreported and believed that Tubbs and Huffy are ready to go back. It is\nfeared that the University swindle is stronger to-day than it has ever\nbeen before.\u201d Later-midnight:\n\n\u201cIt is said that the committee will report the bill back to-morrow.\nBoth sides are marshaling their forces, and the fight on this bill is\nevidently going to be the hottest of the session.--All Washington is\nboiling.\u201d\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\n\u201cIt's easy enough for another fellow to talk,\u201d said Harry, despondingly,\nafter he had put Philip in possession of his view of the case. \u201cIt's\neasy enough to say 'give her up,' if you don't care for her. What am I\ngoing to do to give her up?\u201d\n\nIt seemed to Harry that it was a situation requiring some active\nmeasures. He couldn't realize that he had fallen hopelessly in love\nwithout some rights accruing to him for the possession of the object\nof his passion. Quiet resignation under relinquishment of any thing\nhe wanted was not in his line. And when it appeared to him that his\nsurrender of Laura would be the withdrawal of the one barrier that kept\nher from ruin, it was unreasonable to expect that he could see how to\ngive her up.\n\nHarry had the most buoyant confidence in his own projects always; he saw\neverything connected with himself in a large way and in rosy lines. This\npredominance of the imagination over the judgment gave that appearance\nof exaggeration to his conversation and to his communications with\nregard to himself, which sometimes conveyed the impression that he was\nnot speaking the truth. His acquaintances had been known to say that\nthey invariably allowed a half for shrinkage in his statements, and held\nthe other half under advisement for confirmation.\n\nPhilip in this case could not tell from Harry's story exactly how much\nencouragement Laura had given him, nor what hopes he might justly have\nof winning her. He had never seen him desponding before. The \u201cbrag\u201d\n appeared to be all taken out of him, and his airy manner only asserted\nitself now and then in a comical imitation of its old self.\n\nPhilip wanted time to look about him before he decided what to do. He\nwas not familiar with Washington, and it was difficult to adjust his\nfeelings and perceptions to its peculiarities. Coming out of the sweet\nsanity of the Bolton household, this was by contrast the maddest\nVanity Fair one could conceive. It seemed to him a feverish, unhealthy\natmosphere in which lunacy would be easily developed. He fancied that\neverybody attached to himself an exaggerated importance, from the fact\nof being at the national capital, the center of political influence, the\nfountain of patronage, preferment, jobs and opportunities.\n\nPeople were introduced to each other as from this or that state, not\nfrom cities or towns, and this gave a largeness to their representative\nfeeling. All the women talked politics as naturally and glibly as they\ntalk fashion or literature elsewhere. There was always some exciting\ntopic at the Capitol, or some huge slander was rising up like a\nmiasmatic exhalation from the Potomac, threatening to settle no one knew\nexactly where. Every other person was an aspirant for a place, or, if\nhe had one, for a better place, or more pay; almost every other one\nhad some claim or interest or remedy to urge; even the women were\nall advocates for the advancement of some person, and they violently\nespoused or denounced this or that measure as it would affect some\nrelative, acquaintance or friend.\n\nLove, travel, even death itself, waited on the chances of the dies daily\nthrown in the two Houses, and the committee rooms there. If the measure\nwent through, love could afford to ripen into marriage, and longing for\nforeign travel would have fruition; and it must have been only eternal\nhope springing in the breast that kept alive numerous old claimants who\nfor years and years had besieged the doors of Congress, and who looked\nas if they needed not so much an appropriation of money as six feet of\nground. And those who stood so long waiting for success to bring them\ndeath were usually those who had a just claim.\n\nRepresenting states and talking of national and even international\naffairs, as familiarly as neighbors at home talk of poor crops and the\nextravagance of their ministers, was likely at first to impose upon\nPhilip as to the importance of the people gathered here.\n\nThere was a little newspaper editor from Phil's native town, the\nassistant on a Peddletonian weekly, who made his little annual joke\nabout the \u201cfirst egg laid on our table,\u201d and who was the menial of every\ntradesman in the village and under bonds to him for frequent \u201cpuffs,\u201d\n except the undertaker, about whose employment he was recklessly\nfacetious. In Washington he was an important man, correspondent, and\nclerk of two house committees, a \u201cworker\u201d in politics, and a confident\ncritic of every woman and every man in Washington. He would be a consul\nno doubt by and by, at some foreign port, of the language of which he\nwas ignorant--though if ignorance of language were a qualification he\nmight have been a consul at home. His easy familiarity with great\nmen was beautiful to see, and when Philip learned what a tremendous\nunderground influence this little ignoramus had, he no longer wondered\nat the queer appointments and the queerer legislation.\n\nPhilip was not long in discovering that people in Washington did\nnot differ much from other people; they had the same meannesses,\ngenerosities, and tastes: A Washington boarding house had the odor of a\nboarding house the world over.\n\nCol. Sellers was as unchanged as any one Philip saw whom he had known\nelsewhere. Washington appeared to be the native element of this man. His\npretentions were equal to any he encountered there. He saw nothing in\nits society that equalled that of Hawkeye, he sat down to no table that\ncould not be unfavorably contrasted with his own at home; the most airy\nscheme inflated in the hot air of the capital only reached in magnitude\nsome of his lesser fancies, the by-play of his constructive imagination.\n\n\u201cThe country is getting along very well,\u201d he said to Philip, \u201cbut our\npublic men are too timid. What we want is more money. I've told Boutwell\nso. Talk about basing the currency on gold; you might as well base it on\npork. Gold is only one product. Base it on everything! You've got to\ndo something for the West. How am I to move my crops? We must have\nimprovements. Grant's got the idea. We want a canal from the James River\nto the Mississippi. Government ought to build it.\u201d\n\nIt was difficult to get the Colonel off from these large themes when he\nwas once started, but Philip brought the conversation round to Laura and\nher reputation in the City.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI haven't noticed much. We've been so busy about this\nUniversity. It will make Laura rich with the rest of us, and she has\ndone nearly as much as if she were a man. She has great talent, and will\nmake a big match. I see the foreign ministers and that sort after her.\nYes, there is talk, always will be about a pretty woman so much in\npublic as she is. Tough stories come to me, but I put'em away. 'Taint\nlikely one of Si Hawkins's children would do that--for she is the same\nas a child of his. I told her, though, to go slow,\u201d added the Colonel,\nas if that mysterious admonition from him would set everything right.\n\n\u201cDo you know anything about a Col. Selby?\u201d\n\n\u201cKnow all about him. Fine fellow. But he's got a wife; and I told him,\nas a friend, he'd better sheer off from Laura. I reckon he thought\nbetter of it and did.\u201d\n\nBut Philip was not long in learning the truth. Courted as Laura was by\na certain class and still admitted into society, that, nevertheless,\nbuzzed with disreputable stories about her, she had lost character with\nthe best people. Her intimacy with Selby was open gossip, and there were\nwinks and thrustings of the tongue in any group of men when she passed\nby. It was clear enough that Harry's delusion must be broken up, and\nthat no such feeble obstacle as his passion could interpose would turn\nLaura from her fate. Philip determined to see her, and put himself in\npossession of the truth, as he suspected it, in order to show Harry his\nfolly.\n\nLaura, after her last conversation with Harry, had a new sense of her\nposition. She had noticed before the signs of a change in manner towards\nher, a little less respect perhaps from men, and an avoidance by women.\nShe had attributed this latter partly to jealousy of her, for no one is\nwilling to acknowledge a fault in himself when a more agreeable motive\ncan be found for the estrangement of his acquaintances. But now, if\nsociety had turned on her, she would defy it. It was not in her nature\nto shrink. She knew she had been wronged, and she knew that she had no\nremedy.\n\nWhat she heard of Col. Selby's proposed departure alarmed her more than\nanything else, and she calmly determined that if he was deceiving her\nthe second time it should be the last. Let society finish the tragedy if\nit liked; she was indifferent what came after. At the first opportunity,\nshe charged Selby with his intention to abandon her. He unblushingly\ndenied it.\n\nHe had not thought of going to Europe. He had only been amusing himself\nwith Sellers' schemes. He swore that as soon as she succeeded with her\nbill, he would fly with her to any part of the world.\n\nShe did not quite believe him, for she saw that he feared her, and she\nbegan to suspect that his were the protestations of a coward to gain\ntime. But she showed him no doubts.\n\nShe only watched his movements day by day, and always held herself ready\nto act promptly.\n\nWhen Philip came into the presence of this attractive woman, he could\nnot realize that she was the subject of all the scandal he had heard.\nShe received him with quite the old Hawkeye openness and cordiality,\nand fell to talking at once of their little acquaintance there; and\nit seemed impossible that he could ever say to her what he had come\ndetermined to say. Such a man as Philip has only one standard by which\nto judge women.\n\nLaura recognized that fact no doubt. The better part of her woman's\nnature saw it. Such a man might, years ago, not now, have changed her\nnature, and made the issue of her life so different, even after her\ncruel abandonment. She had a dim feeling of this, and she would like now\nto stand well with him. The spark of truth and honor that was left in\nher was elicited by his presence. It was this influence that governed\nher conduct in this interview.\n\n\u201cI have come,\u201d said Philip in his direct manner, \u201cfrom my friend Mr.\nBrierly. You are not ignorant of his feeling towards you?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps not.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut perhaps you do not know, you who have so much admiration, how\nsincere and overmastering his love is for you?\u201d Philip would not have\nspoken so plainly, if he had in mind anything except to draw from Laura\nsomething that would end Harry's passion.\n\n\u201cAnd is sincere love so rare, Mr. Sterling?\u201d asked Laura, moving her\nfoot a little, and speaking with a shade of sarcasm.\n\n\u201cPerhaps not in Washington,\u201d replied Philip,--tempted into a similar\ntone. \u201cExcuse my bluntness,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut would the knowledge\nof his love; would his devotion, make any difference to you in your\nWashington life?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn respect to what?\u201d asked Laura quickly.\n\n\u201cWell, to others. I won't equivocate--to Col. Selby?\u201d\n\nLaura's face flushed with anger, or shame; she looked steadily at Philip\nand began,\n\n\u201cBy what right, sir,--\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the right of friendship,\u201d interrupted Philip stoutly. \u201cIt may matter\nlittle to you. It is everything to him. He has a Quixotic notion that\nyou would turn back from what is before you for his sake. You cannot\nbe ignorant of what all the city is talking of.\u201d Philip said this\ndeterminedly and with some bitterness.\n\nIt was a full minute before Laura spoke. Both had risen, Philip as if\nto go, and Laura in suppressed excitement. When she spoke her voice was\nvery unsteady, and she looked down.\n\n\u201cYes, I know. I perfectly understand what you mean. Mr. Brierly is\nnothing--simply nothing. He is a moth singed, that is all--the trifler\nwith women thought he was a wasp. I have no pity for him, not the least.\nYou may tell him not to make a fool of himself, and to keep away. I say\nthis on your account, not his. You are not like him. It is enough for me\nthat you want it so. Mr. Sterling,\u201d she continued, looking up; and there\nwere tears in her eyes that contradicted the hardness of her language,\n\u201cyou might not pity him if you knew my history; perhaps you would not\nwonder at some things you hear. No; it is useless to ask me why it\nmust be so. You can't make a life over--society wouldn't let you if you\nwould--and mine must be lived as it is. There, sir, I'm not offended;\nbut it is useless for you to say anything more.\u201d\n\nPhilip went away with his heart lightened about Harry, but profoundly\nsaddened by the glimpse of what this woman might have been. He told\nHarry all that was necessary of the conversation--she was bent on going\nher own way, he had not the ghost of a chance--he was a fool, she had\nsaid, for thinking he had.\n\nAnd Harry accepted it meekly, and made up his own mind that Philip\ndidn't know much about women.\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nThe galleries of the House were packed, on the momentous day, not\nbecause the reporting of an important bill back by a committee was a\nthing to be excited about, if the bill were going to take the ordinary\ncourse afterward; it would be like getting excited over the empaneling\nof a coroner's jury in a murder case, instead of saving up one's\nemotions for the grander occasion of the hanging of the accused, two\nyears later, after all the tedious forms of law had been gone through\nwith.\n\nBut suppose you understand that this coroner's jury is going to turn out\nto be a vigilance committee in disguise, who will hear testimony for\nan hour and then hang the murderer on the spot? That puts a different\naspect upon the matter. Now it was whispered that the legitimate forms\nof procedure usual in the House, and which keep a bill hanging along for\ndays and even weeks, before it is finally passed upon, were going to\nbe overruled, in this case, and short work made of the measure; and so,\nwhat was beginning as a mere inquest might, turn out to be something\nvery different.\n\nIn the course of the day's business the Order of \u201cReports of Committees\u201d\n was finally reached and when the weary crowds heard that glad\nannouncement issue from the Speaker's lips they ceased to fret at the\ndragging delay, and plucked up spirit. The Chairman of the Committee\non Benevolent Appropriations rose and made his report, and just then a\nblue-uniformed brass-mounted little page put a note into his hand.\n\nIt was from Senator Dilworthy, who had appeared upon the floor of the\nHouse for a moment and flitted away again:\n\n\u201cEverybody expects a grand assault in force; no doubt you believe, as I\ncertainly do, that it is the thing to do; we are strong, and everything\nis hot for the contest. Trollop's espousal of our cause has immensely\nhelped us and we grow in power constantly. Ten of the opposition were\ncalled away from town about noon,(but--so it is said--only for one day).\nSix others are sick, but expect to be about again tomorrow or next day,\na friend tells me. A bold onslaught is worth trying. Go for a suspension\nof the rules! You will find we can swing a two-thirds vote--I am\nperfectly satisfied of it. The Lord's truth will prevail.\n\n \u201cDILWORTHY. Mr. Buckstone had reported the bills from his\ncommittee, one by one, leaving the bill to the last. When the House had\nvoted upon the acceptance or rejection of the report upon all but it,\nand the question now being upon its disposal--Mr. Buckstone begged that\nthe House would give its attention to a few remarks which he desired to\nmake. His committee had instructed him to report the bill favorably;\nhe wished to explain the nature of the measure, and thus justify\nthe committee's action; the hostility roused by the press would\nthen disappear, and the bill would shine forth in its true and noble\ncharacter. He said that its provisions were simple. It incorporated the\nKnobs Industrial University, locating it in East Tennessee, declaring it\nopen to all persons without distinction of sex, color or religion, and\ncommitting its management to a board of perpetual trustees, with power\nto fill vacancies in their own number. It provided for the erection\nof certain buildings for the University, dormitories, lecture-halls,\nmuseums, libraries, laboratories, work-shops, furnaces, and mills. It\nprovided also for the purchase of sixty-five thousand acres of land,\n(fully described) for the purposes of the University, in the Knobs of\nEast Tennessee. And it appropriated [blank] dollars for the purchase of\nthe Land, which should be the property of the national trustees in trust\nfor the uses named.\n\nEvery effort had been made to secure the refusal of the whole amount\nof the property of the Hawkins heirs in the Knobs, some seventy-five\nthousand acres Mr. Buckstone said. But Mr. Washington Hawkins (one of\nthe heirs) objected. He was, indeed, very reluctant to sell any part of\nthe land at any price; and indeed--this reluctance was justifiable when\none considers how constantly and how greatly the property is rising in\nvalue.\n\nWhat the South needed, continued Mr. Buckstone, was skilled labor.\nWithout that it would be unable to develop its mines, build its roads,\nwork to advantage and without great waste its fruitful land, establish\nmanufactures or enter upon a prosperous industrial career. Its laborers\nwere almost altogether unskilled. Change them into intelligent, trained\nworkmen, and you increased at once the capital, the resources of the\nentire south, which would enter upon a prosperity hitherto unknown. In\nfive years the increase in local wealth would not only reimburse the\ngovernment for the outlay in this appropriation, but pour untold wealth\ninto the treasury.\n\nThis was the material view, and the least important in the honorable\ngentleman's opinion. [Here he referred to some notes furnished him by\nSenator Dilworthy, and then continued.] God had given us the care of\nthese colored millions. What account should we render to Him of our\nstewardship? We had made them free. Should we leave them ignorant? We\nhad cast them upon their own resources. Should we leave them without\ntools? We could not tell what the intentions of Providence are in regard\nto these peculiar people, but our duty was plain. The Knobs Industrial\nUniversity would be a vast school of modern science and practice, worthy\nof a great nation. It would combine the advantages of Zurich, Freiburg,\nCreuzot and the Sheffield Scientific. Providence had apparently reserved\nand set apart the Knobs of East Tennessee for this purpose. What else\nwere they for? Was it not wonderful that for more than thirty years,\nover a generation, the choicest portion of them had remained in one\nfamily, untouched, as if, separated for some great use!\n\nIt might be asked why the government should buy this land, when it had\nmillions of acres, more than the railroad companies desired, which, it\nmight devote to this purpose? He answered, that the government had no\nsuch tract of land as this. It had nothing comparable to it for the\npurposes of the University: This was to be a school of mining, of\nengineering, of the working of metals, of chemistry, zoology, botany,\nmanufactures, agriculture, in short of all the complicated industries\nthat make a state great. There was no place for the location of such a\nschool like the Knobs of East Tennessee. The hills abounded in metals\nof all sorts, iron in all its combinations, copper, bismuth, gold and\nsilver in small quantities, platinum he believed, tin, aluminium; it\nwas covered with forests and strange plants; in the woods were found the\ncoon, the opossum, the fox, the deer and many other animals who roamed\nin the domain of natural history; coal existed in enormous quantity\nand no doubt oil; it was such a place for the practice of agricultural\nexperiments that any student who had been successful there would have an\neasy task in any other portion of the country.\n\nNo place offered equal facilities for experiments in mining, metallurgy,\nengineering. He expected to live to see the day, when the youth of the\nsouth would resort to its mines, its workshops, its laboratories,\nits furnaces and factories for practical instruction in all the great\nindustrial pursuits.\n\nA noisy and rather ill-natured debate followed, now, and lasted hour\nafter hour. The friends of the bill were instructed by the leaders to\nmake no effort to check it; it was deemed better strategy to tire\nout the opposition; it was decided to vote down every proposition to\nadjourn, and so continue the sitting into the night; opponents might\ndesert, then, one by one and weaken their party, for they had no\npersonal stake in the bill.\n\nSunset came, and still the fight went on; the gas was lit, the crowd\nin the galleries began to thin, but the contest continued; the crowd\nreturned, by and by, with hunger and thirst appeased, and aggravated the\nhungry and thirsty House by looking contented and comfortable; but\nstill the wrangle lost nothing of its bitterness. Recesses were\nmoved plaintively by the opposition, and invariably voted down by the\nUniversity army.\n\nAt midnight the House presented a spectacle calculated to interest a\nstranger. The great galleries were still thronged--though only with men,\nnow; the bright colors that had made them look like hanging gardens were\ngone, with the ladies. The reporters' gallery, was merely occupied by\none or two watchful sentinels of the quill-driving guild; the main body\ncared nothing for a debate that had dwindled to a mere vaporing of dull\nspeakers and now and then a brief quarrel over a point of order; but\nthere was an unusually large attendance of journalists in the reporters'\nwaiting-room, chatting, smoking, and keeping on the 'qui vive' for the\ngeneral irruption of the Congressional volcano that must come when\nthe time was ripe for it. Senator Dilworthy and Philip were in the\nDiplomatic Gallery; Washington sat in the public gallery, and Col.\nSellers was, not far away. The Colonel had been flying about the\ncorridors and button-holing Congressmen all the evening, and believed\nthat he had accomplished a world of valuable service; but fatigue was\ntelling upon him, now, and he was quiet and speechless--for once. Below,\na few Senators lounged upon the sofas set apart for visitors, and talked\nwith idle Congressmen. A dreary member was speaking; the presiding\nofficer was nodding; here and there little knots of members stood in the\naisles, whispering together; all about the House others sat in all the\nvarious attitudes that express weariness; some, tilted back, had one or\nmore legs disposed upon their desks; some sharpened pencils indolently;\nsome scribbled aimlessly; some yawned and stretched; a great many lay\nupon their breasts upon the desks, sound asleep and gently snoring. The\nflooding gaslight from the fancifully wrought roof poured down upon\nthe tranquil scene. Hardly a sound disturbed the stillness, save the\nmonotonous eloquence of the gentleman who occupied the floor. Now and\nthen a warrior of the opposition broke down under the pressure, gave it\nup, and went home.\n\nMr. Buckstone began to think it might be safe, now, to \u201cproceed to\nbusiness.\u201d He consulted with Trollop and one or two others. Senator\nDilworthy descended to the floor of the House and they went to meet him.\nAfter a brief comparison of notes, the Congressmen sought their seats\nand sent pages about the House with messages to friends. These latter\ninstantly roused up, yawned, and began to look alert. The moment the\nfloor was unoccupied, Mr. Buckstone rose, with an injured look, and\nsaid it was evident that the opponents of the bill were merely talking\nagainst time, hoping in this unbecoming way to tire out the friends of\nthe measure and so defeat it. Such conduct might be respectable enough\nin a village debating society, but it was trivial among statesmen,\nit was out of place in so august an assemblage as the House of\nRepresentatives of the United States. The friends of the bill had been\nnot only willing that its opponents should express their opinions, but\nhad strongly desired it. They courted the fullest and freest discussion;\nbut it seemed to him that this fairness was but illy appreciated,\nsince gentlemen were capable of taking advantage of it for selfish and\nunworthy ends. This trifling had gone far enough. He called for the\nquestion.\n\nThe instant Mr. Buckstone sat down, the storm burst forth. A dozen\ngentlemen sprang to their feet.\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker!\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker!\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker!\u201d\n\n\u201cOrder! Order! Order! Question! Question!\u201d\n\nThe sharp blows of the Speaker's gavel rose above the din.\n\nThe \u201cprevious question,\u201d that hated gag, was moved and carried. All\ndebate came to a sudden end, of course. Triumph No. 1.\n\nThen the vote was taken on the adoption of the report and it carried by\na surprising majority.\n\nMr. Buckstone got the floor again and moved that the rules be suspended\nand the bill read a first time.\n\nMr. Trollop--\u201cSecond the motion!\u201d\n\nThe Speaker--\u201cIt is moved and--\u201d\n\nClamor of Voices. \u201cMove we adjourn! Second the motion! Adjourn! Adjourn!\nOrder! Order!\u201d\n\nThe Speaker, (after using his gavel vigorously)--\u201cIt is moved and\nseconded that the House do now adjourn. All those in favor--\u201d\n\nVoices--\u201cDivision! Division! Ayes and nays! Ayes and nays!\u201d\n\nIt was decided to vote upon the adjournment by ayes and nays. This was\nin earnest. The excitement was furious. The galleries were in commotion\nin an instant, the reporters swarmed to their places. Idling members\nof the House flocked to their seats, nervous gentlemen sprang to their\nfeet, pages flew hither and thither, life and animation were visible\neverywhere, all the long ranks of faces in the building were kindled.\n\n\u201cThis thing decides it!\u201d thought Mr. Buckstone; \u201cbut let the fight\nproceed.\u201d\n\nThe voting began, and every sound ceased but the calling if the names\nand the \u201cAye!\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cAye!\u201d of the responses. There was not a\nmovement in the House; the people seemed to hold their breath.\n\nThe voting ceased, and then there was an interval of dead silence\nwhile the clerk made up his count. There was a two-thirds vote on the\nUniversity side--and two over.\n\nThe Speaker--\u201cThe rules are suspended, the motion is carried--first\nreading of the bill!\u201d\n\nBy one impulse the galleries broke forth into stormy applause, and even\nsome of the members of the House were not wholly able to restrain their\nfeelings. The Speaker's gavel came to the rescue and his clear voice\nfollowed:\n\n\u201cOrder, gentlemen--! The House will come to order! If spectators offend\nagain, the Sergeant-at-arms will clear the galleries!\u201d\n\nThen he cast his eyes aloft and gazed at some object attentively for a\nmoment. All eyes followed the direction of the Speaker's, and then there\nwas a general titter. The Speaker said:\n\n\u201cLet the Sergeant-at Arms inform the gentleman that his conduct is an\ninfringement of the dignity of the House--and one which is not warranted\nby the state of the weather.\u201d Poor Sellers was the culprit. He sat\nin the front seat of the gallery, with his arms and his tired body\noverflowing the balustrade--sound asleep, dead to all excitements, all\ndisturbances. The fluctuations of the Washington weather had influenced\nhis dreams, perhaps, for during the recent tempest of applause he had\nhoisted his gingham umbrella, and calmly gone on with his slumbers.\nWashington Hawkins had seen the act, but was not near enough at hand\nto save his friend, and no one who was near enough desired to spoil the\neffect. But a neighbor stirred up the Colonel, now that the House had\nits eye upon him, and the great speculator furled his tent like the\nArab. He said:\n\n\u201cBless my soul, I'm so absent-minded when I get to thinking! I never\nwear an umbrella in the house--did anybody 'notice it'? What-asleep?\nIndeed? And did you wake me sir? Thank you--thank you very much indeed.\nIt might have fallen out of my hands and been injured. Admirable\narticle, sir--present from a friend in Hong Kong; one doesn't come\nacross silk like that in this country--it's the real--Young Hyson, I'm\ntold.\u201d\n\nBy this time the incident was forgotten, for the House was at war again.\nVictory was almost in sight, now, and the friends of the bill threw\nthemselves into their work with enthusiasm. They soon moved and carried\nits second reading, and after a strong, sharp fight, carried a motion to\ngo into Committee of the whole. The Speaker left his place, of course,\nand a chairman was appointed.\n\nNow the contest raged hotter than ever--for the authority that compels\norder when the House sits as a House, is greatly diminished when it sits\nas Committee. The main fight came upon the filling of the blanks with\nthe sum to be appropriated for the purchase of the land, of course.\n\nBuckstone--\u201cMr. Chairman, I move you, sir, that the words 'three\nmillions of' be inserted.\u201d\n\nMr. Hadley--\u201cMr. Chairman, I move that the words two and a half dollars\nbe inserted.\u201d\n\nMr. Clawson--\u201cMr. Chairman, I move the insertion of the words five and\ntwenty cents, as representing the true value of this barren and isolated\ntract of desolation.\u201d\n\nThe question, according to rule, was taken upon the smallest sum first.\nIt was lost.\n\nThen upon the next smallest sum. Lost, also.\n\nAnd then upon the three millions. After a vigorous battle that lasted a\nconsiderable time, this motion was carried.\n\nThen, clause by clause the bill was read, discussed, and amended in\ntrifling particulars, and now the Committee rose and reported.\n\nThe moment the House had resumed its functions and received the report,\nMr. Buckstone moved and carried the third reading of the bill.\n\nThe same bitter war over the sum to be paid was fought over again, and\nnow that the ayes and nays could be called and placed on record, every\nman was compelled to vote by name on the three millions, and indeed on\nevery paragraph of the bill from the enacting clause straight through.\nBut as before, the friends of the measure stood firm and voted in a\nsolid body every time, and so did its enemies.\n\nThe supreme moment was come, now, but so sure was the result that not\neven a voice was raised to interpose an adjournment. The enemy were\ntotally demoralized. The bill was put upon its final passage almost\nwithout dissent, and the calling of the ayes and nays began. When it\nwas ended the triumph was complete--the two-thirds vote held good, and a\nveto was impossible, as far as the House was concerned!\n\nMr. Buckstone resolved that now that the nail was driven home, he\nwould clinch it on the other side and make it stay forever. He moved a\nreconsideration of the vote by which the bill had passed. The motion\nwas lost, of course, and the great Industrial University act was\nan accomplished fact as far as it was in the power of the House of\nRepresentatives to make it so.\n\nThere was no need to move an adjournment. The instant the last motion\nwas decided, the enemies of the University rose and flocked out of the\nHall, talking angrily, and its friends flocked after them jubilant and\ncongratulatory. The galleries disgorged their burden, and presently the\nhouse was silent and deserted.\n\nWhen Col. Sellers and Washington stepped out of the building they were\nsurprised to find that the daylight was old and the sun well up. Said\nthe Colonel:\n\n\u201cGive me your hand, my boy! You're all right at last! You're a\nmillionaire! At least you're going to be. The thing is dead sure. Don't\nyou bother about the Senate. Leave me and Dilworthy to take care of\nthat. Run along home, now, and tell Laura. Lord, it's magnificent\nnews--perfectly magnificent! Run, now. I'll telegraph my wife. She must\ncome here and help me build a house. Everything's all right now!\u201d\n\nWashington was so dazed by his good fortune and so bewildered by the\ngaudy pageant of dreams that was already trailing its long ranks through\nhis brain, that he wandered he knew not where, and so loitered by the\nway that when at last he reached home he woke to a sudden annoyance in\nthe fact that his news must be old to Laura, now, for of course Senator\nDilworthy must have already been home and told her an hour before. He\nknocked at her door, but there was no answer.\n\n\u201cThat is like the Duchess,\u201d said he. \u201cAlways cool; a body can't excite\nher-can't keep her excited, anyway. Now she has gone off to sleep again,\nas comfortably as if she were used to picking up a million dollars every\nday or two.\u201d\n\nThen he went to bed. But he could not sleep; so he got up and wrote\na long, rapturous letter to Louise, and another to his mother. And he\nclosed both to much the same effect:\n\n\u201cLaura will be queen of America, now, and she will be applauded, and\nhonored and petted by the whole nation. Her name will be in every one's\nmouth more than ever, and how they will court her and quote her bright\nspeeches. And mine, too, I suppose; though they do that more already,\nthan they really seem to deserve. Oh, the world is so bright, now, and\nso cheery; the clouds are all gone, our long struggle is ended, our\ntroubles are all over. Nothing can ever make us unhappy any more. You\ndear faithful ones will have the reward of your patient waiting now. How\nfather's Wisdom is proven at last! And how I repent me, that there have\nbeen times when I lost faith and said, the blessing he stored up for us\na tedious generation ago was but a long-drawn curse, a blight upon us\nall.

It was a bright spring morning, the air was soft\nand inspiring; in the deepening wayside green, the pink flush of the\nblossoming peach trees, the soft suffusion on the heights of Arlington,\nand the breath of the warm south wind was apparent, the annual miracle\nof the resurrection of the earth.\n\nThe Senator took off his hat and seemed to open his soul to the sweet\ninfluences of the morning. After the heat and noise of the chamber,\nunder its dull gas-illuminated glass canopy, and the all night struggle\nof passion and feverish excitement there, the open, tranquil world\nseemed like Heaven. The Senator was not in an exultant mood, but rather\nin a condition of holy joy, befitting a Christian statesman whose\nbenevolent plans Providence has made its own and stamped with approval.\nThe great battle had been fought, but the measure had still to encounter\nthe scrutiny of the Senate, and Providence sometimes acts differently in\nthe two Houses. Still the Senator was tranquil, for he knew that there\nis an esprit de corps in the Senate which does not exist in the House,\nthe effect of which is to make the members complaisant towards the\nprojects of each other, and to extend a mutual aid which in a more\nvulgar body would be called \u201clog-rolling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, under Providence, a good night's work, Mr. Sterling. The\ngovernment has founded an institution which will remove half the\ndifficulty from the southern problem. And it is a good thing for the\nHawkins heirs, a very good thing. Laura will be almost a millionaire.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think, Mr. Dilworthy, that the Hawkinses will get much of the\nmoney?\u201d asked Philip innocently, remembering the fate of the Columbus\nRiver appropriation.\n\nThe Senator looked at his companion scrutinizingly for a moment to see\nif he meant anything personal, and then replied,\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, undoubtedly. I have had their interests greatly at heart.\nThere will of course be a few expenses, but the widow and orphans will\nrealize all that Mr. Hawkins, dreamed of for them.\u201d\n\nThe birds were singing as they crossed the Presidential Square, now\nbright with its green turf and tender foliage. After the two had gained\nthe steps of the Senator's house they stood a moment, looking upon the\nlovely prospect:\n\n\u201cIt is like the peace of God,\u201d said the Senator devoutly.\n\nEntering the house, the Senator called a servant and said, \u201cTell Miss\nLaura that we are waiting to see her. I ought to have sent a messenger\non horseback half an hour ago,\u201d he added to Philip, \u201cshe will be\ntransported with our victory. You must stop to breakfast, and see the\nexcitement.\u201d The servant soon came back, with a wondering look and\nreported,\n\n\u201cMiss Laura ain't dah, sah. I reckon she hain't been dah all night!\u201d\n\nThe Senator and Philip both started up. In Laura's room there were\nthe marks of a confused and hasty departure, drawers half open, little\narticles strewn on the floor. The bed had not been disturbed. Upon\ninquiry it appeared that Laura had not been at dinner, excusing herself\nto Mrs. Dilworthy on the plea of a violent headache; that she made a\nrequest to the servants that she might not be disturbed.\n\nThe Senator was astounded. Philip thought at once of Col. Selby. Could\nLaura have run away with him? The Senator thought not. In fact it could\nnot be. Gen. Leffenwell, the member from New Orleans, had casually told\nhim at the house last night that Selby and his family went to New York\nyesterday morning and were to sail for Europe to-day.\n\nPhilip had another idea which, he did not mention. He seized his hat,\nand saying that he would go and see what he could learn, ran to the\nlodgings of Harry; whom he had not seen since yesterday afternoon, when\nhe left him to go to the House.\n\nHarry was not in. He had gone out with a hand-bag before six o'clock\nyesterday, saying that he had to go to New York, but should return next\nday. In Harry's-room on the table Philip found this note:\n\n\u201cDear Mr. Brierly:--Can you meet me at the six o'clock train, and be my\nescort to New York? I have to go about this University bill, the vote of\nan absent member we must have here, Senator Dilworthy cannot go.\n\nYours, L. H.\u201d\n\n\u201cConfound it,\u201d said Phillip, \u201cthe noodle has fallen into her trap. And\nshe promised she would let him alone.\u201d\n\nHe only stopped to send a note to Senator Dilworthy, telling him what he\nhad found, and that he should go at once to New York, and then hastened\nto the railway station. He had to wait an hour for a train, and when it\ndid start it seemed to go at a snail's pace.\n\nPhilip was devoured with anxiety. Where could they have gone? What\nwas Laura's object in taking Harry? Had the flight anything to do with\nSelby? Would Harry be such a fool as to be dragged into some public\nscandal?\n\nIt seemed as if the train would never reach Baltimore. Then there was a\nlong delay at Havre de Grace. A hot box had to be cooled at Wilmington.\nWould it never get on? Only in passing around the city of Philadelphia\ndid the train not seem to go slow. Philip stood upon the platform and\nwatched for the Boltons' house, fancied he could distinguish its roof\namong the trees, and wondered how Ruth would feel if she knew he was so\nnear her.\n\nThen came Jersey, everlasting Jersey, stupid irritating Jersey, where\nthe passengers are always asking which line they are on, and where they\nare to come out, and whether they have yet reached Elizabeth. Launched\ninto Jersey, one has a vague notion that he is on many lines and no one\nin particular, and that he is liable at any moment to come to Elizabeth.\nHe has no notion what Elizabeth is, and always resolves that the next\ntime he goes that way, he will look out of the window and see what it\nis like; but he never does. Or if he does, he probably finds that it is\nPrinceton or something of that sort. He gets annoyed, and never can\nsee the use of having different names for stations in Jersey. By and by\nthere is Newark, three or four Newarks apparently; then marshes; then\nlong rock cuttings devoted to the advertisements of patent medicines and\nready-made, clothing, and New York tonics for Jersey agues, and Jersey\nCity is reached.\n\nOn the ferry-boat Philip bought an evening paper from a boy crying\n\u201c'Ere's the Evening Gram, all about the murder,\u201d and with breathless\nhaste--ran his eyes over the following:\n\nSHOCKING MURDER!!!\n\nTRAGEDY IN HIGH LIFE!!\n\nA BEAUTIFUL WOMAN SHOOTS A DISTINGUISHED\n\nCONFEDERATE SOLDIER AT THE SOUTHERN HOTEL!!!\n\nJEALOUSY THE CAUSE!!!\n\nThis morning occurred another of those shocking murders which have\nbecome the almost daily food of the newspapers, the direct result of\nthe socialistic doctrines and woman's rights agitations, which have made\nevery woman the avenger of her own wrongs, and all society the hunting\nground for her victims.\n\nAbout nine o'clock a lady deliberately shot a man dead in the public\nparlor of the Southern Hotel, coolly remarking, as she threw down her\nrevolver and permitted herself to be taken into custody, \u201cHe brought it\non himself.\u201d Our reporters were immediately dispatched to the scene of\nthe tragedy, and gathered the following particulars.\n\nYesterday afternoon arrived at the hotel from Washington, Col. George\nSelby and family, who had taken passage and were to sail at noon to-day\nin the steamer Scotia for England. The Colonel was a handsome man about\nforty, a gentleman of wealth and high social position, a resident of\nNew Orleans. He served with distinction in the confederate army, and\nreceived a wound in the leg from which he has never entirely recovered,\nbeing obliged to use a cane in locomotion.\n\nThis morning at about nine o'clock, a lady, accompanied by a gentleman,\ncalled at the office of the hotel and asked for Col. Selby. The Colonel\nwas at breakfast. Would the clerk tell him that a lady and gentleman\nwished to see him for a moment in the parlor? The clerk says that the\ngentleman asked her, \u201cWhat do you want to see him for?\u201d and that she\nreplied, \u201cHe is going to Europe, and I ought to just say good by.\u201d\n\nCol. Selby was informed; and the lady and gentleman were shown to the\nparlor, in which were at the time three or four other persons. Five\nminutes after two shots were fired in quick succession, and there was a\nrush to the parlor from which the reports came.\n\nCol. Selby was found lying on the floor, bleeding, but not dead. Two\ngentlemen, who had just come in, had seized the lady, who made no\nresistance, and she was at once given in charge of a police officer who\narrived. The persons who were in the parlor agree substantially as to\nwhat occurred. They had happened to be looking towards the door when the\nman--Col. Selby--entered with his cane, and they looked at him, because\nhe stopped as if surprised and frightened, and made a backward movement.\nAt the same moment the lady in the bonnet advanced towards him and said\nsomething like, \u201cGeorge, will you go with me?\u201d He replied, throwing\nup his hand and retreating, \u201cMy God I can't, don't fire,\u201d and the next\ninstants two shots were heard and he fell. The lady appeared to be\nbeside herself with rage or excitement, and trembled very much when the\ngentlemen took hold of her; it was to them she said, \u201cHe brought it on\nhimself.\u201d\n\nCol. Selby was carried at once to his room and Dr. Puffer, the eminent\nsurgeon was sent for. It was found that he was shot through the breast\nand through the abdomen. Other aid was summoned, but the wounds were\nmortal, and Col Selby expired in an hour, in pain, but his mind was\nclear to the last and he made a full deposition. The substance of it\nwas that his murderess is a Miss Laura Hawkins, whom he had known\nat Washington as a lobbyist and had some business with her. She had\nfollowed him with her attentions and solicitations, and had endeavored\nto make him desert his wife and go to Europe with her. When he resisted\nand avoided her she had threatened him. Only the day before he left\nWashington she had declared that he should never go out of the city\nalive without her.\n\nIt seems to have been a deliberate and premeditated murder, the woman\nfollowing him to Washington on purpose to commit it.\n\nWe learn that the murderess, who is a woman of dazzling and transcendent\nbeauty and about twenty six or seven, is a niece of Senator Dilworthy\nat whose house she has been spending the winter. She belongs to a high\nSouthern family, and has the reputation of being an heiress. Like some\nother great beauties and belles in Washington however there have been\nwhispers that she had something to do with the lobby. If we mistake\nnot we have heard her name mentioned in connection with the sale of the\nTennessee Lands to the Knobs University, the bill for which passed the\nHouse last night.\n\nHer companion is Mr. Harry Brierly, a New York dandy, who has been in\nWashington. His connection with her and with this tragedy is not known,\nbut he was also taken into custody, and will be detained at least as a\nwitness.\n\nP. S. One of the persons present in the parlor says that after Laura\nHawkins had fired twice, she turned the pistol towards herself, but that\nBrierly sprung and caught it from her hand, and that it was he who threw\nit on the floor.\n\nFurther particulars with full biographies of all the parties in our next\nedition. Philip hastened at once to the Southern Hotel, where he\nfound still a great state of excitement, and a thousand different and\nexaggerated stories passing from mouth to mouth. The witnesses of the\nevent had told it over so many times that they had worked it up into a\nmost dramatic scene, and embellished it with whatever could heighten its\nawfulness. Outsiders had taken up invention also. The Colonel's wife\nhad gone insane, they said. The children had rushed into the parlor and\nrolled themselves in their father's blood. The hotel clerk said that he\nnoticed there was murder in the woman's eye when he saw her. A person\nwho had met the woman on the stairs felt a creeping sensation. Some\nthought Brierly was an accomplice, and that he had set the woman on to\nkill his rival. Some said the woman showed the calmness and indifference\nof insanity.\n\nPhilip learned that Harry and Laura had both been taken to the city\nprison, and he went there; but he was not admitted. Not being a\nnewspaper reporter, he could not see either of them that night; but the\nofficer questioned him suspiciously and asked him who he was. He might\nperhaps see Brierly in the morning.\n\nThe latest editions of the evening papers had the result of the inquest.\nIt was a plain enough case for the jury, but they sat over it a long\ntime, listening to the wrangling of the physicians. Dr. Puffer insisted\nthat the man died from the effects of the wound in the chest. Dr. Dobb\nas strongly insisted that the wound in the abdomen caused death. Dr.\nGolightly suggested that in his opinion death ensued from a complication\nof the two wounds and perhaps other causes. He examined the table\nwaiter, as to whether Col. Selby ate any breakfast, and what he ate, and\nif he had any appetite.\n\nThe jury finally threw themselves back upon the indisputable fact that\nSelby was dead, that either wound would have killed him (admitted by the\ndoctors), and rendered a verdict that he died from pistol-shot wounds\ninflicted by a pistol in the hands of Laura Hawkins.\n\nThe morning papers blazed with big type, and overflowed with details of\nthe murder. The accounts in the evening papers were only the premonitory\ndrops to this mighty shower. The scene was dramatically worked up in\ncolumn after column. There were sketches, biographical and historical.\nThere were long \u201cspecials\u201d from Washington, giving a full history of\nLaura's career there, with the names of men with whom she was said to\nbe intimate, a description of Senator Dilworthy's residence and of his\nfamily, and of Laura's room in his house, and a sketch of the Senator's\nappearance and what he said. There was a great deal about her beauty,\nher accomplishments and her brilliant position in society, and her\ndoubtful position in society. There was also an interview with Col.\nSellers and another with Washington Hawkins, the brother of the\nmurderess. One journal had a long dispatch from Hawkeye, reporting\nthe excitement in that quiet village and the reception of the awful\nintelligence.\n\nAll the parties had been \u201cinterviewed.\u201d There were reports of\nconversations with the clerk at the hotel; with the call-boy; with the\nwaiter at table with all the witnesses, with the policeman, with the\nlandlord (who wanted it understood that nothing of that sort had ever\nhappened in his house before, although it had always been frequented\nby the best Southern society,) and with Mrs. Col. Selby. There were\ndiagrams illustrating the scene of the shooting, and views of the hotel\nand street, and portraits of the parties.\n\nThere were three minute and different statements from the doctors about\nthe wounds, so technically worded that nobody could understand them.\nHarry and Laura had also been \u201cinterviewed\u201d and there was a statement\nfrom Philip himself, which a reporter had knocked him up out of bed\nat midnight to give, though how he found him, Philip never could\nconjecture.\n\nWhat some of the journals lacked in suitable length for the occasion,\nthey made up in encyclopaedic information about other similar murders\nand shootings.\n\nThe statement from Laura was not full, in fact it was fragmentary, and\nconsisted of nine parts of, the reporter's valuable observations to\none of Laura's, and it was, as the reporter significantly remarked,\n\u201cincoherent\u201d, but it appeared that Laura claimed to be Selby's wife, or\nto have been his wife, that he had deserted her and betrayed her, and\nthat she was going to follow him to Europe. When the reporter asked:\n\n\u201cWhat made you shoot him, Miss Hawkins?\u201d\n\nLaura's only reply was, very simply,\n\n\u201cDid I shoot him? Do they say I shot him?\u201d. And she would say no more.\n\nThe news of the murder was made the excitement of the day. Talk of it\nfilled the town. The facts reported were scrutinized, the standing of\nthe parties was discussed, the dozen different theories of the motive,\nbroached in the newspapers, were disputed over.\n\nDuring the night subtle electricity had carried the tale over all the\nwires of the continent and under the sea; and in all villages and towns\nof the Union, from the Atlantic to the territories, and away up and\ndown the Pacific slope, and as far as London and Paris and Berlin, that\nmorning the name of Laura Hawkins was spoken by millions and millions\nof people, while the owner of it--the sweet child of years ago, the\nbeautiful queen of Washington drawing rooms--sat shivering on her\ncot-bed in the darkness of a damp cell in the Tombs.\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nPhilip's first effort was to get Harry out of the Tombs. He gained\npermission to see him, in the presence of an officer, during the day,\nand he found that hero very much cast down.\n\n\u201cI never intended to come to such a place as this, old fellow,\u201d he said\nto Philip; \u201cit's no place for a gentleman, they've no idea how to treat\na gentleman. Look at that provender,\u201d pointing to his uneaten prison\nration. \u201cThey tell me I am detained as a witness, and I passed the night\namong a lot of cut-throats and dirty rascals--a pretty witness I'd be in\na month spent in such company.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what under heavens,\u201d asked Philip, \u201cinduced you to come to New York\nwith Laura! What was it for?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat for? Why, she wanted me to come. I didn't know anything about that\ncursed Selby. She said it was lobby business for the University. I'd no\nidea what she was dragging me into that confounded hotel for. I suppose\nshe knew that the Southerners all go there, and thought she'd find her\nman. Oh! Lord, I wish I'd taken your advice. You might as well murder\nsomebody and have the credit of it, as get into the newspapers the way I\nhave. She's pure devil, that girl. You ought to have seen how sweet she\nwas on me; what an ass I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I'm not going to dispute a poor prisoner. But the first thing is\nto get you out of this. I've brought the note Laura wrote you, for one\nthing, and I've seen your uncle, and explained the truth of the case to\nhim. He will be here soon.\u201d\n\nHarry's uncle came, with other friends, and in the course of the day\nmade such a showing to the authorities that Harry was released, on\ngiving bonds to appear as a witness when wanted. His spirits rose with\ntheir usual elasticity as soon as he was out of Centre Street, and he\ninsisted on giving Philip and his friends a royal supper at Delmonico's,\nan excess which was perhaps excusable in the rebound of his feelings,\nand which was committed with his usual reckless generosity. Harry\nordered the supper, and it is perhaps needless to say that Philip paid\nthe bill.\n\nNeither of the young men felt like attempting to see Laura that day, and\nshe saw no company except the newspaper reporters, until the arrival of\nCol. Sellers and Washington Hawkins, who had hastened to New York with\nall speed.\n\nThey found Laura in a cell in the upper tier of the women's department.\nThe cell was somewhat larger than those in the men's department, and\nmight be eight feet by ten square, perhaps a little longer. It was of\nstone, floor and all, and tile roof was oven shaped. A narrow slit\nin the roof admitted sufficient light, and was the only means of\nventilation; when the window was opened there was nothing to prevent the\nrain coming in. The only means of heating being from the corridor, when\nthe door was ajar, the cell was chilly and at this time damp. It was\nwhitewashed and clean, but it had a slight jail odor; its only furniture\nwas a narrow iron bedstead, with a tick of straw and some blankets, not\ntoo clean.\n\nWhen Col. Sellers was conducted to this cell by the matron and looked\nin, his emotions quite overcame him, the tears rolled down his cheeks\nand his voice trembled so that he could hardly speak. Washington was\nunable to say anything; he looked from Laura to the miserable creatures\nwho were walking in the corridor with unutterable disgust. Laura was\nalone calm and self-contained, though she was not unmoved by the sight\nof the grief of her friends.\n\n\u201cAre you comfortable, Laura?\u201d was the first word the Colonel could get\nout.\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d she replied. \u201cI can't say it's exactly comfortable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you cold?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is pretty chilly. The stone floor is like ice. It chills me through\nto step on it. I have to sit on the bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor thing, poor thing. And can you eat any thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I am not hungry. I don't know that I could eat any thing, I can't\neat that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d continued the Colonel, \u201cit's dreadful. But cheer up, dear,\ncheer up;\u201d and the Colonel broke down entirely.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he went on, \u201cwe'll stand by you. We'll do everything for you. I\nknow you couldn't have meant to do it, it must have been insanity, you\nknow, or something of that sort. You never did anything of the sort\nbefore.\u201d\n\nLaura smiled very faintly and said,\n\n\u201cYes, it was something of that sort. It's all a whirl. He was a villain;\nyou don't know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'd rather have killed him myself, in a duel you know, all fair. I\nwish I had. But don't you be down. We'll get you the best counsel, the\nlawyers in New York can do anything; I've read of cases. But you must be\ncomfortable now. We've brought some of your clothes, at the hotel. What\nelse, can we get for you?\u201d\n\nLaura suggested that she would like some sheets for her bed, a piece\nof carpet to step on, and her meals sent in; and some books and writing\nmaterials if it was allowed. The Colonel and Washington promised to\nprocure all these things, and then took their sorrowful leave, a great\ndeal more affected than the criminal was, apparently, by her situation.\n\nThe colonel told the matron as he went away that if she would look to\nLaura's comfort a little it shouldn't be the worse for her; and to the\nturnkey who let them out he patronizingly said,\n\n\u201cYou've got a big establishment here, a credit to the city. I've got a\nfriend in there--I shall see you again, sir.\u201d\n\nBy the next day something more of Laura's own story began to appear in\nthe newspapers, colored and heightened by reporters' rhetoric. Some of\nthem cast a lurid light upon the Colonel's career, and represented his\nvictim as a beautiful avenger of her murdered innocence; and others\npictured her as his willing paramour and pitiless slayer. Her\ncommunications to the reporters were stopped by her lawyers as soon as\nthey were retained and visited her, but this fact did not prevent--it\nmay have facilitated--the appearance of casual paragraphs here and there\nwhich were likely to beget popular sympathy for the poor girl.\n\nThe occasion did not pass without \u201cimprovement\u201d by the leading journals;\nand Philip preserved the editorial comments of three or four of them\nwhich pleased him most. These he used to read aloud to his friends\nafterwards and ask them to guess from which journal each of them had\nbeen cut. One began in this simple manner:--\n\nHistory never repeats itself, but the Kaleidoscopic combinations of\nthe pictured present often seem to be constructed out of the broken\nfragments of antique legends. Washington is not Corinth, and Lais, the\nbeautiful daughter of Timandra, might not have been the prototype of\nthe ravishing Laura, daughter of the plebeian house of Hawkins; but the\norators add statesmen who were the purchasers of the favors of the one,\nmay have been as incorruptible as the Republican statesmen who learned\nhow to love and how to vote from the sweet lips of the Washington\nlobbyist; and perhaps the modern Lais would never have departed from the\nnational Capital if there had been there even one republican Xenocrates\nwho resisted her blandishments. But here the parallel: fails. Lais,\nwandering away with the youth Rippostratus, is slain by the women who\nare jealous of her charms. Laura, straying into her Thessaly with the\nyouth Brierly, slays her other lover and becomes the champion of the\nwrongs of her sex. Another journal began its editorial with less lyrical\nbeauty, but with equal force. It closed as follows:--\n\nWith Laura Hawkins, fair, fascinating and fatal, and with the dissolute\nColonel of a lost cause, who has reaped the harvest he sowed, we have\nnothing to do. But as the curtain rises on this awful tragedy, we catch\na glimpse of the society at the capital under this Administration, which\nwe cannot contemplate without alarm for the fate of the Republic. A\nthird newspaper took up the subject in a different tone. It said:--\n\nOur repeated predictions are verified. The pernicious doctrines which\nwe have announced as prevailing in American society have been again\nillustrated. The name of the city is becoming a reproach. We may have\ndone something in averting its ruin in our resolute exposure of the\nGreat Frauds; we shall not be deterred from insisting that the outraged\nlaws for the protection of human life shall be vindicated now, so that a\nperson can walk the streets or enter the public houses, at least in\nthe day-time, without the risk of a bullet through his brain. A fourth\njournal began its remarks as follows:--\n\nThe fullness with which we present our readers this morning the details\nof the Selby-Hawkins homicide is a miracle of modern journalism.\nSubsequent investigation can do little to fill out the picture. It\nis the old story. A beautiful woman shoots her absconding lover in\ncold-blood; and we shall doubtless learn in due time that if she was not\nas mad as a hare in this month of March, she was at least laboring under\nwhat is termed \u201cmomentary insanity.\u201d It would not be too much to say\nthat upon the first publication of the facts of the tragedy, there was\nan almost universal feeling of rage against the murderess in the Tombs,\nand that reports of her beauty only heightened the indignation. It was\nas if she presumed upon that and upon her sex, to defy the law; and\nthere was a fervent hope that the law would take its plain course.\n\nYet Laura was not without friends, and some of them very influential\ntoo. She had in her keeping a great many secrets and a great many\nreputations, perhaps. Who shall set himself up to judge human motives.\nWhy, indeed, might we not feel pity for a woman whose brilliant career\nhad been so suddenly extinguished in misfortune and crime? Those who had\nknown her so well in Washington might find it impossible to believe\nthat the fascinating woman could have had murder in her heart, and\nwould readily give ear to the current sentimentality about the temporary\naberration of mind under the stress of personal calamity.\n\nSenator Dilworthy, was greatly shocked, of course, but he was full of\ncharity for the erring.\n\n\u201cWe shall all need mercy,\u201d he said. \u201cLaura as an inmate of my family was\na most exemplary female, amiable, affectionate and truthful, perhaps too\nfond of gaiety, and neglectful of the externals of religion, but a woman\nof principle. She may have had experiences of which I am ignorant, but\nshe could not have gone to this extremity if she had been in her own\nright mind.\u201d\n\nTo the Senator's credit be it said, he was willing to help Laura and her\nfamily in this dreadful trial. She, herself, was not without money, for\nthe Washington lobbyist is not seldom more fortunate than the Washington\nclaimant, and she was able to procure a good many luxuries to mitigate\nthe severity of her prison life. It enabled her also to have her own\nfamily near her, and to see some of them daily. The tender solicitude\nof her mother, her childlike grief, and her firm belief in the real\nguiltlessness of her daughter, touched even the custodians of the Tombs\nwho are enured to scenes of pathos.\n\nMrs. Hawkins had hastened to her daughter as soon as she received money\nfor the journey. She had no reproaches, she had only tenderness and\npity. She could not shut out the dreadful facts of the case, but it\nhad been enough for her that Laura had said, in their first interview,\n\u201cmother, I did not know what I was doing.\u201d She obtained lodgings near\nthe prison and devoted her life to her daughter, as if she had been\nreally her own child. She would have remained in the prison day and\nnight if it had been permitted. She was aged and feeble, but this great\nnecessity seemed to give her new life.\n\nThe pathetic story of the old lady's ministrations, and her simplicity\nand faith, also got into the newspapers in time, and probably added to\nthe pathos of this wrecked woman's fate, which was beginning to be felt\nby the public. It was certain that she had champions who thought that\nher wrongs ought to be placed against her crime, and expressions of this\nfeeling came to her in various ways. Visitors came to see her, and gifts\nof fruit and flowers were sent, which brought some cheer into her hard\nand gloomy cell.\n\nLaura had declined to see either Philip or Harry, somewhat to the\nformer's relief, who had a notion that she would necessarily feel\nhumiliated by seeing him after breaking faith with him, but to the\ndiscomfiture of Harry, who still felt her fascination, and thought her\nrefusal heartless. He told Philip that of course he had got through with\nsuch a woman, but he wanted to see her.\n\nPhilip, to keep him from some new foolishness, persuaded him to go\nwith him to Philadelphia; and, give his valuable services in the mining\noperations at Ilium.\n\nThe law took its course with Laura. She was indicted for murder in\nthe first degree and held for trial at the summer term. The two most\ndistinguished criminal lawyers in the city had been retained for her\ndefence, and to that the resolute woman devoted her days with a courage\nthat rose as she consulted with her counsel and understood the methods\nof criminal procedure in New York.\n\nShe was greatly depressed, however, by the news from Washington.\nCongress adjourned and her bill had failed to pass the Senate. It must\nwait for the next session.\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nIt had been a bad winter, somehow, for the firm of Pennybacker, Bigler\nand Small. These celebrated contractors usually made more money during\nthe session of the legislature at Harrisburg than upon all their summer\nwork, and this winter had been unfruitful. It was unaccountable to\nBigler.\n\n\u201cYou see, Mr. Bolton,\u201d he said, and Philip was present at the\nconversation, \u201cit puts us all out. It looks as if politics was played\nout. We'd counted on the year of Simon's re-election. And, now, he's\nreelected, and I've yet to see the first man who's the better for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don't mean to say,\u201d asked Philip, \u201cthat he went in without paying\nanything?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a cent, not a dash cent, as I can hear,\u201d repeated Mr. Bigler,\nindignantly. \u201cI call it a swindle on the state. How it was done gets me.\nI never saw such a tight time for money in Harrisburg.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere there no combinations, no railroad jobs, no mining schemes put\nthrough in connection with the election?\n\n\u201cNot that I knew,\u201d said Bigler, shaking his head in disgust. \u201cIn fact it\nwas openly said, that there was no money in the election. It's perfectly\nunheard of.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d suggested Philip, \u201cit was effected on what the insurance\ncompanies call the 'endowment,' or the 'paid up' plan, by which a policy\nis secured after a certain time without further payment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think then,\u201d said Mr. Bolton smiling, \u201cthat a liberal and sagacious\npolitician might own a legislature after a time, and not be bothered\nwith keeping up his payments?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever it is,\u201d interrupted Mr. Bigler, \u201cit's devilish ingenious and\ngoes ahead of my calculations; it's cleaned me out, when I thought we\nhad a dead sure thing. I tell you what it is, gentlemen, I shall go in\nfor reform. Things have got pretty mixed when a legislature will give\naway a United States senatorship.\u201d\n\nIt was melancholy, but Mr. Bigler was not a man to be crushed by one\nmisfortune, or to lose his confidence in human nature, on one exhibition\nof apparent honesty. He was already on his feet again, or would be if\nMr. Bolton could tide him over shoal water for ninety days.\n\n\u201cWe've got something with money in it,\u201d he explained to Mr. Bolton,\n\u201cgot hold of it by good luck. We've got the entire contract for Dobson's\nPatent Pavement for the city of Mobile. See here.\u201d\n\nMr. Bigler made some figures; contract so much, cost of work and\nmaterials so much, profits so much. At the end of three months the\ncity would owe the company three hundred and seventy-five thousand\ndollars-two hundred thousand of that would be profits. The whole job was\nworth at least a million to the company--it might be more. There could\nbe no mistake in these figures; here was the contract, Mr. Bolton knew\nwhat materials were worth and what the labor would cost.\n\nMr. Bolton knew perfectly well from sore experience that there was\nalways a mistake in figures when Bigler or Small made them, and he knew\nthat he ought to send the fellow about his business. Instead of that, he\nlet him talk.\n\nThey only wanted to raise fifty thousand dollars to carry on the\ncontract--that expended they would have city bonds. Mr. Bolton said he\nhadn't the money. But Bigler could raise it on his name. Mr. Bolton said\nhe had no right to put his family to that risk. But the entire contract\ncould be assigned to him--the security was ample--it was a fortune to\nhim if it was forfeited. Besides Mr. Bigler had been unfortunate, he\ndidn't know where to look for the necessaries of life for his family. If\nhe could only have one more chance, he was sure he could right himself.\nHe begged for it.\n\nAnd Mr. Bolton yielded. He could never refuse such appeals. If he had\nbefriended a man once and been cheated by him, that man appeared to have\na claim upon him forever. He shrank, however, from telling his wife what\nhe had done on this occasion, for he knew that if any person was more\nodious than Small to his family it was Bigler.\n\n\u201cPhilip tells me,\u201d Mrs. Bolton said that evening, \u201cthat the man Bigler\nhas been with thee again to-day. I hope thee will have nothing more to\ndo with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has been very unfortunate,\u201d replied Mr. Bolton, uneasily.\n\n\u201cHe is always unfortunate, and he is always getting thee into trouble.\nBut thee didn't listen to him again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, mother, his family is in want, and I lent him my name--but I\ntook ample security. The worst that can happen will be a little\ninconvenience.\u201d\n\nMrs. Bolton looked grave and anxious, but she did not complain or\nremonstrate; she knew what a \u201clittle inconvenience\u201d meant, but she knew\nthere was no help for it. If Mr. Bolton had been on his way to market to\nbuy a dinner for his family with the only dollar he had in the world in\nhis pocket, he would have given it to a chance beggar who asked him for\nit. Mrs. Bolton only asked (and the question showed that she was no mere\nprovident than her husband where her heart was interested),\n\n\u201cBut has thee provided money for Philip to use in opening the coal\nmine?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I have set apart as much as it ought to cost to open the mine,\nas much as we can afford to lose if no coal is found. Philip has the\ncontrol of it, as equal partner in the venture, deducting the capital\ninvested. He has great confidence in his success, and I hope for his\nsake he won't be disappointed.\u201d\n\nPhilip could not but feel that he was treated very much like one of the\nBolton-family--by all except Ruth. His mother, when he went home after\nhis recovery from his accident, had affected to be very jealous of\nMrs. Bolton, about whom and Ruth she asked a thousand questions--an\naffectation of jealousy which no doubt concealed a real heartache, which\ncomes to every mother when her son goes out into the world and forms\nnew ties. And to Mrs. Sterling, a widow, living on a small income in a\nremote Massachusetts village, Philadelphia was a city of many splendors.\nAll its inhabitants seemed highly favored, dwelling in ease and\nsurrounded by superior advantages. Some of her neighbors had relations\nliving in Philadelphia, and it seemed to them somehow a guarantee of\nrespectability to have relations in Philadelphia. Mrs. Sterling was not\nsorry to have Philip make his way among such well-to-do people, and she\nwas sure that no good fortune could be too good for his deserts.\n\n\u201cSo, sir,\u201d said Ruth, when Philip came from New York, \u201cyou have been\nassisting in a pretty tragedy. I saw your name in the papers. Is this\nwoman a specimen of your western friends?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy only assistance,\u201d replied Philip, a little annoyed, \u201cwas in trying\nto keep Harry out of a bad scrape, and I failed after all. He walked\ninto her trap, and he has been punished for it. I'm going to take him\nup to Ilium to see if he won't work steadily at one thing, and quit his\nnonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs she as beautiful as the newspapers say she is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know, she has a kind of beauty--she is not like--'\n\n\u201cNot like Alice?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, she is brilliant; she was called the handsomest woman in\nWashington--dashing, you know, and sarcastic and witty. Ruth, do you\nbelieve a woman ever becomes a devil?\u201d\n\n\u201cMen do, and I don't know why women shouldn't. But I never saw one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Laura Hawkins comes very near it. But it is dreadful to think of\nher fate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, do you suppose they will hang a woman? Do you suppose they will be\nso barbarous as that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn't thinking of that--it's doubtful if a New York jury would find\na woman guilty of any such crime. But to think of her life if she is\nacquitted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is dreadful,\u201d said Ruth, thoughtfully, \u201cbut the worst of it is that\nyou men do not want women educated to do anything, to be able to earn an\nhonest living by their own exertions. They are educated as if they were\nalways to be petted and supported, and there was never to be any such\nthing as misfortune. I suppose, now, that you would all choose to have\nme stay idly at home, and give up my profession.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Philip, earnestly, \u201cI respect your resolution. But, Ruth,\ndo you think you would be happier or do more good in following your\nprofession than in having a home of your own?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is to hinder having a home of my own?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, perhaps, only you never would be in it--you would be away day\nand night, if you had any practice; and what sort of a home would that\nmake for your husband?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sort of a home is it for the wife whose husband is always away\nriding about in his doctor's gig?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, you know that is not fair. The woman makes the home.\u201d\n\nPhilip and Ruth often had this sort of discussion, to which Philip was\nalways trying to give a personal turn. He was now about to go to Ilium\nfor the season, and he did not like to go without some assurance from\nRuth that she might perhaps love him some day; when he was worthy of it,\nand when he could offer her something better than a partnership in his\npoverty.\n\n\u201cI should work with a great deal better heart, Ruth,\u201d he said the\nmorning he was taking leave, \u201cif I knew you cared for me a little.\u201d\n\nRuth was looking down; the color came faintly to her cheeks, and she\nhesitated. She needn't be looking down, he thought, for she was ever so\nmuch shorter than tall Philip.\n\n\u201cIt's not much of a place, Ilium,\u201d Philip went on, as if a little\ngeographical remark would fit in here as well as anything else, \u201cand I\nshall have plenty of time to think over the responsibility I have taken,\nand--\u201d his observation did not seem to be coming out any where.\n\nBut Ruth looked up, and there was a light in her eyes that quickened\nPhil's pulse. She took his hand, and said with serious sweetness:\n\n\u201cThee mustn't lose heart, Philip.\u201d And then she added, in another mood,\n\u201cThee knows I graduate in the summer and shall have my diploma. And\nif any thing happens--mines explode sometimes--thee can send for me.\nFarewell.\u201d\n\nThe opening of the Ilium coal mine was begun with energy, but without\nmany omens of success. Philip was running a tunnel into the breast of\nthe mountain, in faith that the coal stratum ran there as it ought\nto. How far he must go in he believed he knew, but no one could tell\nexactly. Some of the miners said that they should probably go through\nthe mountain, and that the hole could be used for a railway tunnel. The\nmining camp was a busy place at any rate. Quite a settlement of board\nand log shanties had gone up, with a blacksmith shop, a small machine\nshop, and a temporary store for supplying the wants of the workmen.\nPhilip and Harry pitched a commodious tent, and lived in the full\nenjoyment of the free life.\n\nThere is no difficulty in digging a bole in the ground, if you have\nmoney enough to pay for the digging, but those who try this sort of work\nare always surprised at the large amount of money necessary to make a\nsmall hole. The earth is never willing to yield one product, hidden in\nher bosom, without an equivalent for it. And when a person asks of her\ncoal, she is quite apt to require gold in exchange.\n\nIt was exciting work for all concerned in it. As the tunnel advanced\ninto the rock every day promised to be the golden day. This very blast\nmight disclose the treasure.\n\nThe work went on week after week, and at length during the night as\nwell as the daytime. Gangs relieved each other, and the tunnel was every\nhour, inch by inch and foot by foot, crawling into the mountain. Philip\nwas on the stretch of hope and excitement. Every pay day he saw his\nfunds melting away, and still there was only the faintest show of what\nthe miners call \u201csigns.\u201d\n\nThe life suited Harry, whose buoyant hopefulness was never disturbed.\nHe made endless calculations, which nobody could understand, of the\nprobable position of the vein. He stood about among the workmen with the\nbusiest air. When he was down at Ilium he called himself the engineer\nof the works, and he used to spend hours smoking his pipe with the Dutch\nlandlord on the hotel porch, and astonishing the idlers there with\nthe stories of his railroad operations in Missouri. He talked with the\nlandlord, too, about enlarging his hotel, and about buying some village\nlots, in the prospect of a rise, when the mine was opened. He taught the\nDutchman how to mix a great many cooling drinks for the summer time,\nand had a bill at the hotel, the growing length of which Mr. Dusenheimer\ncontemplated with pleasant anticipations. Mr. Brierly was a very useful\nand cheering person wherever he went.\n\nMidsummer arrived: Philip could report to Mr. Bolton only progress, and\nthis was not a cheerful message for him to send to Philadelphia in\nreply to inquiries that he thought became more and more anxious. Philip\nhimself was a prey to the constant fear that the money would give out\nbefore the coal was struck.\n\nAt this time Harry was summoned to New York, to attend the trial of\nLaura Hawkins. It was possible that Philip would have to go also, her\nlawyer wrote, but they hoped for a postponement. There was important\nevidence that they could not yet obtain, and he hoped the judge would\nnot force them to a trial unprepared. There were many reasons for a\ndelay, reasons which of course are never mentioned, but which it would\nseem that a New York judge sometimes must understand, when he grants\na postponement upon a motion that seems to the public altogether\ninadequate.\n\nHarry went, but he soon came back. The trial was put off. Every week we\ncan gain, said the learned counsel, Braham, improves our chances. The\npopular rage never lasts long.\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\n\u201cWe've struck it!\u201d\n\nThis was the announcement at the tent door that woke Philip out of a\nsound sleep at dead of night, and shook all the sleepiness out of him in\na trice.\n\n\u201cWhat! Where is it? When? Coal? Let me see it. What quality is it?\u201d\n were some of the rapid questions that Philip poured out as he hurriedly\ndressed. \u201cHarry, wake up, my boy, the coal train is coming. Struck it,\neh? Let's see?\u201d\n\nThe foreman put down his lantern, and handed Philip a black lump. There\nwas no mistake about it, it was the hard, shining anthracite, and its\nfreshly fractured surface, glistened in the light like polished steel.\nDiamond never shone with such lustre in the eyes of Philip.\n\nHarry was exuberant, but Philip's natural caution found expression in\nhis next remark.\n\n\u201cNow, Roberts, you are sure about this?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat--sure that it's coal?\u201d\n\n\u201cO, no, sure that it's the main vein.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes. We took it to be that\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you from the first?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can't say we did at first. No, we didn't. Most of the indications\nwere there, but not all of them, not all of them. So we thought we'd\nprospect a bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was tolerable thick, and looked as if it might be the vein--looked\nas if it ought to be the vein. Then we went down on it a little. Looked\nbetter all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen did you strike it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout ten o'clock.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you've been prospecting about four hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, been sinking on it something over four hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm afraid you couldn't go down very far in four hours--could you?\u201d\n\n\u201cO yes--it's a good deal broke up, nothing but picking and gadding\nstuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it does look encouraging, sure enough--but then the lacking\nindications--\u201d\n\n\u201cI'd rather we had them, Mr. Sterling, but I've seen more than one good\npermanent mine struck without 'em in my time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that is encouraging too.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, there was the Union, the Alabama and the Black Mohawk--all good,\nsound mines, you know--all just exactly like this one when we first\nstruck them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I begin to feel a good deal more easy. I guess we've really got\nit. I remember hearing them tell about the Black Mohawk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm free to say that I believe it, and the men all think so too. They\nare all old hands at this business.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome Harry, let's go up and look at it, just for the comfort of it,\u201d\n said Philip. They came back in the course of an hour, satisfied and\nhappy.\n\nThere was no more sleep for them that night. They lit their pipes, put\na specimen of the coal on the table, and made it a kind of loadstone of\nthought and conversation.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthere will have to be a branch track built,\nand a 'switch-back' up the hill.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, there will be no trouble about getting the money for that now. We\ncould sell-out tomorrow for a handsome sum. That sort of coal doesn't\ngo begging within a mile of a rail-road. I wonder if Mr. Bolton would\nrather sell out or work it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, work it,\u201d says Harry, \u201cprobably the whole mountain is coal now\nyou've got to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPossibly it might not be much of a vein after all,\u201d suggested Philip.\n\n\u201cPossibly it is; I'll bet it's forty feet thick. I told you. I knew the\nsort of thing as soon as I put my eyes on it.\u201d\n\nPhilip's next thought was to write to his friends and announce their\ngood fortune. To Mr. Bolton he wrote a short, business letter, as calm\nas he could make it. They had found coal of excellent quality, but\nthey could not yet tell with absolute certainty what the vein was. The\nprospecting was still going on. Philip also wrote to Ruth; but though\nthis letter may have glowed, it was not with the heat of burning\nanthracite. He needed no artificial heat to warm his pen and kindle his\nardor when he sat down to write to Ruth. But it must be confessed that\nthe words never flowed so easily before, and he ran on for an hour\ndisporting in all the extravagance of his imagination. When Ruth read\nit, she doubted if the fellow had not gone out of his senses. And it was\nnot until she reached the postscript that she discovered the cause of\nthe exhilaration. \u201cP. S.--We have found coal.\u201d\n\nThe news couldn't have come to Mr. Bolton in better time. He had never\nbeen so sorely pressed. A dozen schemes which he had in hand, any one\nof which might turn up a fortune, all languished, and each needed just\na little more money to save that which had been invested. He hadn't a\npiece of real estate that was not covered with mortgages, even to\nthe wild tract which Philip was experimenting on, and which had, no\nmarketable value above the incumbrance on it.\n\nHe had come home that day early, unusually dejected.\n\n\u201cI am afraid,\u201d he said to his wife, \u201cthat we shall have to give up our\nhouse. I don't care for myself, but for thee and the children.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will be the least of misfortunes,\u201d said Mrs. Bolton, cheerfully,\n\u201cif thee can clear thyself from debt and anxiety, which is wearing thee\nout, we can live any where. Thee knows we were never happier than when\nwe were in a much humbler home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is, Margaret, that affair of Bigler and Small's has come\non me just when I couldn't stand another ounce. They have made another\nfailure of it. I might have known they would; and the sharpers, or\nfools, I don't know which, have contrived to involve me for three times\nas much as the first obligation. The security is in my hands, but it\nis good for nothing to me. I have not the money to do anything with the\ncontract.\u201d\n\nRuth heard this dismal news without great surprise. She had long felt\nthat they were living on a volcano, that might go in to active operation\nat any hour. Inheriting from her father an active brain and the courage\nto undertake new things, she had little of his sanguine temperament\nwhich blinds one to difficulties and possible failures. She had little\nconfidence in the many schemes which had been about to lift her father\nout of all his embarrassments and into great wealth, ever since she\nwas a child; as she grew older, she rather wondered that they were as\nprosperous as they seemed to be, and that they did not all go to smash\namid so many brilliant projects. She was nothing but a woman, and did\nnot know how much of the business prosperity of the world is only a\nbubble of credit and speculation, one scheme helping to float another\nwhich is no better than it, and the whole liable to come to naught and\nconfusion as soon as the busy brain that conceived them ceases its power\nto devise, or when some accident produces a sudden panic.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, I shall be the stay of the family, yet,\u201d said Ruth, with an\napproach to gaiety; \u201cWhen we move into a little house in town, will\nthee let me put a little sign on the door: DR. RUTH BOLTON? Mrs. Dr.\nLongstreet, thee knows, has a great income.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho will pay for the sign, Ruth?\u201d asked Mr. Bolton.\n\nA servant entered with the afternoon mail from the office. Mr. Bolton\ntook his letters listlessly, dreading to open them. He knew well what\nthey contained, new difficulties, more urgent demands for money.\n\n\u201cOh, here is one from Philip. Poor fellow. I shall feel his\ndisappointment as much as my own bad luck. It is hard to bear when one\nis young.\u201d\n\nHe opened the letter and read. As he read his face lightened, and he\nfetched such a sigh of relief, that Mrs. Bolton and Ruth both exclaimed.\n\n\u201cRead that,\u201d he cried, \u201cPhilip has found coal!\u201d\n\nThe world was changed in a moment. One little sentence had done it.\nThere was no more trouble. Philip had found coal. That meant relief.\nThat meant fortune. A great weight was taken off, and the spirits of the\nwhole household rose magically. Good Money! beautiful demon of Money,\nwhat an enchanter thou art! Ruth felt that she was of less consequence\nin the household, now that Philip had found Coal, and perhaps she was\nnot sorry to feel so.\n\nMr. Bolton was ten years younger the next morning. He went into the\ncity, and showed his letter on change. It was the sort of news his\nfriends were quite willing to listen to. They took a new interest in\nhim. If it was confirmed, Bolton would come right up again. There would\nbe no difficulty about his getting all the money he wanted. The money\nmarket did not seem to be half so tight as it was the day before. Mr.\nBolton spent a very pleasant day in his office, and went home revolving\nsome new plans, and the execution of some projects he had long been\nprevented from entering upon by the lack of money.\n\nThe day had been spent by Philip in no less excitement. By daylight,\nwith Philip's letters to the mail, word had gone down to Ilium that coal\nhad been found, and very early a crowd of eager spectators had come up\nto see for themselves.\n\nThe \u201cprospecting\u201d continued day and night for upwards of a week, and\nduring the first four or five days the indications grew more and more\npromising, and the telegrams and letters kept Mr. Bolton duly posted.\nBut at last a change came, and the promises began to fail with alarming\nrapidity. In the end it was demonstrated without the possibility of a\ndoubt that the great \u201cfind\u201d was nothing but a worthless seam.\n\nPhilip was cast down, all the more so because he had been so foolish\nas to send the news to Philadelphia before he knew what he was writing\nabout. And now he must contradict it. \u201cIt turns out to be only a mere\nseam,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut we look upon it as an indication of better further\nin.\u201d\n\nAlas! Mr. Bolton's affairs could not wait for \u201cindications.\u201d The\nfuture might have a great deal in store, but the present was black and\nhopeless. It was doubtful if any sacrifice could save him from ruin.\nYet sacrifice he must make, and that instantly, in the hope of saving\nsomething from the wreck of his fortune.\n\nHis lovely country home must go. That would bring the most ready money.\nThe house that he had built with loving thought for each one of his\nfamily, as he planned its luxurious apartments and adorned it; the\ngrounds that he had laid out, with so much delight in following the\ntastes of his wife, with whom the country, the cultivation of rare\ntrees and flowers, the care of garden and lawn and conservatories were\na passion almost; this home, which he had hoped his children would enjoy\nlong after he had done with it, must go.\n\nThe family bore the sacrifice better than he did. They declared in\nfact--women are such hypocrites--that they quite enjoyed the city\n(it was in August) after living so long in the country, that it was a\nthousand times more convenient in every respect; Mrs. Bolton said it was\na relief from the worry of a large establishment, and Ruth reminded her\nfather that she should have had to come to town anyway before long.\n\nMr. Bolton was relieved, exactly as a water-logged ship is lightened by\nthrowing overboard the most valuable portion of the cargo--but the leak\nwas not stopped. Indeed his credit was injured instead of helped by the\nprudent step he had taken. It was regarded as a sure evidence of his\nembarrassment, and it was much more difficult for him to obtain\nhelp than if he had, instead of retrenching, launched into some new\nspeculation.\n\nPhilip was greatly troubled, and exaggerated his own share in the\nbringing about of the calamity.\n\n\u201cYou must not look at it so!\u201d Mr. Bolton wrote him. \u201cYou have neither\nhelped nor hindered--but you know you may help by and by. It would have\nall happened just so, if we had never begun to dig that hole. That is\nonly a drop. Work away. I still have hope that something will occur to\nrelieve me. At any rate we must not give up the mine, so long as we have\nany show.\u201d\n\nAlas! the relief did not come. New misfortunes came instead. When the\nextent of the Bigler swindle was disclosed there was no more hope that\nMr. Bolton could extricate himself, and he had, as an honest man, no\nresource except to surrender all his property for the benefit of his\ncreditors.\n\nThe Autumn came and found Philip working with diminished force but still\nwith hope. He had again and again been encouraged by good \u201cindications,\u201d\n but he had again and again been disappointed. He could not go on much\nlonger, and almost everybody except himself had thought it was useless\nto go on as long as he had been doing.\n\nWhen the news came of Mr. Bolton's failure, of course the work stopped.\nThe men were discharged, the tools were housed, the hopeful noise of\npickman and driver ceased, and the mining camp had that desolate and\nmournful aspect which always hovers over a frustrated enterprise.\n\nPhilip sat down amid the ruins, and almost wished he were buried in\nthem. How distant Ruth was now from him, now, when she might need him\nmost. How changed was all the Philadelphia world, which had hitherto\nstood for the exemplification of happiness and prosperity.\n\nHe still had faith that there was coal in that mountain. He made a\npicture of himself living there a hermit in a shanty by the tunnel,\ndigging away with solitary pick and wheelbarrow, day after day and\nyear after year, until he grew gray and aged, and was known in all that\nregion as the old man of the mountain. Perhaps some day--he felt it must\nbe so some day--he should strike coal. But what if he did? Who would\nbe alive to care for it then? What would he care for it then? No, a man\nwants riches in his youth, when the world is fresh to him. He wondered\nwhy Providence could not have reversed the usual process, and let the\nmajority of men begin with wealth and gradually spend it, and die poor\nwhen they no longer needed it.\n\nHarry went back to the city. It was evident that his services were no\nlonger needed. Indeed, he had letters from his uncle, which he did not\nread to Philip, desiring him to go to San Francisco to look after some\ngovernment contracts in the harbor there.\n\nPhilip had to look about him for something to do; he was like Adam;\nthe world was all before him whereto choose. He made, before he went\nelsewhere, a somewhat painful visit to Philadelphia, painful but yet\nnot without its sweetnesses. The family had never shown him so much\naffection before; they all seemed to think his disappointment of more\nimportance than their own misfortune. And there was that in Ruth's\nmanner--in what she gave him and what she withheld--that would have made\na hero of a very much less promising character than Philip Sterling.\n\nAmong the assets of the Bolton property, the Ilium tract was sold, and\nPhilip bought it in at the vendue, for a song, for no one cared to even\nundertake the mortgage on it except himself. He went away the owner of\nit, and had ample time before he reached home in November, to calculate\nhow much poorer he was by possessing it.\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nIt is impossible for the historian, with even the best intentions, to\ncontrol events or compel the persons of his narrative to act wisely or\nto be successful. It is easy to see how things might have been better\nmanaged; a very little change here and there would have made a very\ndifferent history of this one now in hand.\n\nIf Philip had adopted some regular profession, even some trade, he might\nnow be a prosperous editor or a conscientious plumber, or an honest\nlawyer, and have borrowed money at the saving's bank and built a\ncottage, and be now furnishing it for the occupancy of Ruth and himself.\nInstead of this, with only a smattering of civil engineering, he is\nat his mother's house, fretting and fuming over his ill-luck, and the\nhardness and, dishonesty of men, and thinking of nothing but how to get\nthe coal out of the Ilium hills.\n\nIf Senator Dilworthy had not made that visit to Hawkeye, the Hawkins\nfamily and Col. Sellers would not now be dancing attendance upon\nCongress, and endeavoring to tempt that immaculate body into one of\nthose appropriations, for the benefit of its members, which the members\nfind it so difficult to explain to their constituents; and Laura would\nnot be lying in the Tombs, awaiting her trial for murder, and doing\nher best, by the help of able counsel, to corrupt the pure fountain of\ncriminal procedure in New York.\n\nIf Henry Brierly had been blown up on the first Mississippi steamboat he\nset foot on, as the chances were that he would be, he and Col. Sellers\nnever would have gone into the Columbus Navigation scheme, and probably\nnever into the East Tennessee Land scheme, and he would not now be\ndetained in New York from very important business operations on the\nPacific coast, for the sole purpose of giving evidence to convict of\nmurder the only woman he ever loved half as much as he loves himself. If\nMr. Bolton had said the little word \u201cno\u201d to Mr. Bigler, Alice Montague\nmight now be spending the winter in Philadelphia, and Philip also\n(waiting to resume his mining operations in the spring); and Ruth would\nnot be an assistant in a Philadelphia hospital, taxing her strength with\narduous routine duties, day by day, in order to lighten a little the\nburdens that weigh upon her unfortunate family.\n\nIt is altogether a bad business. An honest historian, who had progressed\nthus far, and traced everything to such a condition of disaster\nand suspension, might well be justified in ending his narrative and\nwriting--\u201cafter this the deluge.\u201d His only consolation would be in the\nreflection that he was not responsible for either characters or events.\n\nAnd the most annoying thought is that a little money, judiciously\napplied, would relieve the burdens and anxieties of most of these\npeople; but affairs seem to be so arranged that money is most difficult\nto get when people need it most.\n\nA little of what Mr. Bolton has weakly given to unworthy people would\nnow establish his family in a sort of comfort, and relieve Ruth of the\nexcessive toil for which she inherited no adequate physical vigor. A\nlittle money would make a prince of Col. Sellers; and a little more\nwould calm the anxiety of Washington Hawkins about Laura, for however\nthe trial ended, he could feel sure of extricating her in the end.\nAnd if Philip had a little money he could unlock the stone door in\nthe mountain whence would issue a stream of shining riches. It needs a\ngolden wand to strike that rock. If the Knobs University bill could only\ngo through, what a change would be wrought in the condition of most of\nthe persons in this history. Even Philip himself would feel the good\neffects of it; for Harry would have something and Col. Sellers would\nhave something; and have not both these cautious people expressed a\ndetermination to take an interest in the Ilium mine when they catch\ntheir larks?\n\nPhilip could not resist the inclination to pay a visit to Fallkill. He\nhad not been at the Montague's since the time he saw Ruth there, and he\nwanted to consult the Squire about an occupation. He was determined now\nto waste no more time in waiting on Providence, but to go to work at\nsomething, if it were nothing better, than teaching in the Fallkill\nSeminary, or digging clams on Hingham beach. Perhaps he could read law\nin Squire Montague's office while earning his bread as a teacher in the\nSeminary.\n\nIt was not altogether Philip's fault, let us own, that he was in this\nposition. There are many young men like him in American society, of\nhis age, opportunities, education and abilities, who have really been\neducated for nothing and have let themselves drift, in the hope that\nthey will find somehow, and by some sudden turn of good luck, the\ngolden road to fortune. He was not idle or lazy, he had energy and a\ndisposition to carve his own way. But he was born into a time when all\nyoung men of his age caught the fever of speculation, and expected to\nget on in the world by the omission of some of the regular processes\nwhich have been appointed from of old.\n\nAnd examples were not wanting to encourage him. He saw people, all\naround him, poor yesterday, rich to-day, who had come into sudden\nopulence by some means which they could not have classified among any of\nthe regular occupations of life. A war would give such a fellow a\ncareer and very likely fame. He might have been a \u201crailroad man,\u201d or a\npolitician, or a land speculator, or one of those mysterious people\nwho travel free on all rail-roads and steamboats, and are continually\ncrossing and recrossing the Atlantic, driven day and night about nobody\nknows what, and make a great deal of money by so doing. Probably, at\nlast, he sometimes thought with a whimsical smile, he should end by\nbeing an insurance agent, and asking people to insure their lives for\nhis benefit.\n\nPossibly Philip did not think how much the attractions of Fallkill were\nincreased by the presence of Alice there. He had known her so long,\nshe had somehow grown into his life by habit, that he would expect the\npleasure of her society without thinking much about it. Latterly he\nnever thought of her without thinking of Ruth, and if he gave the\nsubject any attention, it was probably in an undefined consciousness\nthat, he had her sympathy in his love, and that she was always willing\nto hear him talk about it. If he ever wondered that Alice herself was\nnot in love and never spoke of the possibility of her own marriage, it\nwas a transient thought for love did not seem necessary, exactly, to one\nso calm and evenly balanced and with so many resources in her herself.\n\nWhatever her thoughts may have been they were unknown to Philip, as they\nare to these historians; if she was seeming to be what she was not, and\ncarrying a burden heavier than any one else carried, because she had\nto bear it alone, she was only doing what thousands of women do, with a\nself-renunciation and heroism, of which men, impatient and complaining,\nhave no conception. Have not these big babies with beards filled all\nliterature with their outcries, their griefs and their lamentations?\nIt is always the gentle sex which is hard and cruel and fickle and\nimplacable.\n\n\u201cDo you think you would be contented to live in Fallkill, and attend the\ncounty Court?\u201d asked Alice, when Philip had opened the budget of his new\nprogramme.\n\n\u201cPerhaps not always,\u201d said Philip, \u201cI might go and practice in Boston\nmaybe, or go to Chicago.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr you might get elected to Congress.\u201d\n\nPhilip looked at Alice to see if she was in earnest and not chaffing\nhim. Her face was quite sober. Alice was one of those patriotic women\nin the rural districts, who think men are still selected for Congress on\naccount of qualifications for the office.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Philip, \u201cthe chances are that a man cannot get into congress\nnow without resorting to arts and means that should render him unfit to\ngo there; of course there are exceptions; but do you know that I\ncould not go into politics if I were a lawyer, without losing standing\nsomewhat in my profession, and without raising at least a suspicion of\nmy intentions and unselfishness? Why, it is telegraphed all over the\ncountry and commented on as something wonderful if a congressman votes\nhonestly and unselfishly and refuses to take advantage of his position\nto steal from the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d insisted Alice, \u201cI should think it a noble ambition to go to\ncongress, if it is so bad, and help reform it. I don't believe it is as\ncorrupt as the English parliament used to be, if there is any truth in\nthe novels, and I suppose that is reformed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm sure I don't know where the reform is to begin. I've seen a\nperfectly capable, honest man, time and again, run against an illiterate\ntrickster, and get beaten. I suppose if the people wanted decent members\nof congress they would elect them. Perhaps,\u201d continued Philip with a\nsmile, \u201cthe women will have to vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I should be willing to, if it were a necessity, just as I\nwould go to war and do what I could, if the country couldn't be saved\notherwise,\u201d said Alice, with a spirit that surprised Philip, well as he\nthought he knew her. \u201cIf I were a young gentleman in these times--\u201d\n\nPhilip laughed outright. \u201cIt's just what Ruth used to say, 'if she were\na man.' I wonder if all the young ladies are contemplating a change of\nsex.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, only a changed sex,\u201d retorted Alice; \u201cwe contemplate for the most\npart young men who don't care for anything they ought to care for.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Philip, looking humble, \u201cI care for some things, you and\nRuth for instance; perhaps I ought not to. Perhaps I ought to care for\nCongress and that sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon't be a goose, Philip. I heard from Ruth yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I see her letter?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, indeed. But I am afraid her hard work is telling on her, together\nwith her anxiety about her father.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think, Alice,\u201d asked Philip with one of those selfish thoughts\nthat are not seldom mixed with real love, \u201cthat Ruth prefers her\nprofession to--to marriage?\u201d\n\n\u201cPhilip,\u201d exclaimed Alice, rising to quit the room, and speaking\nhurriedly as if the words were forced from her, \u201cyou are as blind as a\nbat; Ruth would cut off her right hand for you this minute.\u201d\n\nPhilip never noticed that Alice's face was flushed and that her voice\nwas unsteady; he only thought of the delicious words he had heard. And\nthe poor girl, loyal to Ruth, loyal to Philip, went straight to her\nroom, locked the door, threw herself on the bed and sobbed as if her\nheart would break. And then she prayed that her Father in Heaven would\ngive her strength. And after a time she was calm again, and went to\nher bureau drawer and took from a hiding place a little piece of paper,\nyellow with age. Upon it was pinned a four-leaved clover, dry and yellow\nalso. She looked long at this foolish memento. Under the clover leaf was\nwritten in a school-girl's hand--\u201cPhilip, June, 186-.\u201d\n\nSquire Montague thought very well of Philip's proposal. It would have\nbeen better if he had begun the study of the law as soon as he left\ncollege, but it was not too late now, and besides he had gathered some\nknowledge of the world.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d asked the Squire, \u201cdo you mean to abandon your land in\nPennsylvania?\u201d This track of land seemed an immense possible fortune to\nthis New England lawyer-farmer. \u201cHasn't it good timber, and doesn't the\nrailroad almost touch it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can't do anything with it now. Perhaps I can sometime.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is your reason for supposing that there is coal there?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe opinion of the best geologist I could consult, my own observation\nof the country, and the little veins of it we found. I feel certain it\nis there. I shall find it some day. I know it. If I can only keep the\nland till I make money enough to try again.\u201d\n\nPhilip took from his pocket a map of the anthracite coal region, and\npointed out the position of the Ilium mountain which he had begun to\ntunnel.\n\n\u201cDoesn't it look like it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt certainly does,\u201d said the Squire, very much interested. It is not\nunusual for a quiet country gentleman to be more taken with such\na venture than a speculator who, has had more experience in its\nuncertainty. It was astonishing how many New England clergymen, in the\ntime of the petroleum excitement, took chances in oil. The Wall street\nbrokers are said to do a good deal of small business for country\nclergymen, who are moved no doubt with the laudable desire of purifying\nthe New York stock board.\n\n\u201cI don't see that there is much risk,\u201d said the Squire, at length. \u201cThe\ntimber is worth more than the mortgage; and if that coal seam does run\nthere, it's a magnificent fortune. Would you like to try it again in the\nspring, Phil?\u201d\n\nLike to try it! If he could have a little help, he would work himself,\nwith pick and barrow, and live on a crust. Only give him one more\nchance.\n\nAnd this is how it came about that the cautious old Squire Montague was\ndrawn into this young fellow's speculation, and began to have his serene\nold age disturbed by anxieties and by the hope of a great stroke of\nluck.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, I only care about it for the boy,\u201d he said. The Squire was\nlike everybody else; sooner or later he must \u201ctake a chance.\u201d\n\nIt is probably on account of the lack of enterprise in women that they\nare not so fond of stock speculations and mine ventures as men. It\nis only when woman becomes demoralized that she takes to any sort of\ngambling. Neither Alice nor Ruth were much elated with the prospect of\nPhilip's renewal of his mining enterprise.\n\nBut Philip was exultant. He wrote to Ruth as if his fortune were already\nmade, and as if the clouds that lowered over the house of Bolton were\nalready in the deep bosom of a coal mine buried. Towards spring he\nwent to Philadelphia with his plans all matured for a new campaign. His\nenthusiasm was irresistible.\n\n\u201cPhilip has come, Philip has come,\u201d cried the children, as if some great\ngood had again come into the household; and the refrain even sang itself\nover in Ruth's heart as she went the weary hospital rounds. Mr. Bolton\nfelt more courage than he had had in months, at the sight of his manly\nface and the sound of his cheery voice.\n\nRuth's course was vindicated now, and it certainly did not become\nPhilip, who had nothing to offer but a future chance against the visible\nresult of her determination and industry, to open an argument with\nher. Ruth was never more certain that she was right and that she was\nsufficient unto herself. She, may be, did not much heed the still small\nvoice that sang in her maiden heart as she went about her work, and\nwhich lightened it and made it easy, \u201cPhilip has come.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad for father's sake,\u201d she said to Philip, \u201cthat thee has come.\nI can see that he depends greatly upon what thee can do. He thinks\nwomen won't hold out long,\u201d added Ruth with the smile that Philip never\nexactly understood.\n\n\u201cAnd aren't you tired sometimes of the struggle?\u201d\n\n\u201cTired? Yes, everybody is tired I suppose. But it is a glorious\nprofession. And would you want me to be dependent, Philip?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes, a little,\u201d said Philip, feeling his way towards what he\nwanted to say.\n\n\u201cOn what, for instance, just now?\u201d asked Ruth, a little maliciously\nPhilip thought.\n\n\u201cWhy, on--\u201d he couldn't quite say it, for it occurred to him that he\nwas a poor stick for any body to lean on in the present state of his\nfortune, and that the woman before him was at least as independent as he\nwas.\n\n\u201cI don't mean depend,\u201d he began again. \u201cBut I love you, that's all. Am\nI nothing--to you?\u201d And Philip looked a little defiant, and as if he\nhad said something that ought to brush away all the sophistries of\nobligation on either side, between man and woman.\n\nPerhaps Ruth saw this. Perhaps she saw that her own theories of a\ncertain equality of power, which ought to precede a union of two hearts,\nmight be pushed too far. Perhaps she had felt sometimes her own weakness\nand the need after all of so dear a sympathy and so tender an interest\nconfessed, as that which Philip could give. Whatever moved her--the\nriddle is as old as creation--she simply looked up to Philip and said in\na low voice, \u201cEverything.\u201d\n\nAnd Philip clasping both her hands in his, and looking down into her\neyes, which drank in all his tenderness with the thirst of a true\nwoman's nature--\n\n\u201cOh! Philip, come out here,\u201d shouted young Eli, throwing the door wide\nopen.\n\nAnd Ruth escaped away to her room, her heart singing again, and now as\nif it would burst for joy, \u201cPhilip has come.\u201d\n\nThat night Philip received a dispatch from Harry--\u201cThe trial begins\ntomorrow.\u201d\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nDecember 18--, found Washington Hawkins and Col. Sellers once more at\nthe capitol of the nation, standing guard over the University bill.\nThe former gentleman was despondent, the latter hopeful. Washington's\ndistress of mind was chiefly on Laura's account. The court would soon\nsit to try her case, he said, and consequently a great deal of ready\nmoney would be needed in the engineering of it. The University bill was\nsure to pass this time, and that would make money plenty, but might not\nthe help come too late? Congress had only just assembled, and delays\nwere to be feared.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the Colonel, \u201cI don't know but you are more or less right,\nthere. Now let's figure up a little on, the preliminaries. I think\nCongress always tries to do as near right as it can, according to its\nlights. A man can't ask any fairer than that. The first preliminary it\nalways starts out on, is to clean itself, so to speak. It will arraign\ntwo or three dozen of its members, or maybe four or five dozen, for\ntaking bribes to vote for this and that and the other bill last winter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt goes up into the dozens, does it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes; in a free country likes ours, where any man can run for\nCongress and anybody can vote for him, you can't expect immortal purity\nall the time--it ain't in nature. Sixty or eighty or a hundred and fifty\npeople are bound to get in who are not angels in disguise, as young\nHicks the correspondent says; but still it is a very good average; very\ngood indeed. As long as it averages as well as that, I think we can feel\nvery well satisfied. Even in these days, when people growl so much and\nthe newspapers are so out of patience, there is still a very respectable\nminority of honest men in Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy a respectable minority of honest men can't do any good, Colonel.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes it can, too\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, how?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, in many ways, many ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what are the ways?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell--I don't know--it is a question that requires time; a body\ncan't answer every question right off-hand. But it does do good. I am\nsatisfied of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, then; grant that it does good; go on with the\npreliminaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what I am coming to. First, as I said, they will try a lot of\nmembers for taking money for votes. That will take four weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that's like last year; and it is a sheer waste of the time for\nwhich the nation pays those men to work--that is what that is. And it\npinches when a body's got a bill waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cA waste of time, to purify the fountain of public law? Well, I never\nheard anybody express an idea like that before. But if it were, it would\nstill be the fault of the minority, for the majority don't\ninstitute these proceedings. There is where that minority becomes an\nobstruction--but still one can't say it is on the wrong side.--Well,\nafter they have finished the bribery cases, they will take up cases of\nmembers who have bought their seats with money. That will take another\nfour weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good; go on. You have accounted for two-thirds of the session.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext they will try each other for various smaller irregularities, like\nthe sale of appointments to West Point cadetships, and that sort of\nthing--mere trifling pocket-money enterprises that might better be\npassed over in silence, perhaps, but then one of our Congresses\ncan never rest easy till it has thoroughly purified itself of all\nblemishes--and that is a thing to be applauded.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long does it take to disinfect itself of these minor impurities?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, about two weeks, generally.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Congress always lies helpless in quarantine ten weeks of a session.\nThat's encouraging. Colonel, poor Laura will never get any benefit\nfrom our bill. Her trial will be over before Congress has half purified\nitself.--And doesn't it occur to you that by the time it has expelled\nall its impure members there may not be enough members left to do\nbusiness legally?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy I did not say Congress would expel anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell won't it expel anybody?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot necessarily. Did it last year? It never does. That would not be\nregular.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why waste all the session in that tomfoolery of trying members?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is usual; it is customary; the country requires it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen the country is a fool, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no. The country thinks somebody is going to be expelled.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, when nobody is expelled, what does the country think then?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy that time, the thing has strung out so long that the country is sick\nand tired of it and glad to have a change on any terms. But all that\ninquiry is not lost. It has a good moral effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho does it have a good moral effect on?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell--I don't know. On foreign countries, I think. We have always been\nunder the gaze of foreign countries. There is no country in the world,\nsir, that pursues corruption as inveterately as we do. There is no\ncountry in the world whose representatives try each other as much as\nours do, or stick to it as long on a stretch. I think there is something\ngreat in being a model for the whole civilized world, Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don't mean a model; you mean an example.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it's all the same; it's just the same thing. It shows that a man\ncan't be corrupt in this country without sweating for it, I can tell you\nthat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHang it, Colonel, you just said we never punish anybody for villainous\npractices.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut good God we try them, don't we! Is it nothing to show a disposition\nto sift things and bring people to a strict account? I tell you it has\nits effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, bother the effect!--What is it they do do? How do they proceed?\nYou know perfectly well--and it is all bosh, too. Come, now, how do they\nproceed?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy they proceed right and regular--and it ain't bosh, Washington, it\nain't bosh. They appoint a committee to investigate, and that committee\nhears evidence three weeks, and all the witnesses on one side swear\nthat the accused took money or stock or something for his vote. Then\nthe accused stands up and testifies that he may have done it, but he was\nreceiving and handling a good deal of money at the time and he doesn't\nremember this particular circumstance--at least with sufficient\ndistinctness to enable him to grasp it tangibly. So of course the thing\nis not proven--and that is what they say in the verdict. They don't\nacquit, they don't condemn. They just say, 'Charge not proven.' It\nleaves the accused in a kind of a shaky condition before the country, it\npurifies Congress, it satisfies everybody, and it doesn't seriously hurt\nanybody. It has taken a long time to perfect our system, but it is the\nmost admirable in the world, now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo one of those long stupid investigations always turns out in that\nlame silly way. Yes, you are correct. I thought maybe you viewed the\nmatter differently from other people. Do you think a Congress of ours\ncould convict the devil of anything if he were a member?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear boy, don't let these damaging delays prejudice you against\nCongress. Don't use such strong language; you talk like a newspaper.\nCongress has inflicted frightful punishments on its members--now you\nknow that. When they tried Mr. Fairoaks, and a cloud of witnesses\nproved him to be--well, you know what they proved him to be--and his own\ntestimony and his own confessions gave him the same character, what did\nCongress do then?--come!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what did Congress do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what Congress did, Washington. Congress intimated plainly\nenough, that they considered him almost a stain upon their body; and\nwithout waiting ten days, hardly, to think the thing over, they rose up\nand hurled at him a resolution declaring that they disapproved of his\nconduct! Now you know that, Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a terrific thing--there is no denying that. If he had been\nproven guilty of theft, arson, licentiousness, infanticide, and defiling\ngraves, I believe they would have suspended him for two days.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can depend on it, Washington. Congress is vindictive, Congress is\nsavage, sir, when it gets waked up once. It will go to any length to\nvindicate its honor at such a time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh well, we have talked the morning through, just as usual in these\ntiresome days of waiting, and we have reached the same old result; that\nis to say, we are no better off than when we began. The land bill is\njust as far away as ever, and the trial is closer at hand. Let's give up\neverything and die.\u201d\n\n\u201cDie and leave the Duchess to fight it out all alone? Oh, no, that won't\ndo. Come, now, don't talk so. It is all going to come out right. Now\nyou'll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt never will, Colonel, never in the world. Something tells me that. I\nget more tired and more despondent every day. I don't see any hope; life\nis only just a trouble. I am so miserable, these days!\u201d\n\nThe Colonel made Washington get up and walk the floor with him, arm in\narm. The good old speculator wanted to comfort him, but he hardly knew\nhow to go about it. He made many attempts, but they were lame; they\nlacked spirit; the words were encouraging; but they were only words--he\ncould not get any heart into them. He could not always warm up, now,\nwith the old Hawkeye fervor. By and by his lips trembled and his voice\ngot unsteady. He said:\n\n\u201cDon't give up the ship, my boy--don't do it. The wind's bound to fetch\naround and set in our favor. I know it.\u201d\n\nAnd the prospect was so cheerful that he wept. Then he blew a\ntrumpet-blast that started the meshes of his handkerchief, and said in\nalmost his breezy old-time way:\n\n\u201cLord bless us, this is all nonsense! Night doesn't last always; day has\ngot to break some time or other. Every silver lining has a cloud behind\nit, as the poet says; and that remark has always cheered me; though--I\nnever could see any meaning to it. Everybody uses it, though, and\neverybody gets comfort out of it. I wish they would start something\nfresh. Come, now, let's cheer up; there's been as good fish in the sea\nas there are now. It shall never be said that Beriah Sellers-- Come in?\u201d\n\nIt was the telegraph boy. The Colonel reached for the message and\ndevoured its contents:\n\n\u201cI said it! Never give up the ship! The trial's postponed till February,\nand we'll save the child yet. Bless my life, what lawyers they have in\nNew-York! Give them money to fight with and the ghost of an excuse, and\nthey: would manage to postpone anything in this world, unless it might\nbe the millennium or something like that. Now for work again my boy. The\ntrial will last to the middle of March, sure; Congress ends the fourth\nof March. Within three days of the end of the session they will be done\nputting through the preliminaries then they will be ready for national\nbusiness. Our bill will go through in forty-eight hours, then, and we'll\ntelegraph a million dollars to the jury--to the lawyers, I mean--and\nthe verdict of the jury will be 'Accidental murder resulting from\njustifiable insanity'--or something to, that effect, something to that\neffect.--Everything is dead sure, now. Come, what is the matter? What\nare you wilting down like that, for? You mustn't be a girl, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Colonel, I am become so used to troubles, so used to failures,\ndisappointments, hard luck of all kinds, that a little good news breaks\nme right down. Everything has been so hopeless that now I can't stand\ngood news at all. It is too good to be true, anyway. Don't you see how\nour bad luck has worked on me? My hair is getting gray, and many nights\nI don't sleep at all. I wish it was all over and we could rest. I wish\nwe could lie down and just forget everything, and let it all be just a\ndream that is done and can't come back to trouble us any more. I am so\ntired.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, poor child, don't talk like that-cheer up--there's daylight ahead.\nDon't give up. You'll have Laura again, and--Louise, and your mother,\nand oceans and oceans of money--and then you can go away, ever so far\naway somewhere, if you want to, and forget all about this infernal\nplace. And by George I'll go with you! I'll go with you--now there's my\nword on it. Cheer up. I'll run out and tell the friends the news.\u201d\n\nAnd he wrung Washington's hand and was about to hurry away when his\ncompanion, in a burst of grateful admiration said:\n\n\u201cI think you are the best soul and the noblest I ever knew, Colonel\nSellers! and if the people only knew you as I do, you would not be\ntagging around here a nameless man--you would be in Congress.\u201d\n\nThe gladness died out of the Colonel's face, and he laid his hand upon\nWashington's shoulder and said gravely:\n\n\u201cI have always been a friend of your family, Washington, and I think I\nhave always tried to do right as between man and man, according to my\nlights. Now I don't think there has ever been anything in my conduct\nthat should make you feel justified in saying a thing like that.\u201d\n\nHe turned, then, and walked slowly out, leaving Washington abashed and\nsomewhat bewildered. When Washington had presently got his thoughts\ninto line again, he said to himself, \u201cWhy, honestly, I only meant to\ncompliment him--indeed I would not have hurt him for the world.\u201d\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\nThe weeks drifted by monotonously enough, now. The \u201cpreliminaries\u201d\n continued to drag along in Congress, and life was a dull suspense to\nSellers and Washington, a weary waiting which might have broken their\nhearts, maybe, but for the relieving change which they got out of an\noccasional visit to New York to see Laura. Standing guard in Washington\nor anywhere else is not an exciting business in time of peace, but\nstanding guard was all that the two friends had to do; all that was\nneeded of them was that they should be on hand and ready for any\nemergency that might come up. There was no work to do; that was all\nfinished; this was but the second session of the last winter's Congress,\nand its action on the bill could have but one result--its passage. The\nhouse must do its work over again, of course, but the same membership\nwas there to see that it did it.--The Senate was secure--Senator\nDilworthy was able to put all doubts to rest on that head. Indeed it was\nno secret in Washington that a two-thirds vote in the Senate was ready\nand waiting to be cast for the University bill as soon as it should come\nbefore that body.\n\nWashington did not take part in the gaieties of \u201cthe season,\u201d as he had\ndone the previous winter. He had lost his interest in such things; he\nwas oppressed with cares, now. Senator Dilworthy said to Washington that\nan humble deportment, under punishment, was best, and that there was but\none way in which the troubled heart might find perfect repose and peace.\nThe suggestion found a response in Washington's breast, and the Senator\nsaw the sign of it in his face.\n\nFrom that moment one could find the youth with the Senator even oftener\nthan with Col. Sellers. When the statesman presided at great temperance\nmeetings, he placed Washington in the front rank of impressive\ndignitaries that gave tone to the occasion and pomp to the platform. His\nbald headed surroundings made the youth the more conspicuous.\n\nWhen the statesman made remarks in these meetings, he not infrequently\nalluded with effect to the encouraging spectacle of one of the\nwealthiest and most brilliant young favorites of society forsaking\nthe light vanities of that butterfly existence to nobly and\nself-sacrificingly devote his talents and his riches to the cause of\nsaving his hapless fellow creatures from shame and misery here and\neternal regret hereafter.\n\nAt the prayer meetings the Senator always brought Washington up the\naisle on his arm and seated him prominently; in his prayers he\nreferred to him in the cant terms which the Senator employed, perhaps\nunconsciously, and mistook, maybe, for religion, and in other ways\nbrought him into notice. He had him out at gatherings for the benefit of\nthe negro, gatherings for the benefit of the Indian, gatherings for the\nbenefit of the heathen in distant lands. He had him out time and again,\nbefore Sunday Schools, as an example for emulation. Upon all these\noccasions the Senator made casual references to many benevolent\nenterprises which his ardent young friend was planning against the day\nwhen the passage of the University bill should make his means available\nfor the amelioration of the condition of the unfortunate among his\nfellow men of all nations and all climes. Thus as the weeks rolled on\nWashington grew up into an imposing lion once more, but a lion that\nroamed the peaceful fields of religion and temperance, and revisited the\nglittering domain of fashion no more. A great moral influence was thus\nbrought to bear in favor of the bill; the weightiest of friends flocked\nto its standard; its most energetic enemies said it was useless to fight\nlonger; they had tacitly surrendered while as yet the day of battle was\nnot come.\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\nThe session was drawing toward its close. Senator Dilworthy thought he\nwould run out west and shake hands with his constituents and let them\nlook at him. The legislature whose duty it would be to re-elect him\nto the United States Senate, was already in session. Mr. Dilworthy\nconsidered his re-election certain, but he was a careful, painstaking\nman, and if, by visiting his State he could find the opportunity to\npersuade a few more legislators to vote for him, he held the journey to\nbe well worth taking. The University bill was safe, now; he could leave\nit without fear; it needed his presence and his watching no longer. But\nthere was a person in his State legislature who did need watching--a\nperson who, Senator Dilworthy said, was a narrow, grumbling,\nuncomfortable malcontent--a person who was stolidly opposed to reform,\nand progress and him,--a person who, he feared, had been bought with\nmoney to combat him, and through him the commonwealth's welfare and its\npolitics' purity.\n\n\u201cIf this person Noble,\u201d said Mr. Dilworthy, in a little speech at a\ndinner party given him by some of his admirers, \u201cmerely desired to\nsacrifice me.--I would willingly offer up my political life on the altar\nof my dear State's weal, I would be glad and grateful to do it; but when\nhe makes of me but a cloak to hide his deeper designs, when he proposes\nto strike through me at the heart of my beloved State, all the lion\nin me is roused--and I say, Here I stand, solitary and alone, but\nunflinching, unquailing, thrice armed with my sacred trust; and whoso\npasses, to do evil to this fair domain that looks to me for protection,\nmust do so over my dead body.\u201d\n\nHe further said that if this Noble were a pure man, and merely\nmisguided, he could bear it, but that he should succeed in his wicked\ndesigns through a base use of money would leave a blot upon his State\nwhich would work untold evil to the morals of the people, and that he\nwould not suffer; the public morals must not be contaminated. He would\nseek this man Noble; he would argue, he would persuade, he would appeal\nto his honor.\n\nWhen he arrived on the ground he found his friends unterrified; they\nwere standing firmly by him and were full of courage. Noble was\nworking hard, too, but matters were against him, he was not making much\nprogress. Mr. Dilworthy took an early opportunity to send for Mr. Noble;\nhe had a midnight interview with him, and urged him to forsake his evil\nways; he begged him to come again and again, which he did. He finally\nsent the man away at 3 o'clock one morning; and when he was gone, Mr.\nDilworthy said to himself,\n\n\u201cI feel a good deal relieved, now, a great deal relieved.\u201d\n\nThe Senator now turned his attention to matters touching the souls of\nhis people. He appeared in church; he took a leading part in prayer\nmeetings; he met and encouraged the temperance societies; he graced the\nsewing circles of the ladies with his presence, and even took a needle\nnow and then and made a stitch or two upon a calico shirt for some poor\nBibleless pagan of the South Seas, and this act enchanted the ladies,\nwho regarded the garments thus honored as in a manner sanctified. The\nSenator wrought in Bible classes, and nothing could keep him away from\nthe Sunday Schools--neither sickness nor storms nor weariness. He even\ntraveled a tedious thirty miles in a poor little rickety stagecoach to\ncomply with the desire of the miserable hamlet of Cattleville that he\nwould let its Sunday School look upon him.\n\nAll the town was assembled at the stage office when he arrived, two\nbonfires were burning, and a battery of anvils was popping exultant\nbroadsides; for a United States Senator was a sort of god in the\nunderstanding of these people who never had seen any creature mightier\nthan a county judge. To them a United States Senator was a vast, vague\ncolossus, an awe inspiring unreality.\n\nNext day everybody was at the village church a full half hour before\ntime for Sunday School to open; ranchmen and farmers had come with their\nfamilies from five miles around, all eager to get a glimpse of the\ngreat man--the man who had been to Washington; the man who had seen the\nPresident of the United States, and had even talked with him; the man\nwho had seen the actual Washington Monument--perhaps touched it with his\nhands.\n\nWhen the Senator arrived the Church was crowded, the windows were full,\nthe aisles were packed, so was the vestibule, and so indeed was the yard\nin front of the building. As he worked his way through to the pulpit\non the arm of the minister and followed by the envied officials of\nthe village, every neck was stretched and, every eye twisted around\nintervening obstructions to get a glimpse. Elderly people directed each\nother's attention and, said, \u201cThere! that's him, with the grand, noble\nforehead!\u201d Boys nudged each other and said, \u201cHi, Johnny, here he is,\nthere, that's him, with the peeled head!\u201d\n\nThe Senator took his seat in the pulpit, with the minister on one side\nof him and the Superintendent of the Sunday School on the other. The\ntown dignitaries sat in an impressive row within the altar railings\nbelow. The Sunday School children occupied ten of the front benches\ndressed in their best and most uncomfortable clothes, and with hair\ncombed and faces too clean to feel natural. So awed were they by the\npresence of a living United States Senator, that during three minutes\nnot a \u201cspit ball\u201d was thrown. After that they began to come to\nthemselves by degrees, and presently the spell was wholly gone and they\nwere reciting verses and pulling hair.\n\nThe usual Sunday School exercises were hurried through, and then\nthe minister, got up and bored the house with a speech built on the\ncustomary Sunday School plan; then the Superintendent put in his oar;\nthen the town dignitaries had their say. They all made complimentary\nreference to \u201ctheir friend the Senator,\u201d and told what a great and\nillustrious man he was and what he had done for his country and for\nreligion and temperance, and exhorted the little boys to be good and\ndiligent and try to become like him some day. The speakers won the\ndeathless hatred of the house by these delays, but at last there was an\nend and hope revived; inspiration was about to find utterance.\n\nSenator Dilworthy rose and beamed upon the assemblage for a full minute\nin silence. Then he smiled with an access of sweetness upon the children\nand began:\n\n\u201cMy little friends--for I hope that all these bright-faced little people\nare my friends and will let me be their friend--my little friends,\nI have traveled much, I have been in many cities and many States,\neverywhere in our great and noble country, and by the blessing of\nProvidence I have been permitted to see many gatherings like this--but I\nam proud, I am truly proud to say that I never have looked upon so much\nintelligence, so much grace, such sweetness of disposition as I see in\nthe charming young countenances I see before me at this moment. I have\nbeen asking myself as I sat here, Where am I? Am I in some far-off\nmonarchy, looking upon little princes and princesses? No. Am I in some\npopulous centre of my own country, where the choicest children of the\nland have been selected and brought together as at a fair for a prize?\nNo. Am I in some strange foreign clime where the children are marvels\nthat we know not of? No. Then where am I? Yes--where am I? I am in a\nsimple, remote, unpretending settlement of my own dear State, and these\nare the children of the noble and virtuous men who have made me what I\nam! My soul is lost in wonder at the thought! And I humbly thank Him to\nwhom we are but as worms of the dust, that he has been pleased to call\nme to serve such men! Earth has no higher, no grander position for me.\nLet kings and emperors keep their tinsel crowns, I want them not; my\nheart is here!\n\n\u201cAgain I thought, Is this a theatre? No. Is it a concert or a gilded\nopera? No. Is it some other vain, brilliant, beautiful temple of\nsoul-staining amusement and hilarity? No. Then what is it? What did\nmy consciousness reply? I ask you, my little friends, What did my\nconsciousness reply? It replied, It is the temple of the Lord! Ah, think\nof that, now. I could hardly keep the tears back, I was so grateful. Oh,\nhow beautiful it is to see these ranks of sunny little faces assembled\nhere to learn the way of life; to learn to be good; to learn to be\nuseful; to learn to be pious; to learn to be great and glorious men and\nwomen; to learn to be props and pillars of the State and shining lights\nin the councils and the households of the nation; to be bearers of the\nbanner and soldiers of the cross in the rude campaigns of life, and\nraptured souls in the happy fields of Paradise hereafter.\n\n\u201cChildren, honor your parents and be grateful to them for providing for\nyou the precious privileges of a Sunday School.\n\n\u201cNow my dear little friends, sit up straight and pretty--there, that's\nit--and give me your attention and let me tell you about a poor little\nSunday School scholar I once knew.--He lived in the far west, and his\nparents were poor. They could not give him a costly education; but they\nwere good and wise and they sent him to the Sunday School. He loved the\nSunday School. I hope you love your Sunday School--ah, I see by your\nfaces that you do! That is right!\n\n\u201cWell, this poor little boy was always in his place when the bell rang,\nand he always knew his lesson; for his teachers wanted him to learn and\nhe loved his teachers dearly. Always love your teachers, my children,\nfor they love you more than you can know, now. He would not let bad boys\npersuade him to go to play on Sunday. There was one little bad boy who\nwas always trying to persuade him, but he never could.\n\n\u201cSo this poor little boy grew up to be a man, and had to go out in the\nworld, far from home and friends to earn his living. Temptations lay all\nabout him, and sometimes he was about to yield, but he would think of\nsome precious lesson he learned in his Sunday School a long time\nago, and that would save him. By and by he was elected to the\nlegislature--Then he did everything he could for Sunday Schools. He\ngot laws passed for them; he got Sunday Schools established wherever he\ncould.\n\n\u201cAnd by and by the people made him governor--and he said it was all\nowing to the Sunday School.\n\n\u201cAfter a while the people elected him a Representative to the Congress\nof the United States, and he grew very famous.--Now temptations assailed\nhim on every hand. People tried to get him to drink wine; to dance, to\ngo to theatres; they even tried to buy his vote; but no, the memory of\nhis Sunday School saved him from all harm; he remembered the fate of\nthe bad little boy who used to try to get him to play on Sunday, and who\ngrew up and became a drunkard and was hanged. He remembered that, and\nwas glad he never yielded and played on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWell, at last, what do you think happened? Why the people gave him a\ntowering, illustrious position, a grand, imposing position. And what do\nyou think it was? What should you say it was, children? It was Senator\nof the United States! That poor little boy that loved his Sunday School\nbecame that man. That man stands before you! All that he is, he owes to\nthe Sunday School.\n\n\u201cMy precious children, love your parents, love your teachers, love your\nSunday School, be pious, be obedient, be honest, be diligent, and then\nyou will succeed in life and be honored of all men. Above all things, my\nchildren, be honest. Above all things be pure-minded as the snow. Let us\njoin in prayer.\u201d\n\nWhen Senator Dilworthy departed from Cattleville, he left three dozen\nboys behind him arranging a campaign of life whose objective point was\nthe United States Senate.\n\nWhen he arrived at the State capital at midnight Mr. Noble came and held\na three-hours' conference with him, and then as he was about leaving\nsaid:\n\n\u201cI've worked hard, and I've got them at last. Six of them haven't got\nquite back-bone enough to slew around and come right out for you on the\nfirst ballot to-morrow; but they're going to vote against you on the\nfirst for the sake of appearances, and then come out for you all in a\nbody on the second--I've fixed all that! By supper time to-morrow you'll\nbe re-elected. You can go to bed and sleep easy on that.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Noble was gone, the Senator said:\n\n\u201cWell, to bring about a complexion of things like this was worth coming\nWest for.\u201d\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\nThe case of the State of New York against Laura Hawkins was finally set\ndown for trial on the 15th day of February, less than a year after the\nshooting of George Selby.\n\nIf the public had almost forgotten the existence of Laura and her crime,\nthey were reminded of all the details of the murder by the newspapers,\nwhich for some days had been announcing the approaching trial. But they\nhad not forgotten. The sex, the age, the beauty of the prisoner; her\nhigh social position in Washington, the unparalled calmness with which\nthe crime was committed had all conspired to fix the event in the public\nmind, although nearly three hundred and sixty-five subsequent murders\nhad occurred to vary the monotony of metropolitan life.\n\nNo, the public read from time to time of the lovely prisoner,\nlanguishing in the city prison, the tortured victim of the law's delay;\nand as the months went by it was natural that the horror of her crime\nshould become a little indistinct in memory, while the heroine of it\nshould be invested with a sort of sentimental interest. Perhaps her\ncounsel had calculated on this. Perhaps it was by their advice that\nLaura had interested herself in the unfortunate criminals who shared her\nprison confinement, and had done not a little to relieve, from her own\npurse, the necessities of some of the poor creatures. That she had\ndone this, the public read in the journals of the day, and the simple\nannouncement cast a softening light upon her character.\n\nThe court room was crowded at an early hour, before the arrival of\njudges, lawyers and prisoner. There is no enjoyment so keen to certain\nminds as that of looking upon the slow torture of a human being on\ntrial for life, except it be an execution; there is no display of human\ningenuity, wit and power so fascinating as that made by trained lawyers\nin the trial of an important case, nowhere else is exhibited such\nsubtlety, acumen, address, eloquence.\n\nAll the conditions of intense excitement meet in a murder trial. The\nawful issue at stake gives significance to the lightest word or look.\nHow the quick eyes of the spectators rove from the stolid jury to the\nkeen lawyers, the impassive judge, the anxious prisoner. Nothing is\nlost of the sharp wrangle of the counsel on points of law, the measured\ndecision's of the bench; the duels between the attorneys and the\nwitnesses. The crowd sways with the rise and fall of the shifting\ntestimony, in sympathetic interest, and hangs upon the dicta of the\njudge in breathless silence. It speedily takes sides for or against\nthe accused, and recognizes as quickly its favorites among the lawyers.\nNothing delights it more than the sharp retort of a witness and the\ndiscomfiture of an obnoxious attorney. A joke, even if it be a lame\none, is no where so keenly relished or quickly applauded as in a murder\ntrial.\n\nWithin the bar the young lawyers and the privileged hangers-on filled\nall the chairs except those reserved at the table for those engaged in\nthe case. Without, the throng occupied all the seats, the window ledges\nand the standing room. The atmosphere was already something horrible. It\nwas the peculiar odor of a criminal court, as if it were tainted by the\npresence, in different persons, of all the crimes that men and women can\ncommit.\n\nThere was a little stir when the Prosecuting Attorney, with two\nassistants, made his way in, seated himself at the table, and spread his\npapers before him. There was more stir when the counsel of the defense\nappeared. They were Mr. Braham, the senior, and Mr. Quiggle and Mr.\nO'Keefe, the juniors.\n\nEverybody in the court room knew Mr. Braham, the great criminal lawyer,\nand he was not unaware that he was the object of all eyes as he moved\nto his place, bowing to his friends in the bar. A large but rather spare\nman, with broad shoulders and a massive head, covered with chestnut\ncurls which fell down upon his coat collar and which he had a habit\nof shaking as a lion is supposed to shake his mane. His face was clean\nshaven, and he had a wide mouth and rather small dark eyes, set quite\ntoo near together. Mr. Braham wore a brown frock coat buttoned\nacross his breast, with a rose-bud in the upper buttonhole, and light\npantaloons. A diamond stud was seen to flash from his bosom; and as he\nseated himself and drew off his gloves a heavy seal ring was displayed\nupon his white left hand. Mr. Braham having seated himself, deliberately\nsurveyed the entire house, made a remark to one of his assistants, and\nthen taking an ivory-handled knife from his pocket began to pare his\nfinger nails, rocking his chair backwards and forwards slowly.\n\nA moment later Judge O'Shaunnessy entered at the rear door and took\nhis seat in one of the chairs behind the bench; a gentleman in black\nbroadcloth, with sandy hair, inclined to curl, a round, reddish\nand rather jovial face, sharp rather than intellectual, and with a\nself-sufficient air. His career had nothing remarkable in it. He was\ndescended from a long line of Irish Kings, and he was the first one of\nthem who had ever come into his kingdom--the kingdom of such being the\ncity of New York. He had, in fact, descended so far and so low that he\nfound himself, when a boy, a sort of street Arab in that city; but\nhe had ambition and native shrewdness, and he speedily took to\nboot-polishing, and newspaper hawking, became the office and errand\nboy of a law firm, picked up knowledge enough to get some employment\nin police courts, was admitted to the bar, became a rising young\npolitician, went to the legislature, and was finally elected to the\nbench which he now honored. In this democratic country he was obliged\nto conceal his royalty under a plebeian aspect. Judge O'Shaunnessy never\nhad a lucrative practice nor a large salary but he had prudently laid\naway money--believing that a dependant judge can never be impartial--and\nhe had lands and houses to the value of three or four hundred thousand\ndollars. Had he not helped to build and furnish this very Court House?\nDid he not know that the very \u201cspittoon\u201d which his judgeship used cost\nthe city the sum of one thousand dollars?\n\nAs soon as the judge was seated, the court was opened with the \u201coi yis,\noi yis\u201d of the officer in his native language, the case called, and\nthe sheriff was directed to bring in the prisoner. In the midst of a\nprofound hush Laura entered, leaning on the arm of the officer, and was\nconducted to a seat by her counsel. She was followed by her mother and\nby Washington Hawkins, who were given seats near her.\n\nLaura was very pale, but this pallor heightened the lustre of her large\neyes and gave a touching sadness to her expressive face. She was dressed\nin simple black, with exquisite taste, and without an ornament. The thin\nlace vail which partially covered her face did not so much conceal as\nheighten her beauty. She would not have entered a drawing room with more\nself-poise, nor a church with more haughty humility. There was in her\nmanner or face neither shame nor boldness, and when she took her seat\nin full view of half the spectators, her eyes were downcast. A murmur\nof admiration ran through the room. The newspaper reporters made their\npencils fly. Mr. Braham again swept his eyes over the house as if in\napproval. When Laura at length raised her eyes a little, she saw Philip\nand Harry within the bar, but she gave no token of recognition.\n\nThe clerk then read the indictment, which was in the usual form. It\ncharged Laura Hawkins, in effect, with the premeditated murder of George\nSelby, by shooting him with a pistol, with a revolver, shotgun, rifle,\nrepeater, breech-loader, cannon, six-shooter, with a gun, or some other\nweapon; with killing him with a slung-shot, a bludgeon, carving knife,\nbowie knife, pen knife, rolling pin, car, hook, dagger, hair pin, with a\nhammer, with a screw-driver, with a nail, and with all other weapons and\nutensils whatsoever, at the Southern hotel and in all other hotels and\nplaces wheresoever, on the thirteenth day of March and all other days of\nthe Christian era wheresoever.\n\nLaura stood while the long indictment was read; and at the end, in\nresponse to the inquiry, of the judge, she said in a clear, low voice;\n\u201cNot guilty.\u201d She sat down and the court proceeded to impanel a jury.\n\nThe first man called was Michael Lanigan, saloon keeper.\n\n\u201cHave you formed or expressed any opinion on this case, and do you know\nany of the parties?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot any,\u201d said Mr. Lanigan.\n\n\u201cHave you any conscientious objections to capital punishment?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir, not to my knowledge.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you read anything about this case?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be sure, I read the papers, y'r Honor.\u201d\n\nObjected to by Mr. Braham, for cause, and discharged.\n\nPatrick Coughlin.\n\n\u201cWhat is your business?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell--I haven't got any particular business.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaven't any particular business, eh? Well, what's your general\nbusiness? What do you do for a living?\u201d\n\n\u201cI own some terriers, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cOwn some terriers, eh? Keep a rat pit?\u201d\n\n\u201cGentlemen comes there to have a little sport. I never fit 'em, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I see--you are probably the amusement committee of the city\ncouncil. Have you ever heard of this case?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot till this morning, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you read?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot fine print, y'r Honor.\u201d\n\nThe man was about to be sworn, when Mr. Braham asked,\n\n\u201cCould your father read?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe old gentleman was mighty handy at that, sir.\u201d\n\nMr. Braham submitted that the man was disqualified. Judge thought not.\nPoint argued. Challenged peremptorily, and set aside.\n\nEthan Dobb, cart-driver.\n\n\u201cCan you read?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but haven't a habit of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you heard of this case?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so--but it might be another. I have no opinion about it.\u201d\n\nDist. A. \u201cTha--tha--there! Hold on a bit? Did anybody tell you to say\nyou had no opinion about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cN--n--o, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake care now, take care. Then what suggested it to you to volunteer\nthat remark?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey've always asked that, when I was on juries.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, then. Have you any conscientious scruples about capital\npunishment?\u201d\n\n\u201cAny which?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you object to finding a person guilty--of murder on evidence?\u201d\n\n\u201cI might, sir, if I thought he wan't guilty.\u201d\n\nThe district attorney thought he saw a point.\n\n\u201cWould this feeling rather incline you against a capital conviction?\u201d\n\nThe juror said he hadn't any feeling, and didn't know any of the\nparties. Accepted and sworn.\n\nDennis Lafin, laborer. Have neither formed nor expressed an opinion.\nNever had heard of the case. Believed in hangin' for them that deserved\nit. Could read if it was necessary.\n\nMr. Braham objected. The man was evidently bloody minded. Challenged\nperemptorily.\n\nLarry O'Toole, contractor. A showily dressed man of the style known\nas \u201cvulgar genteel,\u201d had a sharp eye and a ready tongue. Had read the\nnewspaper reports of the case, but they made no impression on him.\nShould be governed by the evidence. Knew no reason why he could not be\nan impartial juror.\n\nQuestion by District Attorney.\n\n\u201cHow is it that the reports made no impression on you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever believe anything I see in the newspapers.\u201d\n\n(Laughter from the crowd, approving smiles from his Honor and Mr.\nBraham.) Juror sworn in. Mr. Braham whispered to O'Keefe, \u201cthat's the\nman.\u201d\n\nAvery Hicks, pea-nut peddler. Did he ever hear of this case? The man\nshook his head.\n\n\u201cCan you read?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d \u201cAny scruples about capital punishment?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nHe was about to be sworn, when the district attorney turning to him\ncarelessly, remarked,\n\n\u201cUnderstand the nature of an oath?\u201d\n\n\u201cOutside,\u201d said the man, pointing to the door.\n\n\u201cI say, do you know what an oath is?\u201d\n\n\u201cFive cents,\u201d explained the man.\n\n\u201cDo you mean to insult me?\u201d roared the prosecuting officer. \u201cAre you an\nidiot?\u201d\n\n\u201cFresh baked. I'm deefe. I don't hear a word you say.\u201d\n\nThe man was discharged. \u201cHe wouldn't have made a bad juror, though,\u201d\n whispered Braham. \u201cI saw him looking at the prisoner sympathizingly.\nThat's a point you want to watch for.\u201d\n\nThe result of the whole day's work was the selection of only two jurors.\nThese however were satisfactory to Mr. Braham. He had kept off all those\nhe did not know. No one knew better than this great criminal lawyer\nthat the battle was fought on the selection of the jury. The subsequent\nexamination of witnesses, the eloquence expended on the jury are all\nfor effect outside. At least that is the theory of Mr. Braham. But human\nnature is a queer thing, he admits; sometimes jurors are unaccountably\nswayed, be as careful as you can in choosing them.\n\nIt was four weary days before this jury was made up, but when it was\nfinally complete, it did great credit to the counsel for the defence.\nSo far as Mr. Braham knew, only two could read, one of whom was the\nforeman, Mr. Braham's friend, the showy contractor. Low foreheads and\nheavy faces they all had; some had a look of animal cunning, while the\nmost were only stupid. The entire panel formed that boasted heritage\ncommonly described as the \u201cbulwark of our liberties.\u201d\n\nThe District Attorney, Mr. McFlinn, opened the case for the state. He\nspoke with only the slightest accent, one that had been inherited but\nnot cultivated. He contented himself with a brief statement of the case.\nThe state would prove that Laura Hawkins, the prisoner at the bar,\na fiend in the form of a beautiful woman, shot dead George Selby, a\nSouthern gentleman, at the time and place described. That the murder was\nin cold blood, deliberate and without provocation; that it had been long\npremeditated and threatened; that she had followed the deceased from\nWashington to commit it. All this would be proved by unimpeachable\nwitnesses. The attorney added that the duty of the jury, however painful\nit might be, would be plain and simple. They were citizens, husbands,\nperhaps fathers. They knew how insecure life had become in the\nmetropolis. Tomorrow our own wives might be widows, their own children\norphans, like the bereaved family in yonder hotel, deprived of husband\nand father by the jealous hand of some murderous female.

Requested by the District Attorney to tell\nthe jury all he knew about the killing, he narrated the circumstances\nsubstantially as the reader already knows them.\n\nHe accompanied Miss Hawkins to New York at her request, supposing she\nwas coming in relation to a bill then pending in Congress, to secure\nthe attendance of absent members. Her note to him was here shown. She\nappeared to be very much excited at the Washington station. After she\nhad asked the conductor several questions, he heard her say, \u201cHe can't\nescape.\u201d Witness asked her \u201cWho?\u201d and she replied \u201cNobody.\u201d Did not see\nher during the night. They traveled in a sleeping car. In the morning\nshe appeared not to have slept, said she had a headache. In crossing the\nferry she asked him about the shipping in sight; he pointed out where\nthe Cunarders lay when in port. They took a cup of coffee that morning\nat a restaurant. She said she was anxious to reach the Southern Hotel\nwhere Mr. Simons, one of the absent members, was staying, before he went\nout. She was entirely self-possessed, and beyond unusual excitement did\nnot act unnaturally. After she had fired twice at Col. Selby, she turned\nthe pistol towards her own breast, and witness snatched it from her.\nShe had been a great deal with Selby in Washington, appeared to be\ninfatuated with him.\n\n(Cross-examined by Mr. Braham.) \u201cMist-er.....er Brierly!\u201d (Mr. Braham\nhad in perfection this lawyer's trick of annoying a witness, by drawling\nout the \u201cMister,\u201d as if unable to recall the name, until the witness is\nsufficiently aggravated, and then suddenly, with a rising inflection,\nflinging his name at him with startling unexpectedness.) \u201cMist-er.....er\nBrierly! What is your occupation?\u201d\n\n\u201cCivil Engineer, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, civil engineer, (with a glance at the jury). Following that\noccupation with Miss Hawkins?\u201d (Smiles by the jury).\n\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d said Harry, reddening.\n\n\u201cHow long have you known the prisoner?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo years, sir. I made her acquaintance in Hawkeye, Missouri.\u201d\n\n\u201cM.....m...m. Mist-er.....er Brierly! Were you not a lover of Miss\nHawkins?\u201d\n\nObjected to. \u201cI submit, your Honor, that I have the right to establish\nthe relation of this unwilling witness to the prisoner.\u201d Admitted.\n\n\u201cWell, sir,\u201d said Harry hesitatingly, \u201cwe were friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou act like a friend!\u201d (sarcastically.) The jury were beginning to\nhate this neatly dressed young sprig. \u201cMister......er....Brierly! Didn't\nMiss Hawkins refuse you?\u201d\n\nHarry blushed and stammered and looked at the judge. \u201cYou must answer,\nsir,\u201d said His Honor.\n\n\u201cShe--she--didn't accept me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I should think not. Brierly do you dare tell the jury that you had\nnot an interest in the removal of your rival, Col. Selby?\u201d roared Mr.\nBraham in a voice of thunder.\n\n\u201cNothing like this, sir, nothing like this,\u201d protested the witness.\n\n\u201cThat's all, sir,\u201d said Mr. Braham severely.\n\n\u201cOne word,\u201d said the District Attorney. \u201cHad you the least suspicion of\nthe prisoner's intention, up to the moment of the shooting?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the least,\u201d answered Harry earnestly.\n\n\u201cOf course not, of course not,\u201d nodded Mr. Braham to the jury.\n\nThe prosecution then put upon the stand the other witnesses of the\nshooting at the hotel, and the clerk and the attending physicians. The\nfact of the homicide was clearly established. Nothing new was elicited,\nexcept from the clerk, in reply to a question by Mr. Braham, the fact\nthat when the prisoner enquired for Col. Selby she appeared excited and\nthere was a wild look in her eyes.\n\nThe dying deposition of Col. Selby was then produced. It set forth\nLaura's threats, but there was a significant addition to it, which the\nnewspaper report did not have. It seemed that after the deposition\nwas taken as reported, the Colonel was told for the first time by his\nphysicians that his wounds were mortal. He appeared to be in great\nmental agony and fear; and said he had not finished his deposition.\nHe added, with great difficulty and long pauses these words.\n\u201cI--have--not--told--all. I must tell--put--it--down--I--wronged--her.\nYears--ago--I--can't see--O--God--I--deserved----\u201d That was all. He\nfainted and did not revive again.\n\nThe Washington railway conductor testified that the prisoner had\nasked him if a gentleman and his family went out on the evening train,\ndescribing the persons he had since learned were Col. Selby and family.\n\nSusan Cullum, colored servant at Senator Dilworthy's, was sworn. Knew\nCol. Selby. Had seen him come to the house often, and be alone in the\nparlor with Miss Hawkins. He came the day but one before he was shot.\nShe let him in. He appeared flustered like. She heard talking in the\nparlor, 'peared like it was quarrelin'. Was afeared sumfin' was wrong:\nJust put her ear to--the--keyhole of the back parlor-door. Heard a man's\nvoice, \u201cI--can't--I can't, Good God,\u201d quite beggin' like. Heard--young\nMiss' voice, \u201cTake your choice, then. If you 'bandon me, you knows\nwhat to 'spect.\u201d Then he rushes outen the house, I goes in--and I\nsays, \u201cMissis did you ring?\u201d She was a standin' like a tiger, her eyes\nflashin'. I come right out.\n\nThis was the substance of Susan's testimony, which was not shaken in the\nleast by severe cross-examination. In reply to Mr. Braham's question, if\nthe prisoner did not look insane, Susan said, \u201cLord; no, sir, just mad\nas a hawnet.\u201d\n\nWashington Hawkins was sworn. The pistol, identified by the officer as\nthe one used in the homicide, was produced Washington admitted that it\nwas his. She had asked him for it one morning, saying she thought she\nhad heard burglars the night before. Admitted that he never had heard\nburglars in the house. Had anything unusual happened just before that?\nNothing that he remembered. Did he accompany her to a reception at Mrs.\nShoonmaker's a day or two before? Yes. What occurred? Little by little\nit was dragged out of the witness that Laura had behaved strangely\nthere, appeared to be sick, and he had taken her home. Upon being pushed\nhe admitted that she had afterwards confessed that she saw Selby there.\nAnd Washington volunteered the statement that Selby, was a black-hearted\nvillain.\n\nThe District Attorney said, with some annoyance; \u201cThere--there! That\nwill do.\u201d\n\nThe defence declined to examine Mr. Hawkins at present. The case for\nthe prosecution was closed. Of the murder there could not be the least\ndoubt, or that the prisoner followed the deceased to New York with a\nmurderous intent. On the evidence the jury must convict, and might do so\nwithout leaving their seats. This was the condition of the case two\ndays after the jury had been selected. A week had passed since the trial\nopened; and a Sunday had intervened.\n\nThe public who read the reports of the evidence saw no chance for the\nprisoner's escape. The crowd of spectators who had watched the trial\nwere moved with the most profound sympathy for Laura.\n\nMr. Braham opened the case for the defence. His manner was subdued, and\nhe spoke in so low a voice that it was only by reason of perfect silence\nin the court room that he could be heard. He spoke very distinctly,\nhowever, and if his nationality could be discovered in his speech it was\nonly in a certain richness and breadth of tone.\n\nHe began by saying that he trembled at the responsibility he had\nundertaken; and he should altogether despair, if he did not see before\nhim a jury of twelve men of rare intelligence, whose acute minds would\nunravel all the sophistries of the prosecution, men with a sense of\nhonor, which would revolt at the remorseless persecution of this hunted\nwoman by the state, men with hearts to feel for the wrongs of which\nshe was the victim. Far be it from him to cast any suspicion upon the\nmotives of the able, eloquent and ingenious lawyers of the state;\nthey act officially; their business is to convict. It is our business,\ngentlemen, to see that justice is done.\n\n\u201cIt is my duty, gentlemen, to unfold to you one of the most affecting\ndramas in all the history of misfortune. I shall have to show you\na life, the sport of fate and circumstances, hurried along through\nshifting storm and sun, bright with trusting innocence and anon black\nwith heartless villainy, a career which moves on in love and desertion\nand anguish, always hovered over by the dark spectre of INSANITY--an\ninsanity hereditary and induced by mental torture,--until it ends, if\nend it must in your verdict, by one of those fearful accidents, which\nare inscrutable to men and of which God alone knows the secret.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, I shall ask you to go with me away from this court room\nand its minions of the law, away from the scene of this tragedy, to a\ndistant, I wish I could say a happier day. The story I have to tell is\nof a lovely little girl, with sunny hair and laughing eyes, traveling\nwith her parents, evidently people of wealth and refinement, upon a\nMississippi steamboat. There is an explosion, one of those terrible\ncatastrophes which leave the imprint of an unsettled mind upon the\nsurvivors. Hundreds of mangled remains are sent into eternity. When the\nwreck is cleared away this sweet little girl is found among the panic\nstricken survivors in the midst of a scene of horror enough to turn the\nsteadiest brain. Her parents have disappeared. Search even for their\nbodies is in vain. The bewildered, stricken child--who can say what\nchanges the fearful event wrought in her tender brain--clings to the\nfirst person who shows her sympathy. It is Mrs. Hawkins, this good\nlady who is still her loving friend. Laura is adopted into the Hawkins\nfamily. Perhaps she forgets in time that she is not their child. She is\nan orphan. No, gentlemen, I will not deceive you, she is not an orphan.\nWorse than that. There comes another day of agony. She knows that her\nfather lives. Who is he, where is he? Alas, I cannot tell you. Through\nthe scenes of this painful history he flits here and there a lunatic! If\nhe seeks his daughter, it is the purposeless search of a lunatic, as one\nwho wanders bereft of reason, crying where is my child? Laura seeks her\nfather. In vain just as she is about to find him, again and again-he\ndisappears, he is gone, he vanishes.\n\n\u201cBut this is only the prologue to the tragedy. Bear with me while I\nrelate it. (Mr. Braham takes out a handkerchief, unfolds it slowly;\ncrashes it in his nervous hand, and throws it on the table). Laura grew\nup in her humble southern home, a beautiful creature, the joy of the\nhouse, the pride of the neighborhood, the loveliest flower in all the\nsunny south. She might yet have been happy; she was happy. But the\ndestroyer came into this paradise. He plucked the sweetest bud that grew\nthere, and having enjoyed its odor, trampled it in the mire beneath his\nfeet. George Selby, the deceased, a handsome, accomplished Confederate\nColonel, was this human fiend. He deceived her with a mock marriage;\nafter some months he brutally abandoned her, and spurned her as if she\nwere a contemptible thing; all the time he had a wife in New Orleans.\nLaura was crushed. For weeks, as I shall show you by the testimony of\nher adopted mother and brother, she hovered over death in delirium.\nGentlemen, did she ever emerge from this delirium? I shall show you that\nwhen she recovered her health, her mind was changed, she was not what\nshe had been. You can judge yourselves whether the tottering reason ever\nrecovered its throne.\n\n\u201cYears pass. She is in Washington, apparently the happy favorite of\na brilliant society. Her family have become enormously rich by one\nof those sudden turns in fortune that the inhabitants of America are\nfamiliar with--the discovery of immense mineral wealth in some wild\nlands owned by them. She is engaged in a vast philanthropic scheme for\nthe benefit of the poor, by the use of this wealth. But, alas, even here\nand now, the same relentless fate pursued her. The villain Selby appears\nagain upon the scene, as if on purpose to complete the ruin of her life.\nHe appeared to taunt her with her dishonor, he threatened exposure if\nshe did not become again the mistress of his passion. Gentlemen, do you\nwonder if this woman, thus pursued, lost her reason, was beside herself\nwith fear, and that her wrongs preyed upon her mind until she was no\nlonger responsible for her acts? I turn away my head as one who would\nnot willingly look even upon the just vengeance of Heaven. (Mr. Braham\npaused as if overcome by his emotions. Mrs. Hawkins and Washington were\nin tears, as were many of the spectators also. The jury looked scared.)\n\n\u201cGentlemen, in this condition of affairs it needed but a spark--I do not\nsay a suggestion, I do not say a hint--from this butterfly Brierly; this\nrejected rival, to cause the explosion. I make no charges, but if this\nwoman was in her right mind when she fled from Washington and reached\nthis city in company--with Brierly, then I do not know what insanity\nis.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Braham sat down, he felt that he had the jury with him. A burst\nof applause followed, which the officer promptly, suppressed. Laura,\nwith tears in her eyes, turned a grateful look upon her counsel. All the\nwomen among the spectators saw the tears and wept also. They thought as\nthey also looked at Mr. Braham, how handsome he is!\n\nMrs. Hawkins took the stand. She was somewhat confused to be the target\nof so many, eyes, but her honest and good face at once told in Laura's\nfavor.\n\n\u201cMrs. Hawkins,\u201d said Mr. Braham, \u201cwill you' be kind enough to state the\ncircumstances of your finding Laura?\u201d\n\n\u201cI object,\u201d said Mr. McFlinn; rising to his feet. \u201cThis has nothing\nwhatever to do with the case, your honor. I am surprised at it, even\nafter the extraordinary speech of my learned friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you propose to connect it, Mr. Braham?\u201d asked the judge.\n\n\u201cIf it please the court,\u201d said Mr. Braham, rising impressively, \u201cyour\nHonor has permitted the prosecution, and I have submitted without a\nword, to go into the most extraordinary testimony to establish a motive.\nAre we to be shut out from showing that the motive attributed to us\ncould not by reason of certain mental conditions exist? I purpose, may,\nit please your Honor, to show the cause and the origin of an aberration\nof mind, to follow it up, with other like evidence, connecting it with\nthe very moment of the homicide, showing a condition of the intellect,\nof the prisoner that precludes responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe State must insist upon its objections,\u201d said the District Attorney.\n\u201cThe purpose evidently is to open the door to a mass of irrelevant\ntestimony, the object of which is to produce an effect upon the jury\nyour Honor well understands.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d suggested the judge, \u201cthe court ought to hear the testimony,\nand exclude it afterwards, if it is irrelevant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill your honor hear argument on that!\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\nAnd argument his honor did hear, or pretend to, for two whole days,\nfrom all the counsel in turn, in the course of which the lawyers read\ncontradictory decisions enough to perfectly establish both sides, from\nvolume after volume, whole libraries in fact, until no mortal man could\nsay what the rules were. The question of insanity in all its legal\naspects was of course drawn into the discussion, and its application\naffirmed and denied. The case was felt to turn upon the admission or\nrejection of this evidence. It was a sort of test trial of strength\nbetween the lawyers. At the end the judge decided to admit the\ntestimony, as the judge usually does in such cases, after a sufficient\nwaste of time in what are called arguments.\n\nMrs. Hawkins was allowed to go on.\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nMrs. Hawkins slowly and conscientiously, as if every detail of her\nfamily history was important, told the story of the steamboat explosion,\nof the finding and adoption of Laura. Silas, that is Mr. Hawkins, and\nshe always loved Laura, as if she had been their own child.\n\nShe then narrated the circumstances of Laura's supposed marriage, her\nabandonment and long illness, in a manner that touched all hearts. Laura\nhad been a different woman since then.\n\nCross-examined. At the time of first finding Laura on the steamboat, did\nshe notice that Laura's mind was at all deranged? She couldn't say that\nshe did. After the recovery of Laura from her long illness, did Mrs.\nHawkins think there were any signs of insanity about her? Witness\nconfessed that she did not think of it then.\n\nRe-Direct examination. \u201cBut she was different after that?\u201d\n\n\u201cO, yes, sir.\u201d\n\nWashington Hawkins corroborated his mother's testimony as to Laura's\nconnection with Col. Selby. He was at Harding during the time of her\nliving there with him. After Col. Selby's desertion she was almost dead,\nnever appeared to know anything rightly for weeks. He added that he\nnever saw such a scoundrel as Selby. (Checked by District attorney.) Had\nhe noticed any change in Laura after her illness? Oh, yes. Whenever, any\nallusion was made that might recall Selby to mind, she looked awful--as\nif she could kill him.\n\n\u201cYou mean,\u201d said Mr. Braham, \u201cthat there was an unnatural, insane gleam\nin her eyes?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, certainly,\u201d said Washington in confusion.\n\nAll this was objected to by the district attorney, but it was got before\nthe jury, and Mr. Braham did not care how much it was ruled out after\nthat.\n\nBeriah Sellers was the next witness called. The Colonel made his way to\nthe stand with majestic, yet bland deliberation. Having taken the oath\nand kissed the Bible with a smack intended to show his great respect\nfor that book, he bowed to his Honor with dignity, to the jury with\nfamiliarity, and then turned to the lawyers and stood in an attitude of\nsuperior attention.\n\n\u201cMr. Sellers, I believe?\u201d began Mr. Braham.\n\n\u201cBeriah Sellers, Missouri,\u201d was the courteous acknowledgment that the\nlawyer was correct.\n\n\u201cMr. Sellers; you know the parties here, you are a friend of the\nfamily?\u201d\n\n\u201cKnow them all, from infancy, sir. It was me, sir, that induced Silas\nHawkins, Judge Hawkins, to come to Missouri, and make his fortune. It\nwas by my advice and in company with me, sir, that he went into the\noperation of--\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes. Mr. Sellers, did you know a Major Lackland?\u201d\n\n\u201cKnew him, well, sir, knew him and honored him, sir. He was one of the\nmost remarkable men of our country, sir. A member of congress. He was\noften at my mansion sir, for weeks. He used to say to me, 'Col. Sellers,\nif you would go into politics, if I had you for a colleague, we should\nshow Calhoun and Webster that the brain of the country didn't lie east\nof the Alleganies. But I said--\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes. I believe Major Lackland is not living, Colonel?\u201d\n\nThere was an almost imperceptible sense of pleasure betrayed in the\nColonel's face at this prompt acknowledgment of his title.\n\n\u201cBless you, no. Died years ago, a miserable death, sir, a ruined man, a\npoor sot. He was suspected of selling his vote in Congress, and probably\nhe did; the disgrace killed him, he was an outcast, sir, loathed by\nhimself and by his constituents. And I think, sir\u201d----\n\nThe Judge. \u201cYou will confine yourself, Col. Sellers to the questions of\nthe counsel.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, your honor. This,\u201d continued the Colonel in confidential\nexplanation, \u201cwas twenty years ago. I shouldn't have thought of\nreferring to such a trifling circumstance now. If I remember rightly,\nsir\u201d--\n\nA bundle of letters was here handed to the witness.\n\n\u201cDo you recognize, that hand-writing?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs if it was my own, sir. It's Major Lackland's. I was knowing to these\nletters when Judge Hawkins received them. [The Colonel's memory was a\nlittle at fault here. Mr. Hawkins had never gone into details with him\non this subject.] He used to show them to me, and say, 'Col, Sellers\nyou've a mind to untangle this sort of thing.' Lord, how everything\ncomes back to me. Laura was a little thing then. 'The Judge and I were\njust laying our plans to buy the Pilot Knob, and--\u201d\n\n\u201cColonel, one moment. Your Honor, we put these letters in evidence.\u201d\n\nThe letters were a portion of the correspondence of Major Lackland with\nSilas Hawkins; parts of them were missing and important letters were\nreferred to that were not here. They related, as the reader knows,\nto Laura's father. Lackland had come upon the track of a man who was\nsearching for a lost child in a Mississippi steamboat explosion years\nbefore. The man was lame in one leg, and appeared to be flitting from\nplace to place. It seemed that Major Lackland got so close track of him\nthat he was able to describe his personal appearance and learn his name.\nBut the letter containing these particulars was lost. Once he heard of\nhim at a hotel in Washington; but the man departed, leaving an empty\ntrunk, the day before the major went there. There was something very\nmysterious in all his movements.\n\nCol. Sellers, continuing his testimony, said that he saw this lost\nletter, but could not now recall the name. Search for the supposed\nfather had been continued by Lackland, Hawkins and himself for several\nyears, but Laura was not informed of it till after the death of Hawkins,\nfor fear of raising false hopes in her mind.\n\nHere the District Attorney arose and said,\n\n\u201cYour Honor, I must positively object to letting the witness wander off\ninto all these irrelevant details.\u201d\n\nMr. Braham. \u201cI submit your honor, that we cannot be interrupted in this\nmanner. We have suffered the state to have full swing. Now here is a\nwitness, who has known the prisoner from infancy, and is competent\nto testify upon the one point vital to her safety. Evidently he is a\ngentleman of character, and his knowledge of the case cannot be shut out\nwithout increasing the aspect of persecution which the State's attitude\ntowards the prisoner already has assumed.\u201d\n\nThe wrangle continued, waxing hotter and hotter. The Colonel seeing the\nattention of the counsel and Court entirely withdrawn from him, thought\nhe perceived here his opportunity, turning and beaming upon the jury,\nhe began simply to talk, but as the grandeur of his position grew upon\nhim--his talk broadened unconsciously into an oratorical vein.\n\n\u201cYou see how she was situated, gentlemen; poor child, it might have\nbroken her heart to let her mind get to running on such a thing as that.\nYou see, from what we could make out her father was lame in the left leg\nand had a deep scar on his left forehead. And so ever since the day\nshe found out she had another father, she never could run across a lame\nstranger without being taken all over with a shiver, and almost fainting\nwhere she stood. And the next minute she would go right after that man.\nOnce she stumbled on a stranger with a game leg; and she was the most\ngrateful thing in this world--but it was the wrong leg, and it was days\nand days before she could leave her bed.\n\nOnce she found a man with a scar on his forehead and she was just going\nto throw herself into his arms, but he stepped out just then, and there\nwasn't anything the matter with his legs. Time and time again, gentlemen\nof the jury, has this poor suffering orphan flung herself on her knees\nwith all her heart's gratitude in her eyes before some scarred and\ncrippled veteran, but always, always to be disappointed, always to be\nplunged into new despair--if his legs were right his scar was wrong,\nif his scar was right his legs were wrong. Never could find a man that\nwould fill the bill. Gentlemen of the jury; you have hearts, you have\nfeelings, you have warm human sympathies; you can feel for this poor\nsuffering child. Gentlemen of the jury, if I had time, if I had the\nopportunity, if I might be permitted to go on and tell you the thousands\nand thousands and thousands of mutilated strangers this poor girl has\nstarted out of cover, and hunted from city to city, from state to state,\nfrom continent to continent, till she has run them down and found they\nwan't the ones; I know your hearts--\u201d\n\nBy this time the Colonel had become so warmed up, that his voice,\nhad reached a pitch above that of the contending counsel; the lawyers\nsuddenly stopped, and they and the Judge turned towards the Colonel and\nremained for several seconds too surprised at this novel exhibition to\nspeak. In this interval of silence, an appreciation of the situation\ngradually stole over the audience, and an explosion of laughter\nfollowed, in which even the Court and the bar could hardly keep from\njoining.\n\nSheriff. \u201cOrder in the Court.\u201d\n\nThe Judge. \u201cThe witness will confine his remarks to answers to\nquestions.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel turned courteously to the Judge and said,\n\n\u201cCertainly, your Honor--certainly. I am not well acquainted with the\nforms of procedure in the courts of New York, but in the West, sir, in\nthe West--\u201d\n\nThe Judge. \u201cThere, there, that will do, that will do!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see, your Honor, there were no questions asked me, and I thought\nI would take advantage of the lull in the proceedings to explain to the\njury a very significant train of--\u201d\n\nThe Judge. \u201cThat will DO sir! Proceed Mr. Braham.\u201d\n\n\u201cCol. Sellers, have you any reason to suppose that this man is still\nliving?\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery reason, sir, every reason.\n\n\u201cState why\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never heard of his death, sir. It has never come to my\nknowledge. In fact, sir, as I once said to Governor--\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you state to the jury what has been the effect of the knowledge of\nthis wandering and evidently unsettled being, supposed to be her father,\nupon the mind of Miss Hawkins for so many years!\u201d\n\nQuestion objected to. Question ruled out.\n\nCross-examined. \u201cMajor Sellers, what is your occupation?\u201d\n\nThe Colonel looked about him loftily, as if casting in his mind\nwhat would be the proper occupation of a person of such multifarious\ninterests and then said with dignity:\n\n\u201cA gentleman, sir. My father used to always say, sir\u201d--\n\n\u201cCapt. Sellers, did you ever see this man, this supposed father?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Sir. But upon one occasion, old Senator Thompson said to me, its my\nopinion, Colonel Sellers\u201d--\n\n\u201cDid you ever see any body who had seen him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir: It was reported around at one time, that\u201d--\n\n\u201cThat is all.\u201d\n\nThe defense then spent a day in the examination of medical experts in\ninsanity who testified, on the evidence heard, that sufficient causes\nhad occurred to produce an insane mind in the prisoner. Numerous cases\nwere cited to sustain this opinion. There was such a thing as momentary\ninsanity, in which the person, otherwise rational to all appearances,\nwas for the time actually bereft of reason, and not responsible for his\nacts. The causes of this momentary possession could often be found in\nthe person's life. [It afterwards came out that the chief expert for the\ndefense, was paid a thousand dollars for looking into the case.]\n\nThe prosecution consumed another day in the examination of experts\nrefuting the notion of insanity. These causes might have produced\ninsanity, but there was no evidence that they have produced it in this\ncase, or that the prisoner was not at the time of the commission of the\ncrime in full possession of her ordinary faculties.\n\nThe trial had now lasted two weeks. It required four days now for the\nlawyers to \u201csum up.\u201d These arguments of the counsel were very important\nto their friends, and greatly enhanced their reputation at the bar\nbut they have small interest to us. Mr. Braham in his closing speech\nsurpassed himself; his effort is still remembered as the greatest in the\ncriminal annals of New York.\n\nMr. Braham re-drew for the jury the picture of Laura's early life; he\ndwelt long upon that painful episode of the pretended marriage and the\ndesertion. Col. Selby, he said, belonged, gentlemen; to what is called\nthe \u201cupper classes.\u201d It is the privilege of the \u201cupper classes\u201d to prey\nupon the sons and daughters of the people. The Hawkins family, though\nallied to the best blood of the South, were at the time in humble\ncircumstances. He commented upon her parentage. Perhaps her agonized\nfather, in his intervals of sanity, was still searching for his lost\ndaughter. Would he one day hear that she had died a felon's death?\nSociety had pursued her, fate had pursued her, and in a moment of\ndelirium she had turned and defied fate and society. He dwelt upon the\nadmission of base wrong in Col. Selby's dying statement. He drew a vivid\npicture of the villain at last overtaken by the vengeance of Heaven.\nWould the jury say that this retributive justice, inflicted by an\noutraged, and deluded woman, rendered irrational by the most cruel\nwrongs, was in the nature of a foul, premeditated murder? \u201cGentlemen;\nit is enough for me to look upon the life of this most beautiful and\naccomplished of her sex, blasted by the heartless villainy of man,\nwithout seeing, at the end of it; the horrible spectacle of a gibbet.\nGentlemen, we are all human, we have all sinned, we all have need of\nmercy. But I do not ask mercy of you who are the guardians of society\nand of the poor waifs, its sometimes wronged victims; I ask only that\njustice which you and I shall need in that last, dreadful hour, when\ndeath will be robbed of half its terrors if we can reflect that we have\nnever wronged a human being. Gentlemen, the life of this lovely and once\nhappy girl, this now stricken woman, is in your hands.\u201d\n\nThe jury were visibly affected. Half the court room was in tears. If a\nvote of both spectators and jury could have been taken then, the verdict\nwould have been, \u201clet her go, she has suffered enough.\u201d\n\nBut the district attorney had the closing argument. Calmly and without\nmalice or excitement he reviewed the testimony. As the cold facts were\nunrolled, fear settled upon the listeners. There was no escape from\nthe murder or its premeditation. Laura's character as a lobbyist in\nWashington which had been made to appear incidentally in the evidence\nwas also against her: the whole body of the testimony of the defense\nwas shown to be irrelevant, introduced only to excite sympathy, and not\ngiving a color of probability to the absurd supposition of insanity.\nThe attorney then dwelt upon the insecurity of life in the city, and the\ngrowing immunity with which women committed murders. Mr. McFlinn made a\nvery able speech; convincing the reason without touching the feelings.\n\nThe Judge in his charge reviewed the testimony with great show of\nimpartiality. He ended by saying that the verdict must be acquittal or\nmurder in the first degree. If you find that the prisoner committed\na homicide, in possession of her reason and with premeditation, your\nverdict will be accordingly. If you find she was not in her right mind,\nthat she was the victim of insanity, hereditary or momentary, as it has\nbeen explained, your verdict will take that into account.\n\nAs the Judge finished his charge, the spectators anxiously watched the\nfaces of the jury. It was not a remunerative study. In the court room\nthe general feeling was in favor of Laura, but whether this feeling\nextended to the jury, their stolid faces did not reveal. The public\noutside hoped for a conviction, as it always does; it wanted an example;\nthe newspapers trusted the jury would have the courage to do its duty.\nWhen Laura was convicted, then the public would turn around and abuse\nthe governor if he did not pardon her.\n\nThe jury went out. Mr. Braham preserved his serene confidence, but\nLaura's friends were dispirited. Washington and Col. Sellers had been\nobliged to go to Washington, and they had departed under the unspoken\nfear the verdict would be unfavorable, a disagreement was the best they\ncould hope for, and money was needed. The necessity of the passage of\nthe University bill was now imperative.\n\nThe Court waited for some time, but the jury gave no signs of coming in.\nMr. Braham said it was extraordinary. The Court then took a recess for\na couple of hours. Upon again coming in, word was brought that the jury\nhad not yet agreed.\n\nBut the jury had a question. The point upon which they wanted\ninstruction was this. They wanted to know if Col. Sellers was related to\nthe Hawkins family. The court then adjourned till morning.\n\nMr. Braham, who was in something of a pet, remarked to Mr. O'Toole that\nthey must have been deceived--that juryman with the broken nose could\nread!\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\nThe momentous day was at hand--a day that promised to make or mar the\nfortunes of Hawkins family for all time. Washington Hawkins and Col.\nSellers were both up early, for neither of them could sleep. Congress\nwas expiring, and was passing bill after bill as if they were gasps and\neach likely to be its last. The University was on file for its third\nreading this day, and to-morrow Washington would be a millionaire and\nSellers no longer, impecunious but this day, also, or at farthest the\nnext, the jury in Laura's Case would come to a decision of some kind or\nother--they would find her guilty, Washington secretly feared, and then\nthe care and the trouble would all come back again, and these would be\nwearing months of besieging judges for new trials; on this day, also,\nthe re-election of Mr. Dilworthy to the Senate would take place. So\nWashington's mind was in a state of turmoil; there were more interests\nat stake than it could handle with serenity. He exulted when he thought\nof his millions; he was filled with dread when he thought of Laura. But\nSellers was excited and happy. He said:\n\n\u201cEverything is going right, everything's going perfectly right. Pretty\nsoon the telegrams will begin to rattle in, and then you'll see, my boy.\nLet the jury do what they please; what difference is it going to make?\nTo-morrow we can send a million to New York and set the lawyers at work\non the judges; bless your heart they will go before judge after judge\nand exhort and beseech and pray and shed tears. They always do; and they\nalways win, too. And they will win this time. They will get a writ of\nhabeas corpus, and a stay of proceedings, and a supersedeas, and a new\ntrial and a nolle prosequi, and there you are! That's the routine,\nand it's no trick at all to a New York lawyer. That's the regular\nroutine--everything's red tape and routine in the law, you see; it's\nall Greek to you, of course, but to a man who is acquainted with those\nthings it's mere--I'll explain it to you sometime. Everything's going\nto glide right along easy and comfortable now. You'll see, Washington,\nyou'll see how it will be. And then, let me think ..... Dilwortby will\nbe elected to-day, and by day, after to-morrow night he will be in New\nYork ready to put in his shovel--and you haven't lived in Washington all\nthis time not to know that the people who walk right by a Senator whose\nterm is up without hardly seeing him will be down at the deepo to say\n'Welcome back and God bless you; Senator, I'm glad to see you, sir!'\nwhen he comes along back re-elected, you know. Well, you see, his\ninfluence was naturally running low when he left here, but now he has\ngot a new six-years' start, and his suggestions will simply just weigh\na couple of tons a-piece day after tomorrow. Lord bless you he could\nrattle through that habeas corpus and supersedeas and all those things\nfor Laura all by himself if he wanted to, when he gets back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hadn't thought of that,\u201d said Washington, brightening, \u201cbut it is so.\nA newly-elected Senator is a power, I know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes indeed he is.--Why it, is just human nature. Look at me. When we\nfirst came here, I was Mr. Sellers, and Major Sellers, Captain Sellers,\nbut nobody could ever get it right, somehow; but the minute our bill\nwent, through the House, I was Col. Sellers every time. And nobody could\ndo enough for me, and whatever I said was wonderful, Sir, it was always\nwonderful; I never seemed to say any flat things at all. It was Colonel,\nwon't you come and dine with us; and Colonel why don't we ever see you\nat our house; and the Colonel says this; and the Colonel says that; and\nwe know such-and-such is so-and-so because my husband heard Col. Sellers\nsay so. Don't you see? Well, the Senate adjourned and left our bill\nhigh, and dry, and I'll be hanged if I warn't Old Sellers from that\nday, till our bill passed the House again last week. Now I'm the Colonel\nagain; and if I were to eat all the dinners I am invited to, I reckon\nI'd wear my teeth down level with my gums in a couple of weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I do wonder what you will be to-morrow; Colonel, after the\nPresident signs the bill!\u201d\n\n\u201cGeneral, sir?--General, without a doubt. Yes, sir, tomorrow it will\nbe General, let me congratulate you, sir; General, you've done a great\nwork, sir;--you've done a great work for the niggro; Gentlemen allow me\nthe honor to introduce my friend General Sellers, the humane friend\nof the niggro. Lord bless me; you'll' see the newspapers say, General\nSellers and servants arrived in the city last night and is stopping\nat the Fifth Avenue; and General Sellers has accepted a reception and\nbanquet by the Cosmopolitan Club; you'll see the General's opinions\nquoted, too--and what the General has to say about the propriety of a\nnew trial and a habeas corpus for the unfortunate Miss Hawkins will not\nbe without weight in influential quarters, I can tell you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I want to be the first to shake your faithful old hand and salute\nyou with your new honors, and I want to do it now--General!\u201d said\nWashington, suiting the action to the word, and accompanying it with all\nthe meaning that a cordial grasp and eloquent eyes could give it.\n\nThe Colonel was touched; he was pleased and proud, too; his face\nanswered for that.\n\nNot very long after breakfast the telegrams began to arrive. The first\nwas from Braham, and ran thus:\n\n\u201cWe feel certain that the verdict will be rendered to-day. Be it good or\nbad, let it find us ready to make the next move instantly, whatever\nit may be.\u201d \u201cThat's the right talk,\u201d said Sellers. \u201cThat Braham's a\nwonderful man. He was the only man there that really understood me; he\ntold me so himself, afterwards.\u201d\n\nThe next telegram was from Mr. Dilworthy:\n\n\u201cI have not only brought over the Great Invincible, but through him\na dozen more of the opposition. Shall be re-elected to-day by an\noverwhelming majority.\u201d \u201cGood again!\u201d said the Colonel. \u201cThat man's\ntalent for organization is something marvelous. He wanted me to go out\nthere and engineer that thing, but I said, No, Dilworthy, I must be\non hand here,--both on Laura's account and the bill's--but you've no\ntrifling genius for organization yourself, said I--and I was right. You\ngo ahead, said I--you can fix it--and so he has. But I claim no credit\nfor that--if I stiffened up his back-bone a little, I simply put him in\nthe way to make his fight--didn't undertake it myself. He has captured\nNoble--. I consider that a splendid piece of diplomacy--Splendid, Sir!\u201d\n\nBy and by came another dispatch from New York:\n\n\u201cJury still out. Laura calm and firm as a statue. The report that the\njury have brought her in guilty is false and premature.\u201d \u201cPremature!\u201d\n gasped Washington, turning white. \u201cThen they all expect that sort of a\nverdict, when it comes in.\u201d\n\nAnd so did he; but he had not had courage enough to put it into\nwords. He had been preparing himself for the worst, but after all his\npreparation the bare suggestion of the possibility of such a verdict\nstruck him cold as death.\n\nThe friends grew impatient, now; the telegrams did not come fast enough:\neven the lightning could not keep up with their anxieties. They walked\nthe floor talking disjointedly and listening for the door-bell. Telegram\nafter telegram came. Still no result. By and by there was one which\ncontained a single line:\n\n\u201cCourt now coming in after brief recess to hear verdict. Jury ready.\u201d\n \u201cOh, I wish they would finish!\u201d said Washington. \u201cThis suspense is\nkilling me by inches!\u201d\n\nThen came another telegram:\n\n\u201cAnother hitch somewhere. Jury want a little more time and further\ninstructions.\u201d \u201cWell, well, well, this is trying,\u201d said the Colonel. And\nafter a pause, \u201cNo dispatch from Dilworthy for two hours, now. Even\na dispatch from him would be better than nothing, just to vary this\nthing.\u201d\n\nThey waited twenty minutes. It seemed twenty hours.\n\n\u201cCome!\u201d said Washington. \u201cI can't wait for the telegraph boy to come all\nthe way up here. Let's go down to Newspaper Row--meet him on the way.\u201d\n\nWhile they were passing along the Avenue, they saw someone putting up a\ngreat display-sheet on the bulletin board of a newspaper office, and an\neager crowd of men was collecting abort the place. Washington and the\nColonel ran to the spot and read this:\n\n\u201cTremendous Sensation! Startling news from Saint's Rest! On first ballot\nfor U. S. Senator, when voting was about to begin, Mr. Noble rose in\nhis place and drew forth a package, walked forward and laid it on the\nSpeaker's desk, saying, 'This contains $7,000 in bank bills and was\ngiven me by Senator Dilworthy in his bed-chamber at midnight last night\nto buy--my vote for him--I wish the Speaker to count the money and\nretain it to pay the expense of prosecuting this infamous traitor for\nbribery. The whole legislature was stricken speechless with dismay and\nastonishment. Noble further said that there were fifty members present\nwith money in their pockets, placed there by Dilworthy to buy their\nvotes. Amidst unparalleled excitement the ballot was now taken, and J.\nW. Smith elected U. S. Senator; Dilworthy receiving not one vote! Noble\npromises damaging exposures concerning Dilworthy and certain measures\nof his now pending in Congress. \u201cGood heavens and earth!\u201d exclaimed the\nColonel.\n\n\u201cTo the Capitol!\u201d said Washington. \u201cFly!\u201d\n\nAnd they did fly. Long before they got there the newsboys were running\nahead of them with Extras, hot from the press, announcing the astounding\nnews.\n\nArrived in the gallery of the Senate, the friends saw a curious\nspectacle--every Senator held an Extra in his hand and looked as\ninterested as if it contained news of the destruction of the earth. Not\na single member was paying the least attention to the business of the\nhour.\n\nThe Secretary, in a loud voice, was just beginning to read the title of\na bill:\n\n\u201cHouse-Bill--No. 4,231,--An-Act-to-Found-and-Incorporate-the\nKnobs-Industrial-University!\n--Read-first-and-second-time-considered-in-committee-of-the-whole-ordered-engrossed\nand-passed-to-third-reading-and-final passage!\u201d\n\nThe President--\u201cThird reading of the bill!\u201d\n\nThe two friends shook in their shoes. Senators threw down their extras\nand snatched a word or two with each other in whispers. Then the gavel\nrapped to command silence while the names were called on the ayes and\nnays. Washington grew paler and paler, weaker and weaker while the\nlagging list progressed; and when it was finished, his head fell\nhelplessly forward on his arms. The fight was fought, the long struggle\nwas over, and he was a pauper. Not a man had voted for the bill!\n\nCol. Sellers was bewildered and well nigh paralyzed, himself. But no man\ncould long consider his own troubles in the presence of such suffering\nas Washington's. He got him up and supported him--almost carried him\nindeed--out of the building and into a carriage. All the way home\nWashington lay with his face against the Colonel's shoulder and merely\ngroaned and wept. The Colonel tried as well as he could under the dreary\ncircumstances to hearten him a little, but it was of no use. Washington\nwas past all hope of cheer, now. He only said:\n\n\u201cOh, it is all over--it is all over for good, Colonel. We must beg our\nbread, now. We never can get up again. It was our last chance, and it is\ngone. They will hang Laura! My God they will hang her! Nothing can\nsave the poor girl now. Oh, I wish with all my soul they would hang me\ninstead!\u201d\n\nArrived at home, Washington fell into a chair and buried his face in his\nhands and gave full way to his misery. The Colonel did not know where to\nturn nor what to do. The servant maid knocked at the door and passed in\na telegram, saying it had come while they were gone.\n\nThe Colonel tore it open and read with the voice of a man-of-war's\nbroadside:\n\n\u201cVERDICT OF JURY, NOT GUILTY AND LAURA IS FREE!\u201d\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\nThe court room was packed on the morning on which the verdict of the\njury was expected, as it had been every day of the trial, and by\nthe same spectators, who had followed its progress with such intense\ninterest.\n\nThere is a delicious moment of excitement which the frequenter of\ntrials well knows, and which he would not miss for the world. It is that\ninstant when the foreman of the jury stands up to give the verdict, and\nbefore he has opened his fateful lips.\n\nThe court assembled and waited. It was an obstinate jury.\n\nIt even had another question--this intelligent jury--to ask the judge\nthis morning.\n\nThe question was this: \u201cWere the doctors clear that the deceased had no\ndisease which might soon have carried him off, if he had not been shot?\u201d\n There was evidently one jury man who didn't want to waste life, and was\nwilling to stake a general average, as the jury always does in a civil\ncase, deciding not according to the evidence but reaching the verdict by\nsome occult mental process.\n\nDuring the delay the spectators exhibited unexampled patience, finding\namusement and relief in the slightest movements of the court, the\nprisoner and the lawyers. Mr. Braham divided with Laura the attention of\nthe house. Bets were made by the Sheriff's deputies on the verdict, with\nlarge odds in favor of a disagreement.\n\nIt was afternoon when it was announced that the jury was coming in.\nThe reporters took their places and were all attention; the judge\nand lawyers were in their seats; the crowd swayed and pushed in eager\nexpectancy, as the jury walked in and stood up in silence.\n\nJudge. \u201cGentlemen, have you agreed upon your verdict?\u201d\n\nForeman. \u201cWe have.\u201d\n\nJudge. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\nForeman. \u201cNOT GUILTY.\u201d\n\nA shout went up from the entire room and a tumult of cheering which the\ncourt in vain attempted to quell. For a few moments all order was lost.\nThe spectators crowded within the bar and surrounded Laura who, calmer\nthan anyone else, was supporting her aged mother, who had almost fainted\nfrom excess of joy.\n\nAnd now occurred one of those beautiful incidents which no\nfiction-writer would dare to imagine, a scene of touching pathos,\ncreditable to our fallen humanity. In the eyes of the women of the\naudience Mr. Braham was the hero of the occasion; he had saved the life\nof the prisoner; and besides he was such a handsome man. The women could\nnot restrain their long pent-up emotions. They threw themselves upon Mr.\nBraham in a transport of gratitude; they kissed him again and again,\nthe young as well as the advanced in years, the married as well as\nthe ardent single women; they improved the opportunity with a touching\nself-sacrifice; in the words of a newspaper of the day they \u201clavished\nhim with kisses.\u201d\n\nIt was something sweet to do; and it would be sweet for a woman to\nremember in after years, that she had kissed Braham! Mr. Braham himself\nreceived these fond assaults with the gallantry of his nation, enduring\nthe ugly, and heartily paying back beauty in its own coin.\n\nThis beautiful scene is still known in New York as \u201cthe kissing of\nBraham.\u201d\n\nWhen the tumult of congratulation had a little spent itself, and order\nwas restored, Judge O'Shaunnessy said that it now became his duty to\nprovide for the proper custody and treatment of the acquitted. The\nverdict of the jury having left no doubt that the woman was of an\nunsound mind, with a kind of insanity dangerous to the safety of the\ncommunity, she could not be permitted to go at large. \u201cIn accordance\nwith the directions of the law in such cases,\u201d said the Judge, \u201cand\nin obedience to the dictates of a wise humanity, I hereby commit Laura\nHawkins to the care of the Superintendent of the State Hospital\nfor Insane Criminals, to be held in confinement until the State\nCommissioners on Insanity shall order her discharge. Mr. Sheriff, you\nwill attend at once to the execution of this decree.\u201d\n\nLaura was overwhelmed and terror-stricken. She had expected to walk\nforth in freedom in a few moments. The revulsion was terrible. Her\nmother appeared like one shaken with an ague fit. Laura insane! And\nabout to be locked up with madmen! She had never contemplated this. Mr.\nGraham said he should move at once for a writ of 'habeas corpus'.\n\nBut the judge could not do less than his duty, the law must have its\nway. As in the stupor of a sudden calamity, and not fully comprehending\nit, Mrs. Hawkins saw Laura led away by the officer.\n\nWith little space for thought she was rapidly driven to the railway\nstation, and conveyed to the Hospital for Lunatic Criminals. It was\nonly when she was within this vast and grim abode of madness that she\nrealized the horror of her situation. It was only when she was received\nby the kind physician and read pity in his eyes, and saw his look of\nhopeless incredulity when she attempted to tell him that she was not\ninsane; it was only when she passed through the ward to which she\nwas consigned and saw the horrible creatures, the victims of a double\ncalamity, whose dreadful faces she was hereafter to see daily, and was\nlocked into the small, bare room that was to be her home, that all her\nfortitude forsook her. She sank upon the bed, as soon as she was left\nalone--she had been searched by the matron--and tried to think. But her\nbrain was in a whirl. She recalled Braham's speech, she recalled the\ntestimony regarding her lunacy. She wondered if she were not mad; she\nfelt that she soon should be among these loathsome creatures. Better\nalmost to have died, than to slowly go mad in this confinement.\n\n--We beg the reader's pardon. This is not history, which has just been\nwritten. It is really what would have occurred if this were a novel.\nIf this were a work of fiction, we should not dare to dispose of Laura\notherwise. True art and any attention to dramatic proprieties required\nit. The novelist who would turn loose upon society an insane murderess\ncould not escape condemnation. Besides, the safety of society, the\ndecencies of criminal procedure, what we call our modern civilization,\nall would demand that Laura should be disposed of in the manner we\nhave described. Foreigners, who read this sad story, will be unable to\nunderstand any other termination of it.\n\nBut this is history and not fiction. There is no such law or custom as\nthat to which his Honor is supposed to have referred; Judge O'Shaunnessy\nwould not probably pay any attention to it if there were. There is no\nHospital for Insane Criminals; there is no State commission of lunacy.\nWhat actually occurred when the tumult in the court room had subsided\nthe sagacious reader will now learn.\n\nLaura left the court room, accompanied by her mother and other friends,\namid the congratulations of those assembled, and was cheered as she\nentered a carriage, and drove away. How sweet was the sunlight, how\nexhilarating the sense of freedom! Were not these following cheers the\nexpression of popular approval and affection? Was she not the heroine of\nthe hour?\n\nIt was with a feeling of triumph that Laura reached her hotel, a\nscornful feeling of victory over society with its own weapons.\n\nMrs. Hawkins shared not at all in this feeling; she was broken with the\ndisgrace and the long anxiety.\n\n\u201cThank God, Laura,\u201d she said, \u201cit is over. Now we will go away from this\nhateful city. Let us go home at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cMother,\u201d replied Laura, speaking with some tenderness, \u201cI cannot go\nwith you. There, don't cry, I cannot go back to that life.\u201d\n\nMrs. Hawkins was sobbing. This was more cruel than anything else, for\nshe had a dim notion of what it would be to leave Laura to herself.\n\n\u201cNo, mother, you have been everything to me. You know how dearly I love\nyou. But I cannot go back.\u201d\n\nA boy brought in a telegraphic despatch. Laura took it and read:\n\n\u201cThe bill is lost. Dilworthy ruined. (Signed) WASHINGTON.\u201d For a moment\nthe words swam before her eyes. The next her eyes flashed fire as she\nhanded the dispatch to her mother and bitterly said,\n\n\u201cThe world is against me. Well, let it be, let it. I am against it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a cruel disappointment,\u201d said Mrs. Hawkins, to whom one grief\nmore or less did not much matter now, \u201cto you and, Washington; but we\nmust humbly bear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBear it;\u201d replied Laura scornfully, \u201cI've all my life borne it, and\nfate has thwarted me at every step.\u201d\n\nA servant came to the door to say that there was a gentleman below who\nwished to speak with Miss Hawkins. \u201cJ. Adolphe Griller\u201d was the name\nLaura read on the card. \u201cI do not know such a person. He probably comes\nfrom Washington. Send him up.\u201d\n\nMr. Griller entered. He was a small man, slovenly in dress, his tone\nconfidential, his manner wholly void of animation, all his features\nbelow the forehead protruding--particularly the apple of his\nthroat--hair without a kink in it, a hand with no grip, a meek, hang-dog\ncountenance. He was a falsehood done in flesh and blood; for while every\nvisible sign about him proclaimed him a poor, witless, useless weakling,\nthe truth was that he had the brains to plan great enterprises and\nthe pluck to carry them through. That was his reputation, and it was a\ndeserved one. He softly said:\n\n\u201cI called to see you on business, Miss Hawkins. You have my card?\u201d\n\nLaura bowed.\n\nMr. Griller continued to purr, as softly as before.\n\n\u201cI will proceed to business. I am a business man. I am a lecture-agent,\nMiss Hawkins, and as soon as I saw that you were acquitted, it occurred\nto me that an early interview would be mutually beneficial.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't understand you, sir,\u201d said Laura coldly.\n\n\u201cNo? You see, Miss Hawkins, this is your opportunity. If you will enter\nthe lecture field under good auspices, you will carry everything before\nyou.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, sir, I never lectured, I haven't any lecture, I don't know\nanything about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, madam, that makes no difference--no real difference. It is not\nnecessary to be able to lecture in order to go into the lecture tour.\nIf ones name is celebrated all over the land, especially, and, if she is\nalso beautiful, she is certain to draw large audiences.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what should I lecture about?\u201d asked Laura, beginning in spite of\nherself to be a little interested as well as amused.\n\n\u201cOh, why; woman--something about woman, I should say; the marriage\nrelation, woman's fate, anything of that sort. Call it The Revelations\nof a Woman's Life; now, there's a good title. I wouldn't want any better\ntitle than that. I'm prepared to make you an offer, Miss Hawkins, a\nliberal offer,--twelve thousand dollars for thirty nights.\u201d\n\nLaura thought. She hesitated. Why not? It would give her employment,\nmoney. She must do something.\n\n\u201cI will think of it, and let you know soon. But still, there is very\nlittle likelihood that I--however, we will not discuss it further now.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember, that the sooner we get to work the better, Miss Hawkins,\npublic curiosity is so fickle. Good day, madam.\u201d\n\nThe close of the trial released Mr. Harry Brierly and left him free\nto depart upon his long talked of Pacific-coast mission. He was very\nmysterious about it, even to Philip.\n\n\u201cIt's confidential, old boy,\u201d he said, \u201ca little scheme we have hatched\nup. I don't mind telling you that it's a good deal bigger thing than\nthat in Missouri, and a sure thing. I wouldn't take a half a million\njust for my share. And it will open something for you, Phil. You will\nhear from me.\u201d\n\nPhilip did hear from Harry a few months afterward. Everything promised\nsplendidly, but there was a little delay. Could Phil let him have a\nhundred, say, for ninety days?\n\nPhilip himself hastened to Philadelphia, and, as soon as the spring\nopened, to the mine at Ilium, and began transforming the loan he had\nreceived from Squire Montague into laborers' wages. He was haunted with\nmany anxieties; in the first place, Ruth was overtaxing her strength in\nher hospital labors, and Philip felt as if he must move heaven and\nearth to save her from such toil and suffering. His increased pecuniary\nobligation oppressed him. It seemed to him also that he had been one\ncause of the misfortune to the Bolton family, and that he was dragging\ninto loss and ruin everybody who associated with him. He worked on day\nafter day and week after week, with a feverish anxiety.\n\nIt would be wicked, thought Philip, and impious, to pray for luck; he\nfelt that perhaps he ought not to ask a blessing upon the sort of labor\nthat was only a venture; but yet in that daily petition, which this\nvery faulty and not very consistent young Christian gentleman put up, he\nprayed earnestly enough for Ruth and for the Boltons and for those\nwhom he loved and who trusted in him, and that his life might not be a\nmisfortune to them and a failure to himself.\n\nSince this young fellow went out into the world from his New England\nhome, he had done some things that he would rather his mother should not\nknow, things maybe that he would shrink from telling Ruth. At a certain\ngreen age young gentlemen are sometimes afraid of being called milksops,\nand Philip's associates had not always been the most select, such as\nthese historians would have chosen for him, or whom at a later, period\nhe would have chosen for himself. It seemed inexplicable, for instance,\nthat his life should have been thrown so much with his college\nacquaintance, Henry Brierly.\n\nYet, this was true of Philip, that in whatever company he had been he\nhad never been ashamed to stand up for the principles he learned from\nhis mother, and neither raillery nor looks of wonder turned him from\nthat daily habit he had learned at his mother's knees.--Even flippant\nHarry respected this, and perhaps it was one of the reasons why Harry\nand all who knew Philip trusted him implicitly. And yet it must be\nconfessed that Philip did not convey the impression to the world of a\nvery serious young man, or of a man who might not rather easily fall\ninto temptation. One looking for a real hero would have to go elsewhere.\n\nThe parting between Laura and her mother was exceedingly painful to\nboth. It was as if two friends parted on a wide plain, the one to\njourney towards the setting and the other towards the rising sun, each\ncomprehending that every step henceforth must separate their lives,\nwider and wider.\n\nCHAPTER LIX.\n\nWhen Mr. Noble's bombshell fell in Senator Dilworthy's camp, the\nstatesman was disconcerted for a moment. For a moment; that was all. The\nnext moment he was calmly up and doing. From the centre of our country\nto its circumference, nothing was talked of but Mr. Noble's terrible\nrevelation, and the people were furious. Mind, they were not furious\nbecause bribery was uncommon in our public life, but merely because here\nwas another case. Perhaps it did not occur to the nation of good and\nworthy people that while they continued to sit comfortably at home and\nleave the true source of our political power (the \u201cprimaries,\u201d) in the\nhands of saloon-keepers, dog-fanciers and hod-carriers, they could go on\nexpecting \u201canother\u201d case of this kind, and even dozens and hundreds of\nthem, and never be disappointed. However, they may have thought that to\nsit at home and grumble would some day right the evil.\n\nYes, the nation was excited, but Senator Dilworthy was calm--what was\nleft of him after the explosion of the shell. Calm, and up and doing.\nWhat did he do first? What would you do first, after you had tomahawked\nyour mother at the breakfast table for putting too much sugar in your\ncoffee? You would \u201cask for a suspension of public opinion.\u201d That is\nwhat Senator Dilworthy did. It is the custom. He got the usual amount of\nsuspension. Far and wide he was called a thief, a briber, a promoter of\nsteamship subsidies, railway swindles, robberies of the government in\nall possible forms and fashions. Newspapers and everybody else called\nhim a pious hypocrite, a sleek, oily fraud, a reptile who manipulated\ntemperance movements, prayer meetings, Sunday schools, public charities,\nmissionary enterprises, all for his private benefit. And as these\ncharges were backed up by what seemed to be good and sufficient,\nevidence, they were believed with national unanimity.\n\nThen Mr. Dilworthy made another move. He moved instantly to Washington\nand \u201cdemanded an investigation.\u201d Even this could not pass without\ncomment. Many papers used language to this effect:\n\n\u201cSenator Dilworthy's remains have demanded an investigation. This sounds\nfine and bold and innocent; but when we reflect that they demand it at\nthe hands of the Senate of the United States, it simply becomes matter\nfor derision. One might as well set the gentlemen detained in the public\nprisons to trying each other. This investigation is likely to be like\nall other Senatorial investigations--amusing but not useful. Query. Why\ndoes the Senate still stick to this pompous word, 'Investigation?' One\ndoes not blindfold one's self in order to investigate an object.\u201d Mr.\nDilworthy appeared in his place in the Senate and offered a resolution\nappointing a committee to investigate his case. It carried, of course,\nand the committee was appointed. Straightway the newspapers said:\n\n\u201cUnder the guise of appointing a committee to investigate the late Mr.\nDilworthy, the Senate yesterday appointed a committee to investigate\nhis accuser, Mr. Noble. This is the exact spirit and meaning of the\nresolution, and the committee cannot try anybody but Mr. Noble without\noverstepping its authority. That Dilworthy had the effrontery to offer\nsuch a resolution will surprise no one, and that the Senate could\nentertain it without blushing and pass it without shame will surprise\nno one. We are now reminded of a note which we have received from the\nnotorious burglar Murphy, in which he finds fault with a statement of\nours to the effect that he had served one term in the penitentiary and\nalso one in the U. S. Senate. He says, 'The latter statement is untrue\nand does me great injustice.' After an unconscious sarcasm like that,\nfurther comment is unnecessary.\u201d And yet the Senate was roused by the\nDilworthy trouble. Many speeches were made. One Senator (who was accused\nin the public prints of selling his chances of re-election to his\nopponent for $50,000 and had not yet denied the charge) said that, \u201cthe\npresence in the Capital of such a creature as this man Noble, to testify\nagainst a brother member of their body, was an insult to the Senate.\u201d\n\nAnother Senator said, \u201cLet the investigation go on and let it make an\nexample of this man Noble; let it teach him and men like him that\nthey could not attack the reputation of a United States Senator with\nimpunity.\u201d\n\nAnother said he was glad the investigation was to be had, for it was\nhigh time that the Senate should crush some cur like this man Noble, and\nthus show his kind that it was able and resolved to uphold its ancient\ndignity.\n\nA by-stander laughed, at this finely delivered peroration; and said:\n\n\u201cWhy, this is the Senator who franked his baggage home through the mails\nlast week--registered, at that. However, perhaps he was merely engaged\nin 'upholding the ancient dignity of the Senate,'--then.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, the modern dignity of it,\u201d said another by-stander. \u201cIt don't\nresemble its ancient dignity but it fits its modern style like a glove.\u201d\n\nThere being no law against making offensive remarks about U. S.\nSenators, this conversation, and others like it, continued without let\nor hindrance. But our business is with the investigating committee.\n\nMr. Noble appeared before the Committee of the Senate; and testified to\nthe following effect:\n\nHe said that he was a member of the State legislature of the\nHappy-Land-of-Canaan; that on the --- day of ------ he assembled himself\ntogether at the city of Saint's Rest, the capital of the State, along\nwith his brother legislators; that he was known to be a political enemy\nof Mr. Dilworthy and bitterly opposed to his re-election; that Mr.\nDilworthy came to Saint's Rest and reported to be buying pledges of\nvotes with money; that the said Dilworthy sent for him to come to\nhis room in the hotel at night, and he went; was introduced to\nMr. Dilworthy; called two or three times afterward at Dilworthy's\nrequest--usually after midnight; Mr. Dilworthy urged him to vote for\nhim; Noble declined; Dilworthy argued; said he was bound to be elected,\nand could then ruin him (Noble) if he voted no; said he had every\nrailway and every public office and stronghold of political power in the\nState under his thumb, and could set up or pull down any man he chose;\ngave instances showing where and how he had used this power; if Noble\nwould vote for him he would make him a Representative in Congress; Noble\nstill declined to vote, and said he did not believe Dilworthy was going\nto be elected; Dilworthy showed a list of men who would vote for him--a\nmajority of the legislature; gave further proofs of his power by telling\nNoble everything the opposing party had done or said in secret caucus;\nclaimed that his spies reported everything to him, and that--\n\nHere a member of the Committee objected that this evidence was\nirrelevant and also in opposition to the spirit of the Committee's\ninstructions, because if these things reflected upon any one it was\nupon Mr. Dilworthy. The chairman said, let the person proceed with his\nstatement--the Committee could exclude evidence that did not bear upon\nthe case.\n\nMr. Noble continued. He said that his party would cast him out if he\nvoted for Mr. Dilworthy; Dilworthy said that that would inure to\nhis benefit because he would then be a recognized friend of his\n(Dilworthy's) and he could consistently exalt him politically and make\nhis fortune; Noble said he was poor, and it was hard to tempt him so;\nDilworthy said he would fix that; he said, \u201cTell, me what you want, and\nsay you will vote for me;\u201d Noble could not say; Dilworthy said \u201cI will\ngive you $5,000.\u201d\n\nA Committee man said, impatiently, that this stuff was all outside\nthe case, and valuable time was being wasted; this was all a plain\nreflection upon a brother Senator. The Chairman said it was the quickest\nway to proceed, and the evidence need have no weight.\n\nMr. Noble continued. He said he told Dilworthy that $5,000 was not\nmuch to pay for a man's honor, character and everything that was\nworth having; Dilworthy said he was surprised; he considered $5,000\na fortune--for some men; asked what Noble's figure was; Noble said he\ncould not think $10,000 too little; Dilworthy said it was a great deal\ntoo much; he would not do it for any other man, but he had conceived\na liking for Noble, and where he liked a man his heart yearned to help\nhim; he was aware that Noble was poor, and had a family to support, and\nthat he bore an unblemished reputation at home; for such a man and such\na man's influence he could do much, and feel that to help such a man\nwould be an act that would have its reward; the struggles of the poor\nalways touched him; he believed that Noble would make a good use of this\nmoney and that it would cheer many a sad heart and needy home; he would\ngive the $10,000; all he desired in return was that when the balloting\nbegan, Noble should cast his vote for him and should explain to the\nlegislature that upon looking into the charges against Mr. Dilworthy of\nbribery, corruption, and forwarding stealing measures in Congress he had\nfound them to be base calumnies upon a man whose motives were pure and\nwhose character was stainless; he then took from his pocket $2,000 in\nbank bills and handed them to Noble, and got another package containing\n$5,000 out of his trunk and gave to him also. He----\n\nA Committee man jumped up, and said:\n\n\u201cAt last, Mr. Chairman, this shameless person has arrived at the point.\nThis is sufficient and conclusive. By his own confession he has received\na bribe, and did it deliberately.\n\n\u201cThis is a grave offense, and cannot be passed over in silence, sir. By\nthe terms of our instructions we can now proceed to mete out to him such\npunishment as is meet for one who has maliciously brought disrespect\nupon a Senator of the United States. We have no need to hear the rest of\nhis evidence.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman said it would be better and more regular to proceed with\nthe investigation according to the usual forms. A note would be made of\nMr. Noble's admission.\n\nMr. Noble continued. He said that it was now far past midnight; that\nhe took his leave and went straight to certain legislators, told\nthem everything, made them count the money, and also told them of the\nexposure he would make in joint convention; he made that exposure, as\nall the world knew. The rest of the $10,000 was to be paid the day after\nDilworthy was elected.\n\nSenator Dilworthy was now asked to take the stand and tell what he knew\nabout the man Noble. The Senator wiped his mouth with his handkerchief,\nadjusted his white cravat, and said that but for the fact that public\nmorality required an example, for the warning of future Nobles, he would\nbeg that in Christian charity this poor misguided creature might be\nforgiven and set free. He said that it was but too evident that this\nperson had approached him in the hope of obtaining a bribe; he had\nintruded himself time and again, and always with moving stories of his\npoverty. Mr. Dilworthy said that his heart had bled for him--insomuch\nthat he had several times been on the point of trying to get some one to\ndo something for him. Some instinct had told him from the beginning that\nthis was a bad man, an evil-minded man, but his inexperience of such had\nblinded him to his real motives, and hence he had never dreamed that\nhis object was to undermine the purity of a United States Senator. He\nregretted that it was plain, now, that such was the man's object and\nthat punishment could not with safety to the Senate's honor be withheld.\nHe grieved to say that one of those mysterious dispensations of an\ninscrutable Providence which are decreed from time to time by His wisdom\nand for His righteous, purposes, had given this conspirator's tale a\ncolor of plausibility,--but this would soon disappear under the clear\nlight of truth which would now be thrown upon the case.\n\nIt so happened, (said the Senator,) that about the time in question, a\npoor young friend of mine, living in a distant town of my State, wished\nto establish a bank; he asked me to lend him the necessary money; I said\nI had no, money just then, but world try to borrow it. The day before\nthe election a friend said to me that my election expenses must be\nvery large specially my hotel bills, and offered to lend me some money.\nRemembering my young, friend, I said I would like a few thousands now,\nand a few more by and by; whereupon he gave me two packages of bills\nsaid to contain $2,000 and $5,000 respectively; I did not open the\npackages or count the money; I did not give any note or receipt for\nthe same; I made no memorandum of the transaction, and neither did my\nfriend. That night this evil man Noble came troubling me again: I could\nnot rid myself of him, though my time was very precious. He mentioned my\nyoung friend and said he was very anxious to have the $7000 now to begin\nhis banking operations with, and could wait a while for the rest. Noble\nwished to get the money and take it to him. I finally gave him the\ntwo packages of bills; I took no note or receipt from him, and made no\nmemorandum of the matter. I no more look for duplicity and deception in\nanother man than I would look for it in myself. I never thought of\nthis man again until I was overwhelmed the next day by learning what a\nshameful use he had made of the confidence I had reposed in him and\nthe money I had entrusted to his care. This is all, gentlemen. To the\nabsolute truth of every detail of my statement I solemnly swear, and I\ncall Him to witness who is the Truth and the loving Father of all whose\nlips abhor false speaking; I pledge my honor as a Senator, that I have\nspoken but the truth. May God forgive this wicked man as I do.\n\nMr. Noble--\u201cSenator Dilworthy, your bank account shows that up to\nthat day, and even on that very day, you conducted all your financial\nbusiness through the medium of checks instead of bills, and so kept\ncareful record of every moneyed transaction. Why did you deal in bank\nbills on this particular occasion?\u201d\n\nThe Chairman--\u201cThe gentleman will please to remember that the Committee\nis conducting this investigation.\u201d\n\nMr. Noble--\u201cThen will the Committee ask the question?\u201d\n\nThe Chairman--\u201cThe Committee will--when it desires to know.\u201d\n\nMr. Noble--\u201cWhich will not be during this century perhaps.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman--\u201cAnother remark like that, sir, will procure you the\nattentions of the Sergeant-at-arms.\u201d\n\nMr. Noble--\u201cD--n the Sergeant-at-arms, and the Committee too!\u201d\n\nSeveral Committeemen--\u201cMr. Chairman, this is Contempt!\u201d\n\nMr. Noble--\u201cContempt of whom?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf the Committee! Of the Senate of the United States!\u201d\n\nMr. Noble--\u201cThen I am become the acknowledged representative of a\nnation. You know as well as I do that the whole nation hold as much\nas three-fifths of the United States Senate in entire\ncontempt.--Three-fifths of you are Dilworthys.\u201d\n\nThe Sergeant-at-arms very soon put a quietus upon the observations of\nthe representative of the nation, and convinced him that he was not in\nthe over-free atmosphere of his Happy-Land-of-Canaan:\n\nThe statement of Senator Dilworthy naturally carried conviction to the\nminds of the committee.--It was close, logical, unanswerable; it bore\nmany internal evidences of its truth. For instance, it is customary in\nall countries for business men to loan large sums of money in bank bills\ninstead of checks. It is customary for the lender to make no memorandum\nof the transaction. It is customary, for the borrower to receive the\nmoney without making a memorandum of it, or giving a note or a receipt\nfor it's use--the borrower is not likely to die or forget about it.\nIt is customary to lend nearly anybody money to start a bank with\nespecially if you have not the money to lend him and have to borrow it\nfor the purpose. It is customary to carry large sums of money in bank\nbills about your person or in your trunk. It is customary to hand a\nlarge sum in bank bills to a man you have just been introduced to (if\nhe asks you to do it,) to be conveyed to a distant town and delivered\nto another party. It is not customary to make a memorandum of this\ntransaction; it is not customary for the conveyor to give a note or a\nreceipt for the money; it is not customary to require that he shall get\na note or a receipt from the man he is to convey it to in the distant\ntown. It would be at least singular in you to say to the proposed\nconveyor, \u201cYou might be robbed; I will deposit the money in a bank and\nsend a check for it to my friend through the mail.\u201d\n\nVery well. It being plain that Senator Dilworthy's statement was rigidly\ntrue, and this fact being strengthened by his adding to it the support\nof \u201chis honor as a Senator,\u201d the Committee rendered a verdict of \u201cNot\nproven that a bribe had been offered and accepted.\u201d This in a manner\nexonerated Noble and let him escape.\n\nThe Committee made its report to the Senate, and that body proceeded to\nconsider its acceptance. One Senator indeed, several Senators--objected\nthat the Committee had failed of its duty; they had proved this man\nNoble guilty of nothing, they had meted out no punishment to him; if the\nreport were accepted, he would go forth free and scathless, glorying in\nhis crime, and it would be a tacit admission that any blackguard could\ninsult the Senate of the United States and conspire against the sacred\nreputation of its members with impunity; the Senate owed it to the\nupholding of its ancient dignity to make an example of this man\nNoble--he should be crushed.\n\nAn elderly Senator got up and took another view of the case. This was\na Senator of the worn-out and obsolete pattern; a man still lingering\namong the cobwebs of the past, and behind the spirit of the age. He\nsaid that there seemed to be a curious misunderstanding of the case.\nGentlemen seemed exceedingly anxious to preserve and maintain the honor\nand dignity of the Senate.\n\nWas this to be done by trying an obscure adventurer for attempting to\ntrap a Senator into bribing him? Or would not the truer way be to find\nout whether the Senator was capable of being entrapped into so shameless\nan act, and then try him? Why, of course. Now the whole idea of the\nSenate seemed to be to shield the Senator and turn inquiry away from\nhim. The true way to uphold the honor of the Senate was to have none but\nhonorable men in its body. If this Senator had yielded to temptation\nand had offered a bribe, he was a soiled man and ought to be instantly\nexpelled; therefore he wanted the Senator tried, and not in the usual\nnamby-pamby way, but in good earnest. He wanted to know the truth\nof this matter. For himself, he believed that the guilt of Senator\nDilworthy was established beyond the shadow of a doubt; and he\nconsidered that in trifling with his case and shirking it the Senate was\ndoing a shameful and cowardly thing--a thing which suggested that in\nits willingness to sit longer in the company of such a man, it was\nacknowledging that it was itself of a kind with him and was therefore\nnot dishonored by his presence. He desired that a rigid examination be\nmade into Senator Dilworthy's case, and that it be continued clear into\nthe approaching extra session if need be. There was no dodging this\nthing with the lame excuse of want of time.\n\nIn reply, an honorable Senator said that he thought it would be as well\nto drop the matter and accept the Committee's report. He said with some\njocularity that the more one agitated this thing, the worse it was for\nthe agitator. He was not able to deny that he believed Senator Dilworthy\nto be guilty--but what then? Was it such an extraordinary case? For\nhis part, even allowing the Senator to be guilty, he did not think his\ncontinued presence during the few remaining days of the Session would\ncontaminate the Senate to a dreadful degree. [This humorous sally was\nreceived with smiling admiration--notwithstanding it was not wholly new,\nhaving originated with the Massachusetts General in the House a day or\ntwo before, upon the occasion of the proposed expulsion of a member for\nselling his vote for money.]\n\nThe Senate recognized the fact that it could not be contaminated by\nsitting a few days longer with Senator Dilworthy, and so it accepted the\ncommittee's report and dropped the unimportant matter.\n\nMr. Dilworthy occupied his seat to the last hour of the session. He said\nthat his people had reposed a trust in him, and it was not for him to\ndesert them. He would remain at his post till he perished, if need be.\n\nHis voice was lifted up and his vote cast for the last time, in support\nof an ingenious measure contrived by the General from Massachusetts\nwhereby the President's salary was proposed to be doubled and every\nCongressman paid several thousand dollars extra for work previously\ndone, under an accepted contract, and already paid for once and\nreceipted for.\n\nSenator Dilworthy was offered a grand ovation by his friends at home,\nwho said that their affection for him and their confidence in him were\nin no wise impaired by the persecutions that had pursued him, and that\nhe was still good enough for them.\n\n[The $7,000 left by Mr. Noble with his state legislature was placed\nin safe keeping to await the claim of the legitimate owner. Senator\nDilworthy made one little effort through his protege the embryo banker\nto recover it, but there being no notes of hand or, other memoranda to\nsupport the claim, it failed. The moral of which is, that when one\nloans money to start a bank with, one ought to take the party's written\nacknowledgment of the fact.]\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\nFor some days Laura had been a free woman once more. During this time,\nshe had experienced--first, two or three days of triumph, excitement,\ncongratulations, a sort of sunburst of gladness, after a long night of\ngloom and anxiety; then two or three days of calming down, by degrees--a\nreceding of tides, a quieting of the storm-wash to a murmurous\nsurf-beat, a diminishing of devastating winds to a refrain that bore the\nspirit of a truce-days given to solitude, rest, self-communion, and\nthe reasoning of herself into a realization of the fact that she was\nactually done with bolts and bars, prison horrors and impending death;\nthen came a day whose hours filed slowly by her, each laden with some\nremnant, some remaining fragment of the dreadful time so lately ended--a\nday which, closing at last, left the past a fading shore behind her and\nturned her eyes toward the broad sea of the future. So speedily do we\nput the dead away and come back to our place in the ranks to march in\nthe pilgrimage of life again.\n\nAnd now the sun rose once more and ushered in the first day of what\nLaura comprehended and accepted as a new life.\n\nThe past had sunk below the horizon, and existed no more for her; she\nwas done with it for all time. She was gazing out over the trackless\nexpanses of the future, now, with troubled eyes. Life must be begun\nagain--at eight and twenty years of age. And where to begin? The page\nwas blank, and waiting for its first record; so this was indeed a\nmomentous day.\n\nHer thoughts drifted back, stage by stage, over her career. As far as\nthe long highway receded over the plain of her life, it was lined with\nthe gilded and pillared splendors of her ambition all crumbled to ruin\nand ivy-grown; every milestone marked a disaster; there was no green\nspot remaining anywhere in memory of a hope that had found its fruition;\nthe unresponsive earth had uttered no voice of flowers in testimony that\none who was blest had gone that road.\n\nHer life had been a failure. That was plain, she said. No more of that.\nShe would now look the future in the face; she would mark her course\nupon the chart of life, and follow it; follow it without swerving,\nthrough rocks and shoals, through storm and calm, to a haven of rest\nand peace or shipwreck. Let the end be what it might, she would mark her\ncourse now--to-day--and follow it.\n\nOn her table lay six or seven notes. They were from lovers; from some\nof the prominent names in the land; men whose devotion had survived\neven the grisly revealments of her character which the courts had\nuncurtained; men who knew her now, just as she was, and yet pleaded as\nfor their lives for the dear privilege of calling the murderess wife.\n\nAs she read these passionate, these worshiping, these supplicating\nmissives, the woman in her nature confessed itself; a strong yearning\ncame upon her to lay her head upon a loyal breast and find rest from\nthe conflict of life, solace for her griefs, the healing of love for her\nbruised heart.\n\nWith her forehead resting upon her hand, she sat thinking, thinking,\nwhile the unheeded moments winged their flight. It was one of those\nmornings in early spring when nature seems just stirring to a half\nconsciousness out of a long, exhausting lethargy; when the first faint\nbalmy airs go wandering about, whispering the secret of the coming\nchange; when the abused brown grass, newly relieved of snow, seems\nconsidering whether it can be worth the trouble and worry of contriving\nits green raiment again only to fight the inevitable fight with the\nimplacable winter and be vanquished and buried once more; when the sun\nshines out and a few birds venture forth and lift up a forgotten song;\nwhen a strange stillness and suspense pervades the waiting air. It is a\ntime when one's spirit is subdued and sad, one knows not why; when the\npast seems a storm-swept desolation, life a vanity and a burden, and the\nfuture but a way to death. It is a time when one is filled with vague\nlongings; when one dreams of flight to peaceful islands in the remote\nsolitudes of the sea, or folds his hands and says, What is the use of\nstruggling, and toiling and worrying any more? let us give it all up.\n\nIt was into such a mood as this that Laura had drifted from the musings\nwhich the letters of her lovers had called up. Now she lifted her head\nand noted with surprise how the day had wasted. She thrust the letters\naside, rose up and went and stood at the window. But she was soon\nthinking again, and was only gazing into vacancy.\n\nBy and by she turned; her countenance had cleared; the dreamy look was\ngone out of her face, all indecision had vanished; the poise of her head\nand the firm set of her lips told that her resolution was formed. She\nmoved toward the table with all the old dignity in her carriage, and all\nthe old pride in her mien. She took up each letter in its turn, touched\na match to it and watched it slowly consume to ashes. Then she said:\n\n\u201cI have landed upon a foreign shore, and burned my ships behind me.\nThese letters were the last thing that held me in sympathy with any\nremnant or belonging of the old life. Henceforth that life and all that\nappertains to it are as dead to me and as far removed from me as if I\nwere become a denizen of another world.\u201d\n\nShe said that love was not for her--the time that it could have\nsatisfied her heart was gone by and could not return; the opportunity\nwas lost, nothing could restore it. She said there could be no love\nwithout respect, and she would only despise a man who could content\nhimself with a thing like her. Love, she said, was a woman's first\nnecessity: love being forfeited; there was but one thing left that could\ngive a passing zest to a wasted life, and that was fame, admiration, the\napplause of the multitude.\n\nAnd so her resolution was taken. She would turn to that final resort\nof the disappointed of her sex, the lecture platform. She would array\nherself in fine attire, she would adorn herself with jewels, and stand\nin her isolated magnificence before massed audiences and enchant them\nwith her eloquence and amaze them with her unapproachable beauty. She\nwould move from city to city like a queen of romance, leaving marveling\nmultitudes behind her and impatient multitudes awaiting her coming.\nHer life, during one hour of each day, upon the platform, would be a\nrapturous intoxication--and when the curtain fell and the lights were\nout, and the people gone, to nestle in their homes and forget her, she\nwould find in sleep oblivion of her homelessness, if she could, if not\nshe would brave out the night in solitude and wait for the next day's\nhour of ecstasy.\n\nSo, to take up life and begin again was no great evil. She saw her way.\nShe would be brave and strong; she would make the best of what was left\nfor her among the possibilities.\n\nShe sent for the lecture agent, and matters were soon arranged.\n\nStraightway, all the papers were filled with her name, and all the dead\nwalls flamed with it. The papers called down imprecations upon her head;\nthey reviled her without stint; they wondered if all sense of decency\nwas dead in this shameless murderess, this brazen lobbyist, this\nheartless seducer of the affections of weak and misguided men; they\nimplored the people, for the sake of their pure wives, their sinless\ndaughters, for the sake of decency, for the sake of public morals, to\ngive this wretched creature such a rebuke as should be an all-sufficient\nevidence to her and to such as her, that there was a limit where the\nflaunting of their foul acts and opinions before the world must stop;\ncertain of them, with a higher art, and to her a finer cruelty, a\nsharper torture, uttered no abuse, but always spoke of her in terms of\nmocking eulogy and ironical admiration. Everybody talked about the new\nwonder, canvassed the theme of her proposed discourse, and marveled how\nshe would handle it.\n\nLaura's few friends wrote to her or came and talked with her, and\npleaded with her to retire while it was yet time, and not attempt to\nface the gathering storm. But it was fruitless. She was stung to the\nquick by the comments of the newspapers; her spirit was roused, her\nambition was towering, now. She was more determined than ever. She would\nshow these people what a hunted and persecuted woman could do.\n\nThe eventful night came. Laura arrived before the great lecture hall in\na close carriage within five minutes of the time set for the lecture to\nbegin. When she stepped out of the vehicle her heart beat fast and her\neyes flashed with exultation: the whole street was packed with people,\nand she could hardly force her way to the hall! She reached the\nante-room, threw off her wraps and placed herself before the\ndressing-glass. She turned herself this way and that--everything was\nsatisfactory, her attire was perfect. She smoothed her hair, rearranged\na jewel here and there, and all the while her heart sang within her, and\nher face was radiant. She had not been so happy for ages and ages, it\nseemed to her. Oh, no, she had never been so overwhelmingly grateful and\nhappy in her whole life before. The lecture agent appeared at the door.\nShe waved him away and said:\n\n\u201cDo not disturb me. I want no introduction. And do not fear for me; the\nmoment the hands point to eight I will step upon the platform.\u201d\n\nHe disappeared. She held her watch before her. She was so impatient that\nthe second-hand seemed whole tedious minutes dragging its way around\nthe circle. At last the supreme moment came, and with head erect and\nthe bearing of an empress she swept through the door and stood upon the\nstage. Her eyes fell upon only a vast, brilliant emptiness--there were\nnot forty people in the house! There were only a handful of coarse men\nand ten or twelve still coarser women, lolling upon the benches and\nscattered about singly and in couples.\n\nHer pulses stood still, her limbs quaked, the gladness went out of her\nface. There was a moment of silence, and then a brutal laugh and an\nexplosion of cat-calls and hisses saluted her from the audience. The\nclamor grew stronger and louder, and insulting speeches were shouted at\nher. A half-intoxicated man rose up and threw something, which missed\nher but bespattered a chair at her side, and this evoked an outburst of\nlaughter and boisterous admiration. She was bewildered, her strength was\nforsaking her. She reeled away from the platform, reached the ante-room,\nand dropped helpless upon a sofa. The lecture agent ran in, with a\nhurried question upon his lips; but she put forth her hands, and with\nthe tears raining from her eyes, said:\n\n\u201cOh, do not speak! Take me away-please take me away, out of this\ndreadful place! Oh, this is like all my life--failure, disappointment,\nmisery--always misery, always failure. What have I done, to be so\npursued! Take me away, I beg of you, I implore you!\u201d\n\nUpon the pavement she was hustled by the mob, the surging masses roared\nher name and accompanied it with every species of insulting epithet;\nthey thronged after the carriage, hooting, jeering, cursing, and even\nassailing the vehicle with missiles. A stone crushed through a blind,\nwounding Laura's forehead, and so stunning her that she hardly knew what\nfurther transpired during her flight.\n\nIt was long before her faculties were wholly restored, and then she\nfound herself lying on the floor by a sofa in her own sitting-room,\nand alone. So she supposed she must have sat down upon the sofa and\nafterward fallen. She raised herself up, with difficulty, for the air\nwas chilly and her limbs were stiff. She turned up the gas and sought\nthe glass. She hardly knew herself, so worn and old she looked, and so\nmarred with blood were her features. The night was far spent, and a dead\nstillness reigned. She sat down by her table, leaned her elbows upon it\nand put her face in her hands.\n\nHer thoughts wandered back over her old life again and her tears flowed\nunrestrained. Her pride was humbled, her spirit was broken. Her memory\nfound but one resting place; it lingered about her young girlhood with a\ncaressing regret; it dwelt upon it as the one brief interval of her life\nthat bore no curse. She saw herself again in the budding grace of her\ntwelve years, decked in her dainty pride of ribbons, consorting with\nthe bees and the butterflies, believing in fairies, holding confidential\nconverse with the flowers, busying herself all day long with airy\ntrifles that were as weighty to her as the affairs that tax the brains\nof diplomats and emperors. She was without sin, then, and unacquainted\nwith grief; the world was full of sunshine and her heart was full of\nmusic. From that--to this!\n\n\u201cIf I could only die!\u201d she said. \u201cIf I could only go back, and be as I\nwas then, for one hour--and hold my father's hand in mine again, and see\nall the household about me, as in that old innocent time--and then\ndie! My God, I am humbled, my pride is all gone, my stubborn heart\nrepents--have pity!\u201d\n\nWhen the spring morning dawned, the form still sat there, the elbows\nresting upon the table and the face upon the hands. All day long the\nfigure sat there, the sunshine enriching its costly raiment and flashing\nfrom its jewels; twilight came, and presently the stars, but still the\nfigure remained; the moon found it there still, and framed the picture\nwith the shadow of the window sash, and flooded it with mellow light; by\nand by the darkness swallowed it up, and later the gray dawn revealed it\nagain; the new day grew toward its prime, and still the forlorn presence\nwas undisturbed.\n\nBut now the keepers of the house had become uneasy; their periodical\nknockings still finding no response, they burst open the door.\n\nThe jury of inquest found that death had resulted from heart disease,\nand was instant and painless. That was all. Merely heart disease.\n\nCHAPTER LXI.\n\nClay Hawkins, years gone by, had yielded, after many a struggle, to the\nmigratory and speculative instinct of our age and our people, and had\nwandered further and further westward upon trading ventures.\nSettling finally in Melbourne, Australia, he ceased to roam, became a\nsteady-going substantial merchant, and prospered greatly. His life lay\nbeyond the theatre of this tale.\n\nHis remittances had supported the Hawkins family, entirely, from the\ntime of his father's death until latterly when Laura by her efforts in\nWashington had been able to assist in this work. Clay was away on a long\nabsence in some of the eastward islands when Laura's troubles began,\ntrying (and almost in vain,) to arrange certain interests which had\nbecome disordered through a dishonest agent, and consequently he knew\nnothing of the murder till he returned and read his letters and papers.\nHis natural impulse was to hurry to the States and save his sister\nif possible, for he loved her with a deep and abiding affection. His\nbusiness was so crippled now, and so deranged, that to leave it would\nbe ruin; therefore he sold out at a sacrifice that left him considerably\nreduced in worldly possessions, and began his voyage to San Francisco.\nArrived there, he perceived by the newspapers that the trial was near\nits close. At Salt Lake later telegrams told him of the acquittal, and\nhis gratitude was boundless--so boundless, indeed, that sleep was driven\nfrom his eyes by the pleasurable excitement almost as effectually as\npreceding weeks of anxiety had done it. He shaped his course straight\nfor Hawkeye, now, and his meeting with his mother and the rest of the\nhousehold was joyful--albeit he had been away so long that he seemed\nalmost a stranger in his own home.\n\nBut the greetings and congratulations were hardly finished when all the\njournals in the land clamored the news of Laura's miserable death. Mrs.\nHawkins was prostrated by this last blow, and it was well that Clay was\nat her side to stay her with comforting words and take upon himself the\nordering of the household with its burden of labors and cares.\n\nWashington Hawkins had scarcely more than entered upon that decade which\ncarries one to the full blossom of manhood which we term the beginning\nof middle age, and yet a brief sojourn at the capital of the nation had\nmade him old. His hair was already turning gray when the late session\nof Congress began its sittings; it grew grayer still, and rapidly, after\nthe memorable day that saw Laura proclaimed a murderess; it waxed grayer\nand still grayer during the lagging suspense that succeeded it and after\nthe crash which ruined his last hope--the failure of his bill in the\nSenate and the destruction of its champion, Dilworthy. A few days\nlater, when he stood uncovered while the last prayer was pronounced over\nLaura's grave, his hair was whiter and his face hardly less old than the\nvenerable minister's whose words were sounding in his ears.\n\nA week after this, he was sitting in a double-bedded room in a cheap\nboarding house in Washington, with Col. Sellers. The two had been living\ntogether lately, and this mutual cavern of theirs the Colonel\nsometimes referred to as their \u201cpremises\u201d and sometimes as their\n\u201capartments\u201d--more particularly when conversing with persons outside. A\ncanvas-covered modern trunk, marked \u201cG. W. H.\u201d stood on end by the door,\nstrapped and ready for a journey; on it lay a small morocco satchel,\nalso marked \u201cG. W. H.\u201d There was another trunk close by--a worn, and\nscarred, and ancient hair relic, with \u201cB. S.\u201d wrought in brass nails on\nits top; on it lay a pair of saddle-bags that probably knew more about\nthe last century than they could tell. Washington got up and walked the\nfloor a while in a restless sort of way, and finally was about to sit\ndown on the hair trunk.\n\n\u201cStop, don't sit down on that!\u201d exclaimed the Colonel: \u201cThere, now\nthat's all right--the chair's better. I couldn't get another trunk like\nthat--not another like it in America, I reckon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid not,\u201d said Washington, with a faint attempt at a smile.\n\n\u201cNo indeed; the man is dead that made that trunk and that saddle-bags.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre his great-grand-children still living?\u201d said Washington, with\nlevity only in the words, not in the tone.\n\n\u201cWell, I don't know--I hadn't thought of that--but anyway they can't\nmake trunks and saddle-bags like that, if they are--no man can,\u201d said\nthe Colonel with honest simplicity. \u201cWife didn't like to see me going\noff with that trunk--she said it was nearly certain to be stolen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? Why, aren't trunks always being stolen?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes--some kinds of trunks are.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, then; this is some kind of a trunk--and an almighty rare\nkind, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I believe it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, why shouldn't a man want to steal it if he got a chance?\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed I don't know.--Why should he?\u201d\n\n\u201cWashington, I never heard anybody talk like you. Suppose you were a\nthief, and that trunk was lying around and nobody watching--wouldn't you\nsteal it? Come, now, answer fair--wouldn't you steal it?\n\n\u201cWell, now, since you corner me, I would take it,--but I wouldn't\nconsider it stealing.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn't! Well, that beats me. Now what would you call stealing?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, taking property is stealing.\u201d\n\n\u201cProperty! Now what a way to talk that is: What do you suppose that\ntrunk is worth?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it in good repair?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect. Hair rubbed off a little, but the main structure is perfectly\nsound.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it leak anywhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cLeak? Do you want to carry water in it? What do you mean by does it\nleak?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy--a--do the clothes fall out of it when it is--when it is\nstationary?\u201d\n\n\u201cConfound it, Washington, you are trying to make fun of me. I don't know\nwhat has got into you to-day; you act mighty curious. What is the matter\nwith you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I'll tell you, old friend. I am almost happy. I am, indeed. It\nwasn't Clay's telegram that hurried me up so and got me ready to start\nwith you. It was a letter from Louise.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood! What is it? What does she say?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe says come home--her father has consented, at last.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy boy, I want to congratulate you; I want to shake you by the hand!\nIt's a long turn that has no lane at the end of it, as the proverb says,\nor somehow that way. You'll be happy yet, and Beriah Sellers will be\nthere to see, thank God!\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe it. General Boswell is pretty nearly a poor man, now. The\nrailroad that was going to build up Hawkeye made short work of him,\nalong with the rest. He isn't so opposed to a son-in-law without a\nfortune, now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout a fortune, indeed! Why that Tennessee Land--\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind the Tennessee Land, Colonel. I am done with that, forever\nand forever--\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy no! You can't mean to say--\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father, away back yonder, years ago, bought it for a blessing for\nhis children, and--\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed he did! Si Hawkins said to me--\u201d\n\n\u201cIt proved a curse to him as long as he lived, and never a curse like it\nwas inflicted upon any man's heirs--\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm bound to say there's more or less truth--\u201d\n\n\u201cIt began to curse me when I was a baby, and it has cursed every hour of\nmy life to this day--\u201d\n\n\u201cLord, lord, but it's so! Time and again my wife--\u201d\n\n\u201cI depended on it all through my boyhood and never tried to do an honest\nstroke of work for my living--\u201d\n\n\u201cRight again--but then you--\u201d\n\n\u201cI have chased it years and years as children chase butterflies. We\nmight all have been prosperous, now; we might all have been happy, all\nthese heart-breaking years, if we had accepted our poverty at first and\ngone contentedly to work and built up our own wealth by our own toil and\nsweat--\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's so, it's so; bless my soul, how often I've told Si Hawkins--\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of that, we have suffered more than the damned themselves\nsuffer! I loved my father, and I honor his memory and recognize his good\nintentions; but I grieve for his mistaken ideas of conferring happiness\nupon his children. I am going to begin my life over again, and begin\nit and end it with good solid work! I'll leave my children no Tennessee\nLand!\u201d\n\n\u201cSpoken like a man, sir, spoken like a man! Your hand, again my boy! And\nalways remember that when a word of advice from Beriah Sellers can help,\nit is at your service. I'm going to begin again, too!\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir. I've seen enough to show me where my mistake was. The law\nis what I was born for. I shall begin the study of the law. Heavens and\nearth, but that Braham's a wonderful man--a wonderful man sir! Such a\nhead! And such a way with him! But I could see that he was jealous of\nme. The little licks I got in in the course of my argument before the\njury--\u201d\n\n\u201cYour argument! Why, you were a witness.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, to the popular eye, to the popular eye--but I knew when I was\ndropping information and when I was letting drive at the court with an\ninsidious argument. But the court knew it, bless you, and weakened every\ntime! And Braham knew it. I just reminded him of it in a quiet way, and\nits final result, and he said in a whisper, 'You did it, Colonel, you\ndid it, sir--but keep it mum for my sake; and I'll tell you what you\ndo,' says he, 'you go into the law, Col. Sellers--go into the law, sir;\nthat's your native element!' And into the law the subscriber is going.\nThere's worlds of money in it!--whole worlds of money! Practice first in\nHawkeye, then in Jefferson, then in St. Louis, then in New York! In the\nmetropolis of the western world! Climb, and climb, and climb--and wind\nup on the Supreme bench. Beriah Sellers, Chief Justice of the Supreme\nCourt of the United States, sir! A made man for all time and eternity!\nThat's the way I block it out, sir--and it's as clear as day--clear as\nthe rosy-morn!\u201d\n\nWashington had heard little of this. The first reference to Laura's\ntrial had brought the old dejection to his face again, and he stood\ngazing out of the window at nothing, lost in reverie.\n\nThere was a knock-the postman handed in a letter. It was from Obedstown,\nEast Tennessee, and was for Washington. He opened it. There was a note\nsaying that enclosed he would please find a bill for the current year's\ntaxes on the 75,000 acres of Tennessee Land belonging to the estate of\nSilas Hawkins, deceased, and added that the money must be paid within\nsixty days or the land would be sold at public auction for the taxes,\nas provided by law. The bill was for $180--something more than twice the\nmarket value of the land, perhaps.\n\nWashington hesitated. Doubts flitted through his mind. The old instinct\ncame upon him to cling to the land just a little longer and give it\none more chance. He walked the floor feverishly, his mind tortured by\nindecision. Presently he stopped, took out his pocket book and counted\nhis money. Two hundred and thirty dollars--it was all he had in the\nworld.\n\n\u201cOne hundred and eighty . . . . . . . from two hundred and thirty,\u201d he\nsaid to himself. \u201cFifty left . . . . . . It is enough to get me home .\n. . . . . . Shall I do it, or shall I not? . . . . I wish I had somebody\nto decide for me.\u201d\n\nThe pocket book lay open in his hand, with Louise's small letter in\nview. His eye fell upon that, and it decided him.\n\n\u201cIt shall go for taxes,\u201d he said, \u201cand never tempt me or mine any more!\u201d\n\nHe opened the window and stood there tearing the tax bill to bits and\nwatching the breeze waft them away, till all were gone.\n\n\u201cThe spell is broken, the life-long curse is ended!\u201d he said. \u201cLet us\ngo.\u201d\n\nThe baggage wagon had arrived; five minutes later the two friends were\nmounted upon their luggage in it, and rattling off toward the station,\nthe Colonel endeavoring to sing \u201cHomeward Bound,\u201d a song whose words he\nknew, but whose tune, as he rendered it, was a trial to auditors.\n\nCHAPTER LXII.\n\nPhilip Sterling's circumstances were becoming straightened. The prospect\nwas gloomy. His long siege of unproductive labor was beginning to tell\nupon his spirits; but what told still more upon them was the undeniable\nfact that the promise of ultimate success diminished every day, now.\nThat is to say, the tunnel had reached a point in the hill which was\nconsiderably beyond where the coal vein should pass (according to all\nhis calculations) if there were a coal vein there; and so, every foot\nthat the tunnel now progressed seemed to carry it further away from the\nobject of the search.\n\nSometimes he ventured to hope that he had made a mistake in estimating\nthe direction which the vein should naturally take after crossing the\nvalley and entering the hill. Upon such occasions he would go into\nthe nearest mine on the vein he was hunting for, and once more get the\nbearings of the deposit and mark out its probable course; but the result\nwas the same every time; his tunnel had manifestly pierced beyond the\nnatural point of junction; and then his spirits fell a little lower. His\nmen had already lost faith, and he often overheard them saying it was\nperfectly plain that there was no coal in the hill.\n\nForemen and laborers from neighboring mines, and no end of experienced\nloafers from the village, visited the tunnel from time to time, and\ntheir verdicts were always the same and always disheartening--\u201cNo coal\nin that hill.\u201d Now and then Philip would sit down and think it all over\nand wonder what the mystery meant; then he would go into the tunnel and\nask the men if there were no signs yet? None--always \u201cnone.\u201d\n\nHe would bring out a piece of rock and examine it, and say to himself,\n\u201cIt is limestone--it has crinoids and corals in it--the rock is right\u201d\n Then he would throw it down with a sigh, and say, \u201cBut that is nothing;\nwhere coal is, limestone with these fossils in it is pretty certain to\nlie against its foot casing; but it does not necessarily follow that\nwhere this peculiar rock is coal must lie above it or beyond it; this\nsign is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nThe thought usually followed:--\u201cThere is one infallible sign--if I could\nonly strike that!\u201d\n\nThree or four times in as many weeks he said to himself, \u201cAm I a\nvisionary? I must be a visionary; everybody is in these days; everybody\nchases butterflies: everybody seeks sudden fortune and will not lay one\nup by slow toil. This is not right, I will discharge the men and go at\nsome honest work. There is no coal here. What a fool I have been; I will\ngive it up.\u201d\n\nBut he never could do it. A half hour of profound thinking always\nfollowed; and at the end of it he was sure to get up and straighten\nhimself and say: \u201cThere is coal there; I will not give it up; and coal\nor no coal I will drive the tunnel clear through the hill; I will not\nsurrender while I am alive.\u201d\n\nHe never thought of asking Mr. Montague for more money. He said there\nwas now but one chance of finding coal against nine hundred and ninety\nnine that he would not find it, and so it would be wrong in him to make\nthe request and foolish in Mr. Montague to grant it.\n\nHe had been working three shifts of men. Finally, the settling of a\nweekly account exhausted his means. He could not afford to run in debt,\nand therefore he gave the men their discharge. They came into his cabin\npresently, where he sat with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his\nhands--the picture of discouragement and their spokesman said:\n\n\u201cMr. Sterling, when Tim was down a week with his fall you kept him on\nhalf-wages and it was a mighty help to his family; whenever any of us\nwas in trouble you've done what you could to help us out; you've acted\nfair and square with us every time, and I reckon we are men and know a\nman when we see him. We haven't got any faith in that hill, but we have\na respect for a man that's got the pluck that you've showed; you've\nfought a good fight, with everybody agin you and if we had grub to go\non, I'm d----d if we wouldn't stand by you till the cows come home! That\nis what the boys say. Now we want to put in one parting blast for luck.\nWe want to work three days more; if we don't find anything, we won't\nbring in no bill against you. That is what we've come to say.\u201d\n\nPhilip was touched. If he had had money enough to buy three days' \u201cgrub\u201d\n he would have accepted the generous offer, but as it was, he could not\nconsent to be less magnanimous than the men, and so he declined in\na manly speech; shook hands all around and resumed his solitary\ncommunings. The men went back to the tunnel and \u201cput in a parting blast\nfor luck\u201d anyhow. They did a full day's work and then took their leave.\nThey called at his cabin and gave him good-bye, but were not able to\ntell him their day's effort had given things a mere promising look.\n\nThe next day Philip sold all the tools but two or three sets; he also\nsold one of the now deserted cabins as old, lumber, together with its\ndomestic wares; and made up his mind that he would buy provisions with\nthe trifle of money thus gained and continue his work alone. About the\nmiddle of the afternoon he put on his roughest clothes and went to the\ntunnel. He lit a candle and groped his way in. Presently he heard the\nsound of a pick or a drill, and wondered, what it meant. A spark of\nlight now appeared in the far end of the tunnel, and when he arrived\nthere he found the man Tim at work. Tim said:\n\n\u201cI'm to have a job in the Golden Brier mine by and by--in a week or ten\ndays--and I'm going to work here till then. A man might as well be at\nsome thing, and besides I consider that I owe you what you paid me when\nI was laid up.\u201d\n\nPhilip said, Oh, no, he didn't owe anything; but Tim persisted, and\nthen Philip said he had a little provision now, and would share. So for\nseveral days Philip held the drill and Tim did the striking. At first\nPhilip was impatient to see the result of every blast, and was always\nback and peering among the smoke the moment after the explosion. But\nthere was never any encouraging result; and therefore he finally lost\nalmost all interest, and hardly troubled himself to inspect results at\nall. He simply labored on, stubbornly and with little hope.\n\nTim staid with him till the last moment, and then took up his job at\nthe Golden Brier, apparently as depressed by the continued barrenness of\ntheir mutual labors as Philip was himself. After that, Philip fought his\nbattle alone, day after day, and slow work it was; he could scarcely see\nthat he made any progress.\n\nLate one afternoon he finished drilling a hole which he had been at work\nat for more than two hours; he swabbed it out, and poured in the powder\nand inserted the fuse; then filled up the rest of the hole with dirt and\nsmall fragments of stone; tamped it down firmly, touched his candle to\nthe fuse, and ran.\n\nBy and by the dull report came, and he was about to walk back\nmechanically and see what was accomplished; but he halted; presently\nturned on his heel and thought, rather than said:\n\n\u201cNo, this is useless, this is absurd. If I found anything it would only\nbe one of those little aggravating seams of coal which doesn't mean\nanything, and--\u201d\n\nBy this time he was walking out of the tunnel. His thought ran on:\n\n\u201cI am conquered . . . . . . I am out of provisions, out of money. . . .\nI have got to give it up . . . . . . All this hard work lost! But I\nam not conquered! I will go and work for money, and come back and have\nanother fight with fate. Ah me, it may be years, it may, be years.\u201d\n\nArrived at the mouth of the tunnel, he threw his coat upon the ground,\nsat down on a stone, and his eye sought the westering sun and dwelt upon\nthe charming landscape which stretched its woody ridges, wave upon wave,\nto the golden horizon.\n\nSomething was taking place at his feet which did not attract his\nattention.\n\nHis reverie continued, and its burden grew more and more gloomy.\nPresently he rose up and, cast a look far away toward the valley, and\nhis thoughts took a new direction:\n\n\u201cThere it is! How good it looks! But down there is not up here. Well, I\nwill go home and pack up--there is nothing else to do.\u201d\n\nHe moved off moodily toward his cabin. He had gone some distance before\nhe thought of his coat; then he was about to turn back, but he smiled at\nthe thought, and continued his journey--such a coat as that could be of\nlittle use in a civilized land; a little further on, he remembered that\nthere were some papers of value in one of the pockets of the relic, and\nthen with a penitent ejaculation he turned back picked up the coat and\nput it on.\n\nHe made a dozen steps, and then stopped very suddenly. He stood still a\nmoment, as one who is trying to believe something and cannot. He put\na hand up over his shoulder and felt his back, and a great thrill shot\nthrough him. He grasped the skirt of the coat impulsively and another\nthrill followed. He snatched the coat from his back, glanced at it,\nthrew it from him and flew back to the tunnel. He sought the spot where\nthe coat had lain--he had to look close, for the light was waning--then\nto make sure, he put his hand to the ground and a little stream of water\nswept against his fingers:\n\n\u201cThank God, I've struck it at last!\u201d\n\nHe lit a candle and ran into the tunnel; he picked up a piece of rubbish\ncast out by the last blast, and said:\n\n\u201cThis clayey stuff is what I've longed for--I know what is behind it.\u201d\n\nHe swung his pick with hearty good will till long after the darkness had\ngathered upon the earth, and when he trudged home at length he knew he\nhad a coal vein and that it was seven feet thick from wall to wall.\n\nHe found a yellow envelope lying on his rickety table, and recognized\nthat it was of a family sacred to the transmission of telegrams.\n\nHe opened it, read it, crushed it in his hand and threw it down. It\nsimply said:\n\n\u201cRuth is very ill.\u201d\n\nCHAPTER LXIII.\n\nIt was evening when Philip took the cars at the Ilium station. The news\nof his success had preceded him, and while he waited for the train, he\nwas the center of a group of eager questioners, who asked him a hundred\nthings about the mine, and magnified his good fortune. There was no\nmistake this time.\n\nPhilip, in luck, had become suddenly a person of consideration, whose\nspeech was freighted with meaning, whose looks were all significant. The\nwords of the proprietor of a rich coal mine have a golden sound, and his\ncommon sayings are repeated as if they were solid wisdom.\n\nPhilip wished to be alone; his good fortune at this moment seemed an\nempty mockery, one of those sarcasms of fate, such as that which spreads\na dainty banquet for the man who has no appetite. He had longed for\nsuccess principally for Ruth's sake; and perhaps now, at this very\nmoment of his triumph, she was dying.\n\n\u201cShust what I said, Mister Sederling,\u201d the landlord of the Ilium hotel\nkept repeating. \u201cI dold Jake Schmidt he find him dere shust so sure as\nnoting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ought to have taken a share, Mr. Dusenheimer,\u201d said Philip.\n\n\u201cYaas, I know. But d'old woman, she say 'You sticks to your pisiness. So\nI sticks to 'em. Und I makes noting. Dat Mister Prierly, he don't never\ncome back here no more, ain't it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Philip.\n\n\u201cVell, dere is so many peers, and so many oder dhrinks, I got 'em all\nset down, ven he coomes back.\u201d\n\nIt was a long night for Philip, and a restless one. At any other time\nthe swing of the cars would have lulled him to sleep, and the rattle and\nclank of wheels and rails, the roar of the whirling iron would have only\nbeen cheerful reminders of swift and safe travel. Now they were voices\nof warning and taunting; and instead of going rapidly the train seemed\nto crawl at a snail's pace. And it not only crawled, but it frequently\nstopped; and when it stopped it stood dead still and there was an\nominous silence. Was anything the matter, he wondered. Only a station\nprobably. Perhaps, he thought, a telegraphic station. And then he\nlistened eagerly. Would the conductor open the door and ask for Philip\nSterling, and hand him a fatal dispatch?\n\nHow long they seemed to wait. And then slowly beginning to move, they\nwere off again, shaking, pounding, screaming through the night. He drew\nhis curtain from time to time and looked out. There was the lurid sky\nline of the wooded range along the base of which they were crawling.\nThere was the Susquehannah, gleaming in the moon-light. There was a\nstretch of level valley with silent farm houses, the occupants all at\nrest, without trouble, without anxiety. There was a church, a graveyard,\na mill, a village; and now, without pause or fear, the train had mounted\na trestle-work high in air and was creeping along the top of it while a\nswift torrent foamed a hundred feet below.\n\nWhat would the morning bring? Even while he was flying to her, her\ngentle spirit might have gone on another flight, whither he could not\nfollow her. He was full of foreboding. He fell at length into a restless\ndoze. There was a noise in his ears as of a rushing torrent when a\nstream is swollen by a freshet in the spring. It was like the breaking\nup of life; he was struggling in the consciousness of coming death: when\nRuth stood by his side, clothed in white, with a face like that of an\nangel, radiant, smiling, pointing to the sky, and saying, \u201cCome.\u201d He\nawoke with a cry--the train was roaring through a bridge, and it shot\nout into daylight.\n\nWhen morning came the train was industriously toiling along through the\nfat lands of Lancaster, with its broad farms of corn and wheat, its mean\nhouses of stone, its vast barns and granaries, built as if, for storing\nthe riches of Heliogabalus. Then came the smiling fields of Chester,\nwith their English green, and soon the county of Philadelphia itself,\nand the increasing signs of the approach to a great city. Long trains\nof coal cars, laden and unladen, stood upon sidings; the tracks of other\nroads were crossed; the smoke of other locomotives was seen on parallel\nlines; factories multiplied; streets appeared; the noise of a busy\ncity began to fill the air;--and with a slower and slower clank on the\nconnecting rails and interlacing switches the train rolled into the\nstation and stood still.\n\nIt was a hot August morning. The broad streets glowed in the sun, and\nthe white-shuttered houses stared at the hot thoroughfares like closed\nbakers' ovens set along the highway. Philip was oppressed with the heavy\nair; the sweltering city lay as in a swoon. Taking a street car, he rode\naway to the northern part of the city, the newer portion, formerly the\ndistrict of Spring Garden, for in this the Boltons now lived, in a small\nbrick house, befitting their altered fortunes.\n\nHe could scarcely restrain his impatience when he came in sight of the\nhouse. The window shutters were not \u201cbowed\u201d; thank God, for that. Ruth\nwas still living, then. He ran up the steps and rang. Mrs. Bolton met\nhim at the door.\n\n\u201cThee is very welcome, Philip.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Ruth?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is very ill, but quieter than she has been, and the fever is a\nlittle abating. The most dangerous time will be when the fever leaves\nher. The doctor fears she will not have strength enough to rally from\nit. Yes, thee can see her.\u201d\n\nMrs. Bolton led the way to the little chamber where Ruth lay. \u201cOh,\u201d said\nher mother, \u201cif she were only in her cool and spacious room in our old\nhome. She says that seems like heaven.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton sat by Ruth's bedside, and he rose and silently pressed\nPhilip's hand. The room had but one window; that was wide open to admit\nthe air, but the air that came in was hot and lifeless. Upon the table\nstood a vase of flowers. Ruth's eyes were closed; her cheeks were\nflushed with fever, and she moved her head restlessly as if in pain.\n\n\u201cRuth,\u201d said her mother, bending over her, \u201cPhilip is here.\u201d\n\nRuth's eyes unclosed, there was a gleam of recognition in them, there\nwas an attempt at a smile upon her face, and she tried to raise her thin\nhand, as Philip touched her forehead with his lips; and he heard her\nmurmur,\n\n\u201cDear Phil.\u201d\n\nThere was nothing to be done but to watch and wait for the cruel fever\nto burn itself out. Dr. Longstreet told Philip that the fever had\nundoubtedly been contracted in the hospital, but it was not malignant,\nand would be little dangerous if Ruth were not so worn down with work,\nor if she had a less delicate constitution.\n\n\u201cIt is only her indomitable will that has kept her up for weeks. And if\nthat should leave her now, there will be no hope. You can do more for\nher now, sir, than I can?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d asked Philip eagerly.\n\n\u201cYour presence, more than anything else, will inspire her with the\ndesire to live.\u201d\n\nWhen the fever turned, Ruth was in a very critical condition. For two\ndays her life was like the fluttering of a lighted candle in the wind.\nPhilip was constantly by her side, and she seemed to be conscious of\nhis presence, and to cling to him, as one borne away by a swift stream\nclings to a stretched-out hand from the shore. If he was absent a moment\nher restless eyes sought something they were disappointed not to find.\n\nPhilip so yearned to bring her back to life, he willed it so strongly\nand passionately, that his will appeared to affect hers and she seemed\nslowly to draw life from his.\n\nAfter two days of this struggle with the grasping enemy, it was evident\nto Dr. Longstreet that Ruth's will was beginning to issue its orders to\nher body with some force, and that strength was slowly coming back. In\nanother day there was a decided improvement. As Philip sat holding her\nweak hand and watching the least sign of resolution in her face, Ruth\nwas able to whisper,\n\n\u201cI so want to live, for you, Phil!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will; darling, you must,\u201d said Philip in a tone of faith and\ncourage that carried a thrill of determination--of command--along all\nher nerves.\n\nSlowly Philip drew her back to life. Slowly she came back, as one\nwilling but well nigh helpless. It was new for Ruth to feel this\ndependence on another's nature, to consciously draw strength of will\nfrom the will of another. It was a new but a dear joy, to be lifted up\nand carried back into the happy world, which was now all aglow with the\nlight of love; to be lifted and carried by the one she loved more than\nher own life.\n\n\u201cSweetheart,\u201d she said to Philip, \u201cI would not have cared to come back\nbut for thy love.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot for thy profession?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, thee may be glad enough of that some day, when thy coal bed is dug\nout and thee and father are in the air again.\u201d\n\nWhen Ruth was able to ride she was taken into the country, for the pure\nair was necessary to her speedy recovery. The family went with her.\nPhilip could not be spared from her side, and Mr. Bolton had gone up to\nIlium to look into that wonderful coal mine and to make arrangements for\ndeveloping it, and bringing its wealth to market. Philip had insisted on\nre-conveying the Ilium property to Mr. Bolton, retaining only the share\noriginally contemplated for himself, and Mr. Bolton, therefore, once\nmore found himself engaged in business and a person of some consequence\nin Third street. The mine turned out even better than was at first\nhoped, and would, if judiciously managed, be a fortune to them all. This\nalso seemed to be the opinion of Mr. Bigler, who heard of it as soon as\nanybody, and, with the impudence of his class called upon Mr. Bolton for\na little aid in a patent car-wheel he had bought an interest in. That\nrascal, Small, he said, had swindled him out of all he had.\n\nMr. Bolton told him he was very sorry, and recommended him to sue Small.\n\nMr. Small also came with a similar story about Mr. Bigler; and Mr.\nBolton had the grace to give him like advice. And he added, \u201cIf you\nand Bigler will procure the indictment of each other, you may have the\nsatisfaction of putting each other in the penitentiary for the forgery\nof my acceptances.\u201d\n\nBigler and Small did not quarrel however. They both attacked Mr. Bolton\nbehind his back as a swindler, and circulated the story that he had made\na fortune by failing.\n\nIn the pure air of the highlands, amid the golden glories of ripening\nSeptember, Ruth rapidly came back to health. How beautiful the world is\nto an invalid, whose senses are all clarified, who has been so near the\nworld of spirits that she is sensitive to the finest influences, and\nwhose frame responds with a thrill to the subtlest ministrations of\nsoothing nature. Mere life is a luxury, and the color of the grass,\nof the flowers, of the sky, the wind in the trees, the outlines of the\nhorizon, the forms of clouds, all give a pleasure as exquisite as the\nsweetest music to the ear famishing for it. The world was all new and\nfresh to Ruth, as if it had just been created for her, and love filled\nit, till her heart was overflowing with happiness.\n\nIt was golden September also at Fallkill. And Alice sat by the open\nwindow in her room at home, looking out upon the meadows where the\nlaborers were cutting the second crop of clover. The fragrance of it\nfloated to her nostrils. Perhaps she did not mind it. She was thinking.\nShe had just been writing to Ruth, and on the table before her was a\nyellow piece of paper with a faded four-leaved clover pinned on it--only\na memory now. In her letter to Ruth she had poured out her heartiest\nblessings upon them both, with her dear love forever and forever.\n\n\u201cThank God,\u201d she said, \u201cthey will never know\u201d\n\nThey never would know. And the world never knows how many women there\nare like Alice, whose sweet but lonely lives of self-sacrifice, gentle,\nfaithful, loving souls, bless it continually.\n\n\u201cShe is a dear girl,\u201d said Philip, when Ruth showed him the letter.\n\n\u201cYes, Phil, and we can spare a great deal of love for her, our own lives\nare so full.\u201d\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nPerhaps some apology to the reader is necessary in view of our failure\nto find Laura's father. We supposed, from the ease with which lost\npersons are found in novels, that it would not be difficult.

SO THEY HANGED LUIGI\n     FINAL REMARKS.\n\n\n\n\nA man who is not born with the novel-writing gift has a troublesome time\nof it when he tries to build a novel. I know this from experience. He\nhas no clear idea of his story; in fact he has no story. He merely has\nsome people in his mind, and an incident or two, also a locality. He\nknows these people, he knows the selected locality, and he trusts\nthat he can plunge those people into those incidents with interesting\nresults. So he goes to work. To write a novel? No--that is a thought\nwhich comes later; in the beginning he is only proposing to tell a\nlittle tale; a very little tale; a six-page tale. But as it is a tale\nwhich he is not acquainted with, and can only find out what it is by\nlistening as it goes along telling itself, it is more than apt to go\non and on and on till it spreads itself into a book. I know about this,\nbecause it has happened to me so many times.\n\nAnd I have noticed another thing: that as the short tale grows into a\nlong tale, the original intention (or motif) is apt to get abolished and\nfind itself superseded by a quite different one. It was so in the\ncase of a magazine sketch which I once started to write--a funny and\nfantastic sketch about a prince and a pauper; it presently assumed a\ngrave cast of its own accord, and in that new shape spread itself out\ninto a book. Much the same thing happened with Pudd'nhead Wilson. I\nhad a sufficiently hard time with that tale, because it changed itself\nfrom a farce to a tragedy while I was going along with it--a most\nembarrassing circumstance. But what was a great deal worse was, that it\nwas not one story, but two stories tangled together; and they obstructed\nand interrupted each other at every turn and created no end of confusion\nand annoyance. I could not offer the book for publication, for I was\nafraid it would unseat the reader's reason. I did not know what was the\nmatter with it, for I had not noticed, as yet, that it was two stories\nin one. It took me months to make that discovery. I carried the\nmanuscript back and forth across the Atlantic two or three times, and\nread it and studied over it on shipboard; and at last I saw where the\ndifficulty lay. I had no further trouble. I pulled one of the stories\nout by the roots, and left the other one--a kind of literary Caesarean\noperation.\n\nWould the reader care to know something about the story which I pulled\nout? He has been told many a time how the born-and-trained novelist\nworks. Won't he let me round and complete his knowledge by telling him\nhow the jack-leg does it?\n\nOriginally the story was called Those Extraordinary Twins. I meant to\nmake it very short. I had seen a picture of a youthful Italian freak\n or freaks which was--or which were--on exhibition in our cities--a\ncombination consisting of two heads and four arms joined to a single\nbody and a single pair of legs--and I thought I would write an\nextravagantly fantastic little story with this freak of nature for\nhero--or heroes--a silly young miss for heroine, and two old ladies and\ntwo boys for the minor parts. I lavishly elaborated these people\nand their doings, of course. But the tale kept spreading along, and\nspreading along, and other people got to intruding themselves and taking\nup more and more room with their talk and their affairs. Among them\ncame a stranger named Pudd'nhead Wilson, and a woman named Roxana; and\npresently the doings of these two pushed up into prominence a young\nfellow named Tom Driscoll, whose proper place was away in the obscure\nbackground. Before the book was half finished those three were taking\nthings almost entirely into their own hands and working the whole tale\nas a private venture of their own--a tale which they had nothing at all\nto do with, by rights.\n\nWhen the book was finished and I came to look around to see what had\nbecome of the team I had originally started out with--Aunt Patsy Cooper,\nAunt Betsy Hale, the two boys, and Rowena the light-weight heroine--they\nwere nowhere to be seen; they had disappeared from the story some time\nor other. I hunted about and found them--found them stranded, idle,\nforgotten, and permanently useless. It was very awkward. It was awkward\nall around; but more particularly in the case of Rowena, because there\nwas a love-match on, between her and one of the twins that constituted\nthe freak, and I had worked it up to a blistering heat and thrown in\na quite dramatic love-quarrel, wherein Rowena scathingly denounced her\nbetrothed for getting drunk, and scoffed at his explanation of how it\nhad happened, and wouldn't listen to it, and had driven him from her in\nthe usual forever way; and now here she sat crying and broken-hearted;\nfor she had found that he had spoken only the truth; that it was not he,\nbut the other half of the freak, that had drunk the liquor that made him\ndrunk; that her half was a prohibitionist and had never drunk a drop\nin his life, and, although tight as a brick three days in the week, was\nwholly innocent of blame; and indeed, when sober, was constantly doing\nall he could to reform his brother, the other half, who never got any\nsatisfaction out of drinking, anyway, because liquor never affected him.\nYes, here she was, stranded with that deep injustice of hers torturing\nher poor torn heart.\n\nI didn't know what to do with her. I was as sorry for her as anybody\ncould be, but the campaign was over, the book was finished, she was\nsidetracked, and there was no possible way of crowding her in, anywhere.\nI could not leave her there, of course; it would not do. After spreading\nher out so, and making such a to-do over her affairs, it would be\nabsolutely necessary to account to the reader for her. I thought and\nthought and studied and studied; but I arrived at nothing. I finally saw\nplainly that there was really no way but one--I must simply give her the\ngrand bounce. It grieved me to do it, for after associating with her so\nmuch I had come to kind of like her after a fashion, notwithstanding\nshe was such an ass and said such stupid irritating things and was so\nnauseatingly sentimental. Still it had to be done. So, at the top of\nChapter XVII, I put in a Calendar remark concerning July the Fourth,\nand began the chapter with this statistic:\n\nRowena went out in the back yard after supper to see the fireworks and\nfell down the well and got drowned.\n\nIt seemed abrupt, but I thought maybe the reader wouldn't notice it,\nbecause I changed the subject right away to something else. Anyway it\nloosened up Rowena from where she was stuck and got her out of the way,\nand that was the main thing. It seemed a prompt good way of weeding\nout people that had got stalled, and a plenty good enough way for those\nothers; so I hunted up the two boys and said they went out back one\nnight to stone the cat and fell down the well and got drowned. Next\nI searched around and found old Aunt Patsy Cooper and Aunt Betsy Hale\nwhere they were aground, and said they went out back one night to visit\nthe sick and fell down the well and got drowned. I was going to drown\nsome of the others, but I gave up the idea, partly because I believed\nthat if I kept that up it would arouse attention, and perhaps sympathy\nwith those people, and partly because it was not a large well and would\nnot hold any more anyway.\n\nStill the story was unsatisfactory. Here was a set of new characters who\nwere become inordinately prominent and who persisted in remaining so to\nthe end; and back yonder was an older set who made a large noise and a\ngreat to-do for a little while and then suddenly played out utterly and\nfell down the well. There was a radical defect somewhere, and I must\nsearch it out and cure it.\n\nThe defect turned out to be the one already spoken of--two stories\nin one, a farce and a tragedy. So I pulled out the farce and left the\ntragedy. This left the original team in, but only as mere names, not as\ncharacters. Their prominence was wholly gone; they were not even worth\ndrowning; so I removed that detail. Also I took those twins apart and\nmade two separate men of them. They had no occasion to have foreign\nnames now, but it was too much trouble to remove them all through, so I\nleft them christened as they were and made no explanation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. THE TWINS AS THEY REALLY WERE\n\nThe conglomerate twins were brought on the stage in Chapter I of the\noriginal extravaganza. Aunt Patsy Cooper has received their letter\napplying for board and lodging, and Rowena, her daughter, insane with\njoy, is begging for a hearing of it:\n\nWell, set down then, and be quiet a minute and don't fly around so; it\nfairly makes me tired to see you. It starts off so: 'HONORED MADAM'--\n\nI like that, ma, don't you? It shows they're high-bred.\n\nYes, I noticed that when I first read it. 'My brother and I have seen\nyour advertisement, by chance, in a copy of your local journal'\n\nIt's so beautiful and smooth, ma-don't you think so?\n\nYes, seems so to me--'and beg leave to take the room you offer. We are\ntwenty-four years of age, and twins--'\n\nTwins! How sweet! I do hope they are handsome, and I just know they\nare! Don't you hope they are, ma?\n\nLand, I ain't particular. 'We are Italians by birth--'\n\nIt's so romantic! Just think there's never been one in this town, and\neverybody will want to see them, and they're all ours! Think of that!\n\n--'but have lived long in the various countries of Europe, and several\nyears in the United States.'\n\nOh, just think what wonders they've seen, ma! Won't it be good to hear\nthem talk?\n\nI reckon so; yes, I reckon so. 'Our names are Luigi and Angelo\nCapello--'\n\nBeautiful, perfectly beautiful! Not like Jones and Robinson and those\nhorrible names.\n\n'You desire but one guest, but dear madam, if you will allow us to pay\nfor two we will not discommode you. We will sleep together in the same\nbed. We have always been used to this, and prefer it.' And then he goes\non to say they will be down Thursday.\n\nAnd this is Tuesday--I don't know how I'm ever going to wait, ma! The\ntime does drag along so, and I'm so dying to see them! Which of them do\nyou reckon is the tallest, ma?\n\nHow do you s'pose I can tell, child? Mostly they are the same\nsize-twins are.\n\n'Well then, which do you reckon is the best looking?\n\nGoodness knows--I don't.\n\nI think Angelo is; it's the prettiest name, anyway. Don't you think\nit's a sweet name, ma?\n\nYes, it's well enough. I'd like both of them better if I knew the way\nto pronounce them--the Eyetalian way, I mean. The Missouri way and the\nEyetalian way is different, I judge.\n\nMaybe--yes. It's Luigi that writes the letter. What do you reckon is\nthe reason Angelo didn't write it?\n\nWhy, how can I tell? What's the difference who writes it, so long as\nit's done?\n\nOh, I hope it wasn't because he is sick! You don't think he is sick, do\nyou, ma?\n\nSick your granny; what's to make him sick?\n\nOh, there's never any telling. These foreigners with that kind of names\nare so delicate, and of course that kind of names are not suited to our\nclimate--you wouldn't expect it.\n\n[And so-on and so-on, no end. The time drags along; Thursday comes: the\nboat arrives in a pouring storm toward midnight.]\n\nAt last there was a knock at the door and the anxious family jumped to\nopen it. Two negro men entered, each carrying a trunk, and proceeded\nupstairs toward the guest-room. Then followed a stupefying apparition--a\ndouble-headed human creature with four arms, one body, and a single\npair of legs! It--or they, as you please--bowed with elaborate foreign\nformality, but the Coopers could not respond immediately; they were\nparalyzed. At this moment there came from the rear of the group a\nfervent ejaculation--My lan'!--followed by a crash of crockery,\nand the slave-wench Nancy stood petrified and staring, with a tray\nof wrecked tea-things at her feet. The incident broke the spell,\nand brought the family to consciousness. The beautiful heads of the\nnew-comer bowed again, and one of them said with easy grace and dignity:\n\nI crave the honor, madam and miss, to introduce to you my brother,\nCount Luigi Capello, (the other head bowed) and myself--Count Angelo;\nand at the same time offer sincere apologies for the lateness of our\ncoming, which was unavoidable, and both heads bowed again.\n\nThe poor old lady was in a whirl of amazement and confusion, but she\nmanaged to stammer out:\n\nI'm sure I'm glad to make your acquaintance, sir--I mean, gentlemen.\nAs for the delay, it is nothing, don't mention it. This is my daughter\nRowena, sir--gentlemen. Please step into the parlor and sit down\nand have a bite and sup; you are dreadful wet and must be\nuncomfortable--both of you, I mean.\n\nBut to the old lady's relief they courteously excused themselves, saying\nit would be wrong to keep the family out of their beds longer; then each\nhead bowed in turn and uttered a friendly good night, and the singular\nfigure moved away in the wake of Rowena's small brothers, who bore\ncandles, and disappeared up the stairs.\n\nThe widow tottered into the parlor and sank into a chair with a gasp,\nand Rowena followed, tongue-tied and dazed. The two sat silent in the\nthrobbing summer heat unconscious of the million-voiced music of the\nmosquitoes, unconscious of the roaring gale, the lashing and thrashing\nof the rain along the windows and the roof, the white glare of the\nlightning, the tumultuous booming and bellowing of the thunder;\nconscious of nothing but that prodigy, that uncanny apparition that\nhad come and gone so suddenly--that weird strange thing that was so\nsoft-spoken and so gentle of manner and yet had shaken them up like an\nearthquake with the shock of its gruesome aspect. At last a cold little\nshudder quivered along down the widow's meager frame and she said in a\nweak voice:\n\nUgh, it was awful just the mere look of that phillipene!\n\nRowena did not answer. Her faculties were still caked; she had not yet\nfound her voice. Presently the widow said, a little resentfully:\n\nAlways been used to sleeping together--in-fact, prefer it. And I was\nthinking it was to accommodate me. I thought it was very good of them,\nwhereas a person situated as that young man is--\n\nMa, you oughtn't to begin by getting up a prejudice against him. I'm\nsure he is good-hearted and means well. Both of his faces show it.\n\nI'm not so certain about that. The one on the left--I mean the one on\nit's left--hasn't near as good a face, in my opinion, as its brother.\n\nThat's Luigi.\n\nYes, Luigi; anyway it's the dark-skinned one; the one that was west of\nhis brother when they stood in the door. Up to all kinds of mischief\nand disobedience when he was a boy, I'll be bound. I lay his mother had\ntrouble to lay her hand on him when she wanted him. But the one on the\nright is as good as gold, I can see that.\n\nThat's Angelo.\n\nYes, Angelo, I reckon, though I can't tell t'other from which by their\nnames, yet awhile. But it's the right-hand one--the blond one. He has\nsuch kind blue eyes, and curly copper hair and fresh complexion--\n\nAnd such a noble face!--oh, it is a noble face, ma, just royal, you may\nsay! And beautiful deary me, how beautiful! But both are that; the dark\none's as beautiful as--a picture. There's no such wonderful faces\nand handsome heads in this town none that even begin. And such hands,\nespecially Angelo's--so shapely and--\n\nStuff, how could you tell which they belonged to?--they had gloves on.\n\nWhy, didn't I see them take off their hats?\n\nThat don't signify. They might have taken off each other's hats. Nobody\ncould tell. There was just a wormy squirming of arms in the air--seemed\nto be a couple of dozen of them, all writhing at once, and it just made\nme dizzy to see them go.\n\nWhy, ma, I hadn't any difficulty. There's two arms on each shoulder--\n\nThere, now. One arm on each shoulder belongs to each of the creatures,\ndon't it? For a person to have two arms on one shoulder wouldn't do him\nany good, would it? Of course not. Each has an arm on each shoulder. Now\nthen, you tell me which of them belongs to which, if you can. They don't\nknow, themselves--they just work whichever arm comes handy. Of course\nthey do; especially if they are in a hurry and can't stop to think which\nbelongs to which.\n\nThe mother seemed to have the rights of the argument, so the daughter\nabandoned the struggle. Presently the widow rose with a yawn and said:\n\nPoor thing, I hope it won't catch cold; it was powerful wet, just\ndrenched, you may say. I hope it has left its boots outside, so they can\nbe dried.\n\nThen she gave a little start, and looked perplexed.\n\nNow I remember I heard one of them ask Joe to call him at half after\nseven--I think it was the one on the left--no, it was the one to the\neast of the other one--but I didn't hear the other one say any thing.\nI wonder if he wants to be called too. Do you reckon it's too late to\nask?\n\nWhy, ma, it's not necessary. Calling one is calling both. If one gets\nup, the other's got to.\n\nSho, of course; I never thought of that. Well, come along, maybe we can\nget some sleep, but I don't know, I'm so shook up with what we've been\nthrough.\n\nThe stranger had made an impression on the boys, too. They had a word of\ntalk as they were getting to bed. Henry, the gentle, the humane, said:\n\nI feel ever so sorry for it, don't you, Joe?\n\nBut Joe was a boy of this world, active, enterprising, and had a\ntheatrical side to him:\n\nSorry? Why, how you talk! It can't stir a step without attracting\nattention. It's just grand!\n\nHenry said, reproachfully:\n\nInstead of pitying it, Joe, you talk as if--\n\nTalk as if what? I know one thing mighty certain: if you can fix me so\nI can eat for two and only have to stub toes for one, I ain't going to\nfool away no such chance just for sentiment.\n\nThe twins were wet and tired, and they proceeded to undress without any\npreliminary remarks. The abundance of sleeve made the partnership coat\nhard to get off, for it was like skinning a tarantula; but it came at\nlast, after much tugging and perspiring. The mutual vest followed. Then\nthe brothers stood up before the glass, and each took off his own cravat\nand collar. The collars were of the standing kind, and came high up\nunder the ears, like the sides of a wheelbarrow, as required by the\nfashion of the day. The cravats were as broad as a bankbill, with\nfringed ends which stood far out to right and left like the wings of a\ndragon-fly, and this also was strictly in accordance with the fashion of\nthe time. Each cravat, as to color, was in perfect taste, so far as its\nowner's complexion was concerned--a delicate pink, in the case of the\nblond brother, a violent scarlet in the case of the brunette--but as\na combination they broke all the laws of taste known to civilization.\nNothing more fiendish and irreconcilable than those shrieking and\nblaspheming colors could have been contrived. The wet boots gave no\nend of trouble--to Luigi. When they were off at last, Angelo said, with\nbitterness:\n\nI wish you wouldn't wear such tight boots, they hurt my feet.\n\nLuigi answered with indifference:\n\nMy friend, when I am in command of our body, I choose my apparel\naccording to my own convenience, as I have remarked more than several\ntimes already. When you are in command, I beg you will do as you\nplease.\n\nAngelo was hurt, and the tears came into his eyes. There was gentle\nreproach in his voice, but, not anger, when he replied:\n\nLuigi, I often consult your wishes, but you never consult mine. When\nI am in command I treat you as a guest; I try to make you feel at home;\nwhen you are in command you treat me as an intruder, you make me feel\nunwelcome. It embarrasses me cruelly in company, for I can see that\npeople notice it and comment on it.\n\nOh, damn the people, responded the brother languidly, and with the air\nof one who is tired of the subject.\n\nA slight shudder shook the frame of Angelo, but he said nothing and the\nconversation ceased. Each buttoned his own share of the nightshirt in\nsilence; then Luigi, with Paine's Age of Reason in his hand, sat down\nin one chair and put his feet in another and lit his pipe, while Angelo\ntook his Whole Duty of Man, and both began to read. Angelo presently\nbegan to cough; his coughing increased and became mixed with gaspings\nfor breath, and he was finally obliged to make an appeal to his\nbrother's humanity:\n\nLuigi, if you would only smoke a little milder tobacco, I am sure I\ncould learn not to mind it in time, but this is so strong, and the pipe\nis so rank that--\n\nAngelo, I wouldn't be such a baby! I have learned to smoke in a week,\nand the trouble is already over with me; if you would try, you could\nlearn too, and then you would stop spoiling my comfort with your\neverlasting complaints.\n\nAh, brother, that is a strong word--everlasting--and isn't quite fair.\nI only complain when I suffocate; you know I don't complain when we are\nin the open air.\n\nWell, anyway, you could learn to smoke yourself.\n\nBut my principles, Luigi, you forget my principles. You would not have\nme do a thing which I regard as a sin?\n\nOh, bosh!\n\nThe conversation ceased again, for Angelo was sick and discouraged and\nstrangling; but after some time he closed his book and asked Luigi to\nsing From Greenland's Icy Mountains with him, but he would not,\nand when he tried to sing by himself Luigi did his best to drown\nhis plaintive tenor with a rude and rollicking song delivered in a\nthundering bass.\n\nAfter the singing there was silence, and neither brother was happy.\nBefore blowing the light out Luigi swallowed half a tumbler of whisky,\nand Angelo, whose sensitive organization could not endure intoxicants of\nany kind, took a pill to keep it from giving him the headache.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. MA COOPER GETS ALL MIXED UP\n\nThe family sat in the breakfast-room waiting for the twins to come down.\nThe widow was quiet, the daughter was alive with happy excitement. She\nsaid:\n\nAh, they're a boon, ma, just a boon! Don't you think so?\n\nLaws, I hope so, I don't know.\n\nWhy, ma, yes you do. They're so fine and handsome, and high-bred and\npolite, so every way superior to our gawks here in this village;\nwhy, they'll make life different from what it was--so humdrum\nand commonplace, you know--oh, you may be sure they're full of\naccomplishments, and knowledge of the world, and all that, that will be\nan immense advantage to society here. Don't you think so, ma?\n\nMercy on me, how should I know, and I've hardly set eyes on them yet.\n After a pause she added, They made considerable noise after they went\nup.\n\nNoise? Why, ma, they were singing! And it was beautiful, too.\n\nOh, it was well enough, but too mixed-up, seemed to me.\n\nNow, ma, honor bright, did you ever hear 'Greenland's Icy Mountains'\nsung sweeter--now did you?\n\nIf it had been sung by itself, it would have been uncommon sweet, I\ndon't deny it; but what they wanted to mix it up with 'Old Bob Ridley'\nfor, I can't make out. Why, they don't go together, at all. They are not\nof the same nature. 'Bob Ridley' is a common rackety slam-bang secular\nsong, one of the rippingest and rantingest and noisiest there is. I am\nno judge of music, and I don't claim it, but in my opinion nobody can\nmake those two songs go together right.\n\nWhy, ma, I thought--\n\nIt don't make any difference what you thought, it can't be done. They\ntried it, and to my mind it was a failure. I never heard such a crazy\nuproar; seemed to me, sometimes, the roof would come off; and as for the\ncats--well, I've lived a many a year, and seen cats aggravated in more\nways than one, but I've never seen cats take on the way they took on\nlast night.\n\nWell, I don't think that that goes for anything, ma, because it is the\nnature of cats that any sound that is unusual--\n\nUnusual! You may well call it so. Now if they are going to sing duets\nevery night, I do hope they will both sing the same tune at the same\ntime, for in my opinion a duet that is made up of two different tunes is\na mistake; especially when the tunes ain't any kin to one another, that\nway.\n\nBut, ma, I think it must be a foreign custom; and it must be right too;\nand the best way, because they have had every opportunity to know what\nis right, and it don't stand to reason that with their education\nthey would do anything but what the highest musical authorities have\nsanctioned. You can't help but admit that, ma.\n\nThe argument was formidably strong; the old lady could not find any way\naround it; so, after thinking it over awhile she gave in with a sigh\nof discontent, and admitted that the daughter's position was probably\ncorrect. Being vanquished, she had no mind to continue the topic at\nthat disadvantage, and was about to seek a change when a change came of\nitself. A footstep was heard on the stairs, and she said:\n\nThere-he's coming!\n\nThey, ma--you ought to say they--it's nearer right.\n\nThe new lodger, rather shoutingly dressed but looking superbly handsome,\nstepped with courtly carnage into the trim little breakfast-room and put\nout all his cordial arms at once, like one of those pocket-knives with\na multiplicity of blades, and shook hands with the whole family\nsimultaneously. He was so easy and pleasant and hearty that all\nembarrassment presently thawed away and disappeared, and a cheery\nfeeling of friendliness and comradeship took its place. He--or\npreferably they--were asked to occupy the seat of honor at the foot of\nthe table. They consented with thanks, and carved the beefsteak with one\nset of their hands while they distributed it at the same time with the\nother set.\n\nWill you have coffee, gentlemen, or tea?\n\nCoffee for Luigi, if you please, madam, tea for me.\n\nCream and sugar?\n\nFor me, yes, madam; Luigi takes his coffee, black. Our natures differ a\ngood deal from each other, and our tastes also.\n\nThe first time the negro girl Nancy appeared in the door and saw the two\nheads turned in opposite directions and both talking at once, then saw\nthe commingling arms feed potatoes into one mouth and coffee into the\nother at the same time, she had to pause and pull herself out of a\nfaintness that came over her; but after that she held her grip and was\nable to wait on the table with fair courage.\n\nConversation fell naturally into the customary grooves. It was a little\njerky, at first, because none of the family could get smoothly through\na sentence without a wabble in it here and a break there, caused by some\nnew surprise in the way of attitude or gesture on the part of the twins.\nThe weather suffered the most. The weather was all finished up and\ndisposed of, as a subject, before the simple Missourians had gotten\nsufficiently wonted to the spectacle of one body feeding two heads to\nfeel composed and reconciled in the presence of so bizarre a miracle.\nAnd even after everybody's mind became tranquilized there was still one\nslight distraction left: the hand that picked up a biscuit carried it to\nthe wrong head, as often as any other way, and the wrong mouth devoured\nit. This was a puzzling thing, and marred the talk a little. It bothered\nthe widow to such a degree that she presently dropped out of the\nconversation without knowing it, and fell to watching and guessing and\ntalking to herself:\n\nNow that hand is going to take that coffee to--no, it's gone to the\nother mouth; I can't understand it; and Now, here is the dark-complected\nhand with a potato in its fork, I'll see what goes with it--there, the\nlight-complected head's got it, as sure as I live!\n\nFinally Rowena said:\n\nMa, what is the matter with you? Are you dreaming about something?\n\nThe old lady came to herself and blushed; then she explained with the\nfirst random thing that came into her mind: I saw Mr. Angelo take up\nMr. Luigi's coffee, and I thought maybe he--sha'n't I give you a cup,\nMr. Angelo?\n\nOh no, madam, I am very much obliged, but I never drink coffee, much as\nI would like to. You did see me take up Luigi's cup, it is true, but if\nyou noticed, I didn't carry it to my mouth, but to his.\n\nY-es, I thought you did: Did you mean to?\n\nHow?\n\nThe widow was a little embarrassed again. She said:\n\nI don't know but what I'm foolish, and you mustn't mind; but you see,\nhe got the coffee I was expecting to see you drink, and you got a potato\nthat I thought he was going to get. So I thought it might be a mistake\nall around, and everybody getting what wasn't intended for him.\n\nBoth twins laughed and Luigi said:\n\nDear madam, there wasn't any mistake. We are always helping each other\nthat way. It is a great economy for us both; it saves time and labor.\nWe have a system of signs which nobody can notice or understand but\nourselves. If I am using both my hands and want some coffee, I make the\nsign and Angelo furnishes it to me; and you saw that when he needed a\npotato I delivered it.\n\nHow convenient!\n\nYes, and often of the extremest value. Take the Mississippi boats, for\ninstance. They are always overcrowded. There is table-room for only half\nof the passengers, therefore they have to set a second table for the\nsecond half. The stewards rush both parties, they give them no time to\neat a satisfying meal, both divisions leave the table hungry. It isn't\nso with us. Angelo books himself for the one table, I book myself for\nthe other. Neither of us eats anything at the other's table, but just\nsimply works--works. Thus, you see there are four hands to feed Angelo,\nand the same four to feed me. Each of us eats two meals.\n\nThe old lady was dazed with admiration, and kept saying, It is\nperfectly wonderful, perfectly wonderful and the boy Joe licked his\nchops enviously, but said nothing--at least aloud.\n\nYes, continued Luigi, our construction may have its disadvantages--in\nfact, HAS--but it also has its compensations of one sort and another.\nTake travel, for instance. Travel is enormously expensive, in all\ncountries; we have been obliged to do a vast deal of it--come, Angelo,\ndon't put any more sugar in your tea, I'm just over one indigestion and\ndon't want another right away--been obliged to do a deal of it, as I was\nsaying. Well, we always travel as one person, since we occupy but one\nseat; so we save half the fare.\n\nHow romantic! interjected Rowena, with effusion.\n\nYes, my dear young lady, and how practical too, and economical.\nIn Europe, beds in the hotels are not charged with the board, but\nseparately--another saving, for we stood to our rights and paid for the\none bed only. The landlords often insisted that as both of us occupied\nthe bed we ought--\n\nNo, they didn't, said Angelo. They did it only twice, and in both\ncases it was a double bed--a rare thing in Europe--and the double\nbed gave them some excuse. Be fair to the landlords; twice doesn't\nconstitute 'often.'\n\nWell, that depends--that depends. I knew a man who fell down a well\ntwice. He said he didn't mind the first time, but he thought the second\ntime was once too often. Have I misused that word, Mrs. Cooper?\n\nTo tell the truth, I was afraid you had, but it seems to look, now,\nlike you hadn't. She stopped, and was evidently struggling with the\ndifficult problem a moment, then she added in the tone of one who is\nconvinced without being converted, It seems so, but I can't somehow\ntell why.\n\nRowena thought Luigi's retort was wonderfully quick and bright, and she\nremarked to herself with satisfaction that there wasn't any young native\nof Dawson's Landing that could have risen to the occasion like that.\nLuigi detected the applause in her face, and expressed his pleasure and\nhis thanks with his eyes; and so eloquently withal, that the girl was\nproud and pleased, and hung out the delicate sign of it on her cheeks.\nLuigi went on, with animation:\n\nBoth of us get a bath for one ticket, theater seat for one ticket,\npew-rent is on the same basis, but at peep-shows we pay double.\n\nWe have much to be thankful for, said Angelo, impressively, with a\nreverent light in his eye and a reminiscent tone in his voice, we have\nbeen greatly blessed. As a rule, what one of us has lacked, the other,\nby the bounty of Providence, has been able to supply. My brother is\nhardy, I am not; he is very masculine, assertive, aggressive; I am\nmuch less so. I am subject to illness, he is never ill. I cannot abide\nmedicines, and cannot take them, but he has no prejudice against them,\nand--\n\nWhy, goodness gracious, interrupted the widow, when you are sick,\ndoes he take the medicine for you?\n\nAlways, madam.\n\nWhy, I never heard such a thing in my life! I think it's beautiful of\nyou.\n\nOh, madam, it's nothing, don't mention it, it's really nothing at all.\n\nBut I say it's beautiful, and I stick to it! cried the widow, with a\nspeaking moisture in her eye.\n\nA well brother to take the medicine for his poor sick brother--I wish\nI had such a son, and she glanced reproachfully at her boys. I declare\nI'll never rest till I've shook you by the hand, and she scrambled out\nof her chair in a fever of generous enthusiasm, and made for the twins,\nblind with her tears, and began to shake. The boy Joe corrected her:\nYou're shaking the wrong one, ma.\n\nThis flurried her, but she made a swift change and went on shaking.\n\nGot the wrong one again, ma, said the boy.\n\nOh, shut up, can't you! said the widow, embarrassed and irritated.\nGive me all your hands, I want to shake them all; for I know you are\nboth just as good as you can be.\n\nIt was a victorious thought, a master-stroke of diplomacy, though that\nnever occurred to her and she cared nothing for diplomacy. She shook the\nfour hands in turn cordially, and went back to her place in a state of\nhigh and fine exultation that made her look young and handsome.\n\nIndeed I owe everything to Luigi, said Angelo, affectionately.\nBut for him I could not have survived our boyhood days, when we were\nfriendless and poor--ah, so poor! We lived from hand to mouth-lived on\nthe coarse fare of unwilling charity, and for weeks and weeks together\nnot a morsel of food passed my lips, for its character revolted me and I\ncould not eat it. But for Luigi I should have died. He ate for us both.\n\nHow noble! sighed Rowena.\n\nDo you hear that? said the widow, severely, to her boys. Let it be an\nexample to you--I mean you, Joe.\n\nJoe gave his head a barely perceptible disparaging toss and said: Et\nfor both. It ain't anything I'd 'a' done it.\n\nHush, if you haven't got any better manners than that. You don't see\nthe point at all. It wasn't good food.\n\nI don't care--it was food, and I'd 'a' et it if it was rotten.\n\nShame! Such language! Can't you understand? They were\nstarving--actually starving--and he ate for both, and--\n\nShucks! you gimme a chance and I'll--\n\nThere, now--close your head! and don't you open it again till you're\nasked.\n\n     [Angelo goes on and tells how his parents the Count and Countess had\n     to fly from Florence for political reasons, and died poor in Berlin\n     bereft of their great property by confiscation; and how he and Luigi\n     had to travel with a freak-show during two years and suffer\n     semi-starvation.]\n\nThat hateful black-bread; but I seldom ate anything during that time;\nthat was poor Luigi's affair--\n\nI'll never Mister him again! cried the widow, with strong emotion,\nhe's Luigi to me, from this out!\n\nThank you a thousand times, madam, a thousand times! though in truth I\ndon't deserve it.\n\nAh, Luigi is always the fortunate one when honors are showering, said\nAngelo, plaintively; now what have I done, Mrs. Cooper, that you leave\nme out? Come, you must strain a point in my favor.\n\nCall you Angelo? Why, certainly I will; what are you thinking of! In\nthe case of twins, why--\n\nBut, ma, you're breaking up the story--do let him go on.\n\nYou keep still, Rowena Cooper, and he can go on all the better, I\nreckon. One interruption don't hurt, it's two that makes the trouble.\n\nBut you've added one, now, and that is three.\n\nRowena! I will not allow you to talk back at me when you have got\nnothing rational to say.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. ANGELO IS BLUE\n\n[After breakfast the whole village crowded in, and there was a grand\nreception in honor of the twins; and at the close of it the gifted\nfreak captured everybody's admiration by sitting down at the piano and\nknocking out a classic four-handed piece in great style. Then the judge\ntook it--or them--driving in his buggy and showed off his village.]\n\nAll along the streets the people crowded the windows and stared at the\namazing twins. Troops of small boys flocked after the buggy, excited and\nyelling. At first the dogs showed no interest. They thought they merely\nsaw three men in a buggy--a matter of no consequence; but when they\nfound out the facts of the case, they altered their opinion pretty\nradically, and joined the boys, expressing their minds as they came.\nOther dogs got interested; indeed, all the dogs. It was a spirited sight\nto see them come leaping fences, tearing around corners, swarming out\nof every bystreet and alley. The noise they made was something beyond\nbelief--or praise. They did not seem to be moved by malice but only by\nprejudice, the common human prejudice against lack of conformity. If the\ntwins turned their heads, they broke and fled in every direction, but\nstopped at a safe distance and faced about; and then formed and came\non again as soon as the strangers showed them their back. Negroes and\nfarmers' wives took to the woods when the buggy came upon them suddenly,\nand altogether the drive was pleasant and animated, and a refreshment\nall around.\n\n     [It was a long and lively drive.  Angelo was a Methodist, Luigi was\n     a Free-thinker.  The judge was very proud of his Freethinkers'\n     Society, which was flourishing along in a most prosperous way and\n     already had two members--himself and the obscure and neglected\n     Pudd'nhead Wilson.  It was to meet that evening, and he invited\n     Luigi to join; a thing which Luigi was glad to do, partly because it\n     would please himself, and partly because it would gravel Angelo.]\n\nThey had now arrived at the widow's gate, and the excursion was ended.\nThe twins politely expressed their obligations for the pleasant outing\nwhich had been afforded them; to which the judge bowed his thanks, and\nthen said he would now go and arrange for the Free-thinkers' meeting,\nand would call for Count Luigi in the evening.\n\nFor you also, dear sir, he added hastily, turning to Angelo and\nbowing. In addressing myself particularly to your brother, I was not\nmeaning to leave you out. It was an unintentional rudeness, I assure\nyou, and due wholly to accident--accident and preoccupation. I beg you\nto forgive me.\n\nHis quick eye had seen the sensitive blood mount into Angelo's face,\nbetraying the wound that had been inflicted. The sting of the slight had\ngone deep, but the apology was so prompt, and so evidently sincere, that\nthe hurt was almost immediately healed, and a forgiving smile testified\nto the kindly judge that all was well again.\n\nConcealed behind Angelo's modest and unassuming exterior, and\nunsuspected by any but his intimates, was a lofty pride, a pride of\nalmost abnormal proportions, indeed, and this rendered him ever the prey\nof slights; and although they were almost always imaginary ones, they\nhurt none the less on that account. By ill fortune judge Driscoll\nhad happened to touch his sorest point, i.e., his conviction that his\nbrother's presence was welcomer everywhere than his own; that he was\noften invited, out of mere courtesy, where only his brother was\nwanted, and that in a majority of cases he would not be included in an\ninvitation if he could be left out without offense. A sensitive nature\nlike this is necessarily subject to moods; moods which traverse the\nwhole gamut of feeling; moods which know all the climes of emotion, from\nthe sunny heights of joy to the black abysses of despair. At times, in\nhis seasons of deepest depressions, Angelo almost wished that he and\nhis brother might become segregated from each other and be separate\nindividuals, like other men. But of course as soon as his mind cleared\nand these diseased imaginings passed away, he shuddered at the repulsive\nthought, and earnestly prayed that it might visit him no more. To\nbe separate, and as other men are! How awkward it would seem; how\nunendurable. What would he do with his hands, his arms? How would his\nlegs feel? How odd, and strange, and grotesque every action, attitude,\nmovement, gesture would be. To sleep by himself, eat by himself, walk by\nhimself--how lonely, how unspeakably lonely! No, no, any fate but that.\nIn every way and from every point, the idea was revolting.\n\nThis was of course natural; to have felt otherwise would have been\nunnatural. He had known no life but a combined one; he had been familiar\nwith it from his birth; he was not able to conceive of any other as\nbeing agreeable, or even bearable. To him, in the privacy of his\nsecret thoughts, all other men were monsters, deformities: and during\nthree-fourths of his life their aspect had filled him with what promised\nto be an unconquerable aversion. But at eighteen his eye began to take\nnote of female beauty; and little by little, undefined longings grew up\nin his heart, under whose softening influences the old stubborn\naversion gradually diminished, and finally disappeared. Men were still\nmonstrosities to him, still deformities, and in his sober moments he had\nno desire to be like them, but their strange and unsocial and uncanny\nconstruction was no longer offensive to him.\n\nThis had been a hard day for him, physically and mentally. He had been\ncalled in the morning before he had quite slept off the effects of the\nliquor which Luigi had drunk; and so, for the first half-hour had had\nthe seedy feeling, and languor, the brooding depression, the cobwebby\nmouth and druggy taste that come of dissipation and are so ill a\npreparation for bodily or intellectual activities; the long violent\nstrain of the reception had followed; and this had been followed, in\nturn, by the dreary sight-seeing, the judge's wearying explanations and\nlaudations of the sights, and the stupefying clamor of the dogs. As\na congruous conclusion, a fitting end, his feelings had been hurt, a\nslight had been put upon him. He would have been glad to forego dinner\nand betake himself to rest and sleep, but he held his peace and said no\nword, for he knew his brother, Luigi, was fresh, unweary, full of life,\nspirit, energy; he would have scoffed at the idea of wasting valuable\ntime on a bed or a sofa, and would have refused permission.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. SUPERNATURAL CHRONOMETRY\n\nRowena was dining out, Joe and Harry were belated at play, there\nwere but three chairs and four persons that noon at the home\ndinner-table--the twins, the widow, and her chum, Aunt Betsy Hale. The\nwidow soon perceived that Angelo's spirits were as low as Luigi's were\nhigh, and also that he had a jaded look. Her motherly solicitude was\naroused, and she tried to get him interested in the talk and win him\nto a happier frame of mind, but the cloud of sadness remained on his\ncountenance. Luigi lent his help, too. He used a form and a phrase which\nhe was always accustomed to employ in these circumstances. He gave his\nbrother an affectionate slap on the shoulder and said, encouragingly:\n\nCheer up, the worst is yet to come!\n\nBut this did no good. It never did. If anything, it made the matter\nworse, as a rule, because it irritated Angelo. This made it a favorite\nwith Luigi. By and by the widow said:\n\nAngelo, you are tired, you've overdone yourself; you go right to bed\nafter dinner, and get a good nap and a rest, then you'll be all right.\n\nIndeed, I would give anything if I could do that, madam.\n\nAnd what's to hender, I'd like to know? Land, the room's yours to do\nwhat you please with! The idea that you can't do what you like with your\nown!\n\nBut, you see, there's one prime essential--an essential of the very\nfirst importance--which isn't my own.\n\nWhat is that?\n\nMy body.\n\nThe old ladies looked puzzled, and Aunt Betsy Hale said:\n\nWhy bless your heart, how is that?\n\nIt's my brother's.\n\nYour brother's! I don't quite understand. I supposed it belonged to\nboth of you.\n\nSo it does. But not to both at the same time.\n\nThat is mighty curious; I don't see how it can be. I shouldn't think it\ncould be managed that way.\n\nOh, it's a good enough arrangement, and goes very well; in fact, it\nwouldn't do to have it otherwise. I find that the teetotalers and the\nanti-teetotalers hire the use of the same hall for their meetings. Both\nparties don't use it at the same time, do they?\n\nYou bet they don't! said both old ladies in a breath.\n\nAnd, moreover, said Aunt Betsy, the Freethinkers and the Baptist\nBible class use the same room over the Market house, but you can take my\nword for it they don't mush up together and use it at the same time.'\n\nVery well, said Angelo, you understand it now. And it stands to\nreason that the arrangement couldn't be improved. I'll prove it to you.\nIf our legs tried to obey two wills, how could we ever get anywhere? I\nwould start one way, Luigi would start another, at the same moment--the\nresult would be a standstill, wouldn't it?\n\nAs sure as you are born! Now ain't that wonderful! A body would never\nhave thought of it.\n\nWe should always be arguing and fussing and disputing over the merest\ntrifles. We should lose worlds of time, for we couldn't go down-stairs\nor up, couldn't go to bed, couldn't rise, couldn't wash, couldn't dress,\ncouldn't stand up, couldn't sit down, couldn't even cross our legs,\nwithout calling a meeting first and explaining the case and passing\nresolutions, and getting consent. It wouldn't ever do--now would it?\n\nDo? Why, it would wear a person out in a week! Did you ever hear\nanything like it, Patsy Cooper?\n\nOh, you'll find there's more than one thing about them that ain't\ncommonplace, said the widow, with the complacent air of a person with a\nproperty right in a novelty that is under admiring scrutiny.\n\nWell, now, how ever do you manage it? I don't mind saying I'm suffering\nto know.\n\nHe who made us, said Angelo reverently, and with us this difficulty,\nalso provided a way out of it. By a mysterious law of our being, each of\nus has utter and indisputable command of our body a week at a time, turn\nand turn about.\n\nWell, I never! Now ain't that beautiful!\n\nYes, it is beautiful and infinitely wise and just. The week ends every\nSaturday at midnight to the minute, to the second, to the last shade of\na fraction of a second, infallibly, unerringly, and in that instant the\none brother's power over the body vanishes and the other brother takes\npossession, asleep or awake.\n\nHow marvelous are His ways, and past finding out!\n\nLuigi said: So exactly to the instant does the change come, that during\nour stay in many of the great cities of the world, the public clocks\nwere regulated by it; and as hundreds of thousands of private clocks and\nwatches were set and corrected in accordance with the public clocks, we\nreally furnished the standard time for the entire city.\n\nDon't tell me that He don't do miracles any more! Blowing down the\nwalls of Jericho with rams' horns wa'n't as difficult, in my opinion.\n\nAnd that is not all, said Angelo. A thing that is even more\nmarvelous, perhaps, is the fact that the change takes note of longitude\nand fits itself to the meridian we are on. Luigi is in command this\nweek. Now, if on Saturday night at a moment before midnight we could\nfly in an instant to a point fifteen degrees west of here, he would hold\npossession of the power another hour, for the change observes local time\nand no other.\n\nBetsy Hale was deeply impressed, and said with solemnity:\n\nPatsy Cooper, for detail it lays over the Passage of the Red Sea.\n\nNow, I shouldn't go as far as that, said Aunt Patsy, but if you've a\nmind to say Sodom and Gomorrah, I am with you, Betsy Hale.\n\nI am agreeable, then, though I do think I was right, and I believe\nParson Maltby would say the same. Well, now, there's another thing.\nSuppose one of you wants to borrow the legs a minute from the one that's\ngot them, could he let him?\n\nYes, but we hardly ever do that. There were disagreeable results,\nseveral times, and so we very seldom ask or grant the privilege,\nnowadays, and we never even think of such a thing unless the case is\nextremely urgent. Besides, a week's possession at a time seems so little\nthat we can't bear to spare a minute of it. People who have the use of\ntheir legs all the time never think of what a blessing it is, of course.\nIt never occurs to them; it's just their natural ordinary condition,\nand so it does not excite them at all. But when I wake up, on Sunday\nmorning, and it's my week and I feel the power all through me, oh, such\na wave of exultation and thanksgiving goes surging over me, and I want\nto shout 'I can walk! I can walk!' Madam, do you ever, at your uprising,\nwant to shout 'I can walk! I can walk!'?\n\nNo, you poor unfortunate cretur', but I'll never get out of my bed\nagain without doing it! Laws, to think I've had this unspeakable\nblessing all my long life and never had the grace to thank the good Lord\nthat gave it to me!\n\nTears stood in the eyes of both the old ladies and the widow said,\nsoftly:\n\nBetsy Hale, we have learned something, you and me.\n\nThe conversation now drifted wide, but by and by floated back once more\nto that admired detail, the rigid and beautiful impartiality with which\nthe possession of power had been distributed, between the twins. Aunt\nBetsy saw in it a far finer justice than human law exhibits in related\ncases. She said:\n\nIn my opinion it ain't right noW, and never has been right, the way a\ntwin born a quarter of a minute sooner than the other one gets all the\nland and grandeurs and nobilities in the old countries and his brother\nhas to go bare and be a nobody. Which of you was born first?\n\nAngelo's head was resting against Luigi's; weariness had overcome him,\nand for the past five minutes he had been peacefully sleeping. The old\nladies had dropped their voices to a lulling drone, to help him to steal\nthe rest his brother wouldn't take him up-stairs to get. Luigi listened\na moment to Angelo's regular breathing, then said in a voice barely\naudible:\n\nWe were both born at the same time, but I am six months older than he\nis.\n\nFor the land's sake!\n\n'Sh! don't wake him up; he wouldn't like my telling this. It has always\nbeen kept secret till now.\n\nBut how in the world can it be? If you were both born at the same time,\nhow can one of you be older than the other?\n\nIt is very simple, and I assure you it is true. I was born with a full\ncrop of hair, he was as bald as an egg for six months. I could walk six\nmonths before he could make a step. I finished teething six months ahead\nof him. I began to take solids six months before he left the breast.\nI began to talk six months before he could say a word. Last, and\nabsolutely unassailable proof, the sutures in my skull closed six months\nahead of his. Always just that six months' difference to a day. Was that\naccident? Nobody is going to claim that, I'm sure. It was ordained--it\nwas law--it had its meaning, and we know what that meaning was. Now what\ndoes this overwhelming body of evidence establish? It establishes\njust one thing, and that thing it establishes beyond any peradventure\nwhatever. Friends, we would not have it known for the world, and I must\nbeg you to keep it strictly to yourselves, but the truth is, we are no\nmore twins than you are.\n\nThe two old ladies were stunned, paralyzed--petrified, one may almost\nsay--and could only sit and gaze vacantly at each other for some\nmoments; then Aunt Betsy Hale said impressively:\n\nThere's no getting around proof like that. I do believe it's the most\namazing thing I ever heard of. She sat silent a moment or two and\nbreathing hard with excitement, then she looked up and surveyed the\nstrangers steadfastly a little while, and added: Well, it does beat me,\nbut I would have took you for twins anywhere.\n\nSo would I, so would I, said Aunt Patsy with the emphasis of a\ncertainty that is not impaired by any shade of doubt.\n\nAnybody would-anybody in the world, I don't care who he is, said Aunt\nBetsy with decision.\n\nYou won't tell, said Luigi, appealingly.\n\nOh, dear, no! answered both ladies promptly, you can trust us, don't\nyou be afraid.\n\nThat is good of you, and kind. Never let on; treat us always as if we\nwere twins.\n\nYou can depend on us, said Aunt Betsy, but it won't be easy, because\nnow that I know you ain't you don't seem so.\n\nLuigi muttered to himself with satisfaction: That swindle has gone\nthrough without change of cars.\n\nIt was not very kind of him to load the poor things up with a secret\nlike that, which would be always flying to their tongues' ends every\ntime they heard any one speak of the strangers as twins, and would\nbecome harder and harder to hang on to with every recurrence of the\ntemptation to tell it, while the torture of retaining it would increase\nwith every new strain that was applied; but he never thought of that,\nand probably would not have worried much about it if he had.\n\nA visitor was announced--some one to see the twins. They withdrew to\nthe parlor, and the two old ladies began to discuss with interest the\nstrange things which they had been listening to. When they had finished\nthe matter to their satisfaction, and Aunt Betsy rose to go, she stopped\nto ask a question:\n\nHow does things come on between Roweny and Tom Driscoll?\n\nWell, about the same. He writes tolerable often, and she answers\ntolerable seldom.\n\nWhere is he?\n\nIn St. Louis, I believe, though he's such a gadabout that a body can't\nbe very certain of him, I reckon.\n\nDon't Roweny know?\n\nOh, yes, like enough. I haven't asked her lately.\n\nDo you know how him and the judge are getting along now?\n\nFirst rate, I believe. Mrs. Pratt says so; and being right in the\nhouse, and sister to the one and aunt to t'other, of course she ought to\nknow. She says the judge is real fond of him when he's away; but frets\nwhen he's around and is vexed with his ways, and not sorry to have him\ngo again. He has been gone three weeks this time--a pleasant thing for\nboth of them, I reckon.\n\nTom's rather harum-scarum, but there ain't anything bad in him, I\nguess.\n\nOh, no, he's just young, that's all. Still, twenty-three is old, in\none way. A young man ought to be earning his living by that time. If Tom\nwere doing that, or was even trying to do it, the judge would be a heap\nbetter satisfied with him. Tom's always going to begin, but somehow he\ncan't seem to find just the opening he likes.\n\nWell, now, it's partly the judge's own fault. Promising the boy his\nproperty wasn't the way to set him to earning a fortune of his own. But\nwhat do you think--is Roweny beginning to lean any toward him, or ain't\nshe?\n\nAunt Patsy had a secret in her bosom; she wanted to keep it there, but\nnature was too strong for her. She drew Aunt Betsy aside, and said in\nher most confidential and mysterious manner:\n\nDon't you breathe a syllable to a soul--I'm going to tell you\nsomething. In my opinion Tom Driscoll's chances were considerable better\nyesterday than they are to-day.\n\nPatsy Cooper, what do you mean?\n\nIt's so, as sure as you're born. I wish you could 'a' been at breakfast\nand seen for yourself.\n\nYou don't mean it!\n\nWell, if I'm any judge, there's a leaning--there's a leaning, sure.\n\nMy land! Which one of 'em is it?\n\nI can't say for certain, but I think it's the youngest one--Anjy.\n\nThen there were hand-shakings, and congratulations, and hopes, and\nso on, and the old ladies parted, perfectly happy--the one in knowing\nsomething which the rest of the town didn't, and the other in having\nbeen the sole person able to furnish that knowledge.\n\nThe visitor who had called to see the twins was the Rev. Mr. Hotchkiss,\npastor of the Baptist church. At the reception Angelo had told him he\nhad lately experienced a change in his religious views, and was\nnow desirous of becoming a Baptist, and would immediately join Mr.\nHotchkiss's church. There was no time to say more, and the brief talk\nended at that point. The minister was much gratified, and had dropped in\nfor a moment now, to invite the twins to attend his Bible class at eight\nthat evening. Angelo accepted, and was expecting Luigi to decline, but\nhe did not, because he knew that the Bible class and the Freethinkers\nmet in the same room, and he wanted to treat his brother to the\nembarrassment of being caught in free-thinking company.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. GUILT AND INNOCENCE FINELY BLENT\n\n[A long and vigorous quarrel follows, between the twins. And there is\nplenty to quarrel about, for Angelo was always seeking truth, and this\nobliged him to change and improve his religion with frequency, which\nwearied Luigi, and annoyed him too; for he had to be present at each new\nenlistment--which placed him in the false position of seeming to indorse\nand approve his brother's fickleness; moreover, he had to go to Angelo's\nprohibition meetings, and he hated them. On the other hand, when it was\nhis week to command the legs he gave Angelo just cause of complaint, for\nhe took him to circuses and horse-races and fandangoes, exposing him to\nall sorts of censure and criticism; and he drank, too; and whatever\nhe drank went to Angelo's head instead of his own and made him\nact disgracefully. When the evening was come, the two attended the\nFree-thinkers' meeting, where Angelo was sad and silent; then came the\nBible class and looked upon him coldly, finding him in such company.\nThen they went to Wilson's house and Chapter XI of Pudd'nhead Wilson\nfollows, which tells of the girl seen in Tom Driscoll's room; and closes\nwith the kicking of Tom by Luigi at the anti-temperance mass-meeting\nof the Sons of Liberty; with the addition of some account of Roxy's\nadventures as a chamber-maid on a Mississippi boat. Her exchange of\nthe children had been flippantly and farcically described in an earlier\nchapter.]\n\nNext morning all the town was a-buzz with great news; Pudd'nhead Wilson\nhad a law case! The public astonishment was so great and the public\ncuriosity so intense, that when the justice of the peace opened his\ncourt, the place was packed with people and even the windows were\nfull. Everybody was flushed and perspiring; the summer heat was almost\nunendurable.\n\nTom Driscoll had brought a charge of assault and battery against the\ntwins. Robert Allen was retained by Driscoll, David Wilson by the\ndefense. Tom, his native cheerfulness unannihilated by his back-breaking\nand bone-bruising passage across the massed heads of the Sons of Liberty\nthe previous night, laughed his little customary laugh, and said to\nWilson:\n\nI've kept my promise, you see; I'm throwing my business your way.\nSooner than I was expecting, too.\n\nIt's very good of you--particularly if you mean to keep it up.\n\nWell, I can't tell about that yet. But we'll see. If I find you deserve\nit I'll take you under my protection and make your fame and fortune for\nyou.\n\nI'll try to deserve it, Tom.\n\nA jury was sworn in; then Mr. Allen said:\n\nWe will detain your honor but a moment with this case. It is not\none where any doubt of the fact of the assault can enter in. These\ngentlemen--the accused--kicked my client at the Market Hall last night;\nthey kicked him with violence; with extraordinary violence; with even\nunprecedented violence, I may say; insomuch that he was lifted entirely\noff his feet and discharged into the midst of the audience. We can prove\nthis by four hundred witnesses--we shall call but three. Mr. Harkness\nwill take the stand.\n\nMr. Harkness, being sworn, testified that he was chairman upon the\noccasion mentioned; that he was close at hand and saw the defendants in\nthis action kick the plaintiff into the air and saw him descend among\nthe audience.\n\nTake the witness, said Allen.\n\nMr. Harkness, said Wilson, you say you saw these gentlemen, my\nclients, kick the plaintiff. Are you sure--and please remember that you\nare on oath--are you perfectly sure that you saw both of them kick him,\nor only one? Now be careful.\n\nA bewildered look began to spread itself over the witness's face. He\nhesitated, stammered, but got out nothing. His eyes wandered to the\ntwins and fixed themselves there with a vacant gaze.\n\nPlease answer, Mr. Harkness, you are keeping the court waiting. It is a\nvery simple question.\n\nCounsel for the prosecution broke in with impatience:\n\nYour honor, the question is an irrelevant triviality. Necessarily, they\nboth kicked him, for they have but the one pair of legs, and both are\nresponsible for them.\n\nWilson said, sarcastically:\n\nWill your honor permit this new witness to be sworn? He seems to\npossess knowledge which can be of the utmost value just at this\nmoment--knowledge which would at once dispose of what every one must see\nis a very difficult question in this case. Brother Allen, will you take\nthe stand?\n\nGo on with your case! said Allen, petulantly. The audience laughed,\nand got a warning from the court.\n\nNow, Mr. Harkness, said Wilson, insinuatingly, we shall have to\ninsist upon an answer to that question.\n\nI--er--well, of course, I do not absolutely know, but in my opinion--\n\nNever mind your opinion, sir--answer the question.\n\nI--why, I can't answer it.\n\nThat will do, Mr. Harkness. Stand down.\n\nThe audience tittered, and the discomfited witness retired in a state of\ngreat embarrassment.\n\nMr. Wakeman took the stand and swore that he saw the twins kick the\nplaintiff off the platform.\n\nThe defense took the witness.\n\nMr. Wakeman, you have sworn that you saw these gentlemen kick the\nplaintiff. Do I understand you to swear that you saw them both do it?\n\nYes, sir,--with decision.\n\nHow do you know that both did it?\n\nBecause I saw them do it.\n\nThe audience laughed, and got another warning from the court.\n\nBut by what means do you know that both, and not one, did it?\n\nWell, in the first place, the insult was given to both of them equally,\nfor they were called a pair of scissors. Of course they would both want\nto resent it, and so--\n\nWait! You are theorizing now. Stick to facts--counsel will attend to\nthe arguments. Go on.\n\nWell, they both went over there--that I saw.\n\nVery good. Go on.\n\nAnd they both kicked him--I swear to it.\n\nMr. Wakeman, was Count Luigi, here, willing to join the Sons of Liberty\nlast night?\n\nYes, sir, he was. He did join, too, and drank a glass or two of whisky,\nlike a man.\n\nWas his brother willing to join?\n\nNo, sir, he wasn't. He is a teetotaler, and was elected through a\nmistake.\n\nWas he given a glass of whisky?\n\nYes, sir, but of course that was another mistake, and not intentional.\nHe wouldn't drink it. He set it down. A slight pause, then he added,\ncasually and quite simply: The plaintiff reached for it and hogged it.\n\nThere was a fine outburst of laughter, but as the justice was caught out\nhimself, his reprimand was not very vigorous.\n\nMr. Allen jumped up and exclaimed: I protest against these foolish\nirrelevancies. What have they to do with the case?\n\nWilson said: Calm yourself, brother, it was only an experiment. Now,\nMr. Wakeman, if one of these gentlemen chooses to join an association\nand the other doesn't; and if one of them enjoys whisky and the other\ndoesn't, but sets it aside and leaves it unprotected (titter from\nthe audience), it seems to show that they have independent minds, and\ntastes, and preferences, and that one of them is able to approve of a\nthing at the very moment that the other is heartily disapproving of it.\nDoesn't it seem so to you?\n\nCertainly it does. It's perfectly plain.\n\nNow, then, it might be--I only say it might be--that one of these\nbrothers wanted to kick the plaintiff last night, and that the other\ndidn't want that humiliating punishment inflicted upon him in that\npublic way and before all those people. Isn't that possible?\n\nOf course it is. It's more than possible. I don't believe the blond one\nwould kick anybody. It was the other one that--\n\nSilence! shouted the plaintiff's counsel, and went on with an angry\nsentence which was lost in the wave of laughter that swept the house.\n\nThat will do, Mr. Wakeman, said Wilson, you may stand down.\n\nThe third witness was called. He had seen the twins kick the plaintiff.\nMr. Wilson took the witness.\n\nMr. Rogers, you say you saw these accused gentlemen kick the\nplaintiff?\n\nYes, sir.\n\nBoth of them?\n\nYes, sir.\n\nWhich of them kicked him first?\n\nWhy--they--they both kicked him at the same time.\n\nAre you perfectly sure of that?\n\nYes, sir.\n\nWhat makes you sure of it?\n\nWhy, I stood right behind them, and saw them do it.\n\nHow many kicks were delivered?\n\nOnly one.\n\nIf two men kick, the result should be two kicks, shouldn't it?\n\nWhy--why yes, as a rule.\n\nThen what do you think went with the other kick?\n\nI--well--the fact is, I wasn't thinking of two being necessary, this\ntime.\n\nWhat do you think now?\n\nWell, I--I'm sure I don't quite know what to think, but I reckon that\none of them did half of the kick and the other one did the other half.\n\nSomebody in the crowd sung out: It's the first sane thing that any of\nthem has said.\n\nThe audience applauded. The judge said: Silence! or I will clear the\ncourt.\n\nMr. Allen looked pleased, but Wilson did not seem disturbed. He said:\n\nMr. Rogers, you have favored us with what you think and what you\nreckon, but as thinking and reckoning are not evidence, I will now give\nyou a chance to come out with something positive, one way or the other,\nand shall require you to produce it. I will ask the accused to stand up\nand repeat the phenomenal kick of last night. The twins stood up. Now,\nMr. Rogers, please stand behind them.\n\nA Voice: No, stand in front! (Laughter. Silenced by the court.)\nAnother Voice: No, give Tommy another highst! (Laughter. Sharply\nrebuked by the court.)\n\nNow, then, Mr. Rogers, two kicks shall be delivered, one after the\nother, and I give you my word that at least one of the two shall be\ndelivered by one of the twins alone, without the slightest assistance\nfrom his brother. Watch sharply, for you have got to render a decision\nwithout any if's and ands it. Rogers bent himself behind the twins with\nhis palms just above his knees, in the modern attitude of the catcher at\na baseball match, and riveted his eyes on the pair of legs in front of\nhim.\n\nAre you ready, Mr. Rogers?\n\nReady sir.\n\nThe kick was launched.\n\nHave you got that one classified, Mr. Rogers?\n\nLet me study a minute, sir.\n\nTake as much time as you please. Let me know when you are ready.\n\nFor as much as a minute Rogers pondered, with all eyes and a breathless\ninterest fastened upon him. Then he gave the word: Ready, sir.\n\nKick!\n\nThe kick that followed was an exact duplicate of the first one.\n\nNow, then, Mr. Rogers, one of those kicks was an individual kick, not a\nmutual one. You will now state positively which was the mutual one.\n\nThe witness said, with a crestfallen look:\n\nI've got to give it up. There ain't any man in the world that could\ntell t'other from which, sir.\n\nDo you still assert that last night's kick was a mutual kick?\n\nIndeed, I don't, sir.\n\nThat will do, Mr. Rogers. If my brother Allen desires to address the\ncourt, your honor, very well; but as far as I am concerned I am ready\nto let the case be at once delivered into the hands of this intelligent\njury without comment.\n\nMr. Justice Robinson had been in office only two months, and in that\nshort time had not had many cases to try, of course. He had no knowledge\nof laws and courts except what he had picked up since he came into\noffice. He was a sore trouble to the lawyers, for his rulings were\npretty eccentric sometimes, and he stood by them with Roman simplicity\nand fortitude; but the people were well satisfied with him, for they saw\nthat his intentions were always right, that he was entirely impartial,\nand that he usually made up in good sense what he lacked in technique,\nso to speak. He now perceived that there was likely to be a miscarriage\nof justice here, and he rose to the occasion.\n\nWait a moment, gentlemen, he said, it is plain that an assault has\nbeen committed it is plain to anybody; but the way things are going, the\nguilty will certainly escape conviction. I can not allow this. Now---\n\nBut, your honor! said Wilson, interrupting him, earnestly but\nrespectfully, you are deciding the case yourself, whereas the jury--\n\nNever mind the jury, Mr. Wilson; the jury will have a chance when there\nis a reasonable doubt for them to take hold of--which there isn't, so\nfar. There is no doubt whatever that an assault has been committed. The\nattempt to show that both of the accused committed it has failed. Are\nthey both to escape justice on that account? Not in this court, if I\ncan prevent it. It appears to have been a mistake to bring the charge\nagainst them as a corporation; each should have been charged in his\ncapacity as an individual, and--\n\nBut, your honor! said Wilson, in fairness to my clients I must insist\nthat inasmuch as the prosecution did not separate the--\n\nNo wrong will be done your clients, sir--they will be protected;\nalso the public and the offended laws. Mr. Allen, you will amend your\npleadings, and put one of the accused on trial at a time.\n\nWilson broke in: But, your honor! this is wholly unprecedented! To\nimperil an accused person by arbitrarily altering and widening the\ncharge against him in order to compass his conviction when the charge\nas originally brought promises to fail to convict, is a thing unheard of\nbefore.\n\nUnheard of where?\n\nIn the courts of this or any other state.\n\nThe judge said with dignity: I am not acquainted with the customs\nof other courts, and am not concerned to know what they are. I am\nresponsible for this court, and I cannot conscientiously allow my\njudgment to be warped and my judicial liberty hampered by trying to\nconform to the caprices of other courts, be they--\n\nBut, your honor, the oldest and highest courts in Europe--\n\nThis court is not run on the European plan, Mr. Wilson; it is not run\non any plan but its own. It has a plan of its own; and that plan is, to\nfind justice for both State and accused, no matter what happens to\nbe practice and custom in Europe or anywhere else. (Great applause.)\nSilence! It has not been the custom of this court to imitate other\ncourts; it has not been the custom of this court to take shelter behind\nthe decisions of other courts, and we will not begin now. We will do\nthe best we can by the light that God has given us, and while this court\ncontinues to have His approval, it will remain indifferent to what other\norganizations may think of it. (Applause.) Gentlemen, I must have\norder!--quiet yourselves! Mr. Allen, you will now proceed against the\nprisoners one at a time. Go on with the case.\n\nAllen was not at his ease. However, after whispering a moment with his\nclient and with one or two other people, he rose and said:\n\nYour honor, I find it to be reported and believed that the accused are\nable to act independently in many ways, but that this independence\ndoes not extend to their legs, authority over their legs being vested\nexclusively in the one brother during a specific term of days, and then\npassing to the other brother for a like term, and so on, by regular\nalternation. I could call witnesses who would prove that the accused had\nrevealed to them the existence of this extraordinary fact, and had also\nmade known which of them was in possession of the legs yesterday--and\nthis would, of course, indicate where the guilt of the assault\nbelongs--but as this would be mere hearsay evidence, these revelations\nnot having been made under oath--\n\nNever mind about that, Mr. Allen. It may not all be hearsay. We\nshall see. It may at least help to put us on the right track. Call the\nwitnesses.\n\nThen I will call Mr. John Buckstone, who is now present, and I beg that\nMrs. Patsy Cooper may be sent for. Take the stand, Mr. Buckstone.\n\nBuckstone took the oath, and then testified that on the previous evening\nthe Count Angelo Capello had protested against going to the hall, and\nhad called all present to witness that he was going by compulsion and\nwould not go if he could help himself. Also, that the Count Luigi had\nreplied sharply that he would go, just the same, and that he, Count\nLuigi, would see to that himself. Also, that upon Count Angelo's\ncomplaining about being kept on his legs so long, Count Luigi retorted\nwith apparent surprise, Your legs!--I like your impudence!\n\nNow we are getting at the kernel of the thing, observed the judge,\nwith grave and earnest satisfaction. It looks as if the Count Luigi was\nin possession of the battery at the time of the assault.\n\nNothing further was elicited from Mr. Buckstone on direct examination.\nMr. Wilson took the witness.\n\nMr. Buckstone, about what time was it that that conversation took\nplace?\n\nToward nine yesterday evening, sir.\n\nDid you then proceed directly to the hall?\n\nYes, sir.\n\nHow long did it take you to go there?\n\nWell, we walked; and as it was from the extreme edge of the town, and\nthere was no hurry, I judge it took us about twenty minutes, maybe a\ntrifle more.\n\nAbout what hour was the kick delivered?\n\nAbout thirteen minutes and a half to ten.\n\nAdmirable! You are a pattern witness, Mr. Buckstone. How did you happen\nto look at your watch at that particular moment?\n\nI always do it when I see an assault. It's likely I shall be called as\na witness, and it's a good point to have.\n\nIt would be well if others were as thoughtful. Was anything said,\nbetween the conversation at my house and the assault, upon the detail\nwhich we are now examining into?\n\nNo, sir.\n\nIf power over the mutual legs was in the possession of one brother at\nnine, and passed into the possession of the other one during the next\nthirty or forty minutes, do you think you could have detected the\nchange?\n\nBy no means!\n\nThat is all, Mr. Buckstone.\n\nMrs. Patsy Cooper was called. The crowd made way for her, and she came\nsmiling and bowing through the narrow human lane, with Betsy Hale,\nas escort and support, smiling and bowing in her wake, the audience\nbreaking into welcoming cheers as the old favorites filed along. The\njudge did not check this kindly demonstration of homage and affection,\nbut let it run its course unrebuked.\n\nThe old ladies stopped and shook hands with the twins with effusion,\nthen gave the judge a friendly nod, and bustled into the seats provided\nfor them. They immediately began to deliver a volley of eager questions\nat the friends around them: What is this thing for? What is that\nthing for? Who is that young man that's writing at the desk? Why, I\ndeclare, it's Jack Bunce! I thought he was sick. Which is the jury?\nWhy, is that the jury? Billy Price and Job Turner, and Jack Lounsbury,\nand--well, I never! Now who would ever 'a' thought--\n\nBut they were gently called to order at this point, and asked not to\ntalk in court. Their tongues fell silent, but the radiant interest in\ntheir faces remained, and their gratitude for the blessing of a new\nsensation and a novel experience still beamed undimmed from their eyes.\nAunt Patsy stood up and took the oath, and Mr. Allen explained the point\nin issue, and asked her to go on now, in her own way, and throw as much\nlight upon it as she could. She toyed with her reticule a moment or two,\nas if considering where to begin, then she said:\n\nWell, the way of it is this. They are Luigi's legs a week at a time,\nand then they are Angelo's, and he can do whatever he wants to with\nthem.\n\nYou are making a mistake, Aunt Patsy Cooper, said the judge. You\nshouldn't state that as a fact, because you don't know it to be a fact.\n\nWhat's the reason I don't? said Aunt Patsy, bridling a little.\n\nWhat is the reason that you do know it?\n\nThe best in the world because they told me.\n\nThat isn't a reason.\n\nWell, for the land's sake! Betsy Hale, do you hear that?\n\nHear it? I should think so, said Aunt Betsy, rising and facing the\ncourt. Why, Judge, I was there and heard it myself. Luigi says to\nAngelo--no, it was Angelo said it to--\n\nCome, come, Mrs. Hale, pray sit down, and--\n\nCertainly, it's all right, I'm going to sit down presently, but not\nuntil I've--\n\nBut you must sit down!\n\nMust! Well, upon my word if things ain't getting to a pretty pass\nwhen--\n\nThe house broke into laughter, but was promptly brought to order, and\nmeantime Mr. Allen persuaded the old lady to take her seat. Aunt Patsy\ncontinued:\n\nYes, they told me that, and I know it's true. They're Luigi's legs this\nweek, but--\n\nAh, they told you that, did they? said the Justice, with interest.\n\nWell, no, I don't know that they told me, but that's neither here nor\nthere. I know, without that, that at dinner yesterday, Angelo was as\ntired as a dog, and yet Luigi wouldn't lend him the legs to go up-stairs\nand take a nap with.\n\nDid he ask for them?\n\nLet me see--it seems to me, somehow, that--that--Aunt Betsy, do you\nremember whether he--\n\nNever mind about what Aunt Betsy remembers--she is not a witness; we\nonly want to know what YOU remember yourself, said the judge.\n\nWell, it does seem to me that you are most cantankerously particular\nabout a little thing, Sim Robinson. Why, when I can't remember a thing\nmyself, I always--\n\nAh, please go on!\n\nNow how can she when you keep fussing at her all the time? said Aunt\nBetsy. Why, with a person pecking at me that way, I should get that\nfuzzled and fuddled that--\n\nShe was on her feet again, but Allen coaxed her into her seat once more,\nwhile the court squelched the mirth of the house. Then the judge said:\n\nMadam, do you know--do you absolutely know, independently of anything\nthese gentlemen have told you--that the power over their legs passes\nfrom the one to the other regularly every week?\n\nRegularly? Bless your heart, regularly ain't any name for the exactness\nof it! All the big cities in Europe used to set the clocks by it.\n (Laughter, suppressed by the court.)\n\nHow do you know? That is the question. Please answer it plainly and\nsquarely.\n\nDon't you talk to me like that, Sim Robinson--I won't have it. How do I\nknow, indeed! How do YOU know what you know? Because somebody told you.\nYou didn't invent it out of your own head, did you? Why, these twins are\nthe truthfulest people in the world; and I don't think it becomes you\nto sit up there and throw slurs at them when they haven't been doing\nanything to you. And they are orphans besides--both of them. All--\n\nBut Aunt Betsy was up again now, and both old ladies were talking at\nonce and with all their might; but as the house was weltering in a\nstorm of laughter, and the judge was hammering his desk with an iron\npaper-weight, one could only see them talk, not hear them. At last, when\nquiet was restored, the court said:\n\nLet the ladies retire.\n\nBut, your honor, I have the right, in the interest of my clients,--to\ncross-exam--\n\nYou'll not need to exercise it, Mr. Wilson--the evidence is thrown\nout.\n\nThrown out! said Aunt Patsy, ruffled; and what's it thrown out for,\nI'd like to know.\n\nAnd so would I, Patsy Cooper. It seems to me that if we can save these\npoor persecuted strangers, it is our bounden duty to stand up here and\ntalk for them till--\n\nThere, there, there, do sit down!\n\nIt cost some trouble and a good deal of coaxing, but they were got into\ntheir seats at last. The trial was soon ended now. The twins themselves\nbecame witnesses in their own defense. They established the fact, upon\noath, that the leg-power passed from one to the other every Saturday\nnight at twelve o'clock sharp. But on cross-examination their counsel\nwould not allow them to tell whose week of power the current week was.\nThe judge insisted upon their answering, and proposed to compel them,\nbut even the prosecution took fright and came to the rescue then, and\nhelped stay the sturdy jurist's revolutionary hand. So the case had to\ngo to the jury with that important point hanging in the air. They were\nout an hour and brought in this verdict:\n\nWe the jury do find: 1, that an assault was committed, as charged; 2,\nthat it was committed by one of the persons accused, he having been seen\nto do it by several credible witnesses; 3, but that his identity is so\nmerged in his brother's that we have not been able to tell which was\nhim. We cannot convict both, for only one is guilty. We cannot acquit\nboth, for only one is innocent. Our verdict is that justice has been\ndefeated by the dispensation of God, and ask to be discharged from\nfurther duty.\n\nThis was read aloud in court and brought out a burst of hearty applause.\nThe old ladies made a spring at the twins, to shake and congratulate,\nbut were gently disengaged by Mr. Wilson and softly crowded back into\ntheir places.\n\nThe judge rose in his little tribune, laid aside his silver-bowed\nspectacles, roached his gray hair up with his fingers, and said, with\ndignity and solemnity, and even with a certain pathos:\n\nIn all my experience on the bench, I have not seen justice bow her\nhead in shame in this court until this day. You little realize what\nfar-reaching harm has just been wrought here under the fickle forms of\nlaw. Imitation is the bane of courts--I thank God that this one is free\nfrom the contamination of that vice--and in no long time you will\nsee the fatal work of this hour seized upon by profligate so-called\nguardians of justice in all the wide circumstance of this planet and\nperpetuated in their pernicious decisions. I wash my hands of this\niniquity. I would have compelled these culprits to expose their\nguilt, but support failed me where I had most right to expect aid and\nencouragement. And I was confronted by a law made in the interest of\ncrime, which protects the criminal from testifying against himself.\nYet I had precedents of my own whereby I had set aside that law on two\ndifferent occasions and thus succeeded in convicting criminals to\nwhose crimes there were no witnesses but themselves. What have\nyou accomplished this day? Do you realize it? You have set adrift,\nunadmonished, in this community, two men endowed with an awful and\nmysterious gift, a hidden and grisly power for evil--a power by which\neach in his turn may commit crime after crime of the most heinous\ncharacter, and no man be able to tell which is the guilty or which the\ninnocent party in any case of them all. Look to your homes--look to your\nproperty--look to your lives--for you have need!\n\nPrisoners at the bar, stand up. Through suppression of evidence, a\njury of your--our--countrymen have been obliged to deliver a verdict\nconcerning your case which stinks to heaven with the rankness of its\ninjustice. By its terms you, the guilty one, go free with the innocent.\nDepart in peace, and come no more! The costs devolve upon the outraged\nplaintiff--another iniquity. The court stands dissolved.\n\nAlmost everybody crowded forward to overwhelm the twins and their\ncounsel with congratulations; but presently the two old aunties dug\nthe duplicates out and bore them away in triumph through the hurrahing\ncrowd, while lots of new friends carried Pudd'nhead Wilson off\ntavern-ward to feast him and wet down his great and victorious entry\ninto the legal arena. To Wilson, so long familiar with neglect and\ndepreciation, this strange new incense of popularity and admiration\nwas as a fragrance blown from the fields of paradise. A happy man was\nWilson.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE AMAZING DUEL\n\n     A deputation came in the evening and conferred upon Wilson the\n     welcome honor of a nomination for mayor; for the village has just\n     been converted into a city by charter.  Tom skulks out of\n     challenging the twins.  Judge Driscoll thereupon challenges Angelo\n     (accused by Tom of doing the kicking); he declines, but Luigi\n     accepts in his place against Angelo's timid protest.\n\nIt was late Saturday night nearing eleven.\n\nThe judge and his second found the rest of the war party at the further\nend of the vacant ground, near the haunted house. Pudd'nhead Wilson\nadvanced to meet them, and said anxiously:\n\nI must say a word in behalf of my principal's proxy, Count Luigi, to\nwhom you have kindly granted the privilege of fighting my principal's\nbattle for him. It is growing late, and Count Luigi is in great trouble\nlest midnight shall strike before the finish.\n\nIt is another testimony, said Howard, approvingly. That young man is\nfine all through. He wishes to save his brother the sorrow of fighting\non the Sabbath, and he is right; it is the right and manly feeling and\ndoes him credit. We will make all possible haste.\n\nWilson said: There is also another reason--a consideration, in fact,\nwhich deeply concerns Count Luigi himself. These twins have command\nof their mutual legs turn about. Count Luigi is in command now; but at\nmidnight, possession will pass to my principal, Count Angelo, and--well,\nyou can foresee what will happen. He will march straight off the field,\nand carry Luigi with him.\n\nWhy! sure enough! cried the judge, we have heard something about that\nextraordinary law of their being, already--nothing very definite, it is\ntrue, as regards dates and durations of power, but I see it is definite\nenough as regards to-night. Of course we must give Luigi every chance.\nOmit all the ceremonial possible, gentlemen, and place us in position.\n\nThe seconds at once tossed up a coin; Howard won the choice. He placed\nthe judge sixty feet from the haunted house and facing it; Wilson\nplaced the twins within fifteen feet of the house and facing the\njudge--necessarily. The pistol-case was opened and the long slim tubes\ntaken out; when the moonlight glinted from them a shiver went through\nAngelo. The doctor was a fool, but a thoroughly well-meaning one, with\na kind heart and a sincere disposition to oblige, but along with it an\nabsence of tact which often hurt its effectiveness. He brought his box\nof lint and bandages, and asked Angelo to feel and see how soft and\ncomfortable they were. Angelo's head fell over against Luigi's in a\nfaint, and precious time was lost in bringing him to; which provoked\nLuigi into expressing his mind to the doctor with a good deal of vigor\nand frankness. After Angelo came to he was still so weak that Luigi was\nobliged to drink a stiff horn of brandy to brace him up.\n\nThe seconds now stepped at once to their posts, halfway between the\ncombatants, one of them on each side of the line of fire. Wilson was to\ncount, very deliberately, One-two-three-fire!--stop! and the duelists\ncould bang away at any time they chose during that recitation, but not\nafter the last word. Angelo grew very nervous when he saw Wilson's hand\nrising slowly into the air as a sign to make ready, and he leaned his\nhead against Luigi's and said:\n\nOh, please take me away from here, I can't stay, I know I can't!\n\nWhat in the world are you doing? Straighten up! What's the matter with\nyou?--you're in no danger--nobody's going to shoot at you. Straighten\nup, I tell you!\n\nAngelo obeyed, just in time to hear:\n\nOne--!\n\nBang! Just one report, and a little tuft of white hair floated slowly\nto the judge's feet in the moonlight. The judge did not swerve; he still\nstood erect and motionless, like a statue, with his pistol-arm hanging\nstraight down at his side. He was reserving his fire.\n\nTwo--!\n\nThree--!\n\nFire--!\n\nUp came the pistol-arm instantly-Angelo dodged with the report. He said\nOuch! and fainted again.\n\nThe doctor examined and bandaged the wound.\n\nIt was of no consequence, he said--bullet through fleshy part of\narm--no bones broken--the gentleman was still able to fight let the duel\nproceed.\n\nNext time Angelo jumped just as Luigi fired, which disordered his aim\nand caused him to cut a chip off of Howard's ear. The judge took his\ntime again, and when he fired Angelo jumped and got a knuckle skinned.\nThe doctor inspected and dressed the wounds. Angelo now spoke out\nand said he was content with the satisfaction he had got, and if the\njudge--but Luigi shut him roughly up, and asked him not to make an ass\nof himself; adding:\n\nAnd I want you to stop dodging. You take a great deal too prominent a\npart in this thing for a person who has got nothing to do with it. You\nshould remember that you are here only by courtesy, and are without\nofficial recognition; officially you are not here at all; officially you\ndo not even exist. To all intents and purposes you are absent from this\nplace, and you ought for your own modesty's sake to reflect that it\ncannot become a person who is not present here to be taking this sort\nof public and indecent prominence in a matter in which he is not in the\nslightest degree concerned. Now, don't dodge again; the bullets are\nnot for you, they are for me; if I want them dodged I will attend to it\nmyself. I never saw a person act so.\n\nAngelo saw the reasonableness of what his brother had said, and he did\ntry to reform, but it was of no use; both pistols went off at the same\ninstant, and he jumped once more; he got a sharp scrape along his cheek\nfrom the judge's bullet, and so deflected Luigi's aim that his ball\nwent wide and chipped a flake of skin from Pudd'nhead Wilson's chin. The\ndoctor attended to the wounded.\n\nBy the terms, the duel was over. But Luigi was entirely out of patience,\nand begged for one more exchange of shots, insisting that he had had no\nfair chance, on account of his brother's indelicate behavior. Howard was\nopposed to granting so unusual a privilege, but the judge took Luigi's\npart, and added that indeed he himself might fairly be considered\nentitled to another trial, because although the proxy on the other side\nwas in no way to blame for his (the judge's) humiliatingly resultless\nwork, the gentleman with whom he was fighting this duel was to blame for\nit, since if he had played no advantages and had held his head still,\nhis proxy would have been disposed of early. He added:\n\nCount Luigi's request for another exchange is another proof that he is\na brave and chivalrous gentleman, and I beg that the courtesy he asks\nmay be accorded him.\n\nI thank you most sincerely for this generosity, Judge Driscoll, said\nLuigi, with a polite bow, and moving to his place. Then he added--to\nAngelo, Now hold your grip, hold your grip, I tell you, and I'll land\nhim sure!\n\nThe men stood erect, their pistol-arms at their sides, the two seconds\nstood at their official posts, the doctor stood five paces in Wilson's\nrear with his instruments and bandages in his hands. The deep stillness,\nthe peaceful moonlight, the motionless figures, made an impressive\npicture and the impending fatal possibilities augmented\nthis impressiveness to solemnity. Wilson's hand began to\nrise--slowly--slowly--higher--still higher--still higher--in another\nmoment:\n\nBoom! the first stroke of midnight swung up out of the distance;\nAngelo was off like a deer!\n\nOh, you unspeakable traitor! wailed his brother, as they went soaring\nover the fence.\n\nThe others stood astonished and gazing; and so stood, watching that\nstrange spectacle until distance dissolved it and swept it from their\nview. Then they rubbed their eyes like people waking out of a dream.\n\nWell, I've never seen anything like that before! said the judge.\nWilson, I am going to confess now, that I wasn't quite able to\nbelieve in that leg business, and had a suspicion that it was a put-up\nconvenience between those twins; and when Count Angelo fainted I thought\nI saw the whole scheme--thought it was pretext No. 1, and would be\nfollowed by others till twelve o'clock should arrive, and Luigi would\nget off with all the credit of seeming to want to fight and yet not have\nto fight, after all. But I was mistaken. His pluck proved it. He's a\nbrave fellow and did want to fight.\n\nThere isn't any doubt about that, said Howard, and added, in a grieved\ntone, but what an unworthy sort of Christian that Angelo is--I hope and\nbelieve there are not many like him. It is not right to engage in a duel\non the Sabbath--I could not approve of that myself; but to finish one\nthat has been begun--that is a duty, let the day be what it may.\n\nThey strolled along, still wondering, still talking.\n\nIt is a curious circumstance, remarked the surgeon, halting Wilson a\nmoment to paste some more court-plaster on his chin, which had gone\nto leaking blood again, that in this duel neither of the parties who\nhandled the pistols lost blood while nearly all the persons present in\nthe mere capacity of guests got hit. I have not heard of such a thing\nbefore. Don't you think it unusual?\n\nYes, said the Judge, it has struck me as peculiar. Peculiar and\nunfortunate. I was annoyed at it, all the time. In the case of Angelo it\nmade no great difference, because he was in a measure concerned, though\nnot officially; but it troubled me to see the seconds compromised, and\nyet I knew no way to mend the matter.\n\nThere was no way to mend it, said Howard, whose ear was being\nreadjusted now by the doctor; the code fixes our place, and it would\nnot have been lawful to change it. If we could have stood at your\nside, or behind you, or in front of you, it--but it would not have been\nlegitimate and the other parties would have had a just right to complain\nof our trying to protect ourselves from danger; infractions of the code\nare certainly not permissible in any case whatever.\n\nWilson offered no remarks. It seemed to him that there was very little\nplace here for so much solemnity, but he judged that if a duel where\nnobody was in danger or got crippled but the seconds and the outsiders\nhad nothing ridiculous about it for these gentlemen, his pointing out\nthat feature would probably not help them to see it.\n\nHe invited them in to take a nightcap, and Howard and the judge\naccepted, but the doctor said he would have to go and see how Angelo's\nprincipal wound was getting on.\n\n     [It was now Sunday, and in the afternoon Angelo was to be received\n     into the Baptist communion by immersion--a doubtful prospect, the\n     doctor feared.]\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. LUIGI DEFIES GALEN\n\nWhen the doctor arrived at Aunt Patsy Cooper's house, he found the\nlights going and everybody up and dressed and in a great state of\nsolicitude and excitement. The twins were stretched on a sofa in the\nsitting-room, Aunt Patsy was fussing at Angelo's arm, Nancy was flying\naround under her commands, the two young boys were trying to keep out\nof the way and always getting in it, in order to see and wonder, Rowena\nstood apart, helpless with apprehension and emotion, and Luigi was\ngrowling in unappeasable fury over Angelo's shameful flight.\n\nAs has been reported before, the doctor was a fool--a kind-hearted and\nwell-meaning one, but with no tact; and as he was by long odds the most\nlearned physician in the town, and was quite well aware of it, and could\ntalk his learning with ease and precision, and liked to show off when he\nhad an audience, he was sometimes tempted into revealing more of a case\nthan was good for the patient.\n\nHe examined Angelo's wound, and was really minded to say nothing for\nonce; but Aunt Patsy was so anxious and so pressing that he allowed his\ncaution to be overcome, and proceeded to empty himself as follows, with\nscientific relish:\n\nWithout going too much into detail, madam--for you would probably\nnot understand it, anyway--I concede that great care is going to be\nnecessary here; otherwise exudation of the esophagus is nearly sure to\nensue, and this will be followed by ossification and extradition of the\nmaxillaris superioris, which must decompose the granular surfaces of the\ngreat infusorial ganglionic system, thus obstructing the action of the\nposterior varioloid arteries, and precipitating compound strangulated\nsorosis of the valvular tissues, and ending unavoidably in the\ndispersion and combustion of the marsupial fluxes and the consequent\nembrocation of the bicuspid populo redax referendum rotulorum.\n\nA miserable silence followed. Aunt Patsy's heart sank, the pallor of\ndespair invaded her face, she was not able to speak; poor Rowena wrung\nher hands in privacy and silence, and said to herself in the bitterness\nof her young grief, There is no hope--it is plain there is no hope;\nthe good-hearted negro wench, Nancy, paled to chocolate, then to orange,\nthen to amber, and thought to herself with yearning sympathy and sorrow,\nPo' thing, he ain' gwyne to las' throo de half o' dat; small Henry\nchoked up, and turned his head away to hide his rising tears, and his\nbrother Joe said to himself, with a sense of loss, The baptizing's\nbusted, that's sure. Luigi was the only person who had any heart to\nspeak. He said, a little bit sharply, to the doctor:\n\nWell, well, there's nothing to be gained by wasting precious time; give\nhim a barrel of pills--I'll take them for him.\n\nYou? asked the doctor.\n\nYes. Did you suppose he was going to take them himself?\n\nWhy, of course.\n\nWell, it's a mistake. He never took a dose of medicine in his life. He\ncan't.\n\nWell, upon my word, it's the most extraordinary thing I ever heard of!\n\nOh, said Aunt Patsy, as pleased as a mother whose child is being\nadmired and wondered at; you'll find that there's more about them\nthat's wonderful than their just being made in the image of God like the\nrest of His creatures, now you can depend on that, I tell you, and she\nwagged her complacent head like one who could reveal marvelous things if\nshe chose.\n\nThe boy Joe began:\n\nWhy, ma, they ain't made in the im--\n\nYou shut up, and wait till you're asked, Joe. I'll let you know when I\nwant help. Are you looking for something, doctor?\n\nThe doctor asked for a few sheets of paper and a pen, and said he would\nwrite a prescription; which he did. It was one of Galen's; in fact, it\nwas Galen's favorite, and had been slaying people for sixteen thousand\nyears. Galen used it for everything, applied it to everything, said it\nwould remove everything, from warts all the way through to lungs and it\ngenerally did. Galen was still the only medical authority recognized\nin Missouri; his practice was the only practice known to the Missouri\ndoctors, and his prescriptions were the only ammunition they carried\nwhen they went out for game.\n\nBy and by Dr. Claypool laid down his pen and read the result of his\nlabors aloud, carefully and deliberately, for this battery must be\nconstructed on the premises by the family, and mistakes could occur; for\nhe wrote a doctor's hand--the hand which from the beginning of time\nhas been so disastrous to the apothecary and so profitable to the\nundertaker:\n\nTake of afarabocca, henbane, corpobalsamum, each two drams and a half;\nof cloves, opium, myrrh, cyperus, each two drams; of opobalsamum, Indian\nleaf, cinnamon, zedoary, ginger, coftus, coral, cassia, euphorbium,\ngum tragacanth, frankincense, styrax calamita, Celtic, nard, spignel,\nhartwort, mustard, saxifrage, dill, anise, each one dram; of xylaloes,\nrheum ponticum, alipta, moschata, castor, spikenard, galangals,\nopoponax, anacardium, mastich, brimstone, peony, eringo, pulp of dates,\nred and white hermodactyls, roses, thyme, acorns, pennyroyal, gentian,\nthe bark of the root of mandrake, germander, valerian, bishop's-weed,\nbayberries, long and white pepper, xylobalsamum, carnabadium,\nmacedonian, parsley seeds, lovage, the seeds of rue, and sinon, of each\na dram and a half; of pure gold, pure silver, pearls not perforated, the\nblatta byzantina, the bone of the stag's heart, of each the quantity of\nfourteen grains of wheat; of sapphire, emerald and jasper stones, each\none dram; of hazel-nuts, two drams; of pellitory of Spain, shavings\nof ivory, calamus odoratus, each the quantity of twenty-nine grains of\nwheat; of honey or sugar a sufficient quantity. Boil down and skim off.\n\nThere, he said, that will fix the patient; give his brother a\ndipperful every three-quarters of an hour--\n\n--while he survives, muttered Luigi--\n\n--and see that the room is kept wholesomely hot, and the doors and\nwindows closed tight. Keep Count Angelo nicely covered up with six\nor seven blankets, and when he is thirsty--which will be\nfrequently--moisten a rag in the vapor of the tea kettle and let his\nbrother suck it. When he is hungry--which will also be frequently--he\nmust not be humored oftener than every seven or eight hours; then toast\npart of a cracker until it begins to brown, and give it to his brother.\n\nThat is all very well, as far as Angelo is concerned, said Luigi, but\nwhat am I to eat?\n\nI do not see that there is anything the matter with you, the doctor\nanswered, you may, of course, eat what you please.\n\nAnd also drink what I please, I suppose?\n\nOh, certainly--at present. When the violent and continuous perspiring\nhas reduced your strength, I shall have to reduce your diet, of course,\nand also bleed you, but there is no occasion for that yet awhile. He\nturned to Aunt Patsy and said: He must be put to bed, and sat up with,\nand tended with the greatest care, and not allowed to stir for several\ndays and nights.\n\nFor one, I'm sacredly thankful for that, said Luigi, it postpones the\nfuneral--I'm not to be drowned to-day, anyhow.\n\nAngelo said quietly to the doctor:\n\nI will cheerfully submit to all your requirements, sir, up to two\no'clock this afternoon, and will resume them after three, but cannot be\nconfined to the house during that intermediate hour.\n\nWhy, may I ask?\n\nBecause I have entered the Baptist communion, and by appointment am to\nbe baptised in the river at that hour.\n\nOh, insanity!--it cannot be allowed!\n\nAngelo answered with placid firmness:\n\nNothing shall prevent it, if I am alive.\n\nWhy, consider, my dear sir, in your condition it might prove fatal.\n\nA tender and ecstatic smile beamed from Angelo's eyes, and he broke\nforth in a tone of joyous fervency:\n\nAh, how blessed it would be to die for such a cause--it would be\nmartyrdom!\n\nBut your brother--consider your brother; you would be risking his life,\ntoo.\n\nHe risked mine an hour ago, responded Angelo, gloomily; did he\nconsider me? A thought swept through his mind that made him shudder.\nIf I had not run, I might have been killed in a duel on the Sabbath\nday, and my soul would have been lost--lost.\n\nOh, don't fret, it wasn't in any danger, said Luigi, irritably; they\nwouldn't waste it for a little thing like that; there's a glass case all\nready for it in the heavenly museum, and a pin to stick it up with.\n\nAunt Patsy was shocked, and said:\n\nLooy, Looy!--don't talk so, dear!\n\nRowena's soft heart was pierced by Luigi's unfeeling words, and she\nmurmured to herself, Oh, if I but had the dear privilege of protecting\nand defending him with my weak voice!--but alas! this sweet boon is\ndenied me by the cruel conventions of social intercourse.\n\nGet their bed ready, said Aunt Patsy to Nancy, and shut up the\nwindows and doors, and light their candles, and see that you drive all\nthe mosquitoes out of their bar, and make up a good fire in their stove,\nand carry up some bags of hot ashes to lay to his feet--\n\n--and a shovel of fire for his head, and a mustard plaster for his\nneck, and some gum shoes for his ears, Luigi interrupted, with temper;\nand added, to himself, Damnation, I'm going to be roasted alive, I just\nknow it!\n\nWhy, Looy! Do be quiet; I never saw such a fractious thing. A body\nwould think you didn't care for your brother.\n\nI don't--to that extent, Aunt Patsy. I was glad the drowning was\npostponed a minute ago, but I'm not now. No, that is all gone by; I want\nto be drowned.\n\nYou'll bring a judgment on yourself just as sure as you live, if you\ngo on like that. Why, I never heard the beat of it. Now, there--there!\nyou've said enough. Not another word out of you--I won't have it!\n\nBut, Aunt Patsy--\n\nLuigi! Didn't you hear what I told you?\n\nBut, Aunt Patsy, I--why, I'm not going to set my heart and lungs afloat\nin that pail of sewage which this criminal here has been prescri--\n\nYes, you are, too. You are going to be good, and do everything I tell\nyou, like a dear, and she tapped his cheek affectionately with her\nfinger. Rowena, take the prescription and go in the kitchen and hunt up\nthe things and lay them out for me. I'll sit up with my patient the rest\nof the night, doctor; I can't trust Nancy, she couldn't make Luigi take\nthe medicine. Of course, you'll drop in again during the day. Have you\ngot any more directions?\n\nNo, I believe not, Aunt Patsy. If I don't get in earlier, I'll be along\nby early candle-light, anyway. Meantime, don't allow him to get out of\nhis bed.\n\nAngelo said, with calm determination:\n\nI shall be baptized at two o'clock. Nothing but death shall prevent\nme.\n\nThe doctor said nothing aloud, but to himself he said:\n\nWhy, this chap's got a manly side, after all! Physically he's a coward,\nbut morally he's a lion. I'll go and tell the others about this; it will\nraise him a good deal in their estimation--and the public will follow\ntheir lead, of course.\n\nPrivately, Aunt Patsy applauded too, and was proud of Angelo's courage\nin the moral field as she was of Luigi's in the field of honor.\n\nThe boy Henry was troubled, but the boy Joe said, inaudibly, and\ngratefully, We're all honky, after all; and no postponement on account\nof the weather.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. BAPTISM OF THE BETTER HALF\n\nBy nine o'clock the town was humming with the news of the midnight duel,\nand there were but two opinions about it: one, that Luigi's pluck in\nthe field was most praiseworthy and Angelo's flight most scandalous; the\nother, that Angelo's courage in flying the field for conscience' sake\nwas as fine and creditable as was Luigi's in holding the field in the\nface of the bullets. The one opinion was held by half of the town, the\nother one was maintained by the other half. The division was clean and\nexact, and it made two parties, an Angelo party and a Luigi party. The\ntwins had suddenly become popular idols along with Pudd'nhead Wilson,\nand haloed with a glory as intense as his. The children talked the duel\nall the way to Sunday-school, their elders talked it all the way to\nchurch, the choir discussed it behind their red curtain, it usurped the\nplace of pious thought in the nigger gallery.\n\nBy noon the doctor had added the news, and spread it, that Count Angelo,\nin spite of his wound and all warnings and supplications, was resolute\nin his determination to be baptized at the hour appointed. This swept\nthe town like wildfire, and mightily reinforced the enthusiasm of the\nAngelo faction, who said, If any doubted that it was moral courage that\ntook him from the field, what have they to say now!\n\nStill the excitement grew. All the morning it was traveling countryward,\ntoward all points of the compass; so, whereas before only the farmers\nand their wives were intending to come and witness the remarkable\nbaptism, a general holiday was now proclaimed and the children and\nnegroes admitted to the privileges of the occasion. All the farms for\nten miles around were vacated, all the converging roads emptied long\nprocessions of wagons, horses, and yeomanry into the town. The pack\nand cram of people vastly exceeded any that had ever been seen in that\nsleepy region before. The only thing that had ever even approached it,\nwas the time long gone by, but never forgotten, nor even referred to\nwithout wonder and pride, when two circuses and a Fourth of July fell\ntogether. But the glory of that occasion was extinguished now for good.\nIt was but a freshet to this deluge.\n\nThe great invasion massed itself on the river-bank and waited hungrily\nfor the immense event. Waited, and wondered if it would really happen,\nor if the twin who was not a professor would stand out and prevent it.\n\nBut they were not to be disappointed. Angelo was as good as his word. He\ncame attended by an escort of honor composed of several hundred of\nthe best citizens, all of the Angelo party; and when the immersion was\nfinished they escorted him back home and would even have carried him on\ntheir shoulders, but that people might think they were carrying Luigi.\n\nFar into the night the citizens continued to discuss and wonder over the\nstrangely mated pair of incidents that had distinguished and exalted\nthe past twenty-four hours above any other twenty-four in the history\nof their town for picturesqueness and splendid interest; and long before\nthe lights were out and burghers asleep it had been decided on all hands\nthat in capturing these twins Dawson's Landing had drawn a prize in the\ngreat lottery of municipal fortune.\n\nAt midnight Angelo was sleeping peacefully. His immersion had not harmed\nhim, it had merely made him wholesomely drowsy, and he had been dead\nasleep many hours now. It had made Luigi drowsy, too, but he had got\nonly brief naps, on account of his having to take the medicine every\nthree-quarters of an hour-and Aunt Betsy Hale was there to see that he\ndid it. When he complained and resisted, she was quietly firm with him,\nand said in a low voice:\n\nNo-no, that won't do; you mustn't talk, and you mustn't retch and gag\nthat way, either--you'll wake up your poor brother.\n\nWell, what of it, Aunt Betsy, he--\n\n'Sh-h! Don't make a noise dear. You mustn't forget that your poor\nbrother is sick and--\n\nSick, is he? Well, I wish I--\n\n'Sh-h-h! Will you be quiet, Luigi! Here, now, take the rest of\nit--don't keep me holding the dipper all night. I declare if you haven't\nleft a good fourth of it in the bottom! Come--that's a good--\n\nAunt Betsy, don't make me! I feel like I've swallowed a cemetery; I do,\nindeed. Do let me rest a little--just a little; I can't take any more of\nthe devilish stuff now.\n\nLuigi! Using such language here, and him just baptized! Do you want the\nroof to fall on you?\n\nI wish to goodness it would!\n\nWhy, you dreadful thing! I've a good notion to--let that blanket alone;\ndo you want your brother to catch his death?\n\nAunt Betsy, I've got to have it off, I'm being roasted alive; nobody\ncould stand it--you couldn't yourself.\n\nNow, then, you're sneezing again--I just expected it.\n\nBecause I've caught a cold in my head. I always do, when I go in the\nwater with my clothes on. And it takes me weeks to get over it, too. I\nthink it was a shame to serve me so.\n\nLuigi, you are unreasonable; you know very well they couldn't baptize\nhim dry. I should think you would be willing to undergo a little\ninconvenience for your brother's sake.\n\nInconvenience! Now how you talk, Aunt Betsy. I came as near as\nanything to getting drowned you saw that yourself; and do you call this\ninconvenience?--the room shut up as tight as a drum, and so hot the\nmosquitoes are trying to get out; and a cold in the head, and dying for\nsleep and no chance to get any--on account of this infamous medicine\nthat that assassin prescri--\n\nThere, you're sneezing again. I'm going down and mix some more of this\ntruck for you, dear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE DRINKLESS DRUNK\n\nDuring Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday the twins grew steadily worse; but\nthen the doctor was summoned South to attend his mother's funeral,\nand they got well in forty-eight hours. They appeared on the street on\nFriday, and were welcomed with enthusiasm by the new-born parties, the\nLuigi and Angelo factions. The Luigi faction carried its strength into\nthe Democratic party, the Angelo faction entered into a combination with\nthe Whigs. The Democrats nominated Luigi for alderman under the new\ncity government, and the Whigs put up Angelo against him. The Democrats\nnominated Pudd'nhead Wilson for mayor, and he was left alone in this\nglory, for the Whigs had no man who was willing to enter the lists\nagainst such a formidable opponent. No politician had scored such a\ncompliment as this before in the history of the Mississippi Valley.\n\nThe political campaign in Dawson's Landing opened in a pretty warm\nfashion, and waxed hotter every week. Luigi's whole heart was in it, and\neven Angelo developed a surprising amount of interest-which was\nnatural, because he was not merely representing Whigism, a matter of no\nconsequence to him; but he was representing something immensely finer\nand greater--to wit, Reform. In him was centered the hopes of the whole\nreform element of the town; he was the chosen and admired champion of\nevery clique that had a pet reform of any sort or kind at heart. He\nwas president of the great Teetotalers' Union, its chiefest prophet and\nmouthpiece.\n\nBut as the canvass went on, troubles began to spring up all\naround--troubles for the twins, and through them for all the parties and\nsegments and fractions of parties. Whenever Luigi had possession of the\nlegs, he carried Angelo to balls, rum shops, Sons of Liberty parades,\nhorse-races, campaign riots, and everywhere else that could damage him\nwith his party and the church; and when it was Angelo's week he carried\nLuigi diligently to all manner of moral and religious gatherings, doing\nhis best to regain the ground he had lost before. As a result of\nthese double performances, there was a storm blowing all the time, an\never-rising storm, too--a storm of frantic criticism of the twins, and\nrage over their extravagant, incomprehensible conduct.\n\nLuigi had the final chance. The legs were his for the closing week of\nthe canvass. He led his brother a fearful dance.\n\nBut he saved his best card for the very eve of the election. There was\nto be a grand turnout of the Teetotalers' Union that day, and Angelo\nwas to march at the head of the procession and deliver a great oration\nafterward. Luigi drank a couple of glasses of whisky--which steadied his\nnerves and clarified his mind, but made Angelo drunk. Everybody who saw\nthe march, saw that the Champion of the Teetotalers was half seas over,\nand noted also that his brother, who made no hypocritical pretensions\nto extra temperance virtues, was dignified and sober. This eloquent fact\ncould not be unfruitful at the end of a hot political canvass. At the\nmass-meeting Angelo tried to make his great temperance oration, but was\nso discommoded--by hiccoughs and thickness of tongue that he had to give\nit up; then drowsiness overtook him and his head drooped against Luigi's\nand he went to sleep. Luigi apologized for him, and was going on to\nimprove his opportunity with an appeal for a moderation of what he\ncalled the prevailing teetotal madness, but persons in the audience\nbegan to howl and throw things at him, and then the meeting rose in\nwrath and chased him home.\n\nThis episode was a crusher for Angelo in another way. It destroyed his\nchances with Rowena. Those chances had been growing, right along, for\ntwo months. Rowena had partly confessed that she loved him, but wanted\ntime to consider. Now the tender dream was ended, and she told him so\nthe moment he was sober enough to understand. She said she would never\nmarry a man who drank.\n\nBut I don't drink, he pleaded.\n\nThat is nothing to the point, she said, coldly, you get drunk, and\nthat is worse.\n\n[There was a long and sufficiently idiotic discussion here, which ended\nas reported in a previous note.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. SO THEY HANGED LUIGI\n\nDawson's Landing had a week of repose, after the election, and it needed\nit, for the frantic and variegated nightmare which had tormented it all\nthrough the preceding week had left it limp, haggard, and exhausted at\nthe end. It got the week of repose because Angelo had the legs, and\nwas in too subdued a condition to want to go out and mingle with an\nirritated community that had come to distrust and detest him because\nthere was such a lack of harmony between his morals, which were\nconfessedly excellent, and his methods of illustrating them, which\nwere distinctly damnable. The new city officers were sworn in on the\nfollowing Monday--at least all but Luigi. There was a complication in\nhis case. His election was conceded, but he could not sit in the board\nof aldermen without his brother, and his brother could not sit there\nbecause he was not a member. There seemed to be no way out of the\ndifficulty but to carry the matter into the courts, so this was resolved\nupon.\n\nThe case was set for the Monday fortnight. In due course the time\narrived. In the mean time the city government had been at a standstill,\nbecause without Luigi there was a tie in the board of aldermen, whereas\nwith him the liquor interest--the richest in the political field--would\nhave one majority. But the court decided that Angelo could not sit in\nthe board with him, either in public or executive sessions, and at the\nsame time forbade the board to deny admission to Luigi, a fairly and\nlegally chosen alderman. The case was carried up and up from court to\ncourt, yet still the same old original decision was confirmed every\ntime. As a result, the city government not only stood still, with its\nhands tied, but everything it was created to protect and care for went a\nsteady gait toward rack and ruin. There was no way to levy a tax, so the\nminor officials had to resign or starve; therefore they resigned. There\nbeing no city money, the enormous legal expenses on both sides had to be\ndefrayed by private subscription. But at last the people came to their\nsenses, and said:\n\nPudd'nhead was right at the start--we ought to have hired the official\nhalf of that human phillipene to resign; but it's too late now; some of\nus haven't got anything left to hire him with.\n\nYes, we have, said another citizen, we've got this--and he produced\na halter.\n\nMany shouted: That's the ticket. But others said: No--Count Angelo is\ninnocent; we mustn't hang him.\n\nWho said anything about hanging him? We are only going to hang the\nother one.\n\nThen that is all right--there is no objection to that.\n\nSo they hanged Luigi. And so ends the history of Those Extraordinary\nTwins.\n\n\n\n\nFINAL REMARKS\n\nAs you see, it was an extravagant sort of a tale, and had no purpose but\nto exhibit that monstrous freak in all sorts of grotesque lights. But\nwhen Roxy wandered into the tale she had to be furnished with something\nto do; so she changed the children in the cradle; this necessitated\nthe invention of a reason for it; this, in turn, resulted in making the\nchildren prominent personages--nothing could prevent it of course. Their\ncareer began to take a tragic aspect, and some one had to be brought\nin to help work the machinery; so Pudd'nhead Wilson was introduced and\ntaken on trial. By this time the whole show was being run by the\nnew people and in their interest, and the original show was become\nside-tracked and forgotten; the twin-monster, and the heroine, and the\nlads, and the old ladies had dwindled to inconsequentialities and were\nmerely in the way. Their story was one story, the new people's story\nwas another story, and there was no connection between them, no\ninterdependence, no kinship. It is not practicable or rational to try to\ntell two stories at the same time; so I dug out the farce and left the\ntragedy.\n\nThe reader already knew how the expert works; he knows now how the other\nkind do it.

{"filename": "The Gilded Age, Part 3..txt", "text": "\n\n\n\n\nProduced by David Widger\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE GILDED AGE\n\nA Tale of Today\n\nby Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner\n\n1873\n\n\nPart 3.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nMr. Harry Brierly drew his pay as an engineer while he was living at the\nCity Hotel in Hawkeye.  Mr. Thompson had been kind enough to say that it\ndidn't make any difference whether he was with the corps or not; and\nalthough Harry protested to the Colonel daily and to Washington Hawkins\nthat he must go back at once to the line and superintend the lay-out with\nreference to his contract, yet he did not go, but wrote instead long\nletters to Philip, instructing him to keep his eye out, and to let him\nknow when any difficulty occurred that required his presence.\n\nMeantime Harry blossomed out in the society of Hawkeye, as he did in any\nsociety where fortune cast him and he had the slightest opportunity to\nexpand.  Indeed the talents of a rich and accomplished young fellow like\nHarry were not likely to go unappreciated in such a place.  A land\noperator, engaged in vast speculations, a favorite in the select circles\nof New York, in correspondence with brokers and bankers, intimate with\npublic men at Washington, one who could play the guitar and touch the\nbanjo lightly, and who had an eye for a pretty girl, and knew the\nlanguage of flattery, was welcome everywhere in Hawkeye.  Even Miss Laura\nHawkins thought it worth while to use her fascinations upon him, and to\nendeavor to entangle the volatile fellow in the meshes of her\nattractions.\n\n\"Gad,\" says Harry to the Colonel, \"she's a superb creature, she'd make a\nstir in New York, money or no money.  There are men I know would give her\na railroad or an opera house, or whatever she wanted--at least they'd\npromise.\"\n\nHarry had a way of looking at women as he looked at anything else in the\nworld he wanted, and he half resolved to appropriate Miss Laura, during\nhis stay in Hawkeye.  Perhaps the Colonel divined his thoughts, or was\noffended at Harry's talk, for he replied,\n\n\"No nonsense, Mr. Brierly.  Nonsense won't do in Hawkeye, not with my\nfriends.  The Hawkins' blood is good blood, all the way from Tennessee.\nThe Hawkinses are under the weather now, but their Tennessee property is\nmillions when it comes into market.\"\n\n\"Of course, Colonel.  Not the least offense intended.  But you can see\nshe is a fascinating woman.  I was only thinking, as to this\nappropriation, now, what such a woman could do in Washington.  All\ncorrect, too, all correct.  Common thing, I assure you in Washington; the\nwives of senators, representatives, cabinet officers, all sorts of wives,\nand some who are not wives, use their influence.  You want an\nappointment?  Do you go to Senator X?  Not much.  You get on the right\nside of his wife.  Is it an appropriation?  You'd go 'straight to the\nCommittee, or to the Interior office, I suppose?  You'd learn better than\nthat.  It takes a woman to get any thing through the Land Office: I tell\nyou, Miss Laura would fascinate an appropriation right through the Senate\nand the House of Representatives in one session, if she was in\nWashington, as your friend, Colonel, of course as your friend.\"\n\n\"Would you have her sign our petition?\" asked the Colonel, innocently.\n\nHarry laughed.  \"Women don't get anything by petitioning Congress; nobody\ndoes, that's for form.  Petitions are referred somewhere, and that's the\nlast of them; you can't refer a handsome woman so easily, when she is\npresent.  They prefer 'em mostly.\"\n\nThe petition however was elaborately drawn up, with a glowing description\nof Napoleon and the adjacent country, and a statement of the absolute\nnecessity to the prosperity of that region and of one of the stations on\nthe great through route to the Pacific, of the, immediate improvement of\nColumbus River; to this was appended a map of the city and a survey of\nthe river.  It was signed by all the people at Stone's Landing who could\nwrite their names, by Col. Beriah Sellers, and the Colonel agreed to have\nthe names headed by all the senators and representatives from the state\nand by a sprinkling of ex-governors and ex-members of congress.  When\ncompleted it was a formidable document.  Its preparation and that of more\nminute plots of the new city consumed the valuable time of Sellers and\nHarry for many weeks, and served to keep them both in the highest\nspirits.\n\nIn the eyes of Washington Hawkins, Harry was a superior being, a man who\nwas able to bring things to pass in a way that excited his enthusiasm.\nHe never tired of listening to his stories of what he had done and of\nwhat he was going to do.  As for Washington, Harry thought he was a man\nof ability and comprehension, but \"too visionary,\" he told the Colonel.\nThe Colonel said he might be right, but he had never noticed anything\nvisionary about him.\n\n\"He's got his plans, sir.  God bless my soul, at his age, I was full of\nplans.  But experience sobers a man, I never touch any thing now that\nhasn't been weighed in my judgment; and when Beriah Sellers puts his\njudgment on a thing, there it is.\"\n\nWhatever might have been Harry's intentions with regard to Laura, he saw\nmore and more of her every day, until he got to be restless and nervous\nwhen he was not with her.\n\nThat consummate artist in passion allowed him to believe that the\nfascination was mainly on his side, and so worked upon his vanity, while\ninflaming his ardor, that he scarcely knew what he was about.  Her\ncoolness and coyness were even made to appear the simple precautions of a\nmodest timidity, and attracted him even more than the little tendernesses\ninto which she was occasionally surprised.  He could never be away from\nher long, day or evening; and in a short time their intimacy was the town\ntalk.  She played with him so adroitly that Harry thought she was\nabsorbed in love for him, and yet he was amazed that he did not get on\nfaster in his conquest.\n\nAnd when he thought of it, he was piqued as well.  A country girl, poor\nenough, that was evident; living with her family in a cheap and most\nunattractive frame house, such as carpenters build in America, scantily\nfurnished and unadorned; without the adventitious aids of dress or jewels\nor the fine manners of society--Harry couldn't understand it.  But she\nfascinated him, and held him just beyond the line of absolute familiarity\nat the same time.  While he was with her she made him forget that the\nHawkins' house was nothing but a wooden tenement, with four small square\nrooms on the ground floor and a half story; it might have been a palace\nfor aught he knew.\n\nPerhaps Laura was older than Harry.  She was, at any rate, at that ripe\nage when beauty in woman seems more solid than in the budding period of\ngirlhood, and she had come to understand her powers perfectly, and to\nknow exactly how much of the susceptibility and archness of the girl it\nwas profitable to retain.  She saw that many women, with the best\nintentions, make a mistake of carrying too much girlishness into\nwomanhood.  Such a woman would have attracted Harry at any time, but only\na woman with a cool brain and exquisite art could have made him lose his\nhead in this way; for Harry thought himself a man of the world.  The\nyoung fellow never dreamed that he was merely being experimented on; he\nwas to her a man of another society and another culture, different from\nthat she had any knowledge of except in books, and she was not unwilling\nto try on him the fascinations of her mind and person.\n\nFor Laura had her dreams.  She detested the narrow limits in which her\nlot was cast, she hated poverty.  Much of her reading had been of modern\nworks of fiction, written by her own sex, which had revealed to her\nsomething of her own powers and given her indeed, an exaggerated notion\nof the influence, the wealth, the position a woman may attain who has\nbeauty and talent and ambition and a little culture, and is not too\nscrupulous in the use of them.  She wanted to be rich, she wanted luxury,\nshe wanted men at her feet, her slaves, and she had not--thanks to some\nof the novels she had read--the nicest discrimination between notoriety\nand reputation; perhaps she did not know how fatal notoriety usually is\nto the bloom of womanhood.\n\nWith the other Hawkins children Laura had been brought up in the belief\nthat they had inherited a fortune in the Tennessee Lands.  She did not by\nany means share all the delusion of the family; but her brain was not\nseldom busy with schemes about it.  Washington seemed to her only to\ndream of it and to be willing to wait for its riches to fall upon him in\na golden shower; but she was impatient, and wished she were a man to take\nhold of the business.\n\n\"You men must enjoy your schemes and your activity and liberty to go\nabout the world,\" she said to Harry one day, when he had been talking of\nNew York and Washington and his incessant engagements.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied that martyr to business, \"it's all well enough, if you\ndon't have too much of it, but it only has one object.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"If a woman doesn't know, it's useless to tell her.  What do you suppose\nI am staying in Hawkeye for, week after week, when I ought to be with my\ncorps?\"\n\n\"I suppose it's your business with Col. Sellers about Napoleon, you've\nalways told me so,\" answered Laura, with a look intended to contradict\nher words.\n\n\"And now I tell you that is all arranged, I suppose you'll tell me I\nought to go?\"\n\n\"Harry!\" exclaimed Laura, touching his arm and letting her pretty hand\nrest there a moment.  \"Why should I want you to go away?  The only person\nin Hawkeye who understands me.\"\n\n\"But you refuse to understand me,\" replied Harry, flattered but still\npetulant.  \"You are like an iceberg, when we are alone.\"\n\nLaura looked up with wonder in her great eyes, and something like a blush\nsuffusing her face, followed by a look of langour that penetrated Harry's\nheart as if it had been longing.\n\n\"Did I ever show any want of confidence in you, Harry?\"  And she gave him\nher hand, which Harry pressed with effusion--something in her manner told\nhim that he must be content with that favor.\n\nIt was always so.  She excited his hopes and denied him, inflamed his\npassion and restrained it, and wound him in her toils day by day.  To\nwhat purpose?  It was keen delight to Laura to prove that she had power\nover men.\n\nLaura liked to hear about life at the east, and especially about the\nluxurious society in which Mr. Brierly moved when he was at home.  It\npleased her imagination to fancy herself a queen in it.\n\n\"You should be a winter in Washington,\" Harry said.\n\n\"But I have no acquaintances there.\"\n\n\"Don't know any of the families of the congressmen?  They like to have a\npretty woman staying with them.\"\n\n\"Not one.\"\n\n\"Suppose Col. Sellers should, have business there; say, about this\nColumbus River appropriation?\"\n\n\"Sellers!\" and Laura laughed.\n\n\"You needn't laugh.  Queerer things have happened.  Sellers knows\neverybody from Missouri, and from the West, too, for that matter.  He'd\nintroduce you to Washington life quick enough.  It doesn't need a crowbar\nto break your way into society there as it does in Philadelphia.  It's\ndemocratic, Washington is.  Money or beauty will open any door.  If I\nwere a handsome woman, I shouldn't want any better place than the capital\nto pick up a prince or a fortune.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" replied Laura.  \"But I prefer the quiet of home, and the\nlove of those I know;\" and her face wore a look of sweet contentment and\nunworldliness that finished Mr. Harry Brierly for the day.\n\nNevertheless, the hint that Harry had dropped fell upon good ground, and\nbore fruit an hundred fold; it worked in her mind until she had built up\na plan on it, and almost a career for herself.  Why not, she said, why\nshouldn't I do as other women have done?  She took the first opportunity\nto see Col. Sellers, and to sound him about the Washington visit.  How\nwas he getting on with his navigation scheme, would it be likely to take\nhim from home to Jefferson City; or to Washington, perhaps?\n\n\"Well, maybe.  If the people of Napoleon want me to go to Washington, and\nlook after that matter, I might tear myself from my home.  It's been\nsuggested to me, but--not a word of it to Mrs. Sellers and the children.\nMaybe they wouldn't like to think of their father in Washington.  But\nDilworthy, Senator Dilworthy, says to me, 'Colonel, you are the man, you\ncould influence more votes than any one else on such a measure, an old\nsettler, a man of the people, you know the wants of Missouri; you've a\nrespect for religion too, says he, and know how the cause of the gospel\ngoes with improvements: Which is true enough, Miss Laura, and hasn't been\nenough thought of in connection with Napoleon.  He's an able man,\nDilworthy, and a good man.  A man has got to be good to succeed as he\nhas.  He's only been in Congress a few years, and he must be worth a\nmillion.  First thing in the morning when he stayed with me he asked\nabout family prayers, whether we had 'em before or after breakfast.\nI hated to disappoint the Senator, but I had to out with it, tell him we\ndidn't have 'em, not steady.  He said he understood, business\ninterruptions and all that, some men were well enough without, but as for\nhim he never neglected the ordinances of religion.  He doubted if the\nColumbus River appropriation would succeed if we did not invoke the\nDivine Blessing on it.\"\n\nPerhaps it is unnecessary to say to the reader that Senator Dilworthy had\nnot stayed with Col. Sellers while he was in Hawkeye; this visit to his\nhouse being only one of the Colonel's hallucinations--one of those\ninstant creations of his fertile fancy, which were always flashing into\nhis brain and out of his mouth in the course of any conversation and\nwithout interrupting the flow of it.\n\nDuring the summer Philip rode across the country and made a short visit\nin Hawkeye, giving Harry an opportunity to show him the progress that he\nand the Colonel had made in their operation at Stone's Landing, to\nintroduce him also to Laura, and to borrow a little money when he\ndeparted.  Harry bragged about his conquest, as was his habit, and took\nPhilip round to see his western prize.\n\nLaura received Mr. Philip with a courtesy and a slight hauteur that\nrather surprised and not a little interested him.  He saw at once that\nshe was older than Harry, and soon made up his mind that she was leading\nhis friend a country dance to which he was unaccustomed.  At least he\nthought he saw that, and half hinted as much to Harry, who flared up at\nonce; but on a second visit Philip was not so sure, the young lady was\ncertainly kind and friendly and almost confiding with Harry, and treated\nPhilip with the greatest consideration.  She deferred to his opinions,\nand listened attentively when he talked, and in time met his frank manner\nwith an equal frankness, so that he was quite convinced that whatever she\nmight feel towards Harry, she was sincere with him.  Perhaps his manly\nway did win her liking.  Perhaps in her mind, she compared him with\nHarry, and recognized in him a man to whom a woman might give her whole\nsoul, recklessly and with little care if she lost it.  Philip was not\ninvincible to her beauty nor to the intellectual charm of her presence.\n\nThe week seemed very short that he passed in Hawkeye, and when he bade\nLaura good by, he seemed to have known her a year.\n\n\"We shall see you again, Mr. Sterling,\" she said as she gave him her\nhand, with just a shade of sadness in her handsome eyes.\n\nAnd when he turned away she followed him with a look that might have\ndisturbed his serenity, if he had not at the moment had a little square\nletter in his breast pocket, dated at Philadelphia, and signed \"Ruth.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nThe visit of Senator Abner Dilworthy was an event in Hawkeye.  When a\nSenator, whose place is in Washington moving among the Great and guiding\nthe destinies of the nation, condescends to mingle among the people and\naccept the hospitalities of such a place as Hawkeye, the honor is not\nconsidered a light one.  All, parties are flattered by it and politics\nare forgotten in the presence of one so distinguished among his fellows.\n\nSenator Dilworthy, who was from a neighboring state, had been a Unionist\nin the darkest days of his country, and had thriven by it, but was that\nany reason why Col. Sellers, who had been a confederate and had not\nthriven by it, should give him the cold shoulder?\n\nThe Senator was the guest of his old friend Gen. Boswell, but it almost\nappeared that he was indebted to Col. Sellers for the unreserved\nhospitalities of the town.  It was the large hearted Colonel who, in a\nmanner, gave him the freedom of the city.\n\n\"You are known here, sir,\" said the Colonel, \"and Hawkeye is proud of\nyou.  You will find every door open, and a welcome at every hearthstone.\nI should insist upon your going to my house, if you were not claimed by\nyour older friend Gen. Boswell.  But you will mingle with our people, and\nyou will see here developments that will surprise you.\"\n\nThe Colonel was so profuse in his hospitality that he must have made the\nimpression upon himself that he had entertained the Senator at his own\nmansion during his stay; at any rate, he afterwards always spoke of him\nas his guest, and not seldom referred to the Senator's relish of certain\nviands on his table.  He did, in fact, press him to dine upon the morning\nof the day the Senator was going away.\n\nSenator Dilworthy was large and portly, though not tall--a pleasant\nspoken man, a popular man with the people.\n\nHe took a lively interest in the town and all the surrounding country,\nand made many inquiries as to the progress of agriculture, of education,\nand of religion, and especially as to the condition of the emancipated\nrace.\n\n\"Providence,\" he said, \"has placed them in our hands, and although you\nand I, General, might have chosen a different destiny for them, under the\nConstitution, yet Providence knows best.\"\n\n\"You can't do much with 'em,\" interrupted Col. Sellers.  \"They are a\nspeculating race, sir, disinclined to work for white folks without\nsecurity, planning how to live by only working for themselves.  Idle,\nsir, there's my garden just a ruin of weeds.  Nothing practical in 'em.\"\n\n\"There is some truth in your observation, Colonel, but you must educate\nthem.\"\n\n\"You educate the niggro and you make him more speculating than he was\nbefore.  If he won't stick to any industry except for himself now, what\nwill he do then?\"\n\n\"But, Colonel, the negro when educated will be more able to make his\nspeculations fruitful.\"\n\n\"Never, sir, never.  He would only have a wider scope to injure himself.\nA niggro has no grasp, sir.  Now, a white man can conceive great\noperations, and carry them out; a niggro can't.\"\n\n\"Still,\" replied the Senator, \"granting that he might injure himself in a\nworldly point of view, his elevation through education would multiply his\nchances for the hereafter--which is the important thing after all,\nColonel.  And no matter what the result is, we must fulfill our duty by\nthis being.\"\n\n\"I'd elevate his soul,\" promptly responded the Colonel; \"that's just it;\nyou can't make his soul too immortal, but I wouldn't touch him, himself.\nYes, sir!  make his soul immortal, but don't disturb the niggro as he\nis.\"\n\nOf course one of the entertainments offered the Senator was a public\nreception, held in the court house, at which he made a speech to his\nfellow citizens.  Col. Sellers was master of ceremonies.  He escorted the\nband from the city hotel to Gen. Boswell's; he marshalled the procession\nof Masons, of Odd Fellows, and of Firemen, the Good Templars, the Sons of\nTemperance, the Cadets of Temperance, the Daughters of Rebecca, the\nSunday School children, and citizens generally, which followed the\nSenator to the court house; he bustled about the room long after every\none else was seated, and loudly cried \"Order!\" in the dead silence which\npreceded the introduction of the Senator by Gen. Boswell.  The occasion\nwas one to call out his finest powers of personal appearance, and one he\nlong dwelt on with pleasure.\n\nThis not being an edition of the Congressional Globe it is impossible to\ngive Senator Dilworthy's speech in full.  He began somewhat as follows:\n\n\"Fellow citizens: It gives me great pleasure to thus meet and mingle with\nyou, to lay aside for a moment the heavy duties of an official and\nburdensome station, and confer in familiar converse with my friends in\nyour great state.  The good opinion of my fellow citizens of all sections\nis the sweetest solace in all my anxieties.  I look forward with longing\nto the time when I can lay aside the cares of office--\" [\"dam sight,\"\nshouted a tipsy fellow near the door.  Cries of \"put him out.\"]\n\n\"My friends, do not remove him.  Let the misguided man stay.  I see that\nhe is a victim of that evil which is swallowing up public virtue and\nsapping the foundation of society.  As I was saying, when I can lay down\nthe cares of office and retire to the sweets of private life in some such\nsweet, peaceful, intelligent, wide-awake and patriotic place as Hawkeye\n(applause).  I have traveled much, I have seen all parts of our glorious\nunion, but I have never seen a lovelier village than yours, or one that\nhas more signs of commercial and industrial and religious prosperity\n--(more applause).\"\n\nThe Senator then launched into a sketch of our great country, and dwelt\nfor an hour or more upon its prosperity and the dangers which threatened\nit.\n\nHe then touched reverently upon the institutions of religion, and upon\nthe necessity of private purity, if we were to have any public morality.\n\"I trust,\" he said, \"that there are children within the sound of my\nvoice,\" and after some remarks to them, the Senator closed with an\napostrophe to \"the genius of American Liberty, walking with the Sunday\nSchool in one hand and Temperance in the other up the glorified steps of\nthe National Capitol.\"\n\nCol. Sellers did not of course lose the opportunity to impress upon so\ninfluential a person as the Senator the desirability of improving the\nnavigation of Columbus river.  He and Mr. Brierly took the Senator over\nto Napoleon and opened to him their plan.  It was a plan that the Senator\ncould understand without a great deal of explanation, for he seemed to be\nfamiliar with the like improvements elsewhere.  When, however, they\nreached Stone's Landing the Senator looked about him and inquired,\n\n\"Is this Napoleon?\"\n\n\"This is the nucleus, the nucleus,\" said the Colonel, unrolling his map.\n\"Here is the deepo, the church, the City Hall and so on.\"\n\n\"Ah, I see.  How far from here is Columbus River?  Does that stream\nempty----\"\n\n\"That, why, that's Goose Run.  Thar ain't no Columbus, thout'n it's over\nto Hawkeye,\" interrupted one of the citizens, who had come out to stare\nat the strangers.  \"A railroad come here last summer, but it haint been\nhere no mo'.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the Colonel hastened to explain, \"in the old records\nColumbus River is called Goose Run.  You see how it sweeps round the\ntown--forty-nine miles to the Missouri; sloop navigation all the way\npretty much, drains this whole country; when it's improved steamboats\nwill run right up here.  It's got to be enlarged, deepened.  You see by\nthe map. Columbus River.  This country must have water communication!\"\n\n\"You'll want a considerable appropriation, Col. Sellers.\n\n\"I should say a million; is that your figure Mr. Brierly.\"\n\n\"According to our surveys,\" said Harry, \"a million would do it; a million\nspent on the river would make Napoleon worth two millions at least.\"\n\n\"I see,\" nodded the Senator.  \"But you'd better begin by asking only for\ntwo or three hundred thousand, the usual way.  You can begin to sell town\nlots on that appropriation you know.\"\n\nThe Senator, himself, to do him justice, was not very much interested in\nthe country or the stream, but he favored the appropriation, and he gave\nthe Colonel and Mr. Brierly to and understand that he would endeavor to\nget it through.  Harry, who thought he was shrewd and understood\nWashington, suggested an interest.\n\nBut he saw that the Senator was wounded by the suggestion.\n\n\"You will offend me by repeating such an observation,\" he said.\n\"Whatever I do will be for the public interest.  It will require a\nportion of the appropriation for necessary expenses, and I am sorry to\nsay that there are members who will have to be seen.  But you can reckon\nupon my humble services.\"\n\nThis aspect of the subject was not again alluded to.  The Senator\npossessed himself of the facts, not from his observation of the ground,\nbut from the lips of Col. Sellers, and laid the appropriation scheme away\namong his other plans for benefiting the public.\n\nIt was on this visit also that the Senator made the acquaintance of Mr.\nWashington Hawkins, and was greatly taken with his innocence, his\nguileless manner and perhaps with his ready adaptability to enter upon\nany plan proposed.\n\nCol. Sellers was pleased to see this interest that Washington had\nawakened, especially since it was likely to further his expectations with\nregard to the Tennessee lands; the Senator having remarked to the\nColonel, that he delighted to help any deserving young man, when the\npromotion of a private advantage could at the same time be made to\ncontribute to the general good.  And he did not doubt that this was an\nopportunity of that kind.\n\nThe result of several conferences with Washington was that the Senator\nproposed that he should go to Washington with him and become his private\nsecretary and the secretary of his committee; a proposal which was\neagerly accepted.\n\nThe Senator spent Sunday in Hawkeye and attended church.  He cheered the\nheart of the worthy and zealous minister by an expression of his sympathy\nin his labors, and by many inquiries in regard to the religious state of\nthe region.  It was not a very promising state, and the good man felt how\nmuch lighter his task would be, if he had the aid of such a man as\nSenator Dilworthy.\n\n\"I am glad to see, my dear sir,\" said the Senator, \"that you give them\nthe doctrines.  It is owing to a neglect of the doctrines, that there is\nsuch a fearful falling away in the country.  I wish that we might have\nyou in Washington--as chaplain, now, in the senate.\"\n\nThe good man could not but be a little flattered, and if sometimes,\nthereafter, in his discouraging work, he allowed the thought that he\nmight perhaps be called to Washington as chaplain of the Senate, to cheer\nhim, who can wonder.  The Senator's commendation at least did one service\nfor him, it elevated him in the opinion of Hawkeye.\n\nLaura was at church alone that day, and Mr. Brierly walked home with her.\nA part of their way lay with that of General Boswell and Senator\nDilworthy, and introductions were made.  Laura had her own reasons for\nwishing to know the Senator, and the Senator was not a man who could be\ncalled indifferent to charms such as hers.  That meek young lady so\ncommended herself to him in the short walk, that he announced his\nintentions of paying his respects to her the next day, an intention which\nHarry received glumly; and when the Senator was out of hearing he called\nhim \"an old fool.\"\n\n\"Fie,\" said Laura, \"I do believe you are jealous, Harry.  He is a very\npleasant man.  He said you were a young man of great promise.\"\n\nThe Senator did call next day, and the result of his visit was that he\nwas confirmed in his impression that there was something about him very\nattractive to ladies.  He saw Laura again and again daring his stay, and\nfelt more and more the subtle influence of her feminine beauty, which\nevery man felt who came near her.\n\nHarry was beside himself with rage while the Senator remained in town;\nhe declared that women were always ready to drop any man for higher game;\nand he attributed his own ill-luck to the Senator's appearance.  The\nfellow was in fact crazy about her beauty and ready to beat his brains\nout in chagrin.  Perhaps Laura enjoyed his torment, but she soothed him\nwith blandishments that increased his ardor, and she smiled to herself to\nthink that he had, with all his protestations of love, never spoken of\nmarriage.  Probably the vivacious fellow never had thought of it.  At any\nrate when he at length went away from Hawkeye he was no nearer it.  But\nthere was no telling to what desperate lengths his passion might not\ncarry him.\n\nLaura bade him good bye with tender regret, which, however, did not\ndisturb her peace or interfere with her plans.  The visit of Senator\nDilworthy had become of more importance to her, and it by and by bore the\nfruit she longed for, in an invitation to visit his family in the\nNational Capital during the winter session of Congress.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n                              O lift your natures up:\n               Embrace our aims: work out your freedom.  Girls,\n               Knowledge is now no more a fountain sealed;\n               Drink deep until the habits of the slave,\n               The sins of emptiness, gossip and spite\n               And slander, die.\n                                   The Princess.\n\nWhether medicine is a science, or only an empirical method of getting a\nliving out of the ignorance of the human race, Ruth found before her\nfirst term was over at the medical school that there were other things\nshe needed to know quite as much as that which is taught in medical\nbooks, and that she could never satisfy her aspirations without more\ngeneral culture.\n\n\"Does your doctor know any thing--I don't mean about medicine, but about\nthings in general, is he a man of information and good sense?\" once asked\nan old practitioner.  \"If he doesn't know any thing but medicine the\nchance is he doesn't know that:\"\n\nThe close application to her special study was beginning to tell upon\nRuth's delicate health also, and the summer brought with it only\nweariness and indisposition for any mental effort.\n\nIn this condition of mind and body the quiet of her home and the\nunexciting companionship of those about her were more than ever tiresome.\n\nShe followed with more interest Philip's sparkling account of his life\nin the west, and longed for his experiences, and to know some of those\npeople of a world so different from here, who alternately amused and\ndispleased him.  He at least was learning the world, the good and the bad\nof it, as must happen to every one who accomplishes anything in it.\n\nBut what, Ruth wrote, could a woman do, tied up by custom, and cast into\nparticular circumstances out of which it was almost impossible to\nextricate herself?  Philip thought that he would go some day and\nextricate Ruth, but he did not write that, for he had the instinct to\nknow that this was not the extrication she dreamed of, and that she must\nfind out by her own experience what her heart really wanted.\n\nPhilip was not a philosopher, to be sure, but he had the old fashioned\nnotion, that whatever a woman's theories of life might be, she would come\nround to matrimony, only give her time.  He could indeed recall to mind\none woman--and he never knew a nobler--whose whole soul was devoted and\nwho believed that her life was consecrated to a certain benevolent\nproject in singleness of life, who yielded to the touch of matrimony, as\nan icicle yields to a sunbeam.\n\nNeither at home nor elsewhere did Ruth utter any complaint, or admit any\nweariness or doubt of her ability to pursue the path she had marked out\nfor herself.  But her mother saw clearly enough her struggle with\ninfirmity, and was not deceived by either her gaiety or by the cheerful\ncomposure which she carried into all the ordinary duties that fell to\nher.  She saw plainly enough that Ruth needed an entire change of scene\nand of occupation, and perhaps she believed that such a change, with the\nknowledge of the world it would bring, would divert Ruth from a course\nfor which she felt she was physically entirely unfitted.\n\nIt therefore suited the wishes of all concerned, when autumn came, that\nRuth should go away to school.  She selected a large New England\nSeminary, of which she had often heard Philip speak, which was attended\nby both sexes and offered almost collegiate advantages of education.\nThither she went in September, and began for the second time in the year\na life new to her.\n\nThe Seminary was the chief feature of Fallkill, a village of two to three\nthousand inhabitants.  It was a prosperous school, with three hundred\nstudents, a large corps of teachers, men and women, and with a venerable\nrusty row of academic buildings on the shaded square of the town.  The\nstudents lodged and boarded in private families in the place, and so it\ncame about that while the school did a great deal to support the town,\nthe town gave the students society and the sweet influences of home life.\nIt is at least respectful to say that the influences of home life are\nsweet.\n\nRuth's home, by the intervention of Philip, was in a family--one of the\nrare exceptions in life or in fiction--that had never known better days.\nThe Montagues, it is perhaps well to say, had intended to come over in\nthe Mayflower, but were detained at Delft Haven by the illness of a\nchild.  They came over to Massachusetts Bay in another vessel, and thus\nescaped the onus of that brevet nobility under which the successors of\nthe Mayflower Pilgrims have descended.  Having no factitious weight of\ndignity to carry, the Montagues steadily improved their condition from\nthe day they landed, and they were never more vigorous or prosperous than\nat the date of this narrative.  With character compacted by the rigid\nPuritan discipline of more than two centuries, they had retained its\nstrength and purity and thrown off its narrowness, and were now\nblossoming under the generous modern influences.  Squire Oliver Montague,\na lawyer who had retired from the practice of his profession except in\nrare cases, dwelt in a square old fashioned New England mile away from\nthe green.  It was called a mansion because it stood alone with ample\nfields about it, and had an avenue of trees leading to it from the road,\nand on the west commanded a view of a pretty little lake with gentle\nslopes and nodding were now blossoming under the generous modern\ninfluences.  Squire Oliver Montague, a lawyer who had retired from the\npractice of his profession except in rare cases, dwelt in a square old\nfashioned New England groves.  But it was just a plain, roomy house,\ncapable of extending to many guests an unpretending hospitality.\n\nThe family consisted of the Squire and his wife, a son and a daughter\nmarried and not at home, a son in college at Cambridge, another son at\nthe Seminary, and a daughter Alice, who was a year or more older than\nRuth.  Having only riches enough to be able to gratify reasonable\ndesires, and yet make their gratifications always a novelty and a\npleasure, the family occupied that just mean in life which is so rarely\nattained, and still more rarely enjoyed without discontent.\n\nIf Ruth did not find so much luxury in the house as in her own home,\nthere were evidences of culture, of intellectual activity and of a zest\nin the affairs of all the world, which greatly impressed her.  Every room\nhad its book-cases or book-shelves, and was more or less a library; upon\nevery table was liable to be a litter of new books, fresh periodicals and\ndaily newspapers.  There were plants in the sunny windows and some choice\nengravings on the walls, with bits of color in oil or water-colors;\nthe piano was sure to be open and strewn with music; and there were\nphotographs and little souvenirs here and there of foreign travel.\nAn absence of any \"what-pots\" in the corners with rows of cheerful\nshells, and Hindoo gods, and Chinese idols, and nests of use less boxes\nof lacquered wood, might be taken as denoting a languidness in the family\nconcerning foreign missions, but perhaps unjustly.\n\nAt any rate the life of the world flowed freely into this hospitable\nhouse, and there was always so much talk there of the news of the day,\nof the new books and of authors, of Boston radicalism and New York\ncivilization, and the virtue of Congress, that small gossip stood a very\npoor chance.\n\nAll this was in many ways so new to Ruth that she seemed to have passed\ninto another world, in which she experienced a freedom and a mental\nexhilaration unknown to her before.  Under this influence she entered\nupon her studies with keen enjoyment, finding for a time all the\nrelaxation she needed, in the charming social life at the Montague house.\n\nIt is strange, she wrote to Philip, in one of her occasional letters,\nthat you never told me more about this delightful family, and scarcely\nmentioned Alice who is the life of it, just the noblest girl, unselfish,\nknows how to do so many things, with lots of talent, with a dry humor,\nand an odd way of looking at things, and yet quiet and even serious\noften--one of your \"capable\" New England girls.  We shall be great\nfriends.  It had never occurred to Philip that there was any thing\nextraordinary about the family that needed mention.  He knew dozens of\ngirls like Alice, he thought to himself, but only one like Ruth.\n\nGood friends the two girls were from the beginning.  Ruth was a study to\nAlice; the product of a culture entirely foreign to her experience, so\nmuch a child in some things, so much a woman in others; and Ruth in turn,\nit must be confessed, probing Alice sometimes with her serious grey eyes,\nwondered what her object in life was, and whether she had any purpose\nbeyond living as she now saw her.  For she could scarcely conceive of a\nlife that should not be devoted to the accomplishment of some definite\nwork, and she had-no doubt that in her own case everything else would\nyield to the professional career she had marked out.\n\n\"So you know Philip Sterling,\" said Ruth one day as the girls sat at\ntheir sewing.  Ruth never embroidered, and never sewed when she could\navoid it.  Bless her.\n\n\"Oh yes, we are old friends.  Philip used to come to Fallkill often while\nhe was in college.  He was once rusticated here for a term.\"\n\n\"Rusticated?\"\n\n\"Suspended for some College scrape.  He was a great favorite here.\nFather and he were famous friends.  Father said that Philip had no end of\nnonsense in him and was always blundering into something, but he was a\nroyal good fellow and would come out all right.\"\n\n\"Did you think he was fickle?\"\n\n\"Why, I never thought whether he was or not,\" replied Alice looking up.\n\"I suppose he was always in love with some girl or another, as college\nboys are.  He used to make me his confidant now and then, and be terribly\nin the dumps.\"\n\n\"Why did he come to you?\" pursued Ruth you were younger than he.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know.  He was at our house a good deal.  Once at a\npicnic by the lake, at the risk of his own life, he saved sister Millie\nfrom drowning, and we all liked to have him here.  Perhaps he thought as\nhe had saved one sister, the other ought to help him when he was in\ntrouble.  I don't know.\"\n\nThe fact was that Alice was a person who invited confidences, because she\nnever betrayed them, and gave abundant sympathy in return.  There are\npersons, whom we all know, to whom human confidences, troubles and\nheart-aches flow as naturally its streams to a placid lake.\n\nThis is not a history of Fallkill, nor of the Montague family, worthy as\nboth are of that honor, and this narrative cannot be diverted into long\nloitering with them.  If the reader visits the village to-day, he will\ndoubtless be pointed out the Montague dwelling, where Ruth lived, the\ncross-lots path she traversed to the Seminary, and the venerable chapel\nwith its cracked bell.\n\nIn the little society of the place, the Quaker girl was a favorite, and\nno considerable social gathering or pleasure party was thought complete\nwithout her.  There was something in this seemingly transparent and yet\ndeep character, in her childlike gaiety and enjoyment of the society\nabout her, and in her not seldom absorption in herself, that would have\nmade her long remembered there if no events had subsequently occurred to\nrecall her to mind.\n\nTo the surprise of Alice, Ruth took to the small gaieties of the village\nwith a zest of enjoyment that seemed foreign to one who had devoted her\nlife to a serious profession from the highest motives.  Alice liked\nsociety well enough, she thought, but there was nothing exciting in that\nof Fallkill, nor anything novel in the attentions of the well-bred young\ngentlemen one met in it.  It must have worn a different aspect to Ruth,\nfor she entered into its pleasures at first with curiosity, and then with\ninterest and finally with a kind of staid abandon that no one would have\ndeemed possible for her.  Parties, picnics, rowing-matches, moonlight\nstrolls, nutting expeditions in the October woods,--Alice declared that\nit was a whirl of dissipation.  The fondness of Ruth, which was scarcely\ndisguised, for the company of agreeable young fellows, who talked\nnothings, gave Alice opportunity for no end of banter.\n\n\"Do you look upon them as I subjects, dear?\" she would ask.\n\nAnd Ruth laughed her merriest laugh, and then looked sober again.\nPerhaps she was thinking, after all, whether she knew herself.\n\nIf you should rear a duck in the heart of the Sahara, no doubt it would\nswim if you brought it to the Nile.\n\nSurely no one would have predicted when Ruth left Philadelphia that she\nwould become absorbed to this extent, and so happy, in a life so unlike\nthat she thought she desired.  But no one can tell how a woman will act\nunder any circumstances.  The reason novelists nearly always fail in\ndepicting women when they make them act, is that they let them do what\nthey have observed some woman has done at sometime or another.  And that\nis where they make a mistake; for a woman will never do again what has\nbeen done before.  It is this uncertainty that causes women, considered\nas materials for fiction, to be so interesting to themselves and to\nothers.\n\nAs the fall went on and the winter, Ruth did not distinguish herself\ngreatly at the Fallkill Seminary as a student, a fact that apparently\ngave her no anxiety, and did not diminish her enjoyment of a new sort of\npower which had awakened within her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\nIn mid-winter, an event occurred of unusual interest to the inhabitants\nof the Montague house, and to the friends of the young ladies who sought\ntheir society.\n\nThis was the arrival at the Sassacua Hotel of two young gentlemen from\nthe west.\n\nIt is the fashion in New England to give Indian names to the public\nhouses, not that the late lamented savage knew how to keep a hotel, but\nthat his warlike name may impress the traveler who humbly craves shelter\nthere, and make him grateful to the noble and gentlemanly clerk if he is\nallowed to depart with his scalp safe.\n\nThe two young gentlemen were neither students for the Fallkill Seminary,\nnor lecturers on physiology, nor yet life assurance solicitors, three\nsuppositions that almost exhausted the guessing power of the people at\nthe hotel in respect to the names of \"Philip Sterling and Henry Brierly,\nMissouri,\" on the register.  They were handsome enough fellows, that was\nevident, browned by out-door exposure, and with a free and lordly way\nabout them that almost awed the hotel clerk himself.  Indeed, he very\nsoon set down Mr. Brierly as a gentleman of large fortune, with enormous\ninterests on his shoulders.  Harry had a way of casually mentioning\nwestern investments, through lines, the freighting business, and the\nroute through the Indian territory to Lower California, which was\ncalculated to give an importance to his lightest word.\n\n\"You've a pleasant town here, sir, and the most comfortable looking hotel\nI've seen out of New York,\" said Harry to the clerk; \"we shall stay here\na few days if you can give us a roomy suite of apartments.\"\n\nHarry usually had the best of everything, wherever he went, as such\nfellows always do have in this accommodating world.  Philip would have\nbeen quite content with less expensive quarters, but there was no\nresisting Harry's generosity in such matters.\n\nRailroad surveying and real-estate operations were at a standstill during\nthe winter in Missouri, and the young men had taken advantage of the lull\nto come east, Philip to see if there was any disposition in his friends,\nthe railway contractors, to give him a share in the Salt Lick Union\nPacific Extension, and Harry to open out to his uncle the prospects of\nthe new city at Stone's Landing, and to procure congressional\nappropriations for the harbor and for making Goose Run navigable.  Harry\nhad with him a map of that noble stream and of the harbor, with a perfect\nnet-work of railroads centering in it, pictures of wharves, crowded with\nsteamboats, and of huge grain-elevators on the bank, all of which grew\nout of the combined imaginations of Col. Sellers and Mr. Brierly.  The\nColonel had entire confidence in Harry's influence with Wall street, and\nwith congressmen, to bring about the consummation of their scheme, and he\nwaited his return in the empty house at Hawkeye, feeding his pinched\nfamily upon the most gorgeous expectations with a reckless prodigality.\n\n\"Don't let 'em into the thing more than is necessary,\" says the Colonel\nto Harry; \"give 'em a small interest; a lot apiece in the suburbs of the\nLanding ought to do a congressman, but I reckon you'll have to mortgage a\npart of the city itself to the brokers.\"\n\nHarry did not find that eagerness to lend money on Stone's Landing in\nWall street which Col. Sellers had expected, (it had seen too many such\nmaps as he exhibited), although his uncle and some of the brokers looked\nwith more favor on the appropriation for improving the navigation of\nColumbus River, and were not disinclined to form a company for that\npurpose.  An appropriation was a tangible thing, if you could get hold of\nit, and it made little difference what it was appropriated for, so long\nas you got hold of it.\n\nPending these weighty negotiations, Philip has persuaded Harry to take a\nlittle run up to Fallkill, a not difficult task, for that young man would\nat any time have turned his back upon all the land in the West at sight\nof a new and pretty face, and he had, it must be confessed, a facility in\nlove making which made it not at all an interference with the more\nserious business of life.  He could not, to be sure, conceive how Philip\ncould be interested in a young lady who was studying medicine, but he had\nno objection to going, for he did not doubt that there were other girls\nin Fallkill who were worth a week's attention.\n\nThe young men were received at the house of the Montagues with the\nhospitality which never failed there.\n\n\"We are glad to see you again,\" exclaimed the Squire heartily, \"you are\nwelcome Mr. Brierly, any friend of Phil's is welcome at our house\"\n\n\"It's more like home to me, than any place except my own home,\" cried\nPhilip, as he looked about the cheerful house and went through a general\nhand-shaking.\n\n\"It's a long time, though, since you have been here to say so,\" Alice\nsaid, with her father's frankness of manner; \"and I suspect we owe the\nvisit now to your sudden interest in the Fallkill Seminary.\"\n\nPhilip's color came, as it had an awkward way of doing in his tell-tale\nface, but before he could stammer a reply, Harry came in with,\n\n\"That accounts for Phil's wish to build a Seminary at Stone's Landing,\nour place in Missouri, when Col. Sellers insisted it should be a\nUniversity.  Phil appears to have a weakness for Seminaries.\"\n\n\"It would have been better for your friend Sellers,\" retorted Philip,\n\"if he had had a weakness for district schools.  Col. Sellers, Miss\nAlice, is a great friend of Harry's, who is always trying to build a\nhouse by beginning at the top.\"\n\n\"I suppose it's as easy to build a University on paper as a Seminary, and\nit looks better,\" was Harry's reflection; at which the Squire laughed,\nand said he quite agreed with him.  The old gentleman understood Stone's\nLanding a good deal better than he would have done after an hour's talk\nwith either of it's expectant proprietors.\n\nAt this moment, and while Philip was trying to frame a question that he\nfound it exceedingly difficult to put into words, the door opened\nquietly, and Ruth entered.  Taking in the, group with a quick glance, her\neye lighted up, and with a merry smile she advanced and shook hands with\nPhilip.  She was so unconstrained and sincerely cordial, that it made\nthat hero of the west feel somehow young, and very ill at ease.\n\nFor months and months he had thought of this meeting and pictured it to\nhimself a hundred times, but he had never imagined it would be like this.\nHe should meet Ruth unexpectedly, as she was walking alone from the\nschool, perhaps, or entering the room where he was waiting for her, and\nshe would cry \"Oh!  Phil,\" and then check herself, and perhaps blush, and\nPhilip calm but eager and enthusiastic, would reassure her by his warm\nmanner, and he would take her hand impressively, and she would look up\ntimidly, and, after his' long absence, perhaps he would be permitted to\nGood heavens, how many times he had come to this point, and wondered if\nit could happen so.  Well, well; he had never supposed that he should be\nthe one embarrassed, and above all by a sincere and cordial welcome.\n\n\"We heard you were at the Sassacus House,\" were Ruth's first words; \"and\nthis I suppose is your friend?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" Philip at length blundered out, \"this is Mr. Brierly\nof whom I have written you.\"\n\nAnd Ruth welcomed Harry with a friendliness that Philip thought was due\nto his friend, to be sure, but which seemed to him too level with her\nreception of himself, but which Harry received as his due from the other\nsex.\n\nQuestions were asked about the journey and about the West, and the\nconversation became a general one, until Philip at length found himself\ntalking with the Squire in relation to land and railroads and things he\ncouldn't keep his mind on especially as he heard Ruth and Harry in an\nanimated discourse, and caught the words \"New York,\" and \"opera,\" and\n\"reception,\" and knew that Harry was giving his imagination full range in\nthe world of fashion.\n\nHarry knew all about the opera, green room and all (at least he said so)\nand knew a good many of the operas and could make very entertaining\nstories of their plots, telling how the soprano came in here, and the\nbasso here, humming the beginning of their airs--tum-ti-tum-ti-ti\n--suggesting the profound dissatisfaction of the basso recitative--down\n--among--the--dead--men--and touching off the whole with an airy grace\nquite captivating; though he couldn't have sung a single air through to\nsave himself, and he hadn't an ear to know whether it was sung correctly.\nAll the same he doted on the opera, and kept a box there, into which he\nlounged occasionally to hear a favorite scene and meet his society\nfriends.\n\nIf Ruth was ever in the city he should be happy to place his box at the\ndisposal of Ruth and her friends.  Needless to say that she was delighted\nwith the offer.\n\nWhen she told Philip of it, that discreet young fellow only smiled, and\nsaid that he hoped she would be fortunate enough to be in New York some\nevening when Harry had not already given the use of his private box to\nsome other friend.\n\nThe Squire pressed the visitors to let him send for their trunks and\nurged them to stay at his house, and Alice joined in the invitation, but\nPhilip had reasons for declining.  They staid to supper, however, and in;\nthe evening Philip had a long talk apart with Ruth, a delightful hour to\nhim, in which she spoke freely of herself as of old, of her studies at\nPhiladelphia and of her plans, and she entered into his adventures and\nprospects in the West with a genuine and almost sisterly interest; an\ninterest, however, which did not exactly satisfy Philip--it was too\ngeneral and not personal enough to suit him.  And with all her freedom in\nspeaking of her own hopes, Philip could not, detect any reference to\nhimself in them; whereas he never undertook anything that he did not\nthink of Ruth in connection with it, he never made a plan that had not\nreference to her, and he never thought of anything as complete if she\ncould not share it.  Fortune, reputation these had no value to him except\nin Ruth's eyes, and there were times when it seemed to him that if Ruth\nwas not on this earth, he should plunge off into some remote wilderness\nand live in a purposeless seclusion.\n\n\"I hoped,\" said Philip; \"to get a little start in connection with this\nnew railroad, and make a little money, so that I could came east and\nengage in something more suited to my tastes.  I shouldn't like to live\nin the West.  Would you?\n\n\"It never occurred to me whether I would or not,\" was the unembarrassed\nreply.  \"One of our graduates went to Chicago, and has a nice practice\nthere.  I don't know where I shall go.  It would mortify mother\ndreadfully to have me driving about Philadelphia in a doctor's gig.\"\n\nPhilip laughed at the idea of it.  \"And does it seem as necessary to you\nto do it as it did before you came to Fallkill?\"\n\nIt was a home question, and went deeper than Philip knew, for Ruth at\nonce thought of practicing her profession among the young gentlemen and\nladies of her acquaintance in the village; but she was reluctant to admit\nto herself that her notions of a career had undergone any change.\n\n\"Oh, I don't think I should come to Fallkill to practice, but I must do\nsomething when I am through school; and why not medicine?\"\n\nPhilip would like to have explained why not, but the explanation would be\nof no use if it were not already obvious to Ruth.\n\nHarry was equally in his element whether instructing Squire Montague\nabout the investment of capital in Missouri, the improvement of Columbus\nRiver, the project he and some gentlemen in New York had for making a\nshorter Pacific connection with the Mississippi than the present one; or\ndiverting Mrs. Montague with his experience in cooking in camp; or\ndrawing for Miss Alice an amusing picture of the social contrasts of New\nEngland and the border where he had been. Harry was a very entertaining\nfellow, having his imagination to help his memory, and telling his\nstories as if he believed them--as perhaps he did. Alice was greatly\namused with Harry and listened so seriously to his romancing that he\nexceeded his usual limits.  Chance allusions to his bachelor\nestablishment in town and the place of his family on the Hudson, could\nnot have been made by a millionaire, more naturally.\n\n\"I should think,\" queried Alice, \"you would rather stay in New York than\nto try the rough life at the West you have been speaking of.\"\n\n\"Oh, adventure,\" says Harry, \"I get tired of New York.  And besides I\ngot involved in some operations that I had to see through.  Parties in\nNew York only last week wanted me to go down into Arizona in a big\ndiamond interest.  I told them, no, no speculation for me.  I've got my\ninterests in Missouri; and I wouldn't leave Philip, as long as he stays\nthere.\"\n\nWhen the young gentlemen were on their way back to the hotel, Mr. Philip,\nwho was not in very good humor, broke out,\n\n\"What the deuce, Harry, did you go on in that style to the Montagues\nfor?\"\n\n\"Go on?\" cried Harry.  \"Why shouldn't I try to make a pleasant evening?\nAnd besides, ain't I going to do those things?  What difference does it\nmake about the mood and tense of a mere verb?  Didn't uncle tell me only\nlast Saturday, that I might as well go down to Arizona and hunt for\ndiamonds?  A fellow might as well make a good impression as a poor one.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.  You'll get to believing your own romancing by and by.\"\n\n\"Well, you'll see.  When Sellers and I get that appropriation, I'll show\nyou an establishment in town and another on the Hudson and a box at the\nopera.\"\n\n\"Yes, it will be like Col. Sellers' plantation at Hawkeye.  Did you ever\nsee that?\"\n\n\"Now, don't be cross, Phil.  She's just superb, that little woman.  You\nnever told me.\"\n\n\"Who's just superb?\" growled Philip, fancying this turn of the\nconversation less than the other.\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Montague, if you must know.\"  And Harry stopped to light a\ncigar, and then puffed on in silence.  The little quarrel didn't last\nover night, for Harry never appeared to cherish any ill-will half a\nsecond, and Philip was too sensible to continue a row about nothing; and\nhe had invited Harry to come with him.\n\nThe young gentlemen stayed in Fallkill a week, and were every day at the\nMontagues, and took part in the winter gaieties of the village.  There\nwere parties here and there to which the friends of Ruth and the\nMontagues were of course invited, and Harry in the generosity of his\nnature, gave in return a little supper at the hotel, very simple indeed,\nwith dancing in the hall, and some refreshments passed round.  And Philip\nfound the whole thing in the bill when he came to pay it.\n\nBefore the week was over Philip thought he had a new light on the\ncharacter of Ruth.  Her absorption in the small gaieties of the society\nthere surprised him.  He had few opportunities for serious conversation\nwith her.  There was always some butterfly or another flitting about,\nand when Philip showed by his manner that he was not pleased, Ruth\nlaughed merrily enough and rallied him on his soberness--she declared he\nwas getting to be grim and unsocial.  He talked indeed more with Alice\nthan with Ruth, and scarcely concealed from her the trouble that was in\nhis mind.  It needed, in fact, no word from him, for she saw clearly\nenough what was going forward, and knew her sex well enough to know there\nwas no remedy for it but time.\n\n\"Ruth is a dear girl, Philip, and has as much firmness of purpose as\never, but don't you see she has just discovered that she is fond of\nsociety?  Don't you let her see you are selfish about it, is my advice.\"\n\nThe last evening they were to spend in Fallkill, they were at the\nMontagues, and Philip hoped that he would find Ruth in a different mood.\nBut she was never more gay, and there was a spice of mischief in her eye\nand in her laugh.  \"Confound it,\" said Philip to himself, \"she's in a\nperfect twitter.\"\n\nHe would have liked to quarrel with her, and fling himself out of the\nhouse in tragedy style, going perhaps so far as to blindly wander off\nmiles into the country and bathe his throbbing brow in the chilling rain\nof the stars, as people do in novels; but he had no opportunity.  For\nRuth was as serenely unconscious of mischief as women can be at times,\nand fascinated him more than ever with her little demurenesses and\nhalf-confidences.  She even said \"Thee\" to him once in reproach for a\ncutting speech he began.  And the sweet little word made his heart beat\nlike a trip-hammer, for never in all her life had she said \"thee\" to him\nbefore.\n\nWas she fascinated with Harry's careless 'bon homie' and gay assurance?\nBoth chatted away in high spirits, and made the evening whirl along in\nthe most mirthful manner.  Ruth sang for Harry, and that young gentleman\nturned the leaves for her at the piano, and put in a bass note now and\nthen where he thought it would tell.\n\nYes, it was a merry evening, and Philip was heartily glad when it was\nover, and the long leave-taking with the family was through with.\n\n\"Farewell Philip.  Good night Mr. Brierly,\" Ruth's clear voice sounded\nafter them as they went down the walk.\n\nAnd she spoke Harry's name last, thought Philip.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n               \"O see ye not yon narrow road\n               So thick beset wi' thorns and briers?\n               That is the Path of Righteousness,\n               Though after it but few inquires.\n\n               \"And see ye not yon braid, braid road,\n               That lies across the lily leven?\n               That is the Path of Wickedness,\n               Though some call it the road to Heaven.\"\n\n                                             Thomas the Rhymer.\n\nPhillip and Harry reached New York in very different states of mind.\nHarry was buoyant.  He found a letter from Col. Sellers urging him to go\nto Washington and confer with Senator Dilworthy.  The petition was in his\nhands.\n\nIt had been signed by everybody of any importance in Missouri, and would\nbe presented immediately.\n\n\"I should go on myself,\" wrote the Colonel, \"but I am engaged in the\ninvention of a process for lighting such a city as St. Louis by means of\nwater; just attach my machine to the water-pipes anywhere and the\ndecomposition of the fluid begins, and you will have floods of light for\nthe mere cost of the machine.  I've nearly got the lighting part, but I\nwant to attach to it a heating, cooking, washing and ironing apparatus.\nIt's going to be the great thing, but we'd better keep this appropriation\ngoing while I am perfecting it.\"\n\nHarry took letters to several congressmen from his uncle and from Mr.\nDuff Brown, each of whom had an extensive acquaintance in both houses\nwhere they were well known as men engaged in large private operations for\nthe public good and men, besides, who, in the slang of the day,\nunderstood the virtues of \"addition, division and silence.\"\n\nSenator Dilworthy introduced the petition into the Senate with the remark\nthat he knew, personally, the signers of it, that they were men\ninterested; it was true, in the improvement of the country, but he\nbelieved without any selfish motive, and that so far as he knew the\nsigners were loyal.  It pleased him to see upon the roll the names of\nmany colored citizens, and it must rejoice every friend of humanity to\nknow that this lately emancipated race were intelligently taking part in\nthe development of the resources of their native land.  He moved the\nreference of the petition to the proper committee.\n\nSenator Dilworthy introduced his young friend to influential members,\nas a person who was very well informed about the Salt Lick Extension of\nthe Pacific, and was one of the Engineers who had made a careful survey\nof Columbus River; and left him to exhibit his maps and plans and to show\nthe connection between the public treasury, the city of Napoleon and\nlegislation for the benefit off the whole country.\n\nHarry was the guest of Senator Dilworthy.  There was scarcely any good\nmovement in which the Senator was not interested.  His house was open to\nall the laborers in the field of total abstinence, and much of his time\nwas taken up in attending the meetings of this cause.  He had a Bible\nclass in the Sunday school of the church which he attended, and he\nsuggested to Harry that he might take a class during the time he remained\nin Washington, Mr. Washington Hawkins had a class.  Harry asked the\nSenator if there was a class of young ladies for him to teach, and after\nthat the Senator did not press the subject.\n\nPhilip, if the truth must be told, was not well satisfied with his\nwestern prospects, nor altogether with the people he had fallen in with.\nThe railroad contractors held out large but rather indefinite promises.\nOpportunities for a fortune he did not doubt existed in Missouri, but for\nhimself he saw no better means for livelihood than the mastery of the\nprofession he had rather thoughtlessly entered upon.  During the summer\nhe had made considerable practical advance in the science of engineering;\nhe had been diligent, and made himself to a certain extent necessary to\nthe work he was engaged on.  The contractors called him into their\nconsultations frequently, as to the character of the country he had been\nover, and the cost of constructing the road, the nature of the work, etc.\n\nStill Philip felt that if he was going to make either reputation or money\nas an engineer, he had a great deal of hard study before him, and it is\nto his credit that he did not shrink from it.  While Harry was in\nWashington dancing attendance upon the national legislature and making\nthe acquaintance of the vast lobby that encircled it, Philip devoted\nhimself day and night, with an energy and a concentration he was capable\nof, to the learning and theory of his profession, and to the science of\nrailroad building.  He wrote some papers at this time for the \"Plow, the\nLoom and the Anvil,\" upon the strength of materials, and especially upon\nbridge-building, which attracted considerable attention, and were copied\ninto the English \"Practical Magazine.\"  They served at any rate to raise\nPhilip in the opinion of his friends the contractors, for practical men\nhave a certain superstitious estimation of ability with the pen, and\nthough they may a little despise the talent, they are quite ready to make\nuse of it.\n\nPhilip sent copies of his performances to Ruth's father and to other\ngentlemen whose good opinion he coveted, but he did not rest upon his\nlaurels.  Indeed, so diligently had he applied himself, that when it came\ntime for him to return to the West, he felt himself, at least in theory,\ncompetent to take charge of a division in the field.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nThe capital of the Great Republic was a new world to country-bred\nWashington Hawkins.  St. Louis was a greater city, but its floating.\npopulation did not hail from great distances, and so it had the general\nfamily aspect of the permanent population; but Washington gathered its\npeople from the four winds of heaven, and so the manners, the faces and\nthe fashions there, presented a variety that was infinite.  Washington\nhad never been in \"society\" in St. Louis, and he knew nothing of the ways\nof its wealthier citizens and had never inspected one of their dwellings.\nConsequently, everything in the nature of modern fashion and grandeur was\na new and wonderful revelation to him.\n\nWashington is an interesting city to any of us.  It seems to become more\nand more interesting the oftener we visit it.  Perhaps the reader has\nnever been there?  Very well.  You arrive either at night, rather too\nlate to do anything or see anything until morning, or you arrive so early\nin the morning that you consider it best to go to your hotel and sleep an\nhour or two while the sun bothers along over the Atlantic.  You cannot\nwell arrive at a pleasant intermediate hour, because the railway\ncorporation that keeps the keys of the only door that leads into the town\nor out of it take care of that.  You arrive in tolerably good spirits,\nbecause it is only thirty-eight miles from Baltimore to the capital, and\nso you have only been insulted three times (provided you are not in a\nsleeping car--the average is higher there): once when you renewed your\nticket after stopping over in Baltimore, once when you were about to\nenter the \"ladies' car\" without knowing it was a lady's car, and once\nWhen you asked the conductor at what hour you would reach Washington.\n\nYou are assailed by a long rank of hackmen who shake their whips in your\nface as you step out upon the sidewalk; you enter what they regard as a\n\"carriage,\" in the capital, and you wonder why they do not take it out of\nservice and put it in the museum: we have few enough antiquities, and\nit is little to our credit that we make scarcely any effort to preserve\nthe few we have.  You reach your hotel, presently--and here let us draw\nthe curtain of charity--because of course you have gone to the wrong one.\nYou being a stranger, how could you do otherwise?  There are a hundred\nand eighteen bad hotels, and only one good one.  The most renowned and\npopular hotel of them all is perhaps the worst one known to history.\n\nIt is winter, and night.  When you arrived, it was snowing.  When you\nreached the hotel, it was sleeting.  When you went to bed, it was\nraining.  During the night it froze hard, and the wind blew some chimneys\ndown.  When you got up in the morning, it was foggy.  When you finished\nyour breakfast at ten o'clock and went out, the sunshine was brilliant,\nthe weather balmy and delicious, and the mud and slush deep and\nall-pervading.  You will like the climate when you get used to it.\n\nYou naturally wish to view the city; so you take an umbrella, an\novercoat, and a fan, and go forth.  The prominent features you soon\nlocate and get familiar with; first you glimpse the ornamental upper\nworks of a long, snowy palace projecting above a grove of trees, and a\ntall, graceful white dome with a statue on it surmounting the palace and\npleasantly contrasting with the background of blue sky.  That building is\nthe capitol; gossips will tell you that by the original estimates it was\nto cost $12,000,000, and that the government did come within $21,200,000\nof building it for that sum.\n\nYou stand at the back of the capitol to treat yourself to a view, and it\nis a very noble one.  You understand, the capitol stands upon the verge\nof a high piece of table land, a fine commanding position, and its front\nlooks out over this noble situation for a city--but it don't see it, for\nthe reason that when the capitol extension was decided upon, the property\nowners at once advanced their prices to such inhuman figures that the\npeople went down and built the city in the muddy low marsh behind the\ntemple of liberty; so now the lordly front of the building, with, its\nimposing colonades, its, projecting, graceful wings, its, picturesque\ngroups of statuary, and its long terraced ranges of steps, flowing down\nin white marble waves to the ground, merely looks out upon a sorrowful\nlittle desert of cheap boarding houses.\n\nSo you observe, that you take your view from the back of the capitol.\nAnd yet not from the airy outlooks of the dome, by the way, because to\nget there you must pass through the great rotunda: and to do that, you\nwould have to see the marvelous Historical Paintings that hang there,\nand the bas-reliefs--and what have you done that you should suffer thus?\nAnd besides, you might have to pass through the old part of the building,\nand you could not help seeing Mr. Lincoln, as petrified by a young lady\nartist for $10,000--and you might take his marble emancipation\nproclamation, which he holds out in his hand and contemplates, for a\nfolded napkin; and you might conceive from his expression and his\nattitude, that he is finding fault with the washing.  Which is not the\ncase.  Nobody knows what is the matter with him; but everybody feels for\nhim.  Well, you ought not to go into the dome anyhow, because it would be\nutterly impossible to go up there without seeing the frescoes in it--and\nwhy should you be interested in the delirium tremens of art?\n\nThe capitol is a very noble and a very beautiful building, both within\nand without, but you need not examine it now.  Still, if you greatly\nprefer going into the dome, go.  Now your general glance gives you\npicturesque stretches of gleaming water, on your left, with a sail here\nand there and a lunatic asylum on shore; over beyond the water, on a\ndistant elevation, you see a squat yellow temple which your eye dwells\nupon lovingly through a blur of unmanly moisture, for it recalls your\nlost boyhood and the Parthenons done in molasses candy which made it\nblest and beautiful.  Still in the distance, but on this side of the\nwater and close to its edge, the Monument to the Father of his Country\ntowers out of the mud--sacred soil is the, customary term.  It has the\naspect of a factory chimney with the top broken off.  The skeleton of a\ndecaying scaffolding lingers about its summit, and tradition says that\nthe spirit of Washington often comes down and sits on those rafters to\nenjoy this tribute of respect which the nation has reared as the symbol\nof its unappeasable gratitude.  The Monument is to be finished, some day,\nand at that time our Washington will have risen still higher in the\nnation's veneration, and will be known as the Great-Great-Grandfather of\nhis Country.  The memorial Chimney stands in a quiet pastoral locality\nthat is full of reposeful expression.  With a glass you can see the\ncow-sheds about its base, and the contented sheep nimbling pebbles in the\ndesert solitudes that surround it, and the tired pigs dozing in the holy\ncalm of its protecting shadow.\n\nNow you wrench your gaze loose, and you look down in front of you and see\nthe broad Pennsylvania Avenue stretching straight ahead for a mile or\nmore till it brings up against the iron fence in front of a pillared\ngranite pile, the Treasury building-an edifice that would command respect\nin any capital.  The stores and hotels that wall in this broad avenue are\nmean, and cheap, and dingy, and are better left without comment.  Beyond\nthe Treasury is a fine large white barn, with wide unhandsome grounds\nabout it.  The President lives there.  It is ugly enough outside, but\nthat is nothing to what it is inside.  Dreariness, flimsiness, bad taste\nreduced to mathematical completeness is what the inside offers to the\neye, if it remains yet what it always has been.\n\nThe front and right hand views give you the city at large.  It is a wide\nstretch of cheap little brick houses, with here and there a noble\narchitectural pile lifting itself out of the midst-government buildings,\nthese.  If the thaw is still going on when you come down and go about\ntown, you will wonder at the short-sightedness of the city fathers, when\nyou come to inspect the streets, in that they do not dilute the mud a\nlittle more and use them for canals.\n\nIf you inquire around a little, you will find that there are more\nboardinghouses to the square acre in Washington than there are in any\nother city in the land, perhaps.  If you apply for a home in one of them,\nit will seem odd to you to have the landlady inspect you with a severe\neye and then ask you if you are a member of Congress.  Perhaps, just as a\npleasantry, you will say yes.  And then she will tell you that she is\n\"full.\"  Then you show her her advertisement in the morning paper, and\nthere she stands, convicted and ashamed.  She will try to blush, and it\nwill be only polite in you to take the effort for the deed.  She shows\nyou her rooms, now, and lets you take one--but she makes you pay in\nadvance for it.  That is what you will get for pretending to be a member\nof Congress.  If you had been content to be merely a private citizen,\nyour trunk would have been sufficient security for your board.  If you\nare curious and inquire into this thing, the chances are that your\nlandlady will be ill-natured enough to say that the person and property\nof a Congressman are exempt from arrest or detention, and that with the\ntears in her eyes she has seen several of the people's representatives\nwalk off to their several States and Territories carrying her unreceipted\nboard bills in their pockets for keepsakes.  And before you have been in\nWashington many weeks you will be mean enough to believe her, too.\n\nOf course you contrive to see everything and find out everything.  And\none of the first and most startling things you find out is, that every\nindividual you encounter in the City of Washington almost--and certainly\nevery separate and distinct individual in the public employment, from the\nhighest bureau chief, clear down to the maid who scrubs Department halls,\nthe night watchmen of the public buildings and the darkey boy who\npurifies the Department spittoons--represents Political Influence.\nUnless you can get the ear of a Senator, or a Congressman, or a Chief of\na Bureau or Department, and persuade him to use his \"influence\" in your\nbehalf, you cannot get an employment of the most trivial nature in\nWashington.  Mere merit, fitness and capability, are useless baggage to\nyou without \"influence.\"  The population of Washington consists pretty\nmuch entirely of government employee and the people who board them.\nThere are thousands of these employees, and they have gathered there from\nevery corner of the Union and got their berths through the intercession\n(command is nearer the word) of the Senators and Representatives of their\nrespective States.  It would be an odd circumstance to see a girl get\nemployment at three or four dollars a week in one of the great public\ncribs without any political grandee to back her, but merely because she\nwas worthy, and competent, and a good citizen of a free country that\n\"treats all persons alike.\"  Washington would be mildly thunderstruck at\nsuch a thing as that.  If you are a member of Congress, (no offence,) and\none of your constituents who doesn't know anything, and does not want to\ngo into the bother of learning something, and has no money, and no\nemployment, and can't earn a living, comes besieging you for help, do you\nsay, \"Come, my friend, if your services were valuable you could get\nemployment elsewhere--don't want you here?\"  Oh, no: You take him to a\nDepartment and say, \"Here, give this person something to pass away the\ntime at--and a salary\"--and the thing is done.  You throw him on his\ncountry.  He is his country's child, let his country support him.  There\nis something good and motherly about Washington, the grand old benevolent\nNational Asylum for the Helpless.\n\nThe wages received by this great hive of employees are placed at the\nliberal figure meet and just for skilled and competent labor.  Such of\nthem as are immediately employed about the two Houses of Congress, are\nnot only liberally paid also, but are remembered in the customary Extra\nCompensation bill which slides neatly through, annually, with the general\ngrab that signalizes the last night of a session, and thus twenty per\ncent. is added to their wages, for--for fun, no doubt.\n\nWashington Hawkins' new life was an unceasing delight to him.  Senator\nDilworthy lived sumptuously, and Washington's quarters were charming\n--gas; running water, hot and cold; bath-room, coal-fires, rich carpets,\nbeautiful pictures on the walls; books on religion, temperance, public\ncharities and financial schemes; trim colored servants, dainty food\n--everything a body could wish for.  And as for stationery, there was no\nend to it; the government furnished it; postage stamps were not needed\n--the Senator's frank could convey a horse through the mails, if necessary.\n\nAnd then he saw such dazzling company.  Renowned generals and admirals\nwho had seemed but colossal myths when he was in the far west, went in\nand out before him or sat at the Senator's table, solidified into\npalpable flesh and blood; famous statesmen crossed his path daily; that\nonce rare and awe-inspiring being, a Congressman, was become a common\nspectacle--a spectacle so common, indeed, that he could contemplate it\nwithout excitement, even without embarrassment; foreign ministers were\nvisible to the naked eye at happy intervals; he had looked upon the\nPresident himself, and lived.  And more; this world of enchantment teemed\nwith speculation--the whole atmosphere was thick with hand that indeed\nwas Washington Hawkins' native air; none other refreshed his lungs so\ngratefully.  He had found paradise at last.\n\nThe more he saw of his chief the Senator, the more he honored him, and\nthe more conspicuously the moral grandeur of his character appeared to\nstand out.  To possess the friendship and the kindly interest of such a\nman, Washington said in a letter to Louise, was a happy fortune for a\nyoung man whose career had been so impeded and so clouded as his.\n\nThe weeks drifted by;--Harry Brierly flirted, danced, added lustre\nto the brilliant Senatorial receptions, and diligently \"buzzed\" and\n\"button-holed\" Congressmen in the interest of the Columbus River scheme;\nmeantime Senator Dilworthy labored hard in the same interest--and in\nothers of equal national importance.  Harry wrote frequently to Sellers,\nand always encouragingly; and from these letters it was easy to see that\nHarry was a pet with all Washington, and was likely to carry the thing\nthrough; that the assistance rendered him by \"old Dilworthy\" was pretty\nfair--pretty fair; \"and every little helps, you know,\" said Harry.\n\nWashington wrote Sellers officially, now and then.  In one of his letters\nit appeared that whereas no member of the House committee favored the\nscheme at first, there was now needed but one more vote to compass a\nmajority report.  Closing sentence:\n\n     \"Providence seems to further our efforts.\"\n          (Signed,) \"ABNER DILWORTHY, U. S. S.,\n                         per WASHINGTON HAWKINS, P. S.\"\n\nAt the end of a week, Washington was able to send the happy news,\nofficially, as usual,--that the needed vote had been added and the bill\nfavorably reported from the Committee.  Other letters recorded its perils\nin Committee of the whole, and by and by its victory, by just the skin of\nits teeth, on third reading and final passage.  Then came letters telling\nof Mr. Dilworthy's struggles with a stubborn majority in his own\nCommittee in the Senate; of how these gentlemen succumbed, one by one,\ntill a majority was secured.\n\nThen there was a hiatus.  Washington watched every move on the board, and\nhe was in a good position to do this, for he was clerk of this committee,\nand also one other.  He received no salary as private secretary, but\nthese two clerkships, procured by his benefactor, paid him an aggregate\nof twelve dollars a day, without counting the twenty percent extra\ncompensation which would of course be voted to him on the last night of\nthe session.\n\nHe saw the bill go into Committee of the whole and struggle for its life\nagain, and finally worry through.  In the fullness of time he noted its\nsecond reading, and by and by the day arrived when the grand ordeal came,\nand it was put upon its final passage.  Washington listened with bated\nbreath to the \"Aye!\" \"No!\" \"No!\" \"Aye!\" of the voters, for a few dread\nminutes, and then could bear the suspense no longer.  He ran down from\nthe gallery and hurried home to wait.\n\nAt the end of two or three hours the Senator arrived in the bosom of his\nfamily, and dinner was waiting.  Washington sprang forward, with the\neager question on his lips, and the Senator said:\n\n\"We may rejoice freely, now, my son--Providence has crowned our efforts\nwith success.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nWashington sent grand good news to Col. Sellers that night.  To Louise he\nwrote:\n\n\"It is beautiful to hear him talk when his heart is full of thankfulness\nfor some manifestation of the Divine favor.  You shall know him, some day\nmy Louise, and knowing him you will honor him, as I do.\"\n\nHarry wrote:\n\n\"I pulled it through, Colonel, but it was a tough job, there is no\nquestion about that.  There was not a friend to the measure in the House\ncommittee when I began, and not a friend in the Senate committee except\nold Dil himself, but they were all fixed for a majority report when I\nhauled off my forces.  Everybody here says you can't get a thing like\nthis through Congress without buying committees for straight-out cash on\ndelivery, but I think I've taught them a thing or two--if I could only\nmake them believe it.  When I tell the old residenters that this thing\nwent through without buying a vote or making a promise, they say, 'That's\nrather too thin.'  And when I say thin or not thin it's a fact, anyway,\nthey say, 'Come, now, but do you really believe that?' and when I say I\ndon't believe anything about it, I know it, they smile and say, 'Well,\nyou are pretty innocent, or pretty blind, one or the other--there's no\ngetting around that.'  Why they really do believe that votes have been\nbought--they do indeed.  But let them keep on thinking so.  I have found\nout that if a man knows how to talk to women, and has a little gift in\nthe way of argument with men, he can afford to play for an appropriation\nagainst a money bag and give the money bag odds in the game.  We've raked\nin $200,000 of Uncle Sam's money, say what they will--and there is more\nwhere this came from, when we want it, and I rather fancy I am the person\nthat can go in and occupy it, too, if I do say it myself, that shouldn't,\nperhaps.  I'll be with you within a week.  Scare up all the men you can,\nand put them to work at once.  When I get there I propose to make things\nhum.\"  The great news lifted Sellers into the clouds.  He went to work on\nthe instant.  He flew hither and thither making contracts, engaging men,\nand steeping his soul in the ecstasies of business.  He was the happiest\nman in Missouri.  And Louise was the happiest woman; for presently came a\nletter from Washington which said:\n\n\"Rejoice with me, for the long agony is over!  We have waited patiently\nand faithfully, all these years, and now at last the reward is at hand.\nA man is to pay our family $40,000 for the Tennessee Land!  It is but a\nlittle sum compared to what we could get by waiting, but I do so long to\nsee the day when I can call you my own, that I have said to myself,\nbetter take this and enjoy life in a humble way than wear out our best\ndays in this miserable separation.  Besides, I can put this money into\noperations here that will increase it a hundred fold, yes, a thousand\nfold, in a few months.  The air is full of such chances, and I know our\nfamily would consent in a moment that I should put in their shares with\nmine.  Without a doubt we shall be worth half a million dollars in a year\nfrom this time--I put it at the very lowest figure, because it is always\nbest to be on the safe side--half a million at the very lowest\ncalculation, and then your father will give his consent and we can marry\nat last.  Oh, that will be a glorious day.  Tell our friends the good\nnews--I want all to share it.\"\n\nAnd she did tell her father and mother, but they said, let it be kept\nstill for the present.  The careful father also told her to write\nWashington and warn him not to speculate with the money, but to wait a\nlittle and advise with one or two wise old heads.  She did this.  And she\nmanaged to keep the good news to herself, though it would seem that the\nmost careless observer might have seen by her springing step and her\nradiant countenance that some fine piece of good fortune had descended\nupon her.\n\nHarry joined the Colonel at Stone's Landing, and that dead place sprang\ninto sudden life.  A swarm of men were hard at work, and the dull air was\nfilled with the cheery music of labor.  Harry had been constituted\nengineer-in-general, and he threw the full strength of his powers into\nhis work.  He moved among his hirelings like a king.  Authority seemed to\ninvest him with a new splendor.  Col. Sellers, as general superintendent\nof a great public enterprise, was all that a mere human being could be\n--and more.  These two grandees went at their imposing \"improvement\" with\nthe air of men who had been charged with the work of altering the\nfoundations of the globe.\n\nThey turned their first attention to straightening the river just above\nthe Landing, where it made a deep bend, and where the maps and plans\nshowed that the process of straightening would not only shorten distance\nbut increase the \"fall.\"  They started a cut-off canal across the\npeninsula formed by the bend, and such another tearing up of the earth\nand slopping around in the mud as followed the order to the men, had\nnever been seen in that region before.  There was such a panic among the\nturtles that at the end of six hours there was not one to be found within\nthree miles of Stone's Landing.  They took the young and the aged, the\ndecrepit and the sick upon their backs and left for tide-water in\ndisorderly procession, the tadpoles following and the bull-frogs bringing\nup the rear.\n\nSaturday night came, but the men were obliged to wait, because the\nappropriation had not come.  Harry said he had written to hurry up the\nmoney and it would be along presently.  So the work continued, on Monday.\nStone's Landing was making quite a stir in the vicinity, by this time.\nSellers threw a lot or two on the market, \"as a feeler,\" and they sold\nwell.  He re-clothed his family, laid in a good stock of provisions, and\nstill had money left.  He started a bank account, in a small way--and\nmentioned the deposit casually to friends; and to strangers, too; to\neverybody, in fact; but not as a new thing--on the contrary, as a matter\nof life-long standing.  He could not keep from buying trifles every day\nthat were not wholly necessary, it was such a gaudy thing to get out his\nbank-book and draw a check, instead of using his old customary formula,\n\"Charge it\" Harry sold a lot or two, also--and had a dinner party or two\nat Hawkeye and a general good time with the money.  Both men held on\npretty strenuously for the coming big prices, however.\n\nAt the end of a month things were looking bad.  Harry had besieged the\nNew York headquarters of the Columbus River Slack-water Navigation\nCompany with demands, then commands, and finally appeals, but to no\npurpose; the appropriation did not come; the letters were not even\nanswered.  The workmen were clamorous, now.  The Colonel and Harry\nretired to consult.\n\n\"What's to be done?\" said the Colonel.\n\n\"Hang'd if I know.\"\n\n\"Company say anything?\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\n\"You telegraphed yesterday?\"\n\nYes, and the day before, too.\"\n\n\"No answer?\"\n\n\"None-confound them!\"\n\nThen there was a long pause.  Finally both spoke at once:\n\n\"I've got it!\"\n\n\"I've got it!\"\n\n\"What's yours?\" said Harry.\n\n\"Give the boys thirty-day orders on the Company for the back pay.\"\n\n\"That's it-that's my own idea to a dot.  But then--but then----\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said the Colonel; \"I know they can't wait for the orders\nto go to New York and be cashed, but what's the reason they can't get\nthem discounted in Hawkeye?\"\n\n\"Of course they can.  That solves the difficulty.  Everybody knows the\nappropriation's been made and the Company's perfectly good.\"\n\nSo the orders were given and the men appeased, though they grumbled a\nlittle at first.  The orders went well enough for groceries and such\nthings at a fair discount, and the work danced along gaily for a time.\nTwo or three purchasers put up frame houses at the Landing and moved in,\nand of course a far-sighted but easy-going journeyman printer wandered\nalong and started the \"Napoleon Weekly Telegraph and Literary\nRepository\"--a paper with a Latin motto from the Unabridged dictionary,\nand plenty of \"fat\" conversational tales and double-leaded poetry--all\nfor two dollars a year, strictly in advance.  Of course the merchants\nforwarded the orders at once to New York--and never heard of them again.\n\nAt the end of some weeks Harry's orders were a drug in the market--nobody\nwould take them at any discount whatever.  The second month closed with a\nriot.--Sellers was absent at the time, and Harry began an active absence\nhimself with the mob at his heels.  But being on horseback, he had the\nadvantage.  He did not tarry in Hawkeye, but went on, thus missing\nseveral appointments with creditors.  He was far on his flight eastward,\nand well out of danger when the next morning dawned.  He telegraphed the\nColonel to go down and quiet the laborers--he was bound east for money\n--everything would be right in a week--tell the men so--tell them to rely\non him and not be afraid.\n\nSellers found the mob quiet enough when he reached the Landing.\nThey had gutted the Navigation office, then piled the beautiful engraved\nstock-books and things in the middle of the floor and enjoyed the bonfire\nwhile it lasted.  They had a liking for the Colonel, but still they had\nsome idea of hanging him, as a sort of make-shift that might answer,\nafter a fashion, in place of more satisfactory game.\n\nBut they made the mistake of waiting to hear what he had to say first.\nWithin fifteen minutes his tongue had done its work and they were all\nrich men.--He gave every one of them a lot in the suburbs of the city of\nStone's Landing, within a mile and a half of the future post office and\nrailway station, and they promised to resume work as soon as Harry got\neast and started the money along.  Now things were blooming and pleasant\nagain, but the men had no money, and nothing to live on.  The Colonel\ndivided with them the money he still had in bank--an act which had\nnothing surprising about it because he was generally ready to divide\nwhatever he had with anybody that wanted it, and it was owing to this\nvery trait that his family spent their days in poverty and at times were\npinched with famine.\n\nWhen the men's minds had cooled and Sellers was gone, they hated\nthemselves for letting him beguile them with fine speeches, but it was\ntoo late, now--they agreed to hang him another time--such time as\nProvidence should appoint.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nRumors of Ruth's frivolity and worldliness at Fallkill traveled to\nPhiladelphia in due time, and occasioned no little undertalk among the\nBolton relatives.\n\nHannah Shoecraft told another, cousin that, for her part, she never\nbelieved that Ruth had so much more \"mind\" than other people; and Cousin\nHulda added that she always thought Ruth was fond of admiration, and that\nwas the reason she was unwilling to wear plain clothes and attend\nMeeting.  The story that Ruth was \"engaged\" to a young gentleman of\nfortune in Fallkill came with the other news, and helped to give point to\nthe little satirical remarks that went round about Ruth's desire to be a\ndoctor!\n\nMargaret Bolton was too wise to be either surprised or alarmed by these\nrumors.  They might be true; she knew a woman's nature too well to think\nthem improbable, but she also knew how steadfast Ruth was in her\npurposes, and that, as a brook breaks into ripples and eddies and dances\nand sports by the way, and yet keeps on to the sea, it was in Ruth's\nnature to give back cheerful answer to the solicitations of friendliness\nand pleasure, to appear idly delaying even, and sporting in the sunshine,\nwhile the current of her resolution flowed steadily on.\n\nThat Ruth had this delight in the mere surface play of life that she\ncould, for instance, be interested in that somewhat serious by-play\ncalled \"flirtation,\" or take any delight in the exercise of those little\narts of pleasing and winning which are none the less genuine and charming\nbecause they are not intellectual, Ruth, herself, had never suspected\nuntil she went to Fallkill.  She had believed it her duty to subdue her\ngaiety of temperament, and let nothing divert her from what are called\nserious pursuits: In her limited experience she brought everything to the\njudgment of her own conscience, and settled the affairs of all the world\nin her own serene judgment hall.  Perhaps her mother saw this, and saw\nalso that there was nothing in the Friends' society to prevent her from\ngrowing more and more opinionated.\n\nWhen Ruth returned to Philadelphia, it must be confessed--though it would\nnot have been by her--that a medical career did seem a little less\nnecessary for her than formerly; and coming back in a glow of triumph, as\nit were, and in the consciousness of the freedom and life in a lively\nsociety and in new and sympathetic friendship, she anticipated pleasure\nin an attempt to break up the stiffness and levelness of the society at\nhome, and infusing into it something of the motion and sparkle which were\nso agreeable at Fallkill.  She expected visits from her new friends, she\nwould have company, the new books and the periodicals about which all the\nworld was talking, and, in short, she would have life.\n\nFor a little while she lived in this atmosphere which she had brought\nwith her.  Her mother was delighted with this change in her, with the\nimprovement in her health and the interest she exhibited in home affairs.\nHer father enjoyed the society of his favorite daughter as he did few\nthings besides; he liked her mirthful and teasing ways, and not less a\nkeen battle over something she had read.  He had been a great reader all\nhis life, and a remarkable memory had stored his mind with encyclopaedic\ninformation.  It was one of Ruth's delights to cram herself with some out\nof the way subject and endeavor to catch her father; but she almost\nalways failed.  Mr. Bolton liked company, a house full of it, and the\nmirth of young people, and he would have willingly entered into any\nrevolutionary plans Ruth might have suggested in relation to Friends'\nsociety.\n\nBut custom and the fixed order are stronger than the most enthusiastic\nand rebellious young lady, as Ruth very soon found.  In spite of all her\nbrave efforts, her frequent correspondence, and her determined animation,\nher books and her music, she found herself settling into the clutches of\nthe old monotony, and as she realized the hopelessness of her endeavors,\nthe medical scheme took new hold of her, and seemed to her the only\nmethod of escape.\n\n\"Mother, thee does not know how different it is in Fallkill, how much\nmore interesting the people are one meets, how much more life there is.\"\n\n\"But thee will find the world, child, pretty much all the same, when thee\nknows it better.  I thought once as thee does now, and had as little\nthought of being a Friend as thee has.  Perhaps when thee has seen more,\nthee will better appreciate a quiet life.\"\n\n\"Thee married young.  I shall not marry young, and perhaps not at all,\"\nsaid Ruth, with a look of vast experience.\n\n\"Perhaps thee doesn't know thee own mind; I have known persons of thy\nage who did not.  Did thee see anybody whom thee would like to live with\nalways in Fallkill?\"\n\n\"Not always,\" replied Ruth with a little laugh.  \"Mother, I think I\nwouldn't say 'always' to any one until I have a profession and am as\nindependent as he is.  Then my love would be a free act, and not in any\nway a necessity.\"\n\nMargaret Bolton smiled at this new-fangled philosophy.  \"Thee will find\nthat love, Ruth, is a thing thee won't reason about, when it comes, nor\nmake any bargains about.  Thee wrote that Philip Sterling was at\nFallkill.\"\n\n\"Yes, and Henry Brierly, a friend of his; a very amusing young fellow and\nnot so serious-minded as Philip, but a bit of a fop maybe.\"\n\n\"And thee preferred the fop to the serious-minded?\"\n\n\"I didn't prefer anybody; but Henry Brierly was good company, which\nPhilip wasn't always.\"\n\n\"Did thee know thee father had been in correspondence with Philip?\"\n\nRuth looked up surprised and with a plain question in her eyes.\n\n\"Oh, it's not about thee.\"\n\n\"What then?\" and if there was any shade of disappointment in her tone,\nprobably Ruth herself did not know it.\n\n\"It's about some land up in the country.  That man Bigler has got father\ninto another speculation.\"\n\n\"That odious man!  Why will father have anything to do with him?  Is it\nthat railroad?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Father advanced money and took land as security, and whatever has\ngone with the money and the bonds, he has on his hands a large tract of\nwild land.\"\n\n\"And what has Philip to do with that?\"\n\n\"It has good timber, if it could ever be got out, and father says that\nthere must be coal in it; it's in a coal region.  He wants Philip to\nsurvey it, and examine it for indications of coal.\"\n\n\"It's another of father's fortunes, I suppose,\" said Ruth.  \"He has put\naway so many fortunes for us that I'm afraid we never shall find them.\"\n\nRuth was interested in it nevertheless, and perhaps mainly because Philip\nwas to be connected with the enterprise.  Mr. Bigler came to dinner with\nher father next day, and talked a great deal about Mr. Bolton's\nmagnificent tract of land, extolled the sagacity that led him to secure\nsuch a property, and led the talk along to another railroad which would\nopen a northern communication to this very land.\n\n\"Pennybacker says it's full of coal, he's no doubt of it, and a railroad\nto strike the Erie would make it a fortune.\"\n\n\"Suppose you take the land and work the thing up, Mr. Bigler; you may\nhave the tract for three dollars an acre.\"\n\n\"You'd throw it away, then,\" replied Mr. Bigler, \"and I'm not the man to\ntake advantage of a friend.  But if you'll put a mortgage on it for the\nnorthern road, I wouldn't mind taking an interest, if Pennybacker is\nwilling; but Pennybacker, you know, don't go much on land, he sticks to\nthe legislature.\"  And Mr. Bigler laughed.\n\nWhen Mr. Bigler had gone, Ruth asked her father about Philip's connection\nwith the land scheme.\n\n\"There's nothing definite,\" said Mr. Bolton.  \"Philip is showing aptitude\nfor his profession.  I hear the best reports of him in New York, though\nthose sharpers don't 'intend to do anything but use him.  I've written\nand offered him employment in surveying and examining the land.  We want\nto know what it is.  And if there is anything in it that his enterprise\ncan dig out, he shall have an interest.  I should be glad to give the\nyoung fellow a lift.\"\n\nAll his life Eli Bolton had been giving young fellows a lift, and\nshouldering the loses when things turned out unfortunately.  His ledger,\ntake-it-altogether, would not show a balance on the right side; but\nperhaps the losses on his books will turn out to be credits in a world\nwhere accounts are kept on a different basis.  The left hand of the\nledger will appear the right, looked at from the other side.\n\nPhilip, wrote to Ruth rather a comical account of the bursting up of the\ncity of Napoleon and the navigation improvement scheme, of Harry's flight\nand the Colonel's discomfiture.  Harry left in such a hurry that he\nhadn't even time to bid Miss Laura Hawkins good-bye, but he had no doubt\nthat Harry would console himself with the next pretty face he saw\n--a remark which was thrown in for Ruth's benefit.  Col. Sellers had in all\nprobability, by this time, some other equally brilliant speculation in\nhis brain.\n\nAs to the railroad, Philip had made up his mind that it was merely kept\non foot for speculative purposes in Wall street, and he was about to quit\nit.  Would Ruth be glad to hear, he wondered, that he was coming East?\nFor he was coming, in spite of a letter from Harry in New York, advising\nhim to hold on until he had made some arrangements in regard to\ncontracts, he to be a little careful about Sellers, who was somewhat\nvisionary, Harry said.\n\nThe summer went on without much excitement for Ruth.  She kept up a\ncorrespondence with Alice, who promised a visit in the fall, she read,\nshe earnestly tried to interest herself in home affairs and such people\nas came to the house; but she found herself falling more and more into\nreveries, and growing weary of things as they were.  She felt that\neverybody might become in time like two relatives from a Shaker\nestablishment in Ohio, who visited the Boltons about this time, a father\nand son, clad exactly alike, and alike in manners.  The son; however,\nwho was not of age, was more unworldly and sanctimonious than his father;\nhe always addressed his parent as \"Brother Plum,\" and bore himself,\naltogether in such a superior manner that Ruth longed to put bent pins in\nhis chair.  Both father and son wore the long, single breasted collarless\ncoats of their society, without buttons, before or behind, but with a row\nof hooks and eyes on either side in front.  It was Ruth's suggestion that\nthe coats would be improved by a single hook and eye sewed on in the\nsmall of the back where the buttons usually are.\n\nAmusing as this Shaker caricature of the Friends was, it oppressed Ruth\nbeyond measure; and increased her feeling of being stifled.\n\nIt was a most unreasonable feeling.  No home could be pleasanter than\nRuth's.  The house, a little out of the city; was one of those elegant\ncountry residences which so much charm visitors to the suburbs of\nPhiladelphia.  A modern dwelling and luxurious in everything that wealth\ncould suggest for comfort, it stood in the midst of exquisitely kept\nlawns, with groups of trees, parterres of flowers massed in colors, with\ngreenhouse, grapery and garden; and on one side, the garden sloped away\nin undulations to a shallow brook that ran over a pebbly bottom and sang\nunder forest trees.  The country about teas the perfection of cultivated\nlandscape, dotted with cottages, and stately mansions of Revolutionary\ndate, and sweet as an English country-side, whether seen in the soft\nbloom of May or in the mellow ripeness of late October.\n\nIt needed only the peace of the mind within, to make it a paradise.\nOne riding by on the Old Germantown road, and seeing a young girl\nswinging in the hammock on the piazza and, intent upon some volume of old\npoetry or the latest novel, would no doubt have envied a life so idyllic.\nHe could not have imagined that the young girl was reading a volume of\nreports of clinics and longing to be elsewhere.\n\nRuth could not have been more discontented if all the wealth about her\nhad been as unsubstantial as a dream.  Perhaps she so thought it.\n\n\"I feel,\" she once said to her father, \"as if I were living in a house of\ncards.\"\n\n\"And thee would like to turn it into a hospital?\"\n\n\"No.  But tell me father,\" continued Ruth, not to be put off, \"is thee\nstill going on with that Bigler and those other men who come here and\nentice thee?\"\n\nMr. Bolton smiled, as men do when they talk with women about \"business\"\n\"Such men have their uses, Ruth.  They keep the world active, and I owe a\ngreat many of my best operations to such men.  Who knows, Ruth, but this\nnew land purchase, which I confess I yielded a little too much to Bigler\nin, may not turn out a fortune for thee and the rest of the children?\"\n\n\"Ah, father, thee sees every thing in a rose-colored light.  I do believe\nthee wouldn't have so readily allowed me to begin the study of medicine,\nif it hadn't had the novelty of an experiment to thee.\"\n\n\"And is thee satisfied with it?\"\n\n\"If thee means, if I have had enough of it, no.  I just begin to see what\nI can do in it, and what a noble profession it is for a woman.  Would\nthee have me sit here like a bird on a bough and wait for somebody to\ncome and put me in a cage?\"\n\nMr. Bolton was not sorry to divert the talk from his own affairs, and he\ndid not think it worth while to tell his family of a performance that\nvery day which was entirely characteristic of him.\n\nRuth might well say that she felt as if she were living in a house of\ncards, although the Bolton household had no idea of the number of perils\nthat hovered over them, any more than thousands of families in America\nhave of the business risks and contingences upon which their prosperity\nand luxury hang.\n\nA sudden call upon Mr. Bolton for a large sum of money, which must be\nforthcoming at once, had found him in the midst of a dozen ventures, from\nno one of which a dollar could be realized.  It was in vain that he\napplied to his business acquaintances and friends; it was a period of\nsudden panic and no money.  \"A hundred thousand!  Mr. Bolton,\" said\nPlumly.  \"Good God, if you should ask me for ten, I shouldn't know where\nto get it.\"\n\nAnd yet that day Mr. Small (Pennybacker, Bigler and Small) came to Mr.\nBolton with a piteous story of ruin in a coal operation, if he could not\nraise ten thousand dollars.  Only ten, and he was sure of a fortune.\nWithout it he was a beggar.  Mr. Bolton had already Small's notes for a\nlarge amount in his safe, labeled \"doubtful;\" he had helped him again and\nagain, and always with the same result.  But Mr. Small spoke with a\nfaltering voice of his family, his daughter in school, his wife ignorant\nof his calamity, and drew such a picture of their agony, that Mr. Bolton\nput by his own more pressing necessity, and devoted the day to scraping\ntogether, here and there, ten thousand dollars for this brazen beggar,\nwho had never kept a promise to him nor paid a debt.\n\nBeautiful credit!  The foundation of modern society.  Who shall say that\nthis is not the golden age of mutual trust, of unlimited reliance upon\nhuman promises?  That is a peculiar condition of society which enables a\nwhole nation to instantly recognize point and meaning in the familiar\nnewspaper anecdote, which puts into the mouth of a distinguished\nspeculator in lands and mines this remark:--\"I wasn't worth a cent two\nyears ago, and now I owe two millions of dollars.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nIt was a hard blow to poor Sellers to see the work on his darling\nenterprise stop, and the noise and bustle and confusion that had been\nsuch refreshment to his soul, sicken and die out.  It was hard to come\ndown to humdrum ordinary life again after being a General Superintendent\nand the most conspicuous man in the community.  It was sad to see his\nname disappear from the newspapers; sadder still to see it resurrected at\nintervals, shorn of its aforetime gaudy gear of compliments and clothed\non with rhetorical tar and feathers.\n\nBut his friends suffered more on his account than he did.  He was a cork\nthat could not be kept under the water many moments at a time.\n\nHe had to bolster up his wife's spirits every now and then.  On one of\nthese occasions he said:\n\n\"It's all right, my dear, all right; it will all come right in a little\nwhile.  There's $200,000 coming, and that will set things booming again:\nHarry seems to be having some difficulty, but that's to be expected--you\ncan't move these big operations to the tune of Fisher's Hornpipe, you\nknow.  But Harry will get it started along presently, and then you'll\nsee!  I expect the news every day now.\"\n\n\"But Beriah, you've been expecting it every day, all along, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Well, yes; yes--I don't know but I have.  But anyway, the longer it's\ndelayed, the nearer it grows to the time when it will start--same as\nevery day you live brings you nearer to--nearer--\"\n\n\"The grave?\"\n\n\"Well, no--not that exactly; but you can't understand these things, Polly\ndear--women haven't much head for business, you know.  You make yourself\nperfectly comfortable, old lady, and you'll see how we'll trot this right\nalong.  Why bless you, let the appropriation lag, if it wants to--that's\nno great matter--there's a bigger thing than that.\"\n\n\"Bigger than $200,000, Beriah?\"\n\n\"Bigger, child?--why, what's $200,000?  Pocket money!  Mere pocket money!\nLook at the railroad!  Did you forget the railroad?  It ain't many months\ntill spring; it will be coming right along, and the railroad swimming\nright along behind it.  Where'll it be by the middle of summer?  Just\nstop and fancy a moment--just think a little--don't anything suggest\nitself?  Bless your heart, you dear women live right in the present all\nthe time--but a man, why a man lives----\n\n\"In the future, Beriah?  But don't we live in the future most too much,\nBeriah?  We do somehow seem to manage to live on next year's crop of corn\nand potatoes as a general thing while this year is still dragging along,\nbut sometimes it's not a robust diet,--Beriah.  But don't look that way,\ndear--don't mind what I say.  I don't mean to fret, I don't mean to\nworry; and I don't, once a month, do I, dear?  But when I get a little\nlow and feel bad, I get a bit troubled and worrisome, but it don't mean\nanything in the world.  It passes right away.  I know you're doing all\nyou can, and I don't want to seem repining and ungrateful--for I'm not,\nBeriah--you know I'm not, don't you?\"\n\n\"Lord bless you, child, I know you are the very best little woman that\never lived--that ever lived on the whole face of the Earth!  And I know\nthat I would be a dog not to work for you and think for you and scheme\nfor you with all my might.  And I'll bring things all right yet, honey\n--cheer up and don't you fear.  The railroad----\"\n\n\"Oh, I had forgotten the railroad, dear, but when a body gets blue, a\nbody forgets everything.  Yes, the railroad--tell me about the railroad.\"\n\n\"Aha, my girl, don't you see?  Things ain't so dark, are they?  Now I\ndidn't forget the railroad.  Now just think for a moment--just figure up\na little on the future dead moral certainties.  For instance, call this\nwaiter St. Louis.\n\n\"And we'll lay this fork (representing the railroad) from St. Louis to\nthis potato, which is Slouchburg:\n\n\"Then with this carving knife we'll continue the railroad from Slouchburg\nto Doodleville, shown by the black pepper:\n\n\"Then we run along the--yes--the comb--to the tumbler that's Brimstone:\n\n\"Thence by the pipe to Belshazzar, which is the salt-cellar:\n\n\"Thence to, to--that quill--Catfish--hand me the pincushion, Marie\nAntoinette:\n\n\"Thence right along these shears to this horse, Babylon:\n\n\"Then by the spoon to Bloody Run--thank you, the ink:\n\n\"Thence to Hail Columbia--snuffers, Polly, please move that cup and\nsaucer close up, that's Hail Columbia:\n\n\"Then--let me open my knife--to Hark-from-the-Tomb, where we'll put\nthe candle-stick--only a little distance from Hail Columbia to\nHark-from-the-Tomb--down-grade all the way.\n\n\"And there we strike Columbus River--pass me two or throe skeins of\nthread to stand for the river; the sugar bowl will do for Hawkeye, and\nthe rat trap for Stone's Landing-Napoleon, I mean--and you can see how\nmuch better Napoleon is located than Hawkeye.  Now here you are with your\nrailroad complete, and showing its continuation to Hallelujah and thence\nto Corruptionville.\n\n\"Now then-them you are!  It's a beautiful road, beautiful.  Jeff Thompson\ncan out-engineer any civil engineer that ever sighted through an aneroid,\nor a theodolite, or whatever they call it--he calls it sometimes one and\nsometimes the other just whichever levels off his sentence neatest, I\nreckon.  But ain't it a ripping toad, though?  I tell you, it'll make a\nstir when it gets along.  Just see what a country it goes through.\nThere's your onions at Slouchburg--noblest onion country that graces\nGod's footstool; and there's your turnip country all around Doodleville\n--bless my life, what fortunes are going to be made there when they get\nthat contrivance perfected for extracting olive oil out of turnips--if\nthere's any in them; and I reckon there is, because Congress has made an\nappropriation of money to test the thing, and they wouldn't have done\nthat just on conjecture, of course.  And now we come to the Brimstone\nregion--cattle raised there till you can't rest--and corn, and all that\nsort of thing.  Then you've got a little stretch along through Belshazzar\nthat don't produce anything now--at least nothing but rocks--but\nirrigation will fetch it.  Then from Catfish to Babylon it's a little\nswampy, but there's dead loads of peat down under there somewhere.  Next\nis the Bloody Run and Hail Columbia country--tobacco enough can be raised\nthere to support two such railroads.  Next is the sassparilla region.\nI reckon there's enough of that truck along in there on the line of the\npocket-knife, from Hail Columbia to Hark-from-the Tomb to fat up all the\nconsumptives in all the hospitals from Halifax to the Holy Land.  It just\ngrows like weeds!  I've got a little belt of sassparilla land in there\njust tucked away unobstrusively waiting for my little Universal\nExpectorant to get into shape in my head.  And I'll fix that, you know.\nOne of these days I'll have all the nations of the earth expecto--\"\n\n\"But Beriah, dear--\"\n\n\"Don't interrupt me; Polly--I don't want you to lose the run of the map\n--well, take your toy-horse, James Fitz-James, if you must have it--and run\nalong with you.  Here, now--the soap will do for Babylon.  Let me see\n--where was I?  Oh yes--now we run down to Stone's Lan--Napoleon--now we\nrun down to Napoleon.  Beautiful road.  Look at that, now.  Perfectly\nstraight line-straight as the way to the grave.  And see where it leaves\nHawkeye-clear out in the cold, my dear, clear out in the cold.  That\ntown's as bound to die as--well if I owned it I'd get its obituary ready,\nnow, and notify the mourners.  Polly, mark my words--in three years from\nthis, Hawkeye'll be a howling wilderness.  You'll see.  And just look at\nthat river--noblest stream that meanders over the thirsty earth!\n--calmest, gentlest artery that refreshes her weary bosom!  Railroad\ngoes all over it and all through it--wades right along on stilts.\nSeventeen bridges in three miles and a half--forty-nine bridges from\nHark-from-the-Tomb to Stone's Landing altogether--forty nine bridges, and\nculverts enough to culvert creation itself!  Hadn't skeins of thread\nenough to represent them all--but you get an idea--perfect trestle-work\nof bridges for seventy two miles: Jeff Thompson and I fixed all that, you\nknow; he's to get the contracts and I'm to put them through on the\ndivide.  Just oceans of money in those bridges.  It's the only part of\nthe railroad I'm interested in,--down along the line--and it's all I\nwant, too.  It's enough, I should judge. Now here we are at Napoleon.\nGood enough country plenty good enough--all it wants is population.\nThat's all right--that will come.  And it's no bad country now for\ncalmness and solitude, I can tell you--though there's no money in that,\nof course.  No money, but a man wants rest, a man wants peace--a man\ndon't want to rip and tear around all the time.  And here we go, now,\njust as straight as a string for Hallelujah--it's a beautiful angle\n--handsome up grade all the way --and then away you go to Corruptionville,\nthe gaudiest country for early carrots and cauliflowers that ever--good\nmissionary field, too.  There ain't such another missionary field outside\nthe jungles of Central Africa.  And patriotic?--why they named it after\nCongress itself.  Oh, I warn you, my dear, there's a good time coming,\nand it'll be right along before you know what you're about, too.  That\nrailroad's fetching it. You see what it is as far as I've got, and if I\nhad enough bottles and soap and boot-jacks and such things to carry it\nalong to where it joins onto the Union Pacific, fourteen hundred miles\nfrom here, I should exhibit to you in that little internal improvement a\nspectacle of inconceivable sublimity.  So, don't you see?  We've got the\nrail road to fall back on; and in the meantime, what are we worrying\nabout that $200,000 appropriation for?  That's all right.  I'd be willing\nto bet anything that the very next letter that comes from Harry will--\"\n\nThe eldest boy entered just in the nick of time and brought a letter,\nwarm from the post-office.\n\n\"Things do look bright, after all, Beriah.  I'm sorry I was blue, but it\ndid seem as if everything had been going against us for whole ages.  Open\nthe letter--open it quick, and let's know all about it before we stir out\nof our places.

We heard his horn and instantly got up. It was dark\nand cold and wretched. As I fumbled around for the matches, knocking\nthings down with my quaking hands, I wished the sun would rise in the\nmiddle of the day, when it was warm and bright and cheerful, and one\nwasn't sleepy. We proceeded to dress by the gloom of a couple sickly\ncandles, but we could hardly button anything, our hands shook so.\nI thought of how many happy people there were in Europe, Asia, and\nAmerica, and everywhere, who were sleeping peacefully in their beds,\nand did not have to get up and see the Rigi sunrise--people who did\nnot appreciate their advantage, as like as not, but would get up in the\nmorning wanting more boons of Providence. While thinking these thoughts\nI yawned, in a rather ample way, and my upper teeth got hitched on a\nnail over the door, and while I was mounting a chair to free myself,\nHarris drew the window-curtain, and said:\n\n\"Oh, this is luck! We shan't have to go out at all--yonder are the\nmountains, in full view.\"\n\n\n\nThat was glad news, indeed. It made us cheerful right away. One could\nsee the grand Alpine masses dimly outlined against the black firmament,\nand one or two faint stars blinking through rifts in the night. Fully\nclothed, and wrapped in blankets, and huddled ourselves up, by the\nwindow, with lighted pipes, and fell into chat, while we waited in\nexceeding comfort to see how an Alpine sunrise was going to look by\ncandlelight. By and by a delicate, spiritual sort of effulgence spread\nitself by imperceptible degrees over the loftiest altitudes of the snowy\nwastes--but there the effort seemed to stop. I said, presently:\n\n\"There is a hitch about this sunrise somewhere. It doesn't seem to go.\nWhat do you reckon is the matter with it?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It appears to hang fire somewhere. I never saw a sunrise\nact like that before. Can it be that the hotel is playing anything on\nus?\"\n\n\"Of course not. The hotel merely has a property interest in the sun, it\nhas nothing to do with the management of it. It is a precarious kind of\nproperty, too; a succession of total eclipses would probably ruin this\ntavern. Now what can be the matter with this sunrise?\"\n\nHarris jumped up and said:\n\n\"I've got it! I know what's the matter with it! We've been looking at\nthe place where the sun SET last night!\"\n\n\"It is perfectly true! Why couldn't you have thought of that sooner? Now\nwe've lost another one! And all through your blundering. It was exactly\nlike you to light a pipe and sit down to wait for the sun to rise in the\nwest.\"\n\n\"It was exactly like me to find out the mistake, too. You never would\nhave found it out. I find out all the mistakes.\"\n\n\"You make them all, too, else your most valuable faculty would be wasted\non you. But don't stop to quarrel, now--maybe we are not too late yet.\"\n\nBut we were. The sun was well up when we got to the exhibition-ground.\n\n\n\nOn our way up we met the crowd returning--men and women dressed in\nall sorts of queer costumes, and exhibiting all degrees of cold and\nwretchedness in their gaits and countenances. A dozen still remained on\nthe ground when we reached there, huddled together about the scaffold\nwith their backs to the bitter wind. They had their red guide-books open\nat the diagram of the view, and were painfully picking out the several\nmountains and trying to impress their names and positions on their\nmemories. It was one of the saddest sights I ever saw.\n\nTwo sides of this place were guarded by railings, to keep people from\nbeing blown over the precipices. The view, looking sheer down into\nthe broad valley, eastward, from this great elevation--almost a\nperpendicular mile--was very quaint and curious. Counties, towns, hilly\nribs and ridges, wide stretches of green meadow, great forest tracts,\nwinding streams, a dozen blue lakes, a block of busy steamboats--we saw\nall this little world in unique circumstantiality of detail--saw it just\nas the birds see it--and all reduced to the smallest of scales and as\nsharply worked out and finished as a steel engraving. The numerous toy\nvillages, with tiny spires projecting out of them, were just as the\nchildren might have left them when done with play the day before; the\nforest tracts were diminished to cushions of moss; one or two big lakes\nwere dwarfed to ponds, the smaller ones to puddles--though they did not\nlook like puddles, but like blue teardrops which had fallen and lodged\nin slight depressions, conformable to their shapes, among the moss-beds\nand the smooth levels of dainty green farm-land; the microscopic\nsteamboats glided along, as in a city reservoir, taking a mighty time to\ncover the distance between ports which seemed only a yard apart; and the\nisthmus which separated two lakes looked as if one might stretch out on\nit and lie with both elbows in the water, yet we knew invisible wagons\nwere toiling across it and finding the distance a tedious one. This\nbeautiful miniature world had exactly the appearance of those \"relief\nmaps\" which reproduce nature precisely, with the heights and depressions\nand other details graduated to a reduced scale, and with the rocks,\ntrees, lakes, etc., colored after nature.\n\n\n\nI believed we could walk down to Waeggis or Vitznau in a day, but I knew\nwe could go down by rail in about an hour, so I chose the latter method.\nI wanted to see what it was like, anyway. The train came along about the\nmiddle of the afternoon, and an odd thing it was. The locomotive-boiler\nstood on end, and it and the whole locomotive were tilted sharply\nbackward. There were two passenger-cars, roofed, but wide open all\naround. These cars were not tilted back, but the seats were; this\nenables the passenger to sit level while going down a steep incline.\n\nThere are three railway-tracks; the central one is cogged; the \"lantern\nwheel\" of the engine grips its way along these cogs, and pulls the\ntrain up the hill or retards its motion on the down trip. About the same\nspeed--three miles an hour--is maintained both ways. Whether going up or\ndown, the locomotive is always at the lower end of the train. It pushes\nin the one case, braces back in the other. The passenger rides backward\ngoing up, and faces forward going down.\n\nWe got front seats, and while the train moved along about fifty yards\non level ground, I was not the least frightened; but now it started\nabruptly downstairs, and I caught my breath. And I, like my neighbors,\nunconsciously held back all I could, and threw my weight to the rear,\nbut, of course, that did no particular good. I had slidden down the\nbalusters when I was a boy, and thought nothing of it, but to slide down\nthe balusters in a railway-train is a thing to make one's flesh creep.\nSometimes we had as much as ten yards of almost level ground, and this\ngave us a few full breaths in comfort; but straightway we would turn a\ncorner and see a long steep line of rails stretching down below us, and\nthe comfort was at an end. One expected to see the locomotive pause,\nor slack up a little, and approach this plunge cautiously, but it\ndid nothing of the kind; it went calmly on, and went it reached the\njumping-off place it made a sudden bow, and went gliding smoothly\ndownstairs, untroubled by the circumstances.\n\nIt was wildly exhilarating to slide along the edge of the precipices,\nafter this grisly fashion, and look straight down upon that far-off\nvalley which I was describing a while ago.\n\nThere was no level ground at the Kaltbad station; the railbed was as\nsteep as a roof; I was curious to see how the stop was going to be\nmanaged. But it was very simple; the train came sliding down, and when\nit reached the right spot it just stopped--that was all there was \"to\nit\"--stopped on the steep incline, and when the exchange of passengers\nand baggage had been made, it moved off and went sliding down again. The\ntrain can be stopped anywhere, at a moment's notice.\n\nThere was one curious effect, which I need not take the trouble to\ndescribe--because I can scissor a description of it out of the railway\ncompany's advertising pamphlet, and save my ink:\n\n\n\n\"On the whole tour, particularly at the Descent, we undergo an optical\nillusion which often seems to be incredible. All the shrubs, fir trees,\nstables, houses, etc., seem to be bent in a slanting direction, as by an\nimmense pressure of air. They are all standing awry, so much awry that\nthe chalets and cottages of the peasants seem to be tumbling down. It\nis the consequence of the steep inclination of the line. Those who\nare seated in the carriage do not observe that they are going down a\ndeclivity of twenty to twenty-five degrees (their seats being adapted\nto this course of proceeding and being bent down at their backs). They\nmistake their carriage and its horizontal lines for a proper measure of\nthe normal plain, and therefore all the objects outside which really\nare in a horizontal position must show a disproportion of twenty to\ntwenty-five degrees declivity, in regard to the mountain.\"\n\nBy the time one reaches Kaltbad, he has acquired confidence in the\nrailway, and he now ceases to try to ease the locomotive by holding\nback. Thenceforth he smokes his pipe in serenity, and gazes out upon the\nmagnificent picture below and about him with unfettered enjoyment. There\nis nothing to interrupt the view or the breeze; it is like inspecting\nthe world on the wing. However--to be exact--there is one place where\nthe serenity lapses for a while; this is while one is crossing the\nSchnurrtobel Bridge, a frail structure which swings its gossamer frame\ndown through the dizzy air, over a gorge, like a vagrant spider-strand.\n\nOne has no difficulty in remembering his sins while the train is\ncreeping down this bridge; and he repents of them, too; though he sees,\nwhen he gets to Vitznau, that he need not have done it, the bridge was\nperfectly safe.\n\nSo ends the eventual trip which we made to the Rigi-Kulm to see an\nAlpine sunrise.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n[Harris Climbs Mountains for Me]\n\n\nAn hour's sail brought us to Lucerne again. I judged it best to go to\nbed and rest several days, for I knew that the man who undertakes to\nmake the tour of Europe on foot must take care of himself.\n\nThinking over my plans, as mapped out, I perceived that they did not\ntake in the Furka Pass, the Rhone Glacier, the Finsteraarhorn, the\nWetterhorn, etc. I immediately examined the guide-book to see if these\nwere important, and found they were; in fact, a pedestrian tour of\nEurope could not be complete without them. Of course that decided me at\nonce to see them, for I never allow myself to do things by halves, or in\na slurring, slipshod way.\n\nI called in my agent and instructed him to go without delay and make a\ncareful examination of these noted places, on foot, and bring me back a\nwritten report of the result, for insertion in my book. I instructed\nhim to go to Hospenthal as quickly as possible, and make his grand start\nfrom there; to extend his foot expedition as far as the Giesbach fall,\nand return to me from thence by diligence or mule. I told him to take\nthe courier with him.\n\nHe objected to the courier, and with some show of reason, since he was\nabout to venture upon new and untried ground; but I thought he might\nas well learn how to take care of the courier now as later, therefore I\nenforced my point. I said that the trouble, delay, and inconvenience\nof traveling with a courier were balanced by the deep respect which a\ncourier's presence commands, and I must insist that as much style be\nthrown into my journeys as possible.\n\nSo the two assumed complete mountaineering costumes and departed. A week\nlater they returned, pretty well used up, and my agent handed me the\nfollowing: Official Report\n\nOF A VISIT TO THE FURKA REGION.\n\nBY H. HARRIS, AGENT About seven o'clock in the morning, with perfectly\nfine weather, we started from Hospenthal, and arrived at the MAISON on\nthe Furka in a little under QUATRE hours. The want of variety in the\nscenery from Hospenthal made the KAHKAHPONEEKA wearisome; but let none\nbe discouraged; no one can fail to be completely R'ECOMPENS'EE for his\nfatigue, when he sees, for the first time, the monarch of the Oberland,\nthe tremendous Finsteraarhorn. A moment before all was dullness, but\na PAS further has placed us on the summit of the Furka; and exactly in\nfront of us, at a HOPOW of only fifteen miles, this magnificent mountain\nlifts its snow-wreathed precipices into the deep blue sky. The inferior\nmountains on each side of the pass form a sort of frame for the picture\nof their dread lord, and close in the view so completely that no other\nprominent feature in the Oberland is visible from this BONG-A-BONG;\nnothing withdraws the attention from the solitary grandeur of the\nFinsteraarhorn and the dependent spurs which form the abutments of the\ncentral peak.\n\n\n\nWith the addition of some others, who were also bound for the Grimsel,\nwe formed a large XHVLOJ as we descended the STEG which winds round the\nshoulder of a mountain toward the Rhone Glacier. We soon left the path\nand took to the ice; and after wandering amongst the crevices UN PEU, to\nadmire the wonders of these deep blue caverns, and hear the rushing of\nwaters through their subglacial channels, we struck out a course toward\nL'AUTRE C\u00d4TE and crossed the glacier successfully, a little above the\ncave from which the infant Rhone takes its first bound from under the\ngrand precipice of ice. Half a mile below this we began to climb the\nflowery side of the Meienwand. One of our party started before the rest,\nbut the HITZE was so great, that we found IHM quite exhausted, and lying\nat full length in the shade of a large GESTEIN. We sat down with him\nfor a time, for all felt the heat exceedingly in the climb up this very\nsteep BOLWOGGOLY, and then we set out again together, and arrived at\nlast near the Dead Man's Lake, at the foot of the Sidelhorn. This lonely\nspot, once used for an extempore burying-place, after a sanguinary\nBATTUE between the French and Austrians, is the perfection of\ndesolation; there is nothing in sight to mark the hand of man, except\nthe line of weather-beaten whitened posts, set up to indicate the\ndirection of the pass in the OWDAWAKK of winter. Near this point the\nfootpath joins the wider track, which connects the Grimsel with the head\nof the Rhone SCHNAWP; this has been carefully constructed, and leads\nwith a tortuous course among and over LES PIERRES, down to the bank of\nthe gloomy little SWOSH-SWOSH, which almost washes against the walls of\nthe Grimsel Hospice. We arrived a little before four o'clock at the end\nof our day's journey, hot enough to justify the step, taking by most of\nthe PARTIE, of plunging into the crystal water of the snow-fed lake.\n\n\n\nThe next afternoon we started for a walk up the Unteraar glacier, with\nthe intention of, at all events, getting as far as the H\u00fctte which is\nused as a sleeping-place by most of those who cross the Strahleck Pass\nto Grindelwald. We got over the tedious collection of stones and D\u00c9BRIS\nwhich covers the PIED of the GLETCHER, and had walked nearly three hours\nfrom the Grimsel, when, just as we were thinking of crossing over to the\nright, to climb the cliffs at the foot of the hut, the clouds, which had\nfor some time assumed a threatening appearance, suddenly dropped, and\na huge mass of them, driving toward us from the Finsteraarhorn, poured\ndown a deluge of HABOOLONG and hail. Fortunately, we were not far from\na very large glacier-table; it was a huge rock balanced on a pedestal\nof ice high enough to admit of our all creeping under it for GOWKARAK.\nA stream of PUCKITTYPUKK had furrowed a course for itself in the ice\nat its base, and we were obliged to stand with one FUSS on each side of\nthis, and endeavor to keep ourselves CHAUD by cutting steps in the steep\nbank of the pedestal, so as to get a higher place for standing on,\nas the WASSER rose rapidly in its trench. A very cold BZZZZZZZZEEE\naccompanied the storm, and made our position far from pleasant; and\npresently came a flash of BLITZEN, apparently in the middle of our\nlittle party, with an instantaneous clap of YOKKY, sounding like a large\ngun fired close to our ears; the effect was startling; but in a few\nseconds our attention was fixed by the roaring echoes of the thunder\nagainst the tremendous mountains which completely surrounded us. This\nwas followed by many more bursts, none of WELCHE, however, was so\ndangerously near; and after waiting a long DEMI-hour in our icy prison,\nwe sallied out to talk through a HABOOLONG which, though not so heavy\nas before, was quite enough to give us a thorough soaking before our\narrival at the Hospice.\n\nThe Grimsel is CERTAINEMENT a wonderful place; situated at the bottom\nof a sort of huge crater, the sides of which are utterly savage GEBIRGE,\ncomposed of barren rocks which cannot even support a single pine ARBRE,\nand afford only scanty food for a herd of GMWKWLLOLP, it looks as if\nit must be completely BEGRABEN in the winter snows. Enormous avalanches\nfall against it every spring, sometimes covering everything to the depth\nof thirty or forty feet; and, in spite of walls four feet thick, and\nfurnished with outside shutters, the two men who stay here when the\nVOYAGEURS are snugly quartered in their distant homes can tell you that\nthe snow sometimes shakes the house to its foundations.\n\nNext morning the HOGGLEBUMGULLUP still continued bad, but we made up our\nminds to go on, and make the best of it. Half an hour after we started,\nthe REGEN thickened unpleasantly, and we attempted to get shelter under\na projecting rock, but being far to NASS already to make standing at\nall AGR\u00c9ABLE, we pushed on for the Handeck, consoling ourselves with the\nreflection that from the furious rushing of the river Aar at our\nside, we should at all events see the celebrated WASSERFALL in GRANDE\nPERFECTION. Nor were we NAPPERSOCKET in our expectation; the water\nwas roaring down its leap of two hundred and fifty feet in a most\nmagnificent frenzy, while the trees which cling to its rocky sides\nswayed to and fro in the violence of the hurricane which it brought down\nwith it; even the stream, which falls into the main cascade at right\nangles, and TOUTEFOIS forms a beautiful feature in the scene, was now\nswollen into a raging torrent; and the violence of this \"meeting of the\nwaters,\" about fifty feet below the frail bridge where we stood, was\nfearfully grand. While we were looking at it, GL\u00dcECKLICHEWEISE a gleam\nof sunshine came out, and instantly a beautiful rainbow was formed by\nthe spray, and hung in mid-air suspended over the awful gorge.\n\nOn going into the CHALET above the fall, we were informed that a BRUECKE\nhad broken down near Guttanen, and that it would be impossible to\nproceed for some time; accordingly we were kept in our drenched\ncondition for EIN STUNDE, when some VOYAGEURS arrived from Meiringen,\nand told us that there had been a trifling accident, ABER that we could\nnow cross. On arriving at the spot, I was much inclined to suspect that\nthe whole story was a ruse to make us SLOWWK and drink the more at the\nHandeck Inn, for only a few planks had been carried away, and though\nthere might perhaps have been some difficulty with mules, the gap was\ncertainly not larger than a MMBGLX might cross with a very slight leap.\nNear Guttanen the HABOOLONG happily ceased, and we had time to walk\nourselves tolerably dry before arriving at Reichenback, WO we enjoyed a\ngood DIN\u00c9 at the Hotel des Alps.\n\n\n\nNext morning we walked to Rosenlaui, the BEAU ID\u00c9AL of Swiss scenery,\nwhere we spent the middle of the day in an excursion to the glacier.\nThis was more beautiful than words can describe, for in the constant\nprogress of the ice it has changed the form of its extremity and formed\na vast cavern, as blue as the sky above, and rippled like a frozen\nocean. A few steps cut in the WHOOPJAMBOREEHOO enabled us to walk\ncompletely under this, and feast our eyes upon one of the loveliest\nobjects in creation. The glacier was all around divided by numberless\nfissures of the same exquisite color, and the finest wood-ERDBEEREN were\ngrowing in abundance but a few yards from the ice. The inn stands in a\nCHARMANT spot close to the C\u00d4T\u00c9 DE LA RIVI\u00c8RE, which, lower down, forms\nthe Reichenbach fall, and embosomed in the richest of pine woods,\nwhile the fine form of the Wellhorn looking down upon it completes the\nenchanting BOPPLE. In the afternoon we walked over the Great Scheideck\nto Grindelwald, stopping to pay a visit to the Upper glacier by the way;\nbut we were again overtaken by bad HOGGLEBUMGULLUP and arrived at the\nhotel in a SOLCHE a state that the landlord's wardrobe was in great\nrequest.\n\nThe clouds by this time seemed to have done their worst, for a lovely\nday succeeded, which we determined to devote to an ascent of the\nFaulhorn. We left Grindelwald just as a thunder-storm was dying away,\nand we hoped to find GUTEN WETTER up above; but the rain, which had\nnearly ceased, began again, and we were struck by the rapidly increasing\nFROID as we ascended. Two-thirds of the way up were completed when\nthe rain was exchanged for GNILLIC, with which the BODEN was thickly\ncovered, and before we arrived at the top the GNILLIC and mist became\nso thick that we could not see one another at more than twenty POOPOO\ndistance, and it became difficult to pick our way over the rough and\nthickly covered ground. Shivering with cold, we turned into bed with a\ndouble allowance of clothes, and slept comfortably while the wind\nhowled AUTOUR DE LA MAISON; when I awoke, the wall and the window looked\nequally dark, but in another hour I found I could just see the form\nof the latter; so I jumped out of bed, and forced it open, though with\ngreat difficulty from the frost and the quantities of GNILLIC heaped up\nagainst it.\n\nA row of huge icicles hung down from the edge of the roof, and anything\nmore wintry than the whole ANBLICK could not well be imagined; but the\nsudden appearance of the great mountains in front was so startling\nthat I felt no inclination to move toward bed again. The snow which\nhad collected upon LA F\u00caNTRE had increased the FINSTERNISS ODER DER\nDUNKELHEIT, so that when I looked out I was surprised to find that the\ndaylight was considerable, and that the BALRAGOOMAH would evidently rise\nbefore long. Only the brightest of LES E'TOILES were still shining; the\nsky was cloudless overhead, though small curling mists lay thousands of\nfeet below us in the valleys, wreathed around the feet of the mountains,\nand adding to the splendor of their lofty summits. We were soon dressed\nand out of the house, watching the gradual approach of dawn, thoroughly\nabsorbed in the first near view of the Oberland giants, which broke\nupon us unexpectedly after the intense obscurity of the evening before.\n\"KABAUGWAKKO SONGWASHEE KUM WETTERHORN SNAWPO!\" cried some one, as that\ngrand summit gleamed with the first rose of dawn; and in a few moments\nthe double crest of the Schreckhorn followed its example; peak after\npeak seemed warmed with life, the Jungfrau blushed even more beautifully\nthan her neighbors, and soon, from the Wetterhorn in the east to the\nWildstrubel in the west, a long row of fires glowed upon mighty altars,\ntruly worthy of the gods.\n\n\n\nThe WLGW was very severe; our sleeping-place could hardly be DISTINGUE\u00c9\nfrom the snow around it, which had fallen to a depth of a FLIRK during\nthe past evening, and we heartily enjoyed a rough scramble EN BAS to\nthe Giesbach falls, where we soon found a warm climate. At noon the day\nbefore Grindelwald the thermometer could not have stood at less than 100\ndegrees Fahr. in the sun; and in the evening, judging from the icicles\nformed, and the state of the windows, there must have been at least\ntwelve DINGBLATTER of frost, thus giving a change of 80 degrees during a\nfew hours.\n\nI said:\n\n\"You have done well, Harris; this report is concise, compact, well\nexpressed; the language is crisp, the descriptions are vivid and not\nneedlessly elaborated; your report goes straight to the point, attends\nstrictly to business, and doesn't fool around. It is in many ways an\nexcellent document. But it has a fault--it is too learned, it is much\ntoo learned. What is 'DINGBLATTER'?\n\n\"'DINGBLATTER' is a Fiji word meaning 'degrees.'\"\n\n\"You knew the English of it, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"What is 'GNILLIC'?\n\n\"That is the Eskimo term for 'snow.'\"\n\n\"So you knew the English for that, too?\"\n\n\"Why, certainly.\"\n\n\"What does 'MMBGLX' stand for?\"\n\n\"That is Zulu for 'pedestrian.'\"\n\n\"'While the form of the Wellhorn looking down upon it completes the\nenchanting BOPPLE.' What is 'BOPPLE'?\"\n\n\"'Picture.' It's Choctaw.\"\n\n\"What is 'SCHNAWP'?\"\n\n\"'Valley.' That is Choctaw, also.\"\n\n\"What is 'BOLWOGGOLY'?\"\n\n\"That is Chinese for 'hill.'\"\n\n\"'KAHKAHPONEEKA'?\"\n\n\"'Ascent.' Choctaw.\"\n\n\"'But we were again overtaken by bad HOGGLEBUMGULLUP.' What does\n'HOGGLEBUMGULLUP' mean?\"\n\n\"That is Chinese for 'weather.'\"\n\n\"Is 'HOGGLEBUMGULLUP' better than the English word? Is it any more\ndescriptive?\"\n\n\"No, it means just the same.\"\n\n\"And 'DINGBLATTER' and 'GNILLIC,' and 'BOPPLE,' and 'SCHNAWP'--are they\nbetter than the English words?\"\n\n\"No, they mean just what the English ones do.\"\n\n\"Then why do you use them? Why have you used all this Chinese and\nChoctaw and Zulu rubbish?\"\n\n\"Because I didn't know any French but two or three words, and I didn't\nknow any Latin or Greek at all.\"\n\n\"That is nothing. Why should you want to use foreign words, anyhow?\"\n\n\"They adorn my page. They all do it.\"\n\n\"Who is 'all'?\"\n\n\"Everybody. Everybody that writes elegantly. Anybody has a right to that\nwants to.\"\n\n\"I think you are mistaken.\" I then proceeded in the following scathing\nmanner. \"When really learned men write books for other learned men\nto read, they are justified in using as many learned words as they\nplease--their audience will understand them; but a man who writes a book\nfor the general public to read is not justified in disfiguring his pages\nwith untranslated foreign expressions. It is an insolence toward the\nmajority of the purchasers, for it is a very frank and impudent way of\nsaying, 'Get the translations made yourself if you want them, this\nbook is not written for the ignorant classes.' There are men who know\na foreign language so well and have used it so long in their daily\nlife that they seem to discharge whole volleys of it into their English\nwritings unconsciously, and so they omit to translate, as much as\nhalf the time. That is a great cruelty to nine out of ten of the man's\nreaders. What is the excuse for this? The writer would say he only uses\nthe foreign language where the delicacy of his point cannot be conveyed\nin English. Very well, then he writes his best things for the tenth man,\nand he ought to warn the nine other not to buy his book. However, the\nexcuse he offers is at least an excuse; but there is another set of\nmen who are like YOU; they know a WORD here and there, of a foreign\nlanguage, or a few beggarly little three-word phrases, filched from the\nback of the Dictionary, and these are continually peppering into their\nliterature, with a pretense of knowing that language--what excuse can\nthey offer? The foreign words and phrases which they use have their\nexact equivalents in a nobler language--English; yet they think they\n'adorn their page' when they say STRASSE for street, and BAHNHOF for\nrailway-station, and so on--flaunting these fluttering rags of poverty\nin the reader's face and imagining he will be ass enough to take\nthem for the sign of untold riches held in reserve. I will let your\n'learning' remain in your report; you have as much right, I suppose, to\n'adorn your page' with Zulu and Chinese and Choctaw rubbish as others of\nyour sort have to adorn theirs with insolent odds and ends smouched from\nhalf a dozen learned tongues whose A-B ABS they don't even know.\"\n\nWhen the musing spider steps upon the red-hot shovel, he first exhibits\na wild surprise, then he shrivels up. Similar was the effect of these\nblistering words upon the tranquil and unsuspecting Agent. I can be\ndreadfully rough on a person when the mood takes me.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n[Alp-scaling by Carriage]\n\n\nWe now prepared for a considerable walk--from Lucerne to Interlaken,\nover the Bruenig Pass. But at the last moment the weather was so good\nthat I changed my mind and hired a four-horse carriage. It was a huge\nvehicle, roomy, as easy in its motion as a palanquin, and exceedingly\ncomfortable.\n\nWe got away pretty early in the morning, after a hot breakfast, and\nwent bowling over a hard, smooth road, through the summer loveliness of\nSwitzerland, with near and distant lakes and mountains before and about\nus for the entertainment of the eye, and the music of multitudinous\nbirds to charm the ear. Sometimes there was only the width of the road\nbetween the imposing precipices on the right and the clear cool water on\nthe left with its shoals of uncatchable fish skimming about through the\nbars of sun and shadow; and sometimes, in place of the precipices, the\ngrassy land stretched away, in an apparently endless upward slant,\nand was dotted everywhere with snug little chalets, the peculiarly\ncaptivating cottage of Switzerland.\n\nThe ordinary chalet turns a broad, honest gable end to the road, and\nits ample roof hovers over the home in a protecting, caressing way,\nprojecting its sheltering eaves far outward. The quaint windows are\nfilled with little panes, and garnished with white muslin curtains,\nand brightened with boxes of blooming flowers. Across the front of the\nhouse, and up the spreading eaves and along the fanciful railings of\nthe shallow porch, are elaborate carvings--wreaths, fruits, arabesques,\nverses from Scripture, names, dates, etc. The building is wholly of\nwood, reddish brown in tint, a very pleasing color. It generally has\nvines climbing over it. Set such a house against the fresh green of the\nhillside, and it looks ever so cozy and inviting and picturesque, and is\na decidedly graceful addition to the landscape.\n\nOne does not find out what a hold the chalet has taken upon him, until\nhe presently comes upon a new house--a house which is aping the town\nfashions of Germany and France, a prim, hideous, straight-up-and-down\nthing, plastered all over on the outside to look like stone, and\naltogether so stiff, and formal, and ugly, and forbidding, and so out of\ntune with the gracious landscape, and so deaf and dumb and dead to the\npoetry of its surroundings, that it suggests an undertaker at a picnic,\na corpse at a wedding, a puritan in Paradise.\n\n\n\nIn the course of the morning we passed the spot where Pontius Pilate is\nsaid to have thrown himself into the lake. The legend goes that after\nthe Crucifixion his conscience troubled him, and he fled from Jerusalem\nand wandered about the earth, weary of life and a prey to tortures\nof the mind. Eventually, he hid himself away, on the heights of Mount\nPilatus, and dwelt alone among the clouds and crags for years; but rest\nand peace were still denied him, so he finally put an end to his misery\nby drowning himself.\n\nPresently we passed the place where a man of better odor was born. This\nwas the children's friend, Santa Claus, or St. Nicholas. There are some\nunaccountable reputations in the world. This saint's is an instance. He\nhas ranked for ages as the peculiar friend of children, yet it appears\nhe was not much of a friend to his own. He had ten of them, and when\nfifty years old he left them, and sought out as dismal a refuge from the\nworld as possible, and became a hermit in order that he might reflect\nupon pious themes without being disturbed by the joyous and other noises\nfrom the nursery, doubtless.\n\n\n\nJudging by Pilate and St. Nicholas, there exists no rule for the\nconstruction of hermits; they seem made out of all kinds of material.\nBut Pilate attended to the matter of expiating his sin while he was\nalive, whereas St. Nicholas will probably have to go on climbing down\nsooty chimneys, Christmas eve, forever, and conferring kindness on other\npeople's children, to make up for deserting his own. His bones are kept\nin a church in a village (Sachseln) which we visited, and are naturally\nheld in great reverence. His portrait is common in the farmhouses of\nthe region, but is believed by many to be but an indifferent likeness.\nDuring his hermit life, according to legend, he partook of the bread\nand wine of the communion once a month, but all the rest of the month he\nfasted.\n\n\n\nA constant marvel with us, as we sped along the bases of the steep\nmountains on this journey, was, not that avalanches occur, but that they\nare not occurring all the time. One does not understand why rocks\nand landslides do not plunge down these declivities daily. A landslip\noccurred three quarters of a century ago, on the route from Arth to\nBrunnen, which was a formidable thing. A mass of conglomerate two miles\nlong, a thousand feet broad, and a hundred feet thick, broke away from a\ncliff three thousand feet high and hurled itself into the valley below,\nburying four villages and five hundred people, as in a grave.\n\n\n\nWe had such a beautiful day, and such endless pictures of limpid lakes,\nand green hills and valleys, and majestic mountains, and milky cataracts\ndancing down the steeps and gleaming in the sun, that we could not help\nfeeling sweet toward all the world; so we tried to drink all the\nmilk, and eat all the grapes and apricots and berries, and buy all the\nbouquets of wild flowers which the little peasant boys and girls offered\nfor sale; but we had to retire from this contract, for it was too heavy.\n\nAt short distances--and they were entirely too short--all along the\nroad, were groups of neat and comely children, with their wares nicely\nand temptingly set forth in the grass under the shade trees, and as soon\nas we approached they swarmed into the road, holding out their baskets\nand milk bottles, and ran beside the carriage, barefoot and bareheaded,\nand importuned us to buy. They seldom desisted early, but continued to\nrun and insist--beside the wagon while they could, and behind it until\nthey lost breath. Then they turned and chased a returning carriage back\nto their trading-post again. After several hours of this, without any\nintermission, it becomes almost annoying. I do not know what we should\nhave done without the returning carriages to draw off the pursuit.\nHowever, there were plenty of these, loaded with dusty tourists and\npiled high with luggage. Indeed, from Lucerne to Interlaken we had\nthe spectacle, among other scenery, of an unbroken procession of\nfruit-peddlers and tourists carriages.\n\nOur talk was mostly anticipatory of what we should see on the down-grade\nof the Bruenig, by and by, after we should pass the summit. All our\nfriends in Lucerne had said that to look down upon Meiringen, and the\nrushing blue-gray river Aar, and the broad level green valley; and\nacross at the mighty Alpine precipices that rise straight up to the\nclouds out of that valley; and up at the microscopic chalets perched\nupon the dizzy eaves of those precipices and winking dimly and fitfully\nthrough the drifting veil of vapor; and still up and up, at the superb\nOltschiback and the other beautiful cascades that leap from those rugged\nheights, robed in powdery spray, ruffled with foam, and girdled with\nrainbows--to look upon these things, they say, was to look upon the last\npossibility of the sublime and the enchanting. Therefore, as I say,\nwe talked mainly of these coming wonders; if we were conscious of any\nimpatience, it was to get there in favorable season; if we felt any\nanxiety, it was that the day might remain perfect, and enable us to see\nthose marvels at their best.\n\nAs we approached the Kaiserstuhl, a part of the harness gave way.\n\nWe were in distress for a moment, but only a moment. It was the\nfore-and-aft gear that was broken--the thing that leads aft from the\nforward part of the horse and is made fast to the thing that pulls the\nwagon. In America this would have been a heavy leathern strap; but, all\nover the continent it is nothing but a piece of rope the size of\nyour little finger--clothes-line is what it is. Cabs use it, private\ncarriages, freight-carts and wagons, all sorts of vehicles have it. In\nMunich I afterward saw it used on a long wagon laden with fifty-four\nhalf-barrels of beer; I had before noticed that the cabs in Heidelberg\nused it--not new rope, but rope that had been in use since Abraham's\ntime --and I had felt nervous, sometimes, behind it when the cab was\ntearing down a hill. But I had long been accustomed to it now, and had\neven become afraid of the leather strap which belonged in its place. Our\ndriver got a fresh piece of clothes-line out of his locker and repaired\nthe break in two minutes.\n\nSo much for one European fashion. Every country has its own ways. It may\ninterest the reader to know how they \"put horses to\" on the continent.\nThe man stands up the horses on each side of the thing that projects\nfrom the front end of the wagon, and then throws the tangled mess of\ngear forward through a ring, and hauls it aft, and passes the other\nthing through the other ring and hauls it aft on the other side of the\nother horse, opposite to the first one, after crossing them and bringing\nthe loose end back, and then buckles the other thing underneath the\nhorse, and takes another thing and wraps it around the thing I spoke\nof before, and puts another thing over each horse's head, with broad\nflappers to it to keep the dust out of his eyes, and puts the iron thing\nin his mouth for him to grit his teeth on, uphill, and brings the ends\nof these things aft over his back, after buckling another one around\nunder his neck to hold his head up, and hitching another thing on\na thing that goes over his shoulders to keep his head up when he is\nclimbing a hill, and then takes the slack of the thing which I mentioned\na while ago, and fetches it aft and makes it fast to the thing that\npulls the wagon, and hands the other things up to the driver to steer\nwith. I never have buckled up a horse myself, but I do not think we do\nit that way.\n\n\n\nWe had four very handsome horses, and the driver was very proud of his\nturnout. He would bowl along on a reasonable trot, on the highway, but\nwhen he entered a village he did it on a furious run, and accompanied it\nwith a frenzy of ceaseless whip-crackings that sounded like volleys of\nmusketry. He tore through the narrow streets and around the sharp curves\nlike a moving earthquake, showering his volleys as he went, and before\nhim swept a continuous tidal wave of scampering children, ducks, cats,\nand mothers clasping babies which they had snatched out of the way of\nthe coming destruction; and as this living wave washed aside, along the\nwalls, its elements, being safe, forgot their fears and turned their\nadmiring gaze upon that gallant driver till he thundered around the next\ncurve and was lost to sight.\n\nHe was a great man to those villagers, with his gaudy clothes and his\nterrific ways. Whenever he stopped to have his cattle watered and fed\nwith loaves of bread, the villagers stood around admiring him while\nhe swaggered about, the little boys gazed up at his face with humble\nhomage, and the landlord brought out foaming mugs of beer and conversed\nproudly with him while he drank. Then he mounted his lofty box, swung\nhis explosive whip, and away he went again, like a storm. I had not\nseen anything like this before since I was a boy, and the stage used to\nflourish the village with the dust flying and the horn tooting.\n\n\n\nWhen we reached the base of the Kaiserstuhl, we took two more horses; we\nhad to toil along with difficulty for an hour and a half or two hours,\nfor the ascent was not very gradual, but when we passed the backbone and\napproached the station, the driver surpassed all his previous efforts in\nthe way of rush and clatter. He could not have six horses all the time,\nso he made the most of his chance while he had it.\n\nUp to this point we had been in the heart of the William Tell region.\nThe hero is not forgotten, by any means, or held in doubtful veneration.\nHis wooden image, with his bow drawn, above the doors of taverns, was a\nfrequent feature of the scenery.\n\nAbout noon we arrived at the foot of the Bruenig Pass, and made a\ntwo-hour stop at the village hotel, another of those clean, pretty, and\nthoroughly well-kept inns which are such an astonishment to people\nwho are accustomed to hotels of a dismally different pattern in remote\ncountry-towns. There was a lake here, in the lap of the great mountains,\nthe green slopes that rose toward the lower crags were graced with\nscattered Swiss cottages nestling among miniature farms and gardens,\nand from out a leafy ambuscade in the upper heights tumbled a brawling\ncataract.\n\n\n\nCarriage after carriage, laden with tourists and trunks, arrived, and\nthe quiet hotel was soon populous. We were early at the table d'h\u00f4te and\nsaw the people all come in. There were twenty-five, perhaps. They were\nof various nationalities, but we were the only Americans. Next to me sat\nan English bride, and next to her sat her new husband, whom she called\n\"Neddy,\" though he was big enough and stalwart enough to be entitled to\nhis full name. They had a pretty little lovers' quarrel over what wine\nthey should have. Neddy was for obeying the guide-book and taking the\nwine of the country; but the bride said:\n\n\"What, that nahsty stuff!\"\n\n\"It isn't nahsty, pet, it's quite good.\"\n\n\"It IS nahsty.\"\n\n\"No, it ISN'T nahsty.\"\n\n\"It's Oful nahsty, Neddy, and I shahn't drink it.\"\n\nThen the question was, what she must have. She said he knew very well\nthat she never drank anything but champagne.\n\nShe added:\n\n\"You know very well papa always has champagne on his table, and I've\nalways been used to it.\"\n\nNeddy made a playful pretense of being distressed about the expense,\nand this amused her so much that she nearly exhausted herself with\nlaughter--and this pleased HIM so much that he repeated his jest a\ncouple of times, and added new and killing varieties to it. When the\nbride finally recovered, she gave Neddy a love-box on the arm with her\nfan, and said with arch severity:\n\n\"Well, you would HAVE me--nothing else would do--so you'll have to make\nthe best of a bad bargain. DO order the champagne, I'm Oful dry.\"\n\n\n\nSo with a mock groan which made her laugh again, Neddy ordered the\nchampagne.\n\nThe fact that this young woman had never moistened the selvedge edge of\nher soul with a less plebeian tipple than champagne, had a marked and\nsubduing effect on Harris. He believed she belonged to the royal family.\nBut I had my doubts.\n\nWe heard two or three different languages spoken by people at the\ntable and guessed out the nationalities of most of the guests to our\nsatisfaction, but we failed with an elderly gentleman and his wife and\na young girl who sat opposite us, and with a gentleman of about\nthirty-five who sat three seats beyond Harris. We did not hear any of\nthese speak. But finally the last-named gentleman left while we were not\nnoticing, but we looked up as he reached the far end of the table. He\nstopped there a moment, and made his toilet with a pocket comb. So he\nwas a German; or else he had lived in German hotels long enough to catch\nthe fashion. When the elderly couple and the young girl rose to leave,\nthey bowed respectfully to us. So they were Germans, too. This national\ncustom is worth six of the other one, for export.\n\n\n\nAfter dinner we talked with several Englishmen, and they inflamed our\ndesire to a hotter degree than ever, to see the sights of Meiringen from\nthe heights of the Bruenig Pass. They said the view was marvelous, and\nthat one who had seen it once could never forget it. They also spoke of\nthe romantic nature of the road over the pass, and how in one place it\nhad been cut through a flank of the solid rock, in such a way that the\nmountain overhung the tourist as he passed by; and they furthermore said\nthat the sharp turns in the road and the abruptness of the descent would\nafford us a thrilling experience, for we should go down in a flying\ngallop and seem to be spinning around the rings of a whirlwind, like a\ndrop of whiskey descending the spirals of a corkscrew.\n\n\n\nI got all the information out of these gentlemen that we could need; and\nthen, to make everything complete, I asked them if a body could get hold\nof a little fruit and milk here and there, in case of necessity. They\nthrew up their hands in speechless intimation that the road was simply\npaved with refreshment-peddlers. We were impatient to get away, now, and\nthe rest of our two-hour stop rather dragged. But finally the set time\narrived and we began the ascent. Indeed it was a wonderful road. It was\nsmooth, and compact, and clean, and the side next the precipices was\nguarded all along by dressed stone posts about three feet high, placed\nat short distances apart. The road could not have been better built if\nNapoleon the First had built it. He seems to have been the introducer of\nthe sort of roads which Europe now uses. All literature which describes\nlife as it existed in England, France, and Germany up to the close\nof the last century, is filled with pictures of coaches and carriages\nwallowing through these three countries in mud and slush half-wheel\ndeep; but after Napoleon had floundered through a conquered kingdom he\ngenerally arranged things so that the rest of the world could follow\ndry-shod.\n\nWe went on climbing, higher and higher, and curving hither and thither,\nin the shade of noble woods, and with a rich variety and profusion of\nwild flowers all about us; and glimpses of rounded grassy backbones\nbelow us occupied by trim chalets and nibbling sheep, and other glimpses\nof far lower altitudes, where distance diminished the chalets to toys\nand obliterated the sheep altogether; and every now and then some\nermined monarch of the Alps swung magnificently into view for a moment,\nthen drifted past an intervening spur and disappeared again.\n\nIt was an intoxicating trip altogether; the exceeding sense of\nsatisfaction that follows a good dinner added largely to the enjoyment;\nthe having something especial to look forward to and muse about, like\nthe approaching grandeurs of Meiringen, sharpened the zest. Smoking\nwas never so good before, solid comfort was never solider; we lay back\nagainst the thick cushions silent, meditative, steeped in felicity. *\n* * * * * * * I rubbed my eyes, opened them, and started. I had been\ndreaming I was at sea, and it was a thrilling surprise to wake up and\nfind land all around me. It took me a couple seconds to \"come to,\" as\nyou may say; then I took in the situation. The horses were drinking at\na trough in the edge of a town, the driver was taking beer, Harris was\nsnoring at my side, the courier, with folded arms and bowed head, was\nsleeping on the box, two dozen barefooted and bareheaded children were\ngathered about the carriage, with their hands crossed behind, gazing up\nwith serious and innocent admiration at the dozing tourists baking there\nin the sun. Several small girls held night-capped babies nearly as big\nas themselves in their arms, and even these fat babies seemed to take a\nsort of sluggish interest in us.\n\n\n\nWe had slept an hour and a half and missed all the scenery! I did not\nneed anybody to tell me that. If I had been a girl, I could have cursed\nfor vexation. As it was, I woke up the agent and gave him a piece of\nmy mind. Instead of being humiliated, he only upbraided me for being\nso wanting in vigilance. He said he had expected to improve his mind by\ncoming to Europe, but a man might travel to the ends of the earth with\nme and never see anything, for I was manifestly endowed with the very\ngenius of ill luck. He even tried to get up some emotion about that\npoor courier, who never got a chance to see anything, on account of my\nheedlessness. But when I thought I had borne about enough of this kind\nof talk, I threatened to make Harris tramp back to the summit and make a\nreport on that scenery, and this suggestion spiked his battery.\n\nWe drove sullenly through Brienz, dead to the seductions of its\nbewildering array of Swiss carvings and the clamorous HOO-hooing of\nits cuckoo clocks, and had not entirely recovered our spirits when we\nrattled across a bridge over the rushing blue river and entered the\npretty town of Interlaken. It was just about sunset, and we had made the\ntrip from Lucerne in ten hours.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n[The Jungfrau, the Bride, and the Piano]\n\n\nWe located ourselves at the Jungfrau Hotel, one of those huge\nestablishments which the needs of modern travel have created in every\nattractive spot on the continent. There was a great gathering at dinner,\nand, as usual, one heard all sorts of languages.\n\nThe table d'h\u00f4te was served by waitresses dressed in the quaint and\ncomely costume of the Swiss peasants. This consists of a simple gros de\nlaine, trimmed with ashes of roses, with overskirt of scare bleu ventre\nsaint gris, cut bias on the off-side, with facings of petit polonaise\nand narrow insertions of p\u00e2te de foie gras backstitched to the mise\nen sce`ne in the form of a jeu d'esprit. It gives to the wearer a\nsingularly piquant and alluring aspect.\n\nOne of these waitresses, a woman of forty, had side-whiskers reaching\nhalf-way down her jaws. They were two fingers broad, dark in color,\npretty thick, and the hairs were an inch long. One sees many women on\nthe continent with quite conspicuous mustaches, but this was the only\nwoman I saw who had reached the dignity of whiskers.\n\nAfter dinner the guests of both sexes distributed themselves about the\nfront porches and the ornamental grounds belonging to the hotel, to\nenjoy the cool air; but, as the twilight deepened toward darkness, they\ngathered themselves together in that saddest and solemnest and most\nconstrained of all places, the great blank drawing-room which is the\nchief feature of all continental summer hotels. There they grouped\nthemselves about, in couples and threes, and mumbled in bated voices,\nand looked timid and homeless and forlorn.\n\nThere was a small piano in this room, a clattery, wheezy, asthmatic\nthing, certainly the very worst miscarriage in the way of a piano that\nthe world has seen. In turn, five or six dejected and homesick ladies\napproached it doubtingly, gave it a single inquiring thump, and\nretired with the lockjaw. But the boss of that instrument was to come,\nnevertheless; and from my own country--from Arkansaw.\n\nShe was a brand-new bride, innocent, girlish, happy in herself and her\ngrave and worshiping stripling of a husband; she was about eighteen,\njust out of school, free from affectations, unconscious of that\npassionless multitude around her; and the very first time she smote\nthat old wreck one recognized that it had met its destiny. Her stripling\nbrought an armful of aged sheet-music from their room--for this bride\nwent \"heeled,\" as you might say--and bent himself lovingly over and got\nready to turn the pages.\n\n\n\nThe bride fetched a swoop with her fingers from one end of the keyboard\nto the other, just to get her bearings, as it were, and you could see\nthe congregation set their teeth with the agony of it. Then, without\nany more preliminaries, she turned on all the horrors of the \"Battle of\nPrague,\" that venerable shivaree, and waded chin-deep in the blood of\nthe slain. She made a fair and honorable average of two false notes in\nevery five, but her soul was in arms and she never stopped to correct.\nThe audience stood it with pretty fair grit for a while, but when the\ncannonade waxed hotter and fiercer, and the discord average rose to\nfour in five, the procession began to move. A few stragglers held their\nground ten minutes longer, but when the girl began to wring the true\ninwardness out of the \"cries of the wounded,\" they struck their colors\nand retired in a kind of panic.\n\n\n\nThere never was a completer victory; I was the only non-combatant left\non the field. I would not have deserted my countrywoman anyhow, but\nindeed I had no desires in that direction. None of us like mediocrity,\nbut we all reverence perfection. This girl's music was perfection in its\nway; it was the worst music that had ever been achieved on our planet by\na mere human being.\n\nI moved up close, and never lost a strain. When she got through, I\nasked her to play it again. She did it with a pleased alacrity and a\nheightened enthusiasm. She made it ALL discords, this time. She got an\namount of anguish into the cries of the wounded that shed a new light on\nhuman suffering. She was on the war-path all the evening. All the time,\ncrowds of people gathered on the porches and pressed their noses against\nthe windows to look and marvel, but the bravest never ventured in.\nThe bride went off satisfied and happy with her young fellow, when her\nappetite was finally gorged, and the tourists swarmed in again.\n\n\n\nWhat a change has come over Switzerland, and in fact all Europe, during\nthis century! Seventy or eighty years ago Napoleon was the only man in\nEurope who could really be called a traveler; he was the only man who\nhad devoted his attention to it and taken a powerful interest in it; he\nwas the only man who had traveled extensively; but now everybody goes\neverywhere; and Switzerland, and many other regions which were unvisited\nand unknown remotenesses a hundred years ago, are in our days a buzzing\nhive of restless strangers every summer. But I digress.\n\nIn the morning, when we looked out of our windows, we saw a wonderful\nsight. Across the valley, and apparently quite neighborly and close at\nhand, the giant form of the Jungfrau rose cold and white into the clear\nsky, beyond a gateway in the nearer highlands. It reminded me, somehow,\nof one of those colossal billows which swells suddenly up beside one's\nship, at sea, sometimes, with its crest and shoulders snowy white, and\nthe rest of its noble proportions streaked downward with creamy foam.\n\nI took out my sketch-book and made a little picture of the Jungfrau,\nmerely to get the shape.\n\nI do not regard this as one of my finished works, in fact I do not rank\nit among my Works at all; it is only a study; it is hardly more than\nwhat one might call a sketch. Other artists have done me the grace to\nadmire it; but I am severe in my judgments of my own pictures, and this\none does not move me.\n\n\n\nIt was hard to believe that that lofty wooded rampart on the left which\nso overtops the Jungfrau was not actually the higher of the two, but it\nwas not, of course. It is only two or three thousand feet high, and of\ncourse has no snow upon it in summer, whereas the Jungfrau is not much\nshorter of fourteen thousand feet high and therefore that lowest verge\nof snow on her side, which seems nearly down to the valley level, is\nreally about seven thousand feet higher up in the air than the summit\nof that wooded rampart. It is the distance that makes the deception.\nThe wooded height is but four or five miles removed from us, but the\nJungfrau is four or five times that distance away.\n\n\n\nWalking down the street of shops, in the fore-noon, I was attracted by\na large picture, carved, frame and all, from a single block of\nchocolate-colored wood. There are people who know everything. Some of\nthese had told us that continental shopkeepers always raise their prices\non English and Americans. Many people had told us it was expensive to\nbuy things through a courier, whereas I had supposed it was just the\nreverse. When I saw this picture, I conjectured that it was worth more\nthan the friend I proposed to buy it for would like to pay, but still it\nwas worth while to inquire; so I told the courier to step in and ask\nthe price, as if he wanted it for himself; I told him not to speak in\nEnglish, and above all not to reveal the fact that he was a courier.\nThen I moved on a few yards, and waited.\n\nThe courier came presently and reported the price. I said to myself, \"It\nis a hundred francs too much,\" and so dismissed the matter from my\nmind. But in the afternoon I was passing that place with Harris, and the\npicture attracted me again. We stepped in, to see how much higher\nbroken German would raise the price. The shopwoman named a figure just\na hundred francs lower than the courier had named. This was a pleasant\nsurprise. I said I would take it. After I had given directions as to\nwhere it was to be shipped, the shopwoman said, appealingly:\n\n\"If you please, do not let your courier know you bought it.\"\n\nThis was an unexpected remark. I said:\n\n\"What makes you think I have a courier?\"\n\n\"Ah, that is very simple; he told me himself.\"\n\n\"He was very thoughtful. But tell me--why did you charge him more than\nyou are charging me?\"\n\n\"That is very simple, also: I do not have to pay you a percentage.\"\n\n\"Oh, I begin to see. You would have had to pay the courier a\npercentage.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly. The courier always has his percentage. In this case it\nwould have been a hundred francs.\"\n\n\"Then the tradesman does not pay a part of it--the purchaser pays all of\nit?\"\n\n\"There are occasions when the tradesman and the courier agree upon a\nprice which is twice or thrice the value of the article, then the two\ndivide, and both get a percentage.\"\n\n\"I see. But it seems to me that the purchaser does all the paying, even\nthen.\"\n\n\"Oh, to be sure! It goes without saying.\"\n\n\"But I have bought this picture myself; therefore why shouldn't the\ncourier know it?\"\n\nThe woman exclaimed, in distress:\n\n\"Ah, indeed it would take all my little profit! He would come and demand\nhis hundred francs, and I should have to pay.\"\n\n\"He has not done the buying. You could refuse.\"\n\n\"I could not dare to refuse. He would never bring travelers here again.\nMore than that, he would denounce me to the other couriers, they would\ndivert custom from me, and my business would be injured.\"\n\nI went away in a thoughtful frame of mind. I began to see why a courier\ncould afford to work for fifty-five dollars a month and his fares. A\nmonth or two later I was able to understand why a courier did not have\nto pay any board and lodging, and why my hotel bills were always larger\nwhen I had him with me than when I left him behind, somewhere, for a few\ndays.\n\nAnother thing was also explained, now, apparently. In one town I had\ntaken the courier to the bank to do the translating when I drew some\nmoney. I had sat in the reading-room till the transaction was finished.\nThen a clerk had brought the money to me in person, and had been\nexceedingly polite, even going so far as to precede me to the door and\nholding it open for me and bow me out as if I had been a distinguished\npersonage. It was a new experience. Exchange had been in my favor ever\nsince I had been in Europe, but just that one time. I got simply the\nface of my draft, and no extra francs, whereas I had expected to get\nquite a number of them. This was the first time I had ever used the\ncourier at the bank. I had suspected something then, and as long as he\nremained with me afterward I managed bank matters by myself.\n\nStill, if I felt that I could afford the tax, I would never travel\nwithout a courier, for a good courier is a convenience whose value\ncannot be estimated in dollars and cents. Without him, travel is a\nbitter harassment, a purgatory of little exasperating annoyances, a\nceaseless and pitiless punishment--I mean to an irascible man who has no\nbusiness capacity and is confused by details.\n\n\n\nWithout a courier, travel hasn't a ray of pleasure in it, anywhere; but\nwith him it is a continuous and unruffled delight. He is always at hand,\nnever has to be sent for; if your bell is not answered promptly--and it\nseldom is--you have only to open the door and speak, the courier will\nhear, and he will have the order attended to or raise an insurrection.\nYou tell him what day you will start, and whither you are going--leave\nall the rest to him. You need not inquire about trains, or fares, or car\nchanges, or hotels, or anything else. At the proper time he will put you\nin a cab or an omnibus, and drive you to the train or the boat; he has\npacked your luggage and transferred it, he has paid all the bills. Other\npeople have preceded you half an hour to scramble for impossible places\nand lose their tempers, but you can take your time; the courier has\nsecured your seats for you, and you can occupy them at your leisure.\n\nAt the station, the crowd mash one another to pulp in the effort to get\nthe weigher's attention to their trunks; they dispute hotly with these\ntyrants, who are cool and indifferent; they get their baggage billets,\nat last, and then have another squeeze and another rage over the\ndisheartening business of trying to get them recorded and paid for, and\nstill another over the equally disheartening business of trying to get\nnear enough to the ticket office to buy a ticket; and now, with their\ntempers gone to the dogs, they must stand penned up and packed together,\nladen with wraps and satchels and shawl-straps, with the weary wife and\nbabies, in the waiting-room, till the doors are thrown open--and then\nall hands make a grand final rush to the train, find it full, and have\nto stand on the platform and fret until some more cars are put on. They\nare in a condition to kill somebody by this time. Meantime, you have\nbeen sitting in your car, smoking, and observing all this misery in the\nextremest comfort.\n\n\n\nOn the journey the guard is polite and watchful--won't allow anybody to\nget into your compartment--tells them you are just recovering from the\nsmall-pox and do not like to be disturbed. For the courier has made\neverything right with the guard. At way-stations the courier comes to\nyour compartment to see if you want a glass of water, or a newspaper,\nor anything; at eating-stations he sends luncheon out to you, while the\nother people scramble and worry in the dining-rooms. If anything breaks\nabout the car you are in, and a station-master proposes to pack you and\nyour agent into a compartment with strangers, the courier reveals to him\nconfidentially that you are a French duke born deaf and dumb, and the\nofficial comes and makes affable signs that he has ordered a choice car\nto be added to the train for you.\n\nAt custom-houses the multitude file tediously through, hot and\nirritated, and look on while the officers burrow into the trunks and\nmake a mess of everything; but you hand your keys to the courier and sit\nstill. Perhaps you arrive at your destination in a rain-storm at ten\nat night--you generally do. The multitude spend half an hour verifying\ntheir baggage and getting it transferred to the omnibuses; but the\ncourier puts you into a vehicle without a moment's loss of time, and\nwhen you reach your hotel you find your rooms have been secured two or\nthree days in advance, everything is ready, you can go at once to bed.\nSome of those other people will have to drift around to two or three\nhotels, in the rain, before they find accommodations.\n\nI have not set down half of the virtues that are vested in a good\ncourier, but I think I have set down a sufficiency of them to show that\nan irritable man who can afford one and does not employ him is not a\nwise economist. My courier was the worst one in Europe, yet he was a\ngood deal better than none at all. It could not pay him to be a better\none than he was, because I could not afford to buy things through him.\nHe was a good enough courier for the small amount he got out of his\nservice. Yes, to travel with a courier is bliss, to travel without one\nis the reverse.\n\nI have had dealings with some very bad couriers; but I have also had\ndealings with one who might fairly be called perfection. He was a young\nPolander, named Joseph N. Verey. He spoke eight languages, and seemed\nto be equally at home in all of them; he was shrewd, prompt, posted,\nand punctual; he was fertile in resources, and singularly gifted in the\nmatter of overcoming difficulties; he not only knew how to do everything\nin his line, but he knew the best ways and the quickest; he was handy\nwith children and invalids; all his employer needed to do was to take\nlife easy and leave everything to the courier. His address is, care of\nMessrs. Gay & Son, Strand, London; he was formerly a conductor of Gay's\ntourist parties. Excellent couriers are somewhat rare; if the reader is\nabout to travel, he will find it to his advantage to make a note of this\none.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n[We Climb Far--by Buggy]\n\n\nThe beautiful Giesbach Fall is near Interlaken, on the other side of\nthe lake of Brienz, and is illuminated every night with those gorgeous\ntheatrical fires whose name I cannot call just at this moment. This was\nsaid to be a spectacle which the tourist ought by no means to miss. I\nwas strongly tempted, but I could not go there with propriety, because\none goes in a boat. The task which I had set myself was to walk over\nEurope on foot, not skim over it in a boat. I had made a tacit contract\nwith myself; it was my duty to abide by it. I was willing to make boat\ntrips for pleasure, but I could not conscientiously make them in the way\nof business.\n\nIt cost me something of a pang to lose that fine sight, but I lived down\nthe desire, and gained in my self-respect through the triumph. I had\na finer and a grander sight, however, where I was. This was the mighty\ndome of the Jungfrau softly outlined against the sky and faintly\nsilvered by the starlight. There was something subduing in the influence\nof that silent and solemn and awful presence; one seemed to meet the\nimmutable, the indestructible, the eternal, face to face, and to feel\nthe trivial and fleeting nature of his own existence the more sharply\nby the contrast. One had the sense of being under the brooding\ncontemplation of a spirit, not an inert mass of rocks and ice--a spirit\nwhich had looked down, through the slow drift of the ages, upon a\nmillion vanished races of men, and judged them; and would judge a\nmillion more--and still be there, watching, unchanged and unchangeable,\nafter all life should be gone and the earth have become a vacant\ndesolation.\n\nWhile I was feeling these things, I was groping, without knowing it,\ntoward an understanding of what the spell is which people find in the\nAlps, and in no other mountains--that strange, deep, nameless influence,\nwhich, once felt, cannot be forgotten--once felt, leaves always\nbehind it a restless longing to feel it again--a longing which is like\nhomesickness; a grieving, haunting yearning which will plead, implore,\nand persecute till it has its will. I met dozens of people, imaginative\nand unimaginative, cultivated and uncultivated, who had come from far\ncountries and roamed through the Swiss Alps year after year--they could\nnot explain why. They had come first, they said, out of idle curiosity,\nbecause everybody talked about it; they had come since because they\ncould not help it, and they should keep on coming, while they lived, for\nthe same reason; they had tried to break their chains and stay away, but\nit was futile; now, they had no desire to break them. Others came nearer\nformulating what they felt; they said they could find perfect rest and\npeace nowhere else when they were troubled: all frets and worries and\nchafings sank to sleep in the presence of the benignant serenity of the\nAlps; the Great Spirit of the Mountain breathed his own peace upon their\nhurt minds and sore hearts, and healed them; they could not think base\nthoughts or do mean and sordid things here, before the visible throne of\nGod.\n\nDown the road a piece was a Kursaal--whatever that may be--and we joined\nthe human tide to see what sort of enjoyment it might afford. It was the\nusual open-air concert, in an ornamental garden, with wines, beer, milk,\nwhey, grapes, etc.--the whey and the grapes being necessaries of life to\ncertain invalids whom physicians cannot repair, and who only continue to\nexist by the grace of whey or grapes. One of these departed spirits told\nme, in a sad and lifeless way, that there is no way for him to live but\nby whey, and dearly, dearly loved whey, he didn't know whey he did, but\nhe did. After making this pun he died--that is the whey it served him.\n\n\n\nSome other remains, preserved from decomposition by the grape system,\ntold me that the grapes were of a peculiar breed, highly medicinal in\ntheir nature, and that they were counted out and administered by the\ngrape-doctors as methodically as if they were pills. The new patient,\nif very feeble, began with one grape before breakfast, took three\nduring breakfast, a couple between meals, five at luncheon, three in the\nafternoon, seven at dinner, four for supper, and part of a grape just\nbefore going to bed, by way of a general regulator. The quantity was\ngradually and regularly increased, according to the needs and capacities\nof the patient, until by and by you would find him disposing of his one\ngrape per second all the day long, and his regular barrel per day.\n\nHe said that men cured in this way, and enabled to discard the grape\nsystem, never afterward got over the habit of talking as if they were\ndictating to a slow amanuensis, because they always made a pause between\neach two words while they sucked the substance out of an imaginary\ngrape. He said these were tedious people to talk with. He said that men\nwho had been cured by the other process were easily distinguished from\nthe rest of mankind because they always tilted their heads back, between\nevery two words, and swallowed a swig of imaginary whey. He said it was\nan impressive thing to observe two men, who had been cured by the two\nprocesses, engaged in conversation--said their pauses and accompanying\nmovements were so continuous and regular that a stranger would think\nhimself in the presence of a couple of automatic machines. One finds\nout a great many wonderful things, by traveling, if he stumbles upon the\nright person.\n\nI did not remain long at the Kursaal; the music was good enough, but it\nseemed rather tame after the cyclone of that Arkansaw expert. Besides,\nmy adventurous spirit had conceived a formidable enterprise--nothing\nless than a trip from Interlaken, by the Gemmi and Visp, clear to\nZermatt, on foot! So it was necessary to plan the details, and get ready\nfor an early start. The courier (this was not the one I have just been\nspeaking of) thought that the portier of the hotel would be able to tell\nus how to find our way. And so it turned out. He showed us the whole\nthing, on a relief-map, and we could see our route, with all its\nelevations and depressions, its villages and its rivers, as clearly as\nif we were sailing over it in a balloon. A relief-map is a great thing.\nThe portier also wrote down each day's journey and the nightly hotel on\na piece of paper, and made our course so plain that we should never be\nable to get lost without high-priced outside help.\n\nI put the courier in the care of a gentleman who was going to Lausanne,\nand then we went to bed, after laying out the walking-costumes and\nputting them into condition for instant occupation in the morning.\n\nHowever, when we came down to breakfast at 8 A.M., it looked so much\nlike rain that I hired a two-horse top-buggy for the first third of the\njourney. For two or three hours we jogged along the level road which\nskirts the beautiful lake of Thun, with a dim and dreamlike picture of\nwatery expanses and spectral Alpine forms always before us, veiled in\na mellowing mist. Then a steady downpour set in, and hid everything but\nthe nearest objects. We kept the rain out of our faces with umbrellas,\nand away from our bodies with the leather apron of the buggy; but the\ndriver sat unsheltered and placidly soaked the weather in and seemed\nto like it. We had the road to ourselves, and I never had a pleasanter\nexcursion.\n\nThe weather began to clear while we were driving up a valley called the\nKienthal, and presently a vast black cloud-bank in front of us dissolved\naway and uncurtained the grand proportions and the soaring loftiness of\nthe Blumis Alp. It was a sort of breath-taking surprise; for we had not\nsupposed there was anything behind that low-hung blanket of sable cloud\nbut level valley. What we had been mistaking for fleeting glimpses of\nsky away aloft there, were really patches of the Blumis's snowy crest\ncaught through shredded rents in the drifting pall of vapor.\n\nWe dined in the inn at Frutigen, and our driver ought to have dined\nthere, too, but he would not have had time to dine and get drunk\nboth, so he gave his mind to making a masterpiece of the latter, and\nsucceeded. A German gentleman and his two young-lady daughters had been\ntaking their nooning at the inn, and when they left, just ahead of us,\nit was plain that their driver was as drunk as ours, and as happy\nand good-natured, too, which was saying a good deal. These rascals\noverflowed with attentions and information for their guests, and with\nbrotherly love for each other. They tied their reins, and took off\ntheir coats and hats, so that they might be able to give unencumbered\nattention to conversation and to the gestures necessary for its\nillustration.\n\n\n\nThe road was smooth; it led up and over and down a continual succession\nof hills; but it was narrow, the horses were used to it, and could\nnot well get out of it anyhow; so why shouldn't the drivers entertain\nthemselves and us? The noses of our horses projected sociably into the\nrear of the forward carriage, and as we toiled up the long hills our\ndriver stood up and talked to his friend, and his friend stood up and\ntalked back to him, with his rear to the scenery. When the top was\nreached and we went flying down the other side, there was no change\nin the program. I carry in my memory yet the picture of that forward\ndriver, on his knees on his high seat, resting his elbows on its back,\nand beaming down on his passengers, with happy eye, and flying hair, and\njolly red face, and offering his card to the old German gentleman while\nhe praised his hack and horses, and both teams were whizzing down a\nlong hill with nobody in a position to tell whether we were bound to\ndestruction or an undeserved safety.\n\nToward sunset we entered a beautiful green valley dotted with chalets, a\ncozy little domain hidden away from the busy world in a cloistered nook\namong giant precipices topped with snowy peaks that seemed to float like\nislands above the curling surf of the sea of vapor that severed them\nfrom the lower world. Down from vague and vaporous heights, little\nruffled zigzag milky currents came crawling, and found their way to the\nverge of one of those tremendous overhanging walls, whence they plunged,\na shaft of silver, shivered to atoms in mid-descent and turned to an air\npuff of luminous dust. Here and there, in grooved depressions among the\nsnowy desolations of the upper altitudes, one glimpsed the extremity of\na glacier, with its sea-green and honeycombed battlements of ice.\n\n\n\nUp the valley, under a dizzy precipice, nestled the village of\nKandersteg, our halting-place for the night. We were soon there, and\nhoused in the hotel. But the waning day had such an inviting influence\nthat we did not remain housed many moments, but struck out and followed\na roaring torrent of ice-water up to its far source in a sort of little\ngrass-carpeted parlor, walled in all around by vast precipices and\noverlooked by clustering summits of ice. This was the snuggest little\ncroquet-ground imaginable; it was perfectly level, and not more than a\nmile long by half a mile wide. The walls around it were so gigantic, and\neverything about it was on so mighty a scale that it was belittled, by\ncontrast, to what I have likened it to--a cozy and carpeted parlor. It\nwas so high above the Kandersteg valley that there was nothing between\nit and the snowy-peaks. I had never been in such intimate relations with\nthe high altitudes before; the snow-peaks had always been remote and\nunapproachable grandeurs, hitherto, but now we were hob-a-nob--if one\nmay use such a seemingly irreverent expression about creations so august\nas these.\n\nWe could see the streams which fed the torrent we had followed issuing\nfrom under the greenish ramparts of glaciers; but two or three of these,\ninstead of flowing over the precipices, sank down into the rock and\nsprang in big jets out of holes in the mid-face of the walls.\n\n\n\nThe green nook which I have been describing is called the Gasternthal.\nThe glacier streams gather and flow through it in a broad and rushing\nbrook to a narrow cleft between lofty precipices; here the rushing\nbrook becomes a mad torrent and goes booming and thundering down\ntoward Kandersteg, lashing and thrashing its way over and among monster\nboulders, and hurling chance roots and logs about like straws. There\nwas no lack of cascades along this route. The path by the side of\nthe torrent was so narrow that one had to look sharp, when he heard a\ncow-bell, and hunt for a place that was wide enough to accommodate a cow\nand a Christian side by side, and such places were not always to be had\nat an instant's notice. The cows wear church-bells, and that is a\ngood idea in the cows, for where that torrent is, you couldn't hear\nan ordinary cow-bell any further than you could hear the ticking of a\nwatch.\n\nI needed exercise, so I employed my agent in setting stranded logs and\ndead trees adrift, and I sat on a boulder and watched them go whirling\nand leaping head over heels down the boiling torrent. It was a\nwonderfully exhilarating spectacle. When I had had enough exercise, I\nmade the agent take some, by running a race with one of those logs. I\nmade a trifle by betting on the log.\n\n\n\nAfter dinner we had a walk up and down the Kandersteg valley, in the\nsoft gloaming, with the spectacle of the dying lights of day playing\nabout the crests and pinnacles of the still and solemn upper realm\nfor contrast, and text for talk. There were no sounds but the dulled\ncomplaining of the torrent and the occasional tinkling of a distant\nbell. The spirit of the place was a sense of deep, pervading peace; one\nmight dream his life tranquilly away there, and not miss it or mind it\nwhen it was gone.\n\nThe summer departed with the sun, and winter came with the stars. It\ngrew to be a bitter night in that little hotel, backed up against a\nprecipice that had no visible top to it, but we kept warm, and woke in\ntime in the morning to find that everybody else had left for Gemmi\nthree hours before--so our little plan of helping that German family\n(principally the old man) over the pass, was a blocked generosity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n[The World's Highest Pig Farm]\n\n\nWe hired the only guide left, to lead us on our way. He was over\nseventy, but he could have given me nine-tenths of his strength and\nstill had all his age entitled him to. He shouldered our satchels,\novercoats, and alpenstocks, and we set out up the steep path. It was hot\nwork. The old man soon begged us to hand over our coats and waistcoats\nto him to carry, too, and we did it; one could not refuse so little a\nthing to a poor old man like that; he should have had them if he had\nbeen a hundred and fifty.\n\nWhen we began that ascent, we could see a microscopic chalet perched\naway up against heaven on what seemed to be the highest mountain near\nus. It was on our right, across the narrow head of the valley. But when\nwe got up abreast it on its own level, mountains were towering high\nabove on every hand, and we saw that its altitude was just about that of\nthe little Gasternthal which we had visited the evening before. Still it\nseemed a long way up in the air, in that waste and lonely wilderness of\nrocks. It had an unfenced grass-plot in front of it which seemed about\nas big as a billiard-table, and this grass-plot slanted so sharply\ndownward, and was so brief, and ended so exceedingly soon at the verge\nof the absolute precipice, that it was a shuddery thing to think of a\nperson's venturing to trust his foot on an incline so situated at all.\nSuppose a man stepped on an orange peel in that yard; there would be\nnothing for him to seize; nothing could keep him from rolling; five\nrevolutions would bring him to the edge, and over he would go.\n\n\n\nWhat a frightful distance he would fall!--for there are very few birds\nthat fly as high as his starting-point. He would strike and bounce, two\nor three times, on his way down, but this would be no advantage to him.\nI would as soon take an airing on the slant of a rainbow as in such\na front yard. I would rather, in fact, for the distance down would be\nabout the same, and it is pleasanter to slide than to bounce. I could\nnot see how the peasants got up to that chalet--the region seemed too\nsteep for anything but a balloon.\n\nAs we strolled on, climbing up higher and higher, we were continually\nbringing neighboring peaks into view and lofty prominence which had been\nhidden behind lower peaks before; so by and by, while standing before a\ngroup of these giants, we looked around for the chalet again; there it\nwas, away down below us, apparently on an inconspicuous ridge in the\nvalley! It was as far below us, now, as it had been above us when we\nwere beginning the ascent.\n\nAfter a while the path led us along a railed precipice, and we looked\nover--far beneath us was the snug parlor again, the little Gasternthal,\nwith its water jets spouting from the face of its rock walls. We could\nhave dropped a stone into it. We had been finding the top of the world\nall along--and always finding a still higher top stealing into view in\na disappointing way just ahead; when we looked down into the Gasternthal\nwe felt pretty sure that we had reached the genuine top at last, but it\nwas not so; there were much higher altitudes to be scaled yet. We were\nstill in the pleasant shade of forest trees, we were still in a region\nwhich was cushioned with beautiful mosses and aglow with the many-tinted\nluster of innumerable wild flowers.\n\nWe found, indeed, more interest in the wild flowers than in anything\nelse. We gathered a specimen or two of every kind which we were\nunacquainted with; so we had sumptuous bouquets. But one of the chief\ninterests lay in chasing the seasons of the year up the mountain, and\ndetermining them by the presence of flowers and berries which we were\nacquainted with. For instance, it was the end of August at the level\nof the sea; in the Kandersteg valley at the base of the pass, we found\nflowers which would not be due at the sea-level for two or three weeks;\nhigher up, we entered October, and gathered fringed gentians. I made\nno notes, and have forgotten the details, but the construction of the\nfloral calendar was very entertaining while it lasted.\n\n\n\nIn the high regions we found rich store of the splendid red flower\ncalled the Alpine rose, but we did not find any examples of the ugly\nSwiss favorite called Edelweiss. Its name seems to indicate that it is a\nnoble flower and that it is white. It may be noble enough, but it is not\nattractive, and it is not white. The fuzzy blossom is the color of bad\ncigar ashes, and appears to be made of a cheap quality of gray plush. It\nhas a noble and distant way of confining itself to the high altitudes,\nbut that is probably on account of its looks; it apparently has no\nmonopoly of those upper altitudes, however, for they are sometimes\nintruded upon by some of the loveliest of the valley families of wild\nflowers. Everybody in the Alps wears a sprig of Edelweiss in his hat. It\nis the native's pet, and also the tourist's.\n\nAll the morning, as we loafed along, having a good time, other\npedestrians went staving by us with vigorous strides, and with the\nintent and determined look of men who were walking for a wager. These\nwore loose knee-breeches, long yarn stockings, and hobnailed high-laced\nwalking-shoes. They were gentlemen who would go home to England or\nGermany and tell how many miles they had beaten the guide-book every\nday. But I doubted if they ever had much real fun, outside of the mere\nmagnificent exhilaration of the tramp through the green valleys and the\nbreezy heights; for they were almost always alone, and even the finest\nscenery loses incalculably when there is no one to enjoy it with.\n\nAll the morning an endless double procession of mule-mounted tourists\nfiled past us along the narrow path--the one procession going, the\nother coming. We had taken a good deal of trouble to teach ourselves the\nkindly German custom of saluting all strangers with doffed hat, and we\nresolutely clung to it, that morning, although it kept us bareheaded\nmost of the time and was not always responded to. Still we found an\ninterest in the thing, because we naturally liked to know who were\nEnglish and Americans among the passers-by. All continental natives\nresponded of course; so did some of the English and Americans, but, as\na general thing, these two races gave no sign. Whenever a man or a woman\nshowed us cold neglect, we spoke up confidently in our own tongue and\nasked for such information as we happened to need, and we always got a\nreply in the same language. The English and American folk are not less\nkindly than other races, they are only more reserved, and that comes of\nhabit and education. In one dreary, rocky waste, away above the line of\nvegetation, we met a procession of twenty-five mounted young men, all\nfrom America. We got answering bows enough from these, of course, for\nthey were of an age to learn to do in Rome as Rome does, without much\neffort.\n\nAt one extremity of this patch of desolation, overhung by bare and\nforbidding crags which husbanded drifts of everlasting snow in their\nshaded cavities, was a small stretch of thin and discouraged grass, and\na man and a family of pigs were actually living here in some shanties.\nConsequently this place could be really reckoned as \"property\"; it had\na money value, and was doubtless taxed. I think it must have marked\nthe limit of real estate in this world. It would be hard to set a money\nvalue upon any piece of earth that lies between that spot and the empty\nrealm of space. That man may claim the distinction of owning the end\nof the world, for if there is any definite end to the world he has\ncertainly found it.\n\n\n\nFrom here forward we moved through a storm-swept and smileless\ndesolation. All about us rose gigantic masses, crags, and ramparts of\nbare and dreary rock, with not a vestige or semblance of plant or tree\nor flower anywhere, or glimpse of any creature that had life. The frost\nand the tempests of unnumbered ages had battered and hacked at these\ncliffs, with a deathless energy, destroying them piecemeal; so all the\nregion about their bases was a tumbled chaos of great fragments which\nhad been split off and hurled to the ground. Soiled and aged banks of\nsnow lay close about our path. The ghastly desolation of the place was\nas tremendously complete as if Dor\u00e9 had furnished the working-plans\nfor it. But every now and then, through the stern gateways around us\nwe caught a view of some neighboring majestic dome, sheathed with\nglittering ice, and displaying its white purity at an elevation compared\nto which ours was groveling and plebeian, and this spectacle always\nchained one's interest and admiration at once, and made him forget there\nwas anything ugly in the world.\n\nI have just said that there was nothing but death and desolation in\nthese hideous places, but I forgot. In the most forlorn and arid and\ndismal one of all, where the racked and splintered debris was thickest,\nwhere the ancient patches of snow lay against the very path, where\nthe winds blew bitterest and the general aspect was mournfulest and\ndreariest, and furthest from any suggestion of cheer or hope, I found\na solitary wee forget-me-not flourishing away, not a droop about it\nanywhere, but holding its bright blue star up with the prettiest and\ngallantest air in the world, the only happy spirit, the only smiling\nthing, in all that grisly desert. She seemed to say, \"Cheer up!--as long\nas we are here, let us make the best of it.\" I judged she had earned a\nright to a more hospitable place; so I plucked her up and sent her to\nAmerica to a friend who would respect her for the fight she had made,\nall by her small self, to make a whole vast despondent Alpine desolation\nstop breaking its heart over the unalterable, and hold up its head and\nlook at the bright side of things for once.\n\n\n\nWe stopped for a nooning at a strongly built little inn called the\nSchwarenbach. It sits in a lonely spot among the peaks, where it is\nswept by the trailing fringes of the cloud-rack, and is rained on, and\nsnowed on, and pelted and persecuted by the storms, nearly every day of\nits life. It was the only habitation in the whole Gemmi Pass.\n\nClose at hand, now, was a chance for a blood-curdling Alpine adventure.\nClose at hand was the snowy mass of the Great Altels cooling its topknot\nin the sky and daring us to an ascent. I was fired with the idea, and\nimmediately made up my mind to procure the necessary guides, ropes,\netc., and undertake it. I instructed Harris to go to the landlord of the\ninn and set him about our preparations. Meantime, I went diligently to\nwork to read up and find out what this much-talked-of mountain-climbing\nwas like, and how one should go about it--for in these matters I\nwas ignorant. I opened Mr. Hinchliff's SUMMER MONTHS AMONG THE ALPS\n(published 1857), and selected his account of his ascent of Monte Rosa.\n\nIt began:\n\n\"It is very difficult to free the mind from excitement on the evening\nbefore a grand expedition--\"\n\nI saw that I was too calm; so I walked the room a while and worked\nmyself into a high excitement; but the book's next remark --that the\nadventurer must get up at two in the morning--came as near as anything\nto flatting it all out again. However, I reinforced it, and read on,\nabout how Mr. Hinchliff dressed by candle-light and was \"soon down among\nthe guides, who were bustling about in the passage, packing provisions,\nand making every preparation for the start\"; and how he glanced out into\nthe cold clear night and saw that--\n\n\n\n\"The whole sky was blazing with stars, larger and brighter than they\nappear through the dense atmosphere breathed by inhabitants of the lower\nparts of the earth. They seemed actually suspended from the dark vault\nof heaven, and their gentle light shed a fairylike gleam over the\nsnow-fields around the foot of the Matterhorn, which raised its\nstupendous pinnacle on high, penetrating to the heart of the Great Bear,\nand crowning itself with a diadem of his magnificent stars. Not a sound\ndisturbed the deep tranquillity of the night, except the distant roar\nof streams which rush from the high plateau of the St. Theodule glacier,\nand fall headlong over precipitous rocks till they lose themselves in\nthe mazes of the Gorner glacier.\"\n\nHe took his hot toast and coffee, and then about half past three his\ncaravan of ten men filed away from the Riffel Hotel, and began the steep\nclimb. At half past five he happened to turn around, and \"beheld the\nglorious spectacle of the Matterhorn, just touched by the rosy-fingered\nmorning, and looking like a huge pyramid of fire rising out of the\nbarren ocean of ice and rock around it.\" Then the Breithorn and the Dent\nBlanche caught the radiant glow; but \"the intervening mass of Monte Rosa\nmade it necessary for us to climb many long hours before we could hope\nto see the sun himself, yet the whole air soon grew warmer after the\nsplendid birth of the day.\"\n\nHe gazed at the lofty crown of Monte Rosa and the wastes of snow that\nguarded its steep approaches, and the chief guide delivered the opinion\nthat no man could conquer their awful heights and put his foot upon that\nsummit. But the adventurers moved steadily on, nevertheless.\n\nThey toiled up, and up, and still up; they passed the Grand Plateau;\nthen toiled up a steep shoulder of the mountain, clinging like flies to\nits rugged face; and now they were confronted by a tremendous wall\nfrom which great blocks of ice and snow were evidently in the habit of\nfalling. They turned aside to skirt this wall, and gradually ascended\nuntil their way was barred by a \"maze of gigantic snow crevices,\"--so\nthey turned aside again, and \"began a long climb of sufficient steepness\nto make a zigzag course necessary.\"\n\n\n\nFatigue compelled them to halt frequently, for a moment or two. At one\nof these halts somebody called out, \"Look at Mont Blanc!\" and \"we were\nat once made aware of the very great height we had attained by actually\nseeing the monarch of the Alps and his attendant satellites right over\nthe top of the Breithorn, itself at least 14,000 feet high!\"\n\nThese people moved in single file, and were all tied to a strong rope,\nat regular distances apart, so that if one of them slipped on those\ngiddy heights, the others could brace themselves on their alpenstocks\nand save him from darting into the valley, thousands of feet below. By\nand by they came to an ice-coated ridge which was tilted up at a sharp\nangle, and had a precipice on one side of it. They had to climb this, so\nthe guide in the lead cut steps in the ice with his hatchet, and as fast\nas he took his toes out of one of these slight holes, the toes of the\nman behind him occupied it.\n\n\n\n\"Slowly and steadily we kept on our way over this dangerous part of the\nascent, and I dare say it was fortunate for some of us that attention\nwas distracted from the head by the paramount necessity of looking after\nthe feet; FOR, WHILE ON THE LEFT THE INCLINE OF ICE WAS SO STEEP THAT\nIT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY MAN TO SAVE HIMSELF IN CASE OF A SLIP,\nUNLESS THE OTHERS COULD HOLD HIM UP, ON THE RIGHT WE MIGHT DROP A PEBBLE\nFROM THE HAND OVER PRECIPICES OF UNKNOWN EXTENT DOWN UPON THE TREMENDOUS\nGLACIER BELOW.\n\n\"Great caution, therefore, was absolutely necessary, and in this exposed\nsituation we were attacked by all the fury of that grand enemy of\naspirants to Monte Rosa--a severe and bitterly cold wind from the north.\nThe fine powdery snow was driven past us in the clouds, penetrating the\ninterstices of our clothes, and the pieces of ice which flew from the\nblows of Peter's ax were whisked into the air, and then dashed over the\nprecipice. We had quite enough to do to prevent ourselves from being\nserved in the same ruthless fashion, and now and then, in the more\nviolent gusts of wind, were glad to stick our alpenstocks into the ice\nand hold on hard.\"\n\nHaving surmounted this perilous steep, they sat down and took a brief\nrest with their backs against a sheltering rock and their heels dangling\nover a bottomless abyss; then they climbed to the base of another\nridge--a more difficult and dangerous one still:\n\n\"The whole of the ridge was exceedingly narrow, and the fall on each\nside desperately steep, but the ice in some of these intervals between\nthe masses of rock assumed the form of a mere sharp edge, almost like a\nknife; these places, though not more than three or four short paces\nin length, looked uncommonly awkward; but, like the sword leading true\nbelievers to the gates of Paradise, they must needs be passed before\nwe could attain to the summit of our ambition. These were in one or two\nplaces so narrow, that in stepping over them with toes well turned\nout for greater security, ONE END OF THE FOOT PROJECTED OVER THE AWFUL\nPRECIPICE ON THE RIGHT, WHILE THE OTHER WAS ON THE BEGINNING OF THE\nICE SLOPE ON THE LEFT, WHICH WAS SCARCELY LESS STEEP THAN THE ROCKS. On\nthese occasions Peter would take my hand, and each of us stretching as\nfar as we could, he was thus enabled to get a firm footing two paces\nor rather more from me, whence a spring would probably bring him to the\nrock on the other side; then, turning around, he called to me to come,\nand, taking a couple of steps carefully, I was met at the third by his\noutstretched hand ready to clasp mine, and in a moment stood by his\nside. The others followed in much the same fashion. Once my right foot\nslipped on the side toward the precipice, but I threw out my left arm in\na moment so that it caught the icy edge under my armpit as I fell, and\nsupported me considerably; at the same instant I cast my eyes down the\nside on which I had slipped, and contrived to plant my right foot on\na piece of rock as large as a cricket-ball, which chanced to protrude\nthrough the ice, on the very edge of the precipice. Being thus anchored\nfore and aft, as it were, I believe I could easily have recovered\nmyself, even if I had been alone, though it must be confessed the\nsituation would have been an awful one; as it was, however, a jerk from\nPeter settled the matter very soon, and I was on my legs all right in an\ninstant. The rope is an immense help in places of this kind.\"\n\n\n\nNow they arrived at the base of a great knob or dome veneered with ice\nand powdered with snow--the utmost, summit, the last bit of solidity\nbetween them and the hollow vault of heaven. They set to work with their\nhatchets, and were soon creeping, insectlike, up its surface, with their\nheels projecting over the thinnest kind of nothingness, thickened up a\nlittle with a few wandering shreds and films of cloud moving in a lazy\nprocession far below. Presently, one man's toe-hold broke and he fell!\nThere he dangled in mid-air at the end of the rope, like a spider, till\nhis friends above hauled him into place again.\n\nA little bit later, the party stood upon the wee pedestal of the very\nsummit, in a driving wind, and looked out upon the vast green expanses\nof Italy and a shoreless ocean of billowy Alps.\n\nWhen I had read thus far, Harris broke into the room in a noble\nexcitement and said the ropes and the guides were secured, and asked if\nI was ready. I said I believed I wouldn't ascend the Altels this time. I\nsaid Alp-climbing was a different thing from what I had supposed it was,\nand so I judged we had better study its points a little more before we\nwent definitely into it. But I told him to retain the guides and order\nthem to follow us to Zermatt, because I meant to use them there. I said\nI could feel the spirit of adventure beginning to stir in me, and was\nsure that the fell fascination of Alp-climbing would soon be upon me. I\nsaid he could make up his mind to it that we would do a deed before\nwe were a week older which would make the hair of the timid curl with\nfright.\n\nThis made Harris happy, and filled him with ambitious anticipations. He\nwent at once to tell the guides to follow us to Zermatt and bring all\ntheir paraphernalia with them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n[Swindling the Coroner]\n\n\nA great and priceless thing is a new interest! How it takes possession\nof a man! how it clings to him, how it rides him! I strode onward from\nthe Schwarenbach hostelry a changed man, a reorganized personality. I\nwalked into a new world, I saw with new eyes. I had been looking\naloft at the giant show-peaks only as things to be worshiped for their\ngrandeur and magnitude, and their unspeakable grace of form; I looked\nup at them now, as also things to be conquered and climbed. My sense of\ntheir grandeur and their noble beauty was neither lost nor impaired; I\nhad gained a new interest in the mountains without losing the old ones.\nI followed the steep lines up, inch by inch, with my eye, and noted the\npossibility or impossibility of following them with my feet. When I saw\na shining helmet of ice projecting above the clouds, I tried to imagine\nI saw files of black specks toiling up it roped together with a gossamer\nthread.\n\nWe skirted the lonely little lake called the Daubensee, and presently\npassed close by a glacier on the right--a thing like a great river\nfrozen solid in its flow and broken square off like a wall at its mouth.\nI had never been so near a glacier before.\n\nHere we came upon a new board shanty, and found some men engaged in\nbuilding a stone house; so the Schwarenbach was soon to have a rival. We\nbought a bottle or so of beer here; at any rate they called it beer, but\nI knew by the price that it was dissolved jewelry, and I perceived by\nthe taste that dissolved jewelry is not good stuff to drink.\n\n\n\nWe were surrounded by a hideous desolation. We stepped forward to a sort\nof jumping-off place, and were confronted by a startling contrast: we\nseemed to look down into fairyland. Two or three thousand feet below us\nwas a bright green level, with a pretty town in its midst, and a silvery\nstream winding among the meadows; the charming spot was walled in on all\nsides by gigantic precipices clothed with pines; and over the pines, out\nof the softened distances, rose the snowy domes and peaks of the Monte\nRosa region. How exquisitely green and beautiful that little valley down\nthere was! The distance was not great enough to obliterate details, it\nonly made them little, and mellow, and dainty, like landscapes and towns\nseen through the wrong end of a spy-glass.\n\nRight under us a narrow ledge rose up out of the valley, with a green,\nslanting, bench-shaped top, and grouped about upon this green-baize\nbench were a lot of black and white sheep which looked merely like\noversized worms. The bench seemed lifted well up into our neighborhood,\nbut that was a deception--it was a long way down to it.\n\n\n\nWe began our descent, now, by the most remarkable road I have ever seen.\nIt wound its corkscrew curves down the face of the colossal precipice--a\nnarrow way, with always the solid rock wall at one elbow, and\nperpendicular nothingness at the other. We met an everlasting procession\nof guides, porters, mules, litters, and tourists climbing up this steep\nand muddy path, and there was no room to spare when you had to pass a\ntolerably fat mule. I always took the inside, when I heard or saw the\nmule coming, and flattened myself against the wall. I preferred the\ninside, of course, but I should have had to take it anyhow, because\nthe mule prefers the outside. A mule's preference--on a precipice--is a\nthing to be respected. Well, his choice is always the outside. His life\nis mostly devoted to carrying bulky panniers and packages which rest\nagainst his body--therefore he is habituated to taking the outside edge\nof mountain paths, to keep his bundles from rubbing against rocks or\nbanks on the other. When he goes into the passenger business he absurdly\nclings to his old habit, and keeps one leg of his passenger always\ndangling over the great deeps of the lower world while that passenger's\nheart is in the highlands, so to speak. More than once I saw a mule's\nhind foot cave over the outer edge and send earth and rubbish into the\nbottom abyss; and I noticed that upon these occasions the rider, whether\nmale or female, looked tolerably unwell.\n\nThere was one place where an eighteen-inch breadth of light masonry had\nbeen added to the verge of the path, and as there was a very sharp\nturn here, a panel of fencing had been set up there at some time, as\na protection. This panel was old and gray and feeble, and the light\nmasonry had been loosened by recent rains. A young American girl came\nalong on a mule, and in making the turn the mule's hind foot caved all\nthe loose masonry and one of the fence-posts overboard; the mule gave a\nviolent lurch inboard to save himself, and succeeded in the effort, but\nthat girl turned as white as the snows of Mont Blanc for a moment.\n\n\n\nThe path was simply a groove cut into the face of the precipice; there\nwas a four-foot breadth of solid rock under the traveler, and four-foot\nbreadth of solid rock just above his head, like the roof of a narrow\nporch; he could look out from this gallery and see a sheer summitless\nand bottomless wall of rock before him, across a gorge or crack a\nbiscuit's toss in width--but he could not see the bottom of his own\nprecipice unless he lay down and projected his nose over the edge. I did\nnot do this, because I did not wish to soil my clothes.\n\nEvery few hundred yards, at particularly bad places, one came across\na panel or so of plank fencing; but they were always old and weak,\nand they generally leaned out over the chasm and did not make any rash\npromises to hold up people who might need support. There was one of\nthese panels which had only its upper board left; a pedestrianizing\nEnglish youth came tearing down the path, was seized with an impulse to\nlook over the precipice, and without an instant's thought he threw his\nweight upon that crazy board. It bent outward a foot! I never made a\ngasp before that came so near suffocating me. The English youth's face\nsimply showed a lively surprise, but nothing more. He went swinging\nalong valleyward again, as if he did not know he had just swindled a\ncoroner by the closest kind of a shave.\n\nThe Alpine litter is sometimes like a cushioned box made fast between\nthe middles of two long poles, and sometimes it is a chair with a back\nto it and a support for the feet. It is carried by relays of strong\nporters. The motion is easier than that of any other conveyance. We met\na few men and a great many ladies in litters; it seemed to me that most\nof the ladies looked pale and nauseated; their general aspect gave me\nthe idea that they were patiently enduring a horrible suffering. As a\nrule, they looked at their laps, and left the scenery to take care of\nitself.\n\n\n\nBut the most frightened creature I saw, was a led horse that overtook\nus. Poor fellow, he had been born and reared in the grassy levels of the\nKandersteg valley and had never seen anything like this hideous place\nbefore. Every few steps he would stop short, glance wildly out from\nthe dizzy height, and then spread his red nostrils wide and pant as\nviolently as if he had been running a race; and all the while he quaked\nfrom head to heel as with a palsy. He was a handsome fellow, and he\nmade a fine statuesque picture of terror, but it was pitiful to see him\nsuffer so.\n\n\n\nThis dreadful path has had its tragedy. Baedeker, with his customary\nover terseness, begins and ends the tale thus:\n\n\"The descent on horseback should be avoided. In 1861 a Comtesse\nd'Herlincourt fell from her saddle over the precipice and was killed on\nthe spot.\"\n\nWe looked over the precipice there, and saw the monument which\ncommemorates the event. It stands in the bottom of the gorge, in a place\nwhich has been hollowed out of the rock to protect it from the torrent\nand the storms. Our old guide never spoke but when spoken to, and then\nlimited himself to a syllable or two, but when we asked him about this\ntragedy he showed a strong interest in the matter. He said the Countess\nwas very pretty, and very young--hardly out of her girlhood, in fact.\nShe was newly married, and was on her bridal tour. The young husband was\nriding a little in advance; one guide was leading the husband's horse,\nanother was leading the bride's.\n\nThe old man continued:\n\n\"The guide that was leading the husband's horse happened to glance back,\nand there was that poor young thing sitting up staring out over the\nprecipice; and her face began to bend downward a little, and she put\nup her two hands slowly and met it--so,--and put them flat against her\neyes--so--and then she sank out of the saddle, with a sharp shriek, and\none caught only the flash of a dress, and it was all over.\"\n\n\n\nThen after a pause:\n\n\"Ah, yes, that guide saw these things--yes, he saw them all. He saw them\nall, just as I have told you.\"\n\nAfter another pause:\n\n\"Ah, yes, he saw them all. My God, that was ME. I was that guide!\"\n\nThis had been the one event of the old man's life; so one may be sure he\nhad forgotten no detail connected with it. We listened to all he had to\nsay about what was done and what happened and what was said after the\nsorrowful occurrence, and a painful story it was.\n\nWhen we had wound down toward the valley until we were about on the last\nspiral of the corkscrew, Harris's hat blew over the last remaining\nbit of precipice--a small cliff a hundred or hundred and fifty feet\nhigh--and sailed down toward a steep slant composed of rough chips and\nfragments which the weather had flaked away from the precipices. We went\nleisurely down there, expecting to find it without any trouble, but we\nhad made a mistake, as to that. We hunted during a couple of hours--not\nbecause the old straw hat was valuable, but out of curiosity to find\nout how such a thing could manage to conceal itself in open ground where\nthere was nothing left for it to hide behind. When one is reading in\nbed, and lays his paper-knife down, he cannot find it again if it is\nsmaller than a saber; that hat was as stubborn as any paper-knife could\nhave been, and we finally had to give it up; but we found a fragment\nthat had once belonged to an opera-glass, and by digging around and\nturning over the rocks we gradually collected all the lenses and the\ncylinders and the various odds and ends that go to making up a complete\nopera-glass. We afterward had the thing reconstructed, and the owner can\nhave his adventurous lost-property by submitting proofs and paying costs\nof rehabilitation. We had hopes of finding the owner there, distributed\naround amongst the rocks, for it would have made an elegant paragraph;\nbut we were disappointed. Still, we were far from being disheartened,\nfor there was a considerable area which we had not thoroughly searched;\nwe were satisfied he was there, somewhere, so we resolved to wait over a\nday at Leuk and come back and get him.\n\nThen we sat down to polish off the perspiration and arrange about what\nwe would do with him when we got him. Harris was for contributing him to\nthe British Museum; but I was for mailing him to his widow. That is the\ndifference between Harris and me: Harris is all for display, I am all\nfor the simple right, even though I lose money by it. Harris argued in\nfavor of his proposition against mine, I argued in favor of mine and\nagainst his. The discussion warmed into a dispute; the dispute warmed\ninto a quarrel. I finally said, very decidedly:\n\n\"My mind is made up. He goes to the widow.\"\n\nHarris answered sharply:\n\n\"And MY mind is made up. He goes to the Museum.\"\n\nI said, calmly:\n\n\"The museum may whistle when it gets him.\"\n\nHarris retorted:\n\n\"The widow may save herself the trouble of whistling, for I will see\nthat she never gets him.\"\n\nAfter some angry bandying of epithets, I said:\n\n\"It seems to me that you are taking on a good many airs about these\nremains. I don't quite see what YOU'VE got to say about them?\"\n\n\"I? I've got ALL to say about them. They'd never have been thought of if\nI hadn't found their opera-glass. The corpse belongs to me, and I'll do\nas I please with him.\"\n\nI was leader of the Expedition, and all discoveries achieved by it\nnaturally belonged to me. I was entitled to these remains, and could\nhave enforced my right; but rather than have bad blood about the matter,\nI said we would toss up for them. I threw heads and won, but it was a\nbarren victory, for although we spent all the next day searching, we\nnever found a bone. I cannot imagine what could ever have become of that\nfellow.\n\nThe town in the valley is called Leuk or Leukerbad. We pointed our\ncourse toward it, down a verdant slope which was adorned with fringed\ngentians and other flowers, and presently entered the narrow alleys of\nthe outskirts and waded toward the middle of the town through liquid\n\"fertilizer.\" They ought to either pave that village or organize a\nferry.\n\nHarris's body was simply a chamois-pasture; his person was populous with\nthe little hungry pests; his skin, when he stripped, was splotched like\na scarlet-fever patient's; so, when we were about to enter one of the\nLeukerbad inns, and he noticed its sign, \"Chamois Hotel,\" he refused to\nstop there. He said the chamois was plentiful enough, without hunting\nup hotels where they made a specialty of it. I was indifferent, for the\nchamois is a creature that will neither bite me nor abide with me; but\nto calm Harris, we went to the H\u00f4tel des Alpes.\n\nAt the table d'h\u00f4te, we had this, for an incident. A very grave man--in\nfact his gravity amounted to solemnity, and almost to austerity--sat\nopposite us and he was \"tight,\" but doing his best to appear sober. He\ntook up a CORKED bottle of wine, tilted it over his glass awhile, then\nset it out of the way, with a contented look, and went on with his\ndinner.\n\nPresently he put his glass to his mouth, and of course found it empty.\nHe looked puzzled, and glanced furtively and suspiciously out of the\ncorner of his eye at a benignant and unconscious old lady who sat at his\nright. Shook his head, as much as to say, \"No, she couldn't have\ndone it.\" He tilted the corked bottle over his glass again, meantime\nsearching around with his watery eye to see if anybody was watching him.\nHe ate a few mouthfuls, raised his glass to his lips, and of course it\nwas still empty. He bent an injured and accusing side-glance upon that\nunconscious old lady, which was a study to see. She went on eating and\ngave no sign. He took up his glass and his bottle, with a wise private\nnod of his head, and set them gravely on the left-hand side of his\nplate--poured himself another imaginary drink--went to work with\nhis knife and fork once more--presently lifted his glass with good\nconfidence, and found it empty, as usual.\n\nThis was almost a petrifying surprise. He straightened himself up in his\nchair and deliberately and sorrowfully inspected the busy old ladies at\nhis elbows, first one and then the other. At last he softly pushed his\nplate away, set his glass directly in front of him, held on to it\nwith his left hand, and proceeded to pour with his right. This time\nhe observed that nothing came. He turned the bottle clear upside down;\nstill nothing issued from it; a plaintive look came into his face, and\nhe said, as if to himself,\n\n\"'IC! THEY'VE GOT IT ALL!\" Then he set the bottle down, resignedly, and\ntook the rest of his dinner dry.\n\n\n\nIt was at that table d'h\u00f4te, too, that I had under inspection the\nlargest lady I have ever seen in private life. She was over seven feet\nhigh, and magnificently proportioned. What had first called my attention\nto her, was my stepping on an outlying flange of her foot, and hearing,\nfrom up toward the ceiling, a deep \"Pardon, m'sieu, but you encroach!\"\n\nThat was when we were coming through the hall, and the place was dim,\nand I could see her only vaguely. The thing which called my attention\nto her the second time was, that at a table beyond ours were two very\npretty girls, and this great lady came in and sat down between them and\nme and blotted out my view. She had a handsome face, and she was very\nfinely formed--perfectly formed, I should say. But she made everybody\naround her look trivial and commonplace. Ladies near her looked like\nchildren, and the men about her looked mean. They looked like failures;\nand they looked as if they felt so, too. She sat with her back to us. I\nnever saw such a back in my life. I would have so liked to see the\nmoon rise over it. The whole congregation waited, under one pretext or\nanother, till she finished her dinner and went out; they wanted to see\nher at full altitude, and they found it worth tarrying for. She filled\none's idea of what an empress ought to be, when she rose up in her\nunapproachable grandeur and moved superbly out of that place.\n\n\n\nWe were not at Leuk in time to see her at her heaviest weight. She had\nsuffered from corpulence and had come there to get rid of her extra\nflesh in the baths. Five weeks of soaking--five uninterrupted hours of\nit every day--had accomplished her purpose and reduced her to the right\nproportions.\n\n\n\nThose baths remove fat, and also skin-diseases. The patients remain in\nthe great tanks for hours at a time. A dozen gentlemen and ladies occupy\na tank together, and amuse themselves with rompings and various games.\nThey have floating desks and tables, and they read or lunch or play\nchess in water that is breast-deep. The tourist can step in and view\nthis novel spectacle if he chooses. There's a poor-box, and he will have\nto contribute. There are several of these big bathing-houses, and you\ncan always tell when you are near one of them by the romping noises and\nshouts of laughter that proceed from it. The water is running water, and\nchanges all the time, else a patient with a ringworm might take the bath\nwith only a partial success, since, while he was ridding himself of the\nringworm, he might catch the itch.\n\n\n\nThe next morning we wandered back up the green valley, leisurely, with\nthe curving walls of those bare and stupendous precipices rising\ninto the clouds before us. I had never seen a clean, bare precipice\nstretching up five thousand feet above me before, and I never shall\nexpect to see another one. They exist, perhaps, but not in places where\none can easily get close to them. This pile of stone is peculiar. From\nits base to the soaring tops of its mighty towers, all its lines and all\nits details vaguely suggest human architecture. There are rudimentary\nbow-windows, cornices, chimneys, demarcations of stories, etc. One could\nsit and stare up there and study the features and exquisite graces of\nthis grand structure, bit by bit, and day after day, and never weary his\ninterest. The termination, toward the town, observed in profile, is the\nperfection of shape. It comes down out of the clouds in a succession of\nrounded, colossal, terracelike projections--a stairway for the gods; at\nits head spring several lofty storm-scarred towers, one after another,\nwith faint films of vapor curling always about them like spectral\nbanners. If there were a king whose realms included the whole world,\nhere would be the place meet and proper for such a monarch. He would\nonly need to hollow it out and put in the electric light. He could give\naudience to a nation at a time under its roof.\n\nOur search for those remains having failed, we inspected with a glass\nthe dim and distant track of an old-time avalanche that once swept down\nfrom some pine-grown summits behind the town and swept away the houses\nand buried the people; then we struck down the road that leads toward\nthe Rhone, to see the famous Ladders. These perilous things are built\nagainst the perpendicular face of a cliff two or three hundred feet\nhigh. The peasants, of both sexes, were climbing up and down them, with\nheavy loads on their backs. I ordered Harris to make the ascent, so I\ncould put the thrill and horror of it in my book, and he accomplished\nthe feat successfully, through a subagent, for three francs, which I\npaid. It makes me shudder yet when I think of what I felt when I was\nclinging there between heaven and earth in the person of that proxy. At\ntimes the world swam around me, and I could hardly keep from letting go,\nso dizzying was the appalling danger. Many a person would have given up\nand descended, but I stuck to my task, and would not yield until I had\naccomplished it. I felt a just pride in my exploit, but I would not have\nrepeated it for the wealth of the world. I shall break my neck yet with\nsome such foolhardy performance, for warnings never seem to have any\nlasting effect on me. When the people of the hotel found that I had\nbeen climbing those crazy Ladders, it made me an object of considerable\nattention.\n\nNext morning, early, we drove to the Rhone valley and took the train for\nVisp. There we shouldered our knapsacks and things, and set out on foot,\nin a tremendous rain, up the winding gorge, toward Zermatt. Hour after\nhour we slopped along, by the roaring torrent, and under noble Lesser\nAlps which were clothed in rich velvety green all the way up and\nhad little atomy Swiss homes perched upon grassy benches along their\nmist-dimmed heights.\n\nThe rain continued to pour and the torrent to boom, and we continued\nto enjoy both. At the one spot where this torrent tossed its white mane\nhighest, and thundered loudest, and lashed the big boulders fiercest,\nthe canton had done itself the honor to build the flimsiest wooden\nbridge that exists in the world. While we were walking over it, along\nwith a party of horsemen, I noticed that even the larger raindrops made\nit shake. I called Harris's attention to it, and he noticed it, too.\nIt seemed to me that if I owned an elephant that was a keepsake, and I\nthought a good deal of him, I would think twice before I would ride him\nover that bridge.\n\nWe climbed up to the village of St. Nicholas, about half past four\nin the afternoon, waded ankle-deep through the fertilizer-juice, and\nstopped at a new and nice hotel close by the little church. We stripped\nand went to bed, and sent our clothes down to be baked. And the horde\nof soaked tourists did the same. That chaos of clothing got mixed in the\nkitchen, and there were consequences.\n\n\n\nI did not get back the same drawers I sent down, when our things came up\nat six-fifteen; I got a pair on a new plan. They were merely a pair\nof white ruffle-cuffed absurdities, hitched together at the top with\na narrow band, and they did not come quite down to my knees. They were\npretty enough, but they made me feel like two people, and disconnected\nat that. The man must have been an idiot that got himself up like\nthat, to rough it in the Swiss mountains. The shirt they brought me\nwas shorter than the drawers, and hadn't any sleeves to it--at least\nit hadn't anything more than what Mr. Darwin would call \"rudimentary\"\nsleeves; these had \"edging\" around them, but the bosom was ridiculously\nplain. The knit silk undershirt they brought me was on a new plan, and\nwas really a sensible thing; it opened behind, and had pockets in it to\nput your shoulder-blades in; but they did not seem to fit mine, and so\nI found it a sort of uncomfortable garment. They gave my bobtail coat\nto somebody else, and sent me an ulster suitable for a giraffe. I had\nto tie my collar on, because there was no button behind on that foolish\nlittle shirt which I described a while ago.\n\nWhen I was dressed for dinner at six-thirty, I was too loose in some\nplaces and too tight in others, and altogether I felt slovenly and\nill-conditioned. However, the people at the table d'h\u00f4te were no better\noff than I was; they had everybody's clothes but their own on. A\nlong stranger recognized his ulster as soon as he saw the tail of it\nfollowing me in, but nobody claimed my shirt or my drawers, though I\ndescribed them as well as I was able. I gave them to the chambermaid\nthat night when I went to bed, and she probably found the owner, for my\nown things were on a chair outside my door in the morning.\n\nThere was a lovable English clergyman who did not get to the table\nd'h\u00f4te at all. His breeches had turned up missing, and without any\nequivalent. He said he was not more particular than other people, but he\nhad noticed that a clergyman at dinner without any breeches was almost\nsure to excite remark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's A Tramp Abroad, by Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)\n\n\n\n"}
{"filename": "Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offences.txt", "text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by David Widger\n\n\n\n\n\nFENIMORE COOPER'S LITERARY OFFENCES\n\nby Mark Twain\n\n\n\n          The Pathfinder and The Deerslayer stand at the head of Cooper's\n          novels as artistic creations.  There are others of his works\n          which contain parts as perfect as are to be found in these, and\n          scenes even more thrilling.  Not one can be compared with\n          either of them as a finished whole.\n\n          The defects in both of these tales are comparatively slight.\n          They were pure works of art.--Prof. Lounsbury.\n\n\n          The five tales reveal an extraordinary fulness of invention.\n          ...  One of the very greatest characters in fiction, Natty\n          Bumppo....\n\n          The craft of the woodsman, the tricks of the trapper, all the\n          delicate art of the forest, were familiar to Cooper from his\n          youth up.--Prof. Brander Matthews.\n\n          Cooper is the greatest artist in the domain of romantic fiction\n          yet produced by America.--Wilkie Collins.\n\n\nIt seems to me that it was far from right for the Professor of English\nLiterature in Yale, the Professor of English Literature in Columbia, and\nWilkie Collins to deliver opinions on Cooper's literature without having\nread some of it. It would have been much more decorous to keep silent\nand let persons talk who have read Cooper.\n\nCooper's art has some defects. In one place in 'Deerslayer,' and in the\nrestricted space of two-thirds of a page, Cooper has scored 114 offences\nagainst literary art out of a possible 115. It breaks the record.\n\nThere are nineteen rules governing literary art in the domain of\nromantic fiction--some say twenty-two. In Deerslayer Cooper violated\neighteen of them. These eighteen require:\n\n1. That a tale shall accomplish something and arrive somewhere. But the\nDeerslayer tale accomplishes nothing and arrives in the air.\n\n2. They require that the episodes of a tale shall be necessary parts of\nthe tale, and shall help to develop it. But as the Deerslayer tale is\nnot a tale, and accomplishes nothing and arrives nowhere, the episodes\nhave no rightful place in the work, since there was nothing for them to\ndevelop.\n\n3. They require that the personages in a tale shall be alive, except in\nthe case of corpses, and that always the reader shall be able to tell\nthe corpses from the others. But this detail has often been overlooked\nin the Deerslayer tale.\n\n4. They require that the personages in a tale, both dead and alive,\nshall exhibit a sufficient excuse for being there. But this detail also\nhas been overlooked in the Deerslayer tale.\n\n5. They require that when the personages of a tale deal in conversation,\nthe talk shall sound like human talk, and be talk such as human\nbeings would be likely to talk in the given circumstances, and have\na discoverable meaning, also a discoverable purpose, and a show of\nrelevancy, and remain in the neighborhood of the subject in hand, and\nbe interesting to the reader, and help out the tale, and stop when the\npeople cannot think of anything more to say. But this requirement has\nbeen ignored from the beginning of the Deerslayer tale to the end of it.\n\n6. They require that when the author describes the character of a\npersonage in his tale, the conduct and conversation of that personage\nshall justify said description. But this law gets little or no attention\nin the Deerslayer tale, as Natty Bumppo's case will amply prove.\n\n7. They require that when a personage talks like an illustrated,\ngilt-edged, tree-calf, hand-tooled, seven-dollar Friendship's Offering\nin the beginning of a paragraph, he shall not talk like a negro minstrel\nin the end of it. But this rule is flung down and danced upon in the\nDeerslayer tale.\n\n8. They require that crass stupidities shall not be played upon the\nreader as \u201cthe craft of the woodsman, the delicate art of the forest,\u201d\n by either the author or the people in the tale. But this rule is\npersistently violated in the Deerslayer tale.\n\n9. They require that the personages of a tale shall confine themselves\nto possibilities and let miracles alone; or, if they venture a miracle,\nthe author must so plausibly set it forth as to make it look possible\nand reasonable. But these rules are not respected in the Deerslayer\ntale.\n\n10. They require that the author shall make the reader feel a deep\ninterest in the personages of his tale and in their fate; and that he\nshall make the reader love the good people in the tale and hate the bad\nones. But the reader of the Deerslayer tale dislikes the good people in\nit, is indifferent to the others, and wishes they would all get drowned\ntogether.\n\n11. They require that the characters in a tale shall be so clearly\ndefined that the reader can tell beforehand what each will do in a given\nemergency. But in the Deerslayer tale this rule is vacated.\n\nIn addition to these large rules there are some little ones. These\nrequire that the author shall:\n\n12. Say what he is proposing to say, not merely come near it.\n\n13. Use the right word, not its second cousin.\n\n14. Eschew surplusage.\n\n15. Not omit necessary details.\n\n16. Avoid slovenliness of form.\n\n17. Use good grammar.\n\n18. Employ a simple and straightforward style.\n\nEven these seven are coldly and persistently violated in the Deerslayer\ntale.\n\nCooper's gift in the way of invention was not a rich endowment; but\nsuch as it was he liked to work it, he was pleased with the effects,\nand indeed he did some quite sweet things with it. In his little box of\nstage properties he kept six or eight cunning devices, tricks, artifices\nfor his savages and woodsmen to deceive and circumvent each other with,\nand he was never so happy as when he was working these innocent things\nand seeing them go. A favorite one was to make a moccasined person tread\nin the tracks of the moccasined enemy, and thus hide his own trail.\nCooper wore out barrels and barrels of moccasins in working that trick.\nAnother stage-property that he pulled out of his box pretty frequently\nwas his broken twig. He prized his broken twig above all the rest of his\neffects, and worked it the hardest. It is a restful chapter in any book\nof his when somebody doesn't step on a dry twig and alarm all the reds\nand whites for two hundred yards around. Every time a Cooper person is\nin peril, and absolute silence is worth four dollars a minute, he is\nsure to step on a dry twig. There may be a hundred handier things to\nstep on, but that wouldn't satisfy Cooper. Cooper requires him to turn\nout and find a dry twig; and if he can't do it, go and borrow one. In\nfact, the Leather Stocking Series ought to have been called the Broken\nTwig Series.\n\nI am sorry there is not room to put in a few dozen instances of the\ndelicate art of the forest, as practised by Natty Bumppo and some of the\nother Cooperian experts. Perhaps we may venture two or three samples.\nCooper was a sailor--a naval officer; yet he gravely tells us how\na vessel, driving towards a lee shore in a gale, is steered for a\nparticular spot by her skipper because he knows of an undertow there\nwhich will hold her back against the gale and save her. For just pure\nwoodcraft, or sailorcraft, or whatever it is, isn't that neat? For\nseveral years Cooper was daily in the society of artillery, and he ought\nto have noticed that when a cannon-ball strikes the ground it either\nburies itself or skips a hundred feet or so; skips again a hundred feet\nor so--and so on, till finally it gets tired and rolls. Now in one place\nhe loses some \u201cfemales\u201d--as he always calls women--in the edge of a wood\nnear a plain at night in a fog, on purpose to give Bumppo a chance to\nshow off the delicate art of the forest before the reader. These\nmislaid people are hunting for a fort. They hear a cannonblast, and a\ncannon-ball presently comes rolling into the wood and stops at their\nfeet. To the females this suggests nothing. The case is very different\nwith the admirable Bumppo. I wish I may never know peace again if he\ndoesn't strike out promptly and follow the track of that cannon-ball\nacross the plain through the dense fog and find the fort. Isn't it\na daisy? If Cooper had any real knowledge of Nature's ways of doing\nthings, he had a most delicate art in concealing the fact. For instance:\none of his acute Indian experts, Chingachgook (pronounced Chicago,\nI think), has lost the trail of a person he is tracking through the\nforest. Apparently that trail is hopelessly lost. Neither you nor I\ncould ever have guessed out the way to find it. It was very different\nwith Chicago. Chicago was not stumped for long. He turned a running\nstream out of its course, and there, in the slush in its old bed, were\nthat person's moccasin-tracks. The current did not wash them away, as\nit would have done in all other like cases--no, even the eternal laws\nof Nature have to vacate when Cooper wants to put up a delicate job of\nwoodcraft on the reader.\n\nWe must be a little wary when Brander Matthews tells us that Cooper's\nbooks \u201creveal an extraordinary fulness of invention.\u201d As a rule, I\nam quite willing to accept Brander Matthews's literary judgments and\napplaud his lucid and graceful phrasing of them; but that particular\nstatement needs to be taken with a few tons of salt. Bless your heart,\nCooper hadn't any more invention than a horse; and I don't mean a\nhigh-class horse, either; I mean a clothes-horse. It would be very\ndifficult to find a really clever \u201csituation\u201d in Cooper's books, and\nstill more difficult to find one of any kind which he has failed to\nrender absurd by his handling of it. Look at the episodes of \u201cthe\ncaves\u201d; and at the celebrated scuffle between Maqua and those others\non the table-land a few days later; and at Hurry Harry's queer\nwater-transit from the castle to the ark; and at Deerslayer's half-hour\nwith his first corpse; and at the quarrel between Hurry Harry and\nDeerslayer later; and at--but choose for yourself; you can't go amiss.\n\nIf Cooper had been an observer his inventive faculty would have worked\nbetter; not more interestingly, but more rationally, more plausibly.\nCooper's proudest creations in the way of \u201csituations\u201d suffer noticeably\nfrom the absence of the observer's protecting gift. Cooper's eye was\nsplendidly inaccurate. Cooper seldom saw anything correctly. He saw\nnearly all things as through a glass eye, darkly. Of course a man who\ncannot see the commonest little every-day matters accurately is\nworking at a disadvantage when he is constructing a \u201csituation.\u201d In the\nDeerslayer tale Cooper has a stream which is fifty feet wide where it\nflows out of a lake; it presently narrows to twenty as it meanders along\nfor no given reason; and yet when a stream acts like that it ought to\nbe required to explain itself. Fourteen pages later the width of the\nbrook's outlet from the lake has suddenly shrunk thirty feet, and become\n\u201cthe narrowest part of the stream.\u201d This shrinkage is not accounted for.\nThe stream has bends in it, a sure indication that it has alluvial banks\nand cuts them; yet these bends are only thirty and fifty feet long. If\nCooper had been a nice and punctilious observer he would have noticed\nthat the bends were oftener nine hundred feet long than short of it.\n\nCooper made the exit of that stream fifty feet wide, in the first place,\nfor no particular reason; in the second place, he narrowed it to less\nthan twenty to accommodate some Indians. He bends a \u201csapling\u201d to the\nform of an arch over this narrow passage, and conceals six Indians in\nits foliage. They are \u201claying\u201d for a settler's scow or ark which is\ncoming up the stream on its way to the lake; it is being hauled against\nthe stiff current by a rope whose stationary end is anchored in the\nlake; its rate of progress cannot be more than a mile an hour. Cooper\ndescribes the ark, but pretty obscurely. In the matter of dimensions \u201cit\nwas little more than a modern canal-boat.\u201d Let us guess, then, that it\nwas about one hundred and forty feet long. It was of \u201cgreater breadth\nthan common.\u201d Let us guess, then, that it was about sixteen feet wide.\nThis leviathan had been prowling down bends which were but a third as\nlong as itself, and scraping between banks where it had only two feet of\nspace to spare on each side. We cannot too much admire this miracle.\nA low-roofed log dwelling occupies \u201ctwo-thirds of the ark's length\u201d--a\ndwelling ninety feet long and sixteen feet wide, let us say a kind of\nvestibule train. The dwelling has two rooms--each forty-five feet long\nand sixteen feet wide, let us guess. One of them is the bedroom of the\nHutter girls, Judith and Hetty; the other is the parlor in the daytime,\nat night it is papa's bedchamber. The ark is arriving at the stream's\nexit now, whose width has been reduced to less than twenty feet to\naccommodate the Indians--say to eighteen. There is a foot to spare on\neach side of the boat. Did the Indians notice that there was going to\nbe a tight squeeze there? Did they notice that they could make money by\nclimbing down out of that arched sapling and just stepping aboard when\nthe ark scraped by? No, other Indians would have noticed these things,\nbut Cooper's Indians never notice anything. Cooper thinks they are\nmarvelous creatures for noticing, but he was almost always in error\nabout his Indians. There was seldom a sane one among them.\n\nThe ark is one hundred and forty feet long; the dwelling is ninety feet\nlong. The idea of the Indians is to drop softly and secretly from the\narched sapling to the dwelling as the ark creeps along under it at the\nrate of a mile an hour, and butcher the family. It will take the ark a\nminute and a half to pass under. It will take the ninety foot dwelling\na minute to pass under. Now, then, what did the six Indians do? It would\ntake you thirty years to guess, and even then you would have to give it\nup, I believe. Therefore, I will tell you what the Indians did. Their\nchief, a person of quite extraordinary intellect for a Cooper Indian,\nwarily watched the canal-boat as it squeezed along under him, and when\nhe had got his calculations fined down to exactly the right shade, as\nhe judged, he let go and dropped. And missed the house! That is actually\nwhat he did. He missed the house, and landed in the stern of the scow.\nIt was not much of a fall, yet it knocked him silly. He lay there\nunconscious. If the house had been ninety-seven feet long he would have\nmade the trip. The fault was Cooper's, not his. The error lay in the\nconstruction of the house. Cooper was no architect.\n\nThere still remained in the roost five Indians.\n\nThe boat has passed under and is now out of their reach. Let me explain\nwhat the five did--you would not be able to reason it out for yourself.\nNo. 1 jumped for the boat, but fell in the water astern of it. Then No.\n2 jumped for the boat, but fell in the water still farther astern of it.\nThen No. 3 jumped for the boat, and fell a good way astern of it. Then\nNo. 4 jumped for the boat, and fell in the water away astern. Then\neven No. 5 made a jump for the boat--for he was a Cooper Indian. In\nthe matter of intellect, the difference between a Cooper Indian and the\nIndian that stands in front of the cigarshop is not spacious. The scow\nepisode is really a sublime burst of invention; but it does not\nthrill, because the inaccuracy of the details throws a sort of air of\nfictitiousness and general improbability over it. This comes of Cooper's\ninadequacy as an observer.\n\nThe reader will find some examples of Cooper's high talent for\ninaccurate observation in the account of the shooting-match in The\nPathfinder.\n\n          \u201cA common wrought nail was driven lightly into the target, its\n          head having been first touched with paint.\u201d\n\nThe color of the paint is not stated--an important omission, but Cooper\ndeals freely in important omissions. No, after all, it was not an\nimportant omission; for this nail-head is a hundred yards from the\nmarksmen, and could not be seen by them at that distance, no matter what\nits color might be.\n\nHow far can the best eyes see a common house-fly? A hundred yards? It is\nquite impossible. Very well; eyes that cannot see a house-fly that is a\nhundred yards away cannot see an ordinary nailhead at that distance, for\nthe size of the two objects is the same. It takes a keen eye to see a\nfly or a nailhead at fifty yards--one hundred and fifty feet. Can the\nreader do it?\n\nThe nail was lightly driven, its head painted, and game called. Then the\nCooper miracles began. The bullet of the first marksman chipped an edge\noff the nail-head; the next man's bullet drove the nail a little way\ninto the target--and removed all the paint. Haven't the miracles\ngone far enough now? Not to suit Cooper; for the purpose of\nthis whole scheme is to show off his prodigy, Deerslayer--\nHawkeye--Long-Rifle--Leather-Stocking--Pathfinder--Bumppo before\nthe ladies.\n\n          \u201c'Be all ready to clench it, boys!' cried out Pathfinder,\n          stepping into his friend's tracks the instant they were vacant.\n          'Never mind a new nail; I can see that, though the paint is\n          gone, and what I can see I can hit at a hundred yards, though\n          it were only a mosquito's eye.  Be ready to clench!'\n\n\u201cThe rifle cracked, the bullet sped its way, and the head of the nail\nwas buried in the wood, covered by the piece of flattened lead.\u201d\n\nThere, you see, is a man who could hunt flies with a rifle, and command\na ducal salary in a Wild West show to-day if we had him back with us.\n\nThe recorded feat is certainly surprising just as it stands; but it\nis not surprising enough for Cooper. Cooper adds a touch. He has made\nPathfinder do this miracle with another man's rifle; and not only that,\nbut Pathfinder did not have even the advantage of loading it himself.\nHe had everything against him, and yet he made that impossible shot; and\nnot only made it, but did it with absolute confidence, saying, \u201cBe ready\nto clench.\u201d Now a person like that would have undertaken that same feat\nwith a brickbat, and with Cooper to help he would have achieved it, too.\n\nPathfinder showed off handsomely that day before the ladies. His\nvery first feat was a thing which no Wild West show can touch. He was\nstanding with the group of marksmen, observing--a hundred yards from the\ntarget, mind; one Jasper raised his rifle and drove the centre of the\nbull's-eye. Then the Quartermaster fired. The target exhibited no result\nthis time. There was a laugh. \u201cIt's a dead miss,\u201d said Major Lundie.\nPathfinder waited an impressive moment or two; then said, in that calm,\nindifferent, know-it-all way of his, \u201cNo, Major, he has covered Jasper's\nbullet, as will be seen if any one will take the trouble to examine the\ntarget.\u201d\n\nWasn't it remarkable! How could he see that little pellet fly through\nthe air and enter that distant bullet-hole? Yet that is what he did; for\nnothing is impossible to a Cooper person. Did any of those people\nhave any deep-seated doubts about this thing? No; for that would imply\nsanity, and these were all Cooper people.\n\n          \u201cThe respect for Pathfinder's skill and for his 'quickness and\n          accuracy of sight'\u201d (the italics [' '] are mine) \u201cwas so\n          profound and general, that the instant he made this declaration\n          the spectators began to distrust their own opinions, and a\n          dozen rushed to the target in order to ascertain the fact.\n          There, sure enough, it was found that the Quartermaster's\n          bullet had gone through the hole made by Jasper's, and that,\n          too, so accurately as to require a minute examination to be\n          certain of the circumstance, which, however, was soon clearly\n          established by discovering one bullet over the other in the\n          stump against which the target was placed.\u201d\n\nThey made a \u201cminute\u201d examination; but never mind, how could they know\nthat there were two bullets in that hole without digging the latest one\nout? for neither probe nor eyesight could prove the presence of any\nmore than one bullet. Did they dig? No; as we shall see. It is the\nPathfinder's turn now; he steps out before the ladies, takes aim, and\nfires.\n\nBut, alas! here is a disappointment; an incredible, an unimaginable\ndisappointment--for the target's aspect is unchanged; there is nothing\nthere but that same old bullet-hole!\n\n          \u201c'If one dared to hint at such a thing,' cried Major Duncan, 'I\n          should say that the Pathfinder has also missed the target!'\u201d\n\nAs nobody had missed it yet, the \u201calso\u201d was not necessary; but never\nmind about that, for the Pathfinder is going to speak.\n\n          \u201c'No, no, Major,' said he, confidently, 'that would be a risky\n          declaration.  I didn't load the piece, and can't say what was\n          in it; but if it was lead, you will find the bullet driving\n          down those of the Quartermaster and Jasper, else is not my name\n          Pathfinder.'\n\n          \u201cA shout from the target announced the truth of this\n          assertion.\u201d\n\nIs the miracle sufficient as it stands? Not for Cooper. The Pathfinder\nspeaks again, as he \u201cnow slowly advances towards the stage occupied by\nthe females\u201d:\n\n          \u201c'That's not all, boys, that's not all; if you find the target\n          touched at all, I'll own to a miss.  The Quartermaster cut the\n          wood, but you'll find no wood cut by that last messenger.\u201d\n\nThe miracle is at last complete. He knew--doubtless saw--at the distance\nof a hundred yards--that his bullet had passed into the hole without\nfraying the edges. There were now three bullets in that one hole--three\nbullets embedded processionally in the body of the stump back of the\ntarget. Everybody knew this--somehow or other--and yet nobody had dug\nany of them out to make sure. Cooper is not a close observer, but he is\ninteresting. He is certainly always that, no matter what happens. And he\nis more interesting when he is not noticing what he is about than when\nhe is. This is a considerable merit.\n\nThe conversations in the Cooper books have a curious sound in our modern\nears. To believe that such talk really ever came out of people's mouths\nwould be to believe that there was a time when time was of no value to\na person who thought he had something to say; when it was the custom\nto spread a two-minute remark out to ten; when a man's mouth was a\nrolling-mill, and busied itself all day long in turning four-foot pigs\nof thought into thirty-foot bars of conversational railroad iron by\nattenuation; when subjects were seldom faithfully stuck to, but the talk\nwandered all around and arrived nowhere; when conversations consisted\nmainly of irrelevancies, with here and there a relevancy, a relevancy\nwith an embarrassed look, as not being able to explain how it got there.\n\nCooper was certainly not a master in the construction of dialogue.\nInaccurate observation defeated him here as it defeated him in so many\nother enterprises of his. He even failed to notice that the man who\ntalks corrupt English six days in the week must and will talk it on\nthe seventh, and can't help himself. In the Deerslayer story he lets\nDeerslayer talk the showiest kind of book-talk sometimes, and at other\ntimes the basest of base dialects. For instance, when some one asks\nhim if he has a sweetheart, and if so, where she abides, this is his\nmajestic answer:\n\n          \u201c'She's in the forest-hanging from the boughs of the trees, in\n          a soft rain--in the dew on the open grass--the clouds that\n          float about in the blue heavens--the birds that sing in the\n          woods--the sweet springs where I slake my thirst--and in all\n          the other glorious gifts that come from God's Providence!'\u201d\n\nAnd he preceded that, a little before, with this:\n\n          \u201c'It consarns me as all things that touches a fri'nd consarns a\n          fri'nd.'\u201d\n\nAnd this is another of his remarks:\n\n          \u201c'If I was Injin born, now, I might tell of this, or carry in\n          the scalp and boast of the expl'ite afore the whole tribe; or\n          if my inimy had only been a bear'\u201d--and so on.\n\nWe cannot imagine such a thing as a veteran Scotch Commander-in-Chief\ncomporting himself in the field like a windy melodramatic actor, but\nCooper could. On one occasion Alice and Cora were being chased by the\nFrench through a fog in the neighborhood of their father's fort:\n\n          \u201c'Point de quartier aux coquins!' cried an eager pursuer, who\n          seemed to direct the operations of the enemy.\n\n          \u201c'Stand firm and be ready, my gallant 60ths!' suddenly\n          exclaimed a voice above them; wait to see the enemy; fire low,\n          and sweep the glacis.'\n\n          \u201c'Father? father!' exclaimed a piercing cry from out the mist;\n          'it is I!  Alice! thy own Elsie! spare, O! save your daughters!'\n\n          \u201c'Hold!' shouted the former speaker, in the awful tones of\n          parental agony, the sound reaching even to the woods, and\n          rolling back in solemn echo.  ''Tis she! God has restored me my\n          children! Throw open the sally-port; to the field, 60ths, to\n          the field! pull not a trigger, lest ye kill my lambs!  Drive\n          off these dogs of France with your steel!'\u201d\n\nCooper's word-sense was singularly dull. When a person has a poor ear\nfor music he will flat and sharp right along without knowing it. He\nkeeps near the tune, but it is not the tune. When a person has a poor\near for words, the result is a literary flatting and sharping; you\nperceive what he is intending to say, but you also perceive that he\ndoesn't say it. This is Cooper. He was not a word-musician. His ear was\nsatisfied with the approximate word. I will furnish some circumstantial\nevidence in support of this charge. My instances are gathered from\nhalf a dozen pages of the tale called Deerslayer. He uses \u201cverbal,\u201d\n for \u201coral\u201d; \u201cprecision,\u201d for \u201cfacility\u201d; \u201cphenomena,\u201d for \u201cmarvels\u201d;\n\u201cnecessary,\u201d for \u201cpredetermined\u201d; \u201cunsophisticated,\u201d for \u201cprimitive\u201d;\n\u201cpreparation,\u201d for \u201cexpectancy\u201d; \u201crebuked,\u201d for \u201csubdued\u201d; \u201cdependent\non,\u201d for \u201cresulting from\u201d; \u201cfact,\u201d for \u201ccondition\u201d; \u201cfact,\u201d for\n\u201cconjecture\u201d; \u201cprecaution,\u201d for \u201ccaution\u201d; \u201cexplain,\u201d for \u201cdetermine\u201d;\n\u201cmortified,\u201d for \u201cdisappointed\u201d; \u201cmeretricious,\u201d for \u201cfactitious\u201d;\n\u201cmaterially,\u201d for \u201cconsiderably\u201d; \u201cdecreasing,\u201d for \u201cdeepening\u201d;\n\u201cincreasing,\u201d for \u201cdisappearing\u201d; \u201cembedded,\u201d for \u201cenclosed\u201d;\n\u201ctreacherous;\u201d for \u201chostile\u201d; \u201cstood,\u201d for \u201cstooped\u201d; \u201csoftened,\u201d for\n\u201creplaced\u201d; \u201crejoined,\u201d for \u201cremarked\u201d; \u201csituation,\u201d for \u201ccondition\u201d;\n\u201cdifferent,\u201d for \u201cdiffering\u201d; \u201cinsensible,\u201d for \u201cunsentient\u201d; \u201cbrevity,\u201d\n for \u201ccelerity\u201d; \u201cdistrusted,\u201d for \u201csuspicious\u201d; \u201cmental imbecility,\u201d\n for \u201cimbecility\u201d; \u201ceyes,\u201d for \u201csight\u201d; \u201ccounteracting,\u201d for \u201copposing\u201d;\n\u201cfuneral obsequies,\u201d for \u201cobsequies.\u201d\n\nThere have been daring people in the world who claimed that Cooper could\nwrite English, but they are all dead now--all dead but Lounsbury. I\ndon't remember that Lounsbury makes the claim in so many words, still he\nmakes it, for he says that Deerslayer is a \u201cpure work of art.\u201d Pure, in\nthat connection, means faultless--faultless in all details--and language\nis a detail. If Mr. Lounsbury had only compared Cooper's English with\nthe English which he writes himself--but it is plain that he didn't;\nand so it is likely that he imagines until this day that Cooper's is as\nclean and compact as his own. Now I feel sure, deep down in my heart,\nthat Cooper wrote about the poorest English that exists in our language,\nand that the English of Deerslayer is the very worst that even Cooper\never wrote.\n\nI may be mistaken, but it does seem to me that Deerslayer is not a work\nof art in any sense; it does seem to me that it is destitute of every\ndetail that goes to the making of a work of art; in truth, it seems to\nme that Deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens.\n\nA work of art? It has no invention; it has no order, system, sequence,\nor result; it has no lifelikeness, no thrill, no stir, no seeming of\nreality; its characters are confusedly drawn, and by their acts and\nwords they prove that they are not the sort of people the author\nclaims that they are; its humor is pathetic; its pathos is funny;\nits conversations are--oh! indescribable; its love-scenes odious; its\nEnglish a crime against the language.\n\nCounting these out, what is left is Art. I think we must all admit that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
