I had come\nto believe it infallible in its judgments about the time of day, and to\nconsider its constitution and its anatomy imperishable.  But at last, one\nnight, I let it run down.  I grieved about it as if it were a recognized\nmessenger and forerunner of calamity.  But by and by I cheered up, set\nthe watch by guess, and commanded my bodings and superstitions to depart.\nNext day I stepped into the chief jeweler's to set it by the exact time,\nand the head of the establishment took it out of my hand and proceeded to\nset it for me.  Then he said, \"She is four minutes slow-regulator wants\npushing up.\"  I tried to stop him--tried to make him understand that the\nwatch kept perfect time.  But no; all this human cabbage could see was\nthat the watch was four minutes slow, and the regulator must be pushed up\na little; and so, while I danced around him in anguish, and implored him\nto let the watch alone, he calmly and cruelly did the shameful deed.  My\nwatch began to gain.  It gained faster and faster day by day.  Within the\nweek it sickened to a raging fever, and its pulse went up to a hundred\nand fifty in the shade.  At the end of two months it had left all the\ntimepieces of the town far in the rear, and was a fraction over thirteen\ndays ahead of the almanac.  It was away into November enjoying the snow,\nwhile the October leaves were still turning.  It hurried up house rent,\nbills payable, and such things, in such a ruinous way that I could not\nabide it.  I took it to the watchmaker to be regulated.  He asked me if I\nhad ever had it repaired.  I said no, it had never needed any repairing.\nHe looked a look of vicious happiness and eagerly pried the watch open,\nand then put a small dice-box into his eye and peered into its machinery.\nHe said it wanted cleaning and oiling, besides regulating--come in a\nweek.  After being cleaned and oiled, and regulated, my watch slowed down\nto that degree that it ticked like a tolling bell.  I began to be left by\ntrains, I failed all appointments, I got to missing my dinner; my watch\nstrung out three days' grace to four and let me go to protest;\nI gradually drifted back into yesterday, then day before, then into last\nweek, and by and by the comprehension came upon me that all solitary and\nalone I was lingering along in week before last, and the world was out of\nsight.  I seemed to detect in myself a sort of sneaking fellow-feeling\nfor the mummy in the museum, and a desire to swap news with him.  I went\nto a watchmaker again.  He took the watch all to pieces while I waited,\nand then said the barrel was \"swelled.\"  He said he could reduce it in\nthree days.  After this the watch averaged well, but nothing more.  For\nhalf a day it would go like the very mischief, and keep up such a barking\nand wheezing and whooping and sneezing and snorting, that I could not\nhear myself think for the disturbance; and as long as it held out there\nwas not a watch in the land that stood any chance against it.  But the\nrest of the day it would keep on slowing down and fooling along until all\nthe clocks it had left behind caught up again.  So at last, at the end of\ntwenty-four hours, it would trot up to the judges' stand all right and\njust in time.  It would show a fair and square average, and no man could\nsay it had done more or less than its duty.  But a correct average is\nonly a mild virtue in a watch, and I took this instrument to another\nwatchmaker.  He said the king-bolt was broken.  I said I was glad it was\nnothing more serious.  To tell the plain truth, I had no idea what the\nking-bolt was, but I did not choose to appear ignorant to a stranger.\nHe repaired the king-bolt, but what the watch gained in one way it lost\nin another.  It would run awhile and then stop awhile, and then run\nawhile again, and so on, using its own discretion about the intervals.\nAnd every time it went off it kicked back like a musket.  I padded my\nbreast for a few days, but finally took the watch to another watchmaker.\nHe picked it all to pieces, and turned the ruin over and over under his\nglass; and then he said there appeared to be something the matter with\nthe hair-trigger.  He fixed it, and gave it a fresh start.  It did well\nnow, except that always at ten minutes to ten the hands would shut\ntogether like a pair of scissors, and from that time forth they would\ntravel together.  The oldest man in the world could not make head or tail\nof the time of day by such a watch, and so I went again to have the thing\nrepaired.  This person said that the crystal had got bent, and that the\nmainspring was not straight.  He also remarked that part of the works\nneeded half-soling.  He made these things all right, and then my\ntimepiece performed unexceptionably, save that now and then, after\nworking along quietly for nearly eight hours, everything inside would let\ngo all of a sudden and begin to buzz like a bee, and the hands would\nstraightway begin to spin round and round so fast that their\nindividuality was lost completely, and they simply seemed a delicate\nspider's web over the face of the watch.  She would reel off the next\ntwenty-four hours in six or seven minutes, and then stop with a bang.\nI went with a heavy heart to one more watchmaker, and looked on while he\ntook her to pieces.  Then I prepared to cross-question him rigidly, for\nthis thing was getting serious.  The watch had cost two hundred dollars\noriginally, and I seemed to have paid out two or three thousand for\nrepairs.  While I waited and looked on I presently recognized in this\nwatchmaker an old acquaintance--a steamboat engineer of other days, and\nnot a good engineer, either.  He examined all the parts carefully, just\nas the other watchmakers had done, and then delivered his verdict with\nthe same confidence of manner.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"She makes too much steam-you want to hang the monkey-wrench on the\nsafety-valve!\"\n\nI brained him on the spot, and had him buried at my own expense.\n\nMy uncle William (now deceased, alas!) used to say that a good horse was,\na good horse until it had run away once, and that a good watch was a good\nwatch until the repairers got a chance at it.  And he used to wonder what\nbecame of all the unsuccessful tinkers, and gunsmiths, and shoemakers,\nand engineers, and blacksmiths; but nobody could ever tell him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOLITICAL ECONOMY\n\n     Political Economy is the basis of all good government.  The wisest\n     men of all ages have brought to bear upon this subject the--\n\n[Here I was interrupted and informed that a stranger wished to see me\ndown at the door.  I went and confronted him, and asked to know his\nbusiness, struggling all the time to keep a tight rein on my seething\npolitical-economy ideas, and not let them break away from me or get\ntangled in their harness.  And privately I wished the stranger was in the\nbottom of the canal with a cargo of wheat on top of him.  I was all in a\nfever, but he was cool.  He said he was sorry to disturb me, but as he\nwas passing he noticed that I needed some lightning-rods.  I said, \"Yes,\nyes--go on--what about it?\"  He said there was nothing about it, in\nparticular--nothing except that he would like to put them up for me.\nI am new to housekeeping; have been used to hotels and boarding-houses\nall my life.  Like anybody else of similar experience, I try to appear\n(to strangers) to be an old housekeeper; consequently I said in an\noffhand way that I had been intending for some time to have six or eight\nlightning-rods put up, but--The stranger started, and looked inquiringly\nat me, but I was serene.  I thought that if I chanced to make any\nmistakes, he would not catch me by my countenance.  He said he would\nrather have my custom than any man's in town.  I said, \"All right,\" and\nstarted off to wrestle with my great subject again, when he called me\nback and said it would be necessary to know exactly how many \"points\" I\nwanted put up, what parts of the house I wanted them on, and what quality\nof rod I preferred.  It was close quarters for a man not used to the\nexigencies of housekeeping; but I went through creditably, and he\nprobably never suspected that I was a novice.  I told him to put up eight\n\"points,\" and put them all on the roof, and use the best quality of rod.\nHe said he could furnish the \"plain\" article at 20 cents a foot;\n\"coppered,\" 25 cents; \"zinc-plated spiral-twist,\" at 30 cents, that would\nstop a streak of lightning any time, no matter where it was bound, and\n\"render its errand harmless and its further progress apocryphal.\"  I said\napocryphal was no slouch of a word, emanating from the source it did,\nbut, philology aside, I liked the spiral-twist and would take that brand.\nThen he said he could make two hundred and fifty feet answer; but to do\nit right, and make the best job in town of it, and attract the admiration\nof the just and the unjust alike, and compel all parties to say they\nnever saw a more symmetrical and hypothetical display of lightning-rods\nsince they were born, he supposed he really couldn't get along without\nfour hundred, though he was not vindictive, and trusted he was willing to\ntry.  I said, go ahead and use four hundred, and make any kind of a job\nhe pleased out of it, but let me get back to my work.  So I got rid of\nhim at last; and now, after half an hour spent in getting my train of\npolitical-economy thoughts coupled together again, I am ready to go on\nonce more.]\n\n     richest treasures of their genius, their experience of life, and\n     their learning.  The great lights of commercial jurisprudence,\n     international confraternity, and biological deviation, of all ages,\n     all civilizations, and all nationalities, from Zoroaster down to\n     Horace Greeley, have--\n\n[Here I was interrupted again, and required to go down and confer further\nwith that lightning-rod man.  I hurried off, boiling and surging with\nprodigious thoughts wombed in words of such majesty that each one of them\nwas in itself a straggling procession of syllables that might be fifteen\nminutes passing a given point, and once more I confronted him--he so calm\nand sweet, I so hot and frenzied.  He was standing in the contemplative\nattitude of the Colossus of Rhodes, with one foot on my infant tuberose,\nand the other among my pansies, his hands on his hips, his hat-brim\ntilted forward, one eye shut and the other gazing critically and\nadmiringly in the direction of my principal chimney.  He said now there\nwas a state of things to make a man glad to be alive; and added, \"I leave\nit to you if you ever saw anything more deliriously picturesque than\neight lightning-rods on one chimney?\"  I said I had no present\nrecollection of anything that transcended it.  He said that in his\nopinion nothing on earth but Niagara Falls was superior to it in the way\nof natural scenery.  All that was needed now, he verily believed, to make\nmy house a perfect balm to the eye, was to kind of touch up the other\nchimneys a little, and thus \"add to the generous 'coup d'oeil' a soothing\nuniformity of achievement which would allay the excitement naturally\nconsequent upon the 'coup d'etat.'\"  I asked him if he learned to talk\nout of a book, and if I could borrow it anywhere?  He smiled pleasantly,\nand said that his manner of speaking was not taught in books, and that\nnothing but familiarity with lightning could enable a man to handle his\nconversational style with impunity.  He then figured up an estimate, and\nsaid that about eight more rods scattered about my roof would about fix\nme right, and he guessed five hundred feet of stuff would do it; and\nadded that the first eight had got a little the start of him, so to\nspeak, and used up a mere trifle of material more than he had calculated\non--a hundred feet or along there.  I said I was in a dreadful hurry,\nand I wished we could get this business permanently mapped out, so that I\ncould go on with my work.  He said, \"I could have put up those eight\nrods, and marched off about my business--some men would have done it.\nBut no; I said to myself, this man is a stranger to me, and I will die\nbefore I'll wrong him; there ain't lightning-rods enough on that house,\nand for one I'll never stir out of my tracks till I've done as I would be\ndone by, and told him so.  Stranger, my duty is accomplished; if the\nrecalcitrant and dephlogistic messenger of heaven strikes your--\"\n\"There, now, there,\" I said, \"put on the other eight--add five hundred\nfeet of spiral-twist--do anything and everything you want to do; but calm\nyour sufferings, and try to keep your feelings where you can reach them\nwith the dictionary.  Meanwhile, if we understand each other now, I will\ngo to work again.\"\n\nI think I have been sitting here a full hour this time, trying to get\nback to where I was when my train of thought was broken up by the last\ninterruption; but I believe I have accomplished it at last, and may\nventure to proceed again.]\n\n     wrestled with this great subject, and the greatest among them have\n     found it a worthy adversary, and one that always comes up fresh and\n     smiling after every throw.  The great Confucius said that he would\n     rather be a profound political economist than chief of police.\n     Cicero frequently said that political economy was the grandest\n     consummation that the human mind was capable of consuming; and even\n     our own Greeley had said vaguely but forcibly that \"Political--\n\n[Here the lightning-rod man sent up another call for me.  I went down in\na state of mind bordering on impatience.  He said he would rather have\ndied than interrupt me, but when he was employed to do a job, and that\njob was expected to be done in a clean, workmanlike manner, and when it\nwas finished and fatigue urged him to seek the rest and recreation he\nstood so much in need of, and he was about to do it, but looked up and\nsaw at a glance that all the calculations had been a little out, and if a\nthunder-storm were to come up, and that house, which he felt a personal\ninterest in, stood there with nothing on earth to protect it but sixteen\nlightning-rods--\"Let us have peace!\" I shrieked.  \"Put up a hundred and\nfifty!  Put some on the kitchen!  Put a dozen on the barn!  Put a couple\non the cow!  Put one on the cook!--scatter them all over the persecuted\nplace till it looks like a zinc-plated, spiral-twisted, silver-mounted\ncanebrake!  Move!  Use up all the material you can get your hands on, and\nwhen you run out of lightning-rods put up ramrods, cam-rods, stair-rods,\npiston-rods--anything that will pander to your dismal appetite for\nartificial scenery, and bring respite to my raging brain and healing to\nmy lacerated soul!\"  Wholly unmoved--further than to smile sweetly--this\niron being simply turned back his wrist-bands daintily, and said he would\nnow proceed to hump himself.  Well, all that was nearly three hours ago.\nIt is questionable whether I am calm enough yet to write on the noble\ntheme of political economy, but I cannot resist the desire to try, for it\nis the one subject that is nearest to my heart and dearest to my brain of\nall this world's philosophy.]\n\n     economy is heaven's best boon to man.\"  When the loose but gifted\n     Byron lay in his Venetian exile he observed that, if it could be\n     granted him to go back and live his misspent life over again, he\n     would give his lucid and unintoxicated intervals to the composition,\n     not of frivolous rhymes, but of essays upon political economy.\n     Washington loved this exquisite science; such names as Baker,\n     Beckwith, Judson, Smith, are imperishably linked with it; and even\n     imperial Homer, in the ninth book of the Iliad, has said:\n\n                    Fiat justitia, ruat coelum,\n                    Post mortem unum, ante bellum,\n                    Hic facet hoc, ex-parte res,\n                    Politicum e-conomico est.\n\n     The grandeur of these conceptions of the old poet, together with the\n     felicity of the wording which clothes them, and the sublimity of the\n     imagery whereby they are illustrated, have singled out that stanza,\n     and made it more celebrated than any that ever--\n\n[\"Now, not a word out of you--not a single word.  Just state your bill\nand relapse into impenetrable silence for ever and ever on these\npremises.  Nine hundred, dollars?  Is that all?  This check for the\namount will be honored at any respectable bank in America.  What is that\nmultitude of people gathered in the street for?  How?--'looking at the\nlightning-rods!'  Bless my life, did they never see any lightning-rods\nbefore?  Never saw 'such a stack of them on one establishment,' did I\nunderstand you to say?  I will step down and critically observe this\npopular ebullition of ignorance.\"]\n\nTHREE DAYS LATER.--We are all about worn out.  For four-and-twenty hours\nour bristling premises were the talk and wonder of the town.  The\ntheaters languished, for their happiest scenic inventions were tame and\ncommonplace compared with my lightning-rods.  Our street was blocked\nnight and day with spectators, and among them were many who came from\nthe country to see.  It was a blessed relief on the second day when a\nthunderstorm came up and the lightning began to \"go for\" my house, as the\nhistorian Josephus quaintly phrases it.  It cleared the galleries, so to\nspeak.  In five minutes there was not a spectator within half a mile of\nmy place; but all the high houses about that distance away were full,\nwindows, roof, and all.  And well they might be, for all the falling\nstars and Fourth-of-July fireworks of a generation, put together and\nrained down simultaneously out of heaven in one brilliant shower upon one\nhelpless roof, would not have any advantage of the pyrotechnic display\nthat was making my house so magnificently conspicuous in the general\ngloom of the storm.\n\nBy actual count, the lightning struck at my establishment seven\nhundred and sixty-four times in forty minutes, but tripped on one of\nthose faithful rods every time, and slid down the spiral-twist and shot\ninto the earth before it probably had time to be surprised at the way the\nthing was done. And through all that bombardment only one patch of slates\nwas ripped up, and that was because, for a single instant, the rods in\nthe vicinity were transporting all the lightning they could possibly\naccommodate.  Well, nothing was ever seen like it since the world began.\nFor one whole day and night not a member of my family stuck his head out\nof the window but he got the hair snatched off it as smooth as a\nbilliard-ball; and; if the reader will believe me, not one of us ever\ndreamt of stirring abroad.  But at last the awful siege came to an\nend-because there was absolutely no more electricity left in the clouds\nabove us within grappling distance of my insatiable rods.  Then I sallied\nforth, and gathered daring workmen together, and not a bite or a nap did\nwe take till the premises were utterly stripped of all their terrific\narmament except just three rods on the house, one on the kitchen, and one\non the barn--and, behold, these remain there even unto this day.  And\nthen, and not till then, the people ventured to use our street again.\nI will remark here, in passing, that during that fearful time I did not\ncontinue my essay upon political economy.  I am not even yet settled\nenough in nerve and brain to resume it.\n\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.--Parties having need of three thousand two\nhundred and eleven feet of best quality zinc-plated spiral-twist\nlightning-rod stuff, and sixteen hundred and thirty-one silver-tipped\npoints, all in tolerable repair (and, although much worn by use, still\nequal to any ordinary emergency), can hear of a bargains by addressing\nthe publisher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE JUMPING FROG [written about 1865]\n\nIN ENGLISH.  THEN IN FRENCH.  THEN CLAWED BACK INTO A CIVILIZED LANGUAGE\nONCE MORE BY PATIENT, UNREMUNERATED TOIL.\n\nEven a criminal is entitled to fair play; and certainly when a man who\nhas done no harm has been unjustly treated, he is privileged to do his\nbest to right himself.  My attention has just beep called to an article\nsome three years old in a French Magazine entitled, 'Revue des Deux\nMondes' (Review of Some Two Worlds), wherein the writer treats of \"Les\nHumoristes Americaines\" (These Humorist Americans).  I am one of these\nhumorists American dissected by him, and hence the complaint I am making.\n\nThis gentleman's article is an able one (as articles go, in the French,\nwhere they always tangle up everything to that degree that when you start\ninto a sentence you never know whether you are going to come out alive or\nnot).  It is a very good article and the writer says all manner of kind\nand complimentary things about me--for which I am sure thank him with all\nmy heart; but then why should he go and spoil all his praise by one\nunlucky experiment?  What I refer to is this: he says my jumping Frog is\na funny story, but still he can't see why it should ever really convulse\nany one with laughter--and straightway proceeds to translate it into\nFrench in order to prove to his nation that there is nothing so very\nextravagantly funny about it.  Just there is where my complaint\noriginates.  He has not translated it at all; he has simply mixed it all\nup; it is no more like the jumping Frog when he gets through with it than\nI am like a meridian of longitude.  But my mere assertion is not proof;\nwherefore I print the French version, that all may see that I do not\nspeak falsely; furthermore, in order that even the unlettered may know my\ninjury and give me their compassion, I have been at infinite pains and\ntrouble to retranslate this French version back into English; and to tell\nthe truth I have well-nigh worn myself out at it, having scarcely rested\nfrom my work during five days and nights.  I cannot speak the French\nlanguage, but I can translate very well, though not fast, I being\nself-educated.  I ask the reader to run his eye over the original English\nversion of the jumping Frog, and then read the French or my\nretranslation, and kindly take notice how the Frenchman has riddled the\ngrammar.  I think it is the worst I ever saw; and yet the French are\ncalled a polished nation.  If I had a boy that put sentences together as\nthey do, I would polish him to some purpose.  Without further\nintroduction, the jumping Frog, as I originally wrote it, was as follows\n[after it will be found the French version--(French version is deleted\nfrom this edition)--, and after the latter my retranslation from the\nFrench]\n\n\n\n\nTHE NOTORIOUS JUMPING FROG OF CALAVERAS COUNTY [Pronounced Cal-e-va-ras]\n\nIn compliance with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote me from the\nEast, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and inquired\nafter my friend's friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as requested to do, and I\nhereunto append the result.  I have a lurking suspicion that Leonidas W.\nSmiley is a myth that my friend never knew such a personage; and that he\non conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler about him, it would remind him\nof his infamous Jim Smiley, and he would go to work and bore me to death\nwith some exasperating reminiscence him as long and as tedious as it\nshould be useless to me.  If that was the design, it succeeded.\n\nI found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room stove of the\ndilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp Angel's, and I noticed that\nhe was fat and bald-headed, and had an expression of winning gentleness\nand simplicity upon his tranquil countenance.  He roused up, and gave me\ngood day.  I told him that a friend of mine had commissioned me to make\nsome inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood named Leonidas\nW. Smiley--Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, a young minister of the Gospel, who\nhe had heard was at one time resident of Angel's Camp.  I added that if\nMr. Wheeler could tell me anything about this Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley,\nI would feel under many obligations to him.\n\nSimon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his\nchair, and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which\nfollows this paragraph.  He never smiled he never frowned, he never\nchanged his voice from the gentle flowing key to which he tuned his\ninitial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of\nenthusiasm; but all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein\nof impressive earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainly that,\nso far from his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or funny\nabout his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired\nits two heroes as men of transcendent genius in 'finesse.'  I let him go\non in his own way, and never interrupted him once.\n\n\"Rev. Leonidas W.  H'm, Reverend Le--well, there was a feller here, once\nby the name of Jim Smiley, in the winter of '49--or maybe it was the\nspring of '50--I don't recollect exactly, somehow, though what makes me\nthink it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume warn't\nfinished when he first come to the camp; but anyway, he was the\ncuriousest man about always betting on anything that turned up you ever\nsee, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and if he couldn't\nhe'd change sides.  Any way that suited the other man would suit him any\nway just so's he got a bet, he was satisfied.  But still he was lucky,\nuncommon lucky; he most always come out winner.  He was always ready and\nlaying for a chance; there couldn't be no solit'ry thing mentioned but\nthat feller'd offer to bet on it, and take any side you please, as I was\njust telling you.  If there was a horse-race, you'd find him flush or\nyou'd find him busted at the end of it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd\nbet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a\nchicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a\nfence, he would bet you which one would fly first; or if there was a\ncamp-meeting, he would be there reg'lar to bet on Parson Walker, which he\njudged to be the best exhorter about here, and so he was too, and a good\nman.  If he even see a straddle-bug start to go anywheres, he would bet\nyou how long it would take him to get to--to wherever he was going to,\nand if you took him up, he would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but\nwhat he would find out where he was bound for and how long he was on the\nroad.  Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about\nhim.  Why, it never made no difference to him--he'd bet on any thing--the\ndangdest feller.  Parson Walker's wife laid very sick once, for a good\nwhile, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one morning\nhe come in, and Smiley up and asked him how she was, and he said she was\nconsiderable better--thank the Lord for his inf'nite mercy--and coming on\nso smart that with the blessing of Prov'dence she'd get well yet; and\nSmiley, before he thought, says, 'Well, I'll resk two-and-a-half she\ndon't anyway.'\n\n\"Thish-yer Smiley had a mare--the boys called her the fifteen-minute nag,\nbut that was only in fun, you know, because of course she was faster than\nthat--and he used to win money on that horse, for all she was so slow and\nalways had the asthma, or the distemper, or the consumption, or something\nof that kind.  They used to give her two or three hundred yards' start,\nand then pass her under way; but always at the fag end of the race she\nget excited and desperate like, and come cavorting and straddling up,\nand scattering her legs around limber, sometimes in the air, and\nsometimes out to one side among the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e dust\nand raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her\nnose--and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as near\nas you could cipher it down.\n\n\"And he had a little small bull-pup, that to look at him you'd think he\nwarn't worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay for a\nchance to steal something.  But as soon as money was up on him he was a\ndifferent dog; his under-jaw'd begin to stick out like the fo'castle of\na steamboat, and his teeth would uncover and shine like the furnaces.\nAnd a dog might tackle him and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him\nover his shoulder two or three times, and Andrew Jackson--which was the\nname of the pup--Andrew Jackson would never let on but what he was\nsatisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else--and the bets being doubled\nand doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up;\nand then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j'int\nof his hind leg and freeze to it--not chaw, you understand, but only just\ngrip and hang on till they throwed up the sponge, if it was a year.\nSmiley always come out winner on that pup, till he harnessed a dog once\nthat didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off in a\ncircular saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money\nwas all up, and he come to make a snatch for his pet holt, he see in a\nminute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other dog had him in the\ndoor, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter\ndiscouraged-like and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got\nshucked out bad.  He give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was\nbroke, and it was his fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind\nlegs for him to take holt of, which was his main dependence in a fight,\nand then he limped off a piece and laid down and died.  It was a good\npup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if\nhe'd lived, for the stuff was in him and he had genius--I know it,\nbecause he hadn't no opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to\nreason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under them\ncircumstances if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when\nI think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out.\n\n\"Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tomcats\nand all them kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't\nfetch nothing for him to bet on but he'd match you.  He ketched a frog\none day, and took him home, and said he cal'lated to educate him; and so\nhe never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn\nthat frog to jump. And you bet you he did learn him, too. He'd give him a\nlittle punch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog whirling in\nthe air like a doughnut--see him turn one summerset, or maybe a couple,\nif he got a good start, and come down flat-footed and all right, like a\ncat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching flies, and kep' him in\npractice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as fur as he could\nsee him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do\n'most anything--and I believe him.  Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster\ndown here on this floor--Dan'l Webster was the name of the frog--and sing\nout, 'Flies, Dan'l, flies!' and quicker'n you could wink he'd spring\nstraight up and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on the\nfloor ag'in as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of\nhis head with his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd\nbeen doin' any more'n any frog might do. You never see a frog so modest\nand straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted.  And when it\ncome to fair and square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more\nground at one straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see.\nJumping on a dead level was his strong suit, you understand; and when it\ncome to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he had a red.\nSmiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers\nthat had traveled and been everywheres all said he laid over any frog\nthat ever they see.\n\n\"Well, Smiley kep' the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to\nfetch him down-town sometimes and lay for a bet.  One day a feller\n--a stranger in the camp, he was--come acrost him with his box, and says:\n\n\"'What might it be that you've got in the box?'\n\n\"And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, 'It might be a parrot, or it\nmight be a canary, maybe, but it ain't--it's only just a frog.'\n\n\"And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round\nthis way and that, and says, 'H'm--so 'tis.  Well, what's HE good for.\n\n\"'Well,' Smiley says, easy and careless, 'he's good enough for one thing,\nI should judge--he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County.\n\n\"The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look,\nand give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate,  'Well,' he says,\n'I don't see no pints about that frog that's any better'n any other\nfrog.'\n\n\"'Maybe you don't,' Smiley says.  'Maybe you understand frogs and maybe\nyou don't understand 'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you\nain't only a amature, as it were.  Anyways, I've got my opinion, and I'll\nresk forty dollars the he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County.'\n\n\"And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad-like, 'Well,\nI'm only a, stranger here, and I ain't got no frog; but if I had a frog,\nI'd bet you.\n\n\"And then Smiley says, 'That's all right--that's all right if you'll hold\nmy box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog.'  Any so the feller took the\nbox, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley's, and set down to\nwait.\n\n\"So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to himself and then\nhe got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon and\nfilled him full of quail-shot-filled him pretty near up to his chin--and\nset him on the floor.  Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped around in\nthe mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him\nin, and give him to this feller and says:\n\n\"'Now, if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore paws\njust even with Dan'l's, and I'll give the word.' Then he says,\n'One-two-three--git' and him and the feller touches up the frogs from\nbehind, and the new frog hopped off lively but Dan'l give a heave, and\nhysted up his shoulders---so-like a Frenchman, but it warn't no use--he\ncouldn't budge; he was planted as solid as a church, and he couldn't no\nmore stir than if he was anchored out.  Smiley was a good deal surprised,\nand he was disgusted too, but he didn't have no idea what the matter was\nof course.\n\n\"The Teller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at\nthe door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder--so--at Dan'l, and\nsays again, very deliberate, 'Well,' he says, 'I don't see no pints about\nthat frog that's any better'n any other frog.'\n\n\"Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long\ntime, and at last he says, 'I do wonder what in the nation that frog\nthrow'd off for--I wonder if there ain't something the matter with him\n--he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow.'  And he ketched Dan'l by the\nnap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, 'Why blame my cats if he don't\nweigh five pound!' and turned him upside down and he belched out a double\nhandful of shot.  And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man\n--he set the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never\nketched him.  And--\"\n\n[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up\nto see what was wanted.]  And turning to me as he moved away, he said:\n\"Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy--I ain't going to be\ngone a second.\"\n\nBut, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of\nthe enterprising vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely to afford me much\ninformation concerning the Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and so I started\naway.\n\nAt the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholed me\nand recommenced:\n\n\"Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller one-eyed cow that didn't have no\ntail, only just a short stump like a bannanner, and--\"\n\nHowever, lacking both time and inclination, I did not wait to hear about\nthe afflicted cow, but took my leave.\n\n\nNow let the learned look upon this picture and say if iconoclasm can\nfurther go:\n\n[From the Revue des Deux Mondes, of July 15th, 1872.]\n\n          .......................\n\n\nTHE JUMPING FROG\n\n\"--Il y avait, une fois ici un individu connu sous le nom de Jim Smiley:\nc'etait dans l'hiver de 49, peut-etre bien au printemps de 50, je ne me\nreappelle pas exactement.  Ce qui me fait croire que c'etait l'un ou\nl'autre, c'est que je me souviens que le grand bief n'etait pas acheve\nlorsqu'il arriva au camp pour la premiere fois, mais de toutes facons il\netait l'homme le plus friand de paris qui se put voir, pariant sur tout\nce qui se presentaat, quand il pouvait trouver un adversaire, et, quand\nn'en trouvait pas il passait du cote oppose.  Tout ce qui convenaiat\nl'autre lui convenait; pourvu qu'il eut un pari, Smiley etait satisfait.\nEt il avait une chance! une chance inouie:  presque toujours il gagnait.\nIt faut dire qu'il etait toujours pret a'exposer, qu'on ne pouvait\nmentionner la moindre chose sans que ce gaillard offrit de parier\nla-dessus n'importe quoi et de prendre le cote que l'on voudrait, comme\nje vous le disais tout a l'heure.  S'il y avait des courses, vous le\ntrouviez riche ou ruine a la fin; s'il y avait un combat de chiens, il\napportait son enjeu; il l'apportait pour un combat de chats, pour un\ncombat de coqs;--parbleu! si vous aviez vu deux oiseaux sur une haie il\nvous aurait offert de parier lequel s'envolerait le premier, et s'il y\naviat 'meeting' au camp, il venait parier regulierement pour le cure\nWalker, qu'il jugeait etre le meilleur predicateur des environs, et qui\nl'etait en effet, et un brave homme.  Il aurai rencontre une punaise de\nbois en chemin, qu'il aurait parie sur le temps qu'il lui faudrait pour\naller ou elle voudrait aller, et si vous l'aviez pris au mot, it aurait\nsuivi la punaise jusqu'au Mexique, sans se soucier d'aller si loin, ni du\ntemps qu'il y perdrait.  Une fois la femme du cure Walker fut tres malade\npendant longtemps, il semblait qu'on ne la sauverait pas; mai un matin le\ncure arrive, et Smiley lui demande comment ella va et il dit qu'elle est\nbien mieux, grace a l'infinie misericorde tellement mieux qu'avec la\nbenediction de la Providence elle s'en tirerait, et voila que, sans y\npenser, Smiley repond:--Eh bien! ye gage deux et demi qu'elle mourra tout\nde meme.\n\n\"Ce Smiley avait une jument que les gars appelaient le bidet du quart\nd'heure, mais seulement pour plaisanter, vous comprenez, parse que, bien\nentendu, elle etait plus vite que ca!  Et il avait coutume de gagner de\nl'argent avec cette bete, quoi-qu'elle fut poussive, cornarde, toujours\nprise d'asthme, de colique ou de consomption, ou de quelque chose\nd'approchant. On lui donnait 2 ou 300 'yards' au depart, puffs on la\ndepassait sans peine; mais jamais a la fin elle ne manquait de\ns'echauffer, de s'exasperer et elle arrivait, s'ecartant, se defendant,\nses jambes greles en l'ai devant les obstacles, quelquefois les evitant\net faisant avec cela plus de poussiare qu'aucun cheval, plus de bruit\nsurtout avec ses eternumens et reniflemens.---crac! elle arrivaat donc\ntoujour premiere d'une tete, aussi juste qu'on peut le mesurer.  Et il\navait un petit bouledogue qui, a le voir, ne valait pas un sou; on aurait\ncru que parier contre lui c'etait voler, tant il etait ordinaire; mais\naussitot les enjeux faits, il devenait un autre chien.  Sa machoire\ninferieure commencait a ressortir comme un gaillard d'avant, ses dents se\ndecouvcraient brillantes commes des fournaises, et un chien pouvait le\ntaquiner, l'exciter, le mordre, le jeter deux ou trois fois par-dessus\nson epaule, Andre Jackson, c'etait le nom du chien, Andre Jackson prenait\ncela tranquillement, comme s'il ne se fut jamais attendu a autre chose,\net quand les paris etaient doubles et redoubles contre lui, il vous\nsaisissait l'autre chien juste a l'articulation de la jambe de derriere,\net il ne la lachait plus, non pas qu'il la machat, vous concevez, mais il\ns'y serait tenu pendu jusqu'a ce qu'on jetat l'eponge en l'air, fallut-il\nattendre un an.  Smiley gagnait toujours avec cette bete-la;\nmalheureusement ils ont fini par dresser un chien qui n'avait pas de\npattes de derriere, parce qu'on les avait sciees, et quand les choses\nfurent au point qu'il voulait, et qu'il en vint a se jeter sur son\nmorceau favori, le pauvre chien comprit en un instant qu'on s'etait moque\nde lui, et que l'autre le tenait.  Vous n'avez jamais vu personne avoir\nl'air plus penaud et plus decourage; il ne fit aucun effort pour gagner\nle combat et fut rudement secoue, de sorte que, regardant Smiley comme\npour lui dire:--Mon coeur est brise, c'est to faute; pourquoi m'avoir\nlivre a un chien qui n'a pas de pattes de derriere, puisque c'est par la\nque je les bats?--il s'en alla en clopinant, et se coucha pour mourir.\nAh! c'etait un bon chien, cet Andre Jackson, et il se serait fait un nom,\ns'il avait vecu, car il y avait de l'etoffe en lui, il avait du genie,\nje la sais, bien que de grandes occasions lui aient manque; mais il est\nimpossible de supposer qu'un chien capable de se battre comme lui,\ncertaines circonstances etant donnees, ait manque de talent.  Je me sens\ntriste toutes les fois que je pense a son dernier combat et au denoument\nqu'il a eu.  Eh bien! ce Smiley nourrissait des terriers a rats, et des\ncoqs combat, et des chats, et toute sorte de choses, au point qu'il etait\ntoujours en mesure de vous tenir tete, et qu'avec sa rage de paris on\nn'avait plus de repos. Il attrapa un jour une grenouille et l'emporta\nchez lui, disant qu'il pretendait faire son Education; vous me croirez si\nvous voulez, mais pendant trois mois il n'a rien fait que lui apprendre a\nsauter dans une cour retire de sa maison. Et je vous reponds qu'il avait\nreussi.  Il lui donnait un petit coup par derriere, et l'instant d'apres\nvous voyiez la grenouille tourner en l'air comme un beignet au-dessus de\nla poele, faire une culbute, quelquefois deux, lorsqu'elle etait bien\npartie, et retomber sur ses pattes comme un chat.  Il l'avait dressee\ndans l'art de gober des mouches, er l'y exercait continuellement, si bien\nqu'une mouche, du plus loin qu'elle apparaissait, etait une mouche\nperdue. Smiley avait coutume de dire que tout ce qui manquait a une\ngrenouille, c'etait l'education, qu'avec l'education elle pouvait faire\npresque tout, et je le crois.  Tenez, je l'ai vu poser Daniel Webster la\nsur se plancher,--Daniel Webster etait le nom de la grenouille,--et lui\nchanter: Des mouches! Daniel, des mouches!--En un clin d'oeil, Daniel\navait bondi et saisi une mouche ici sur le comptoir, puis saute de\nnouveau par terre, ou il restait vraiment a se gratter la tete avec sa\npatte de derriere, comme s'il n'avait pas eu la moindre idee de sa\nsuperiorite.  Jamais vous n'avez grenouille vu de aussi modeste, aussi\nnaturelle, douee comme elle l'etait!  Et quand il s'agissait de sauter\npurement et simplement sur terrain plat, elle faisait plus de chemin en\nun saut qu'aucune bete de son espece que vous puissiez connaitre. Sauter\na plat, c'etait son fort! Quand il s'agissait de cela, Smiley en tassait\nles enjeux sur elle tant qu'il lui, restait un rouge liard. Il faut le\nreconnaitre, Smiley etait monstrueusement fier de sa grenouille, et il en\navait le droit, car des gens qui avaient voyage, qui avaient tout vu,\ndisaient qu'on lui ferait injure de la comparer a une autre; de facon que\nSmiley gardait Daniel dans une petite boite a claire-voie qu'il emportait\nparfois a la Ville pour quelque pari.\n\n\"Un jour, un individu etranger au camp l'arrete aver sa boite et lui\ndit:--Qu'est-ce que vous avez donc serre la dedans?\n\n\"Smiley dit d'un air indifferent:--Cela pourrait etre un perroquet ou un\nserin, mais ce n'est rien de pareil, ce n'est qu'une grenouille.\n\n\"L'individu la prend, la regarde avec soin, la tourne d'un cote et de\nl'autre puis il dit.--Tiens! en effet!  A quoi estelle bonne?\n\n\"--Mon Dieu! repond Smiley, toujours d'un air degage, elle est bonne pour\nune chose a mon avis, elle peut battre en sautant toute grenouille du\ncomte de Calaveras.\n\n\"L'individu reprend la boite, l'examine de nouveau longuement, et la rend\na Smiley en disant d'un air delibere:--Eh bien! je ne vois pas que cette\ngrenouille ait rien de mieux qu'aucune grenouille.\n\n\"--Possible qua vous ne le voyiez pat, dit Smiley, possible que vous vous\nentendiez en grenouilles, possible que vous ne vous y entendez point,\npossible qua vous avez de l'experience, et possible que vous ne soyez\nqu'un amateur.  De toute maniere, je parie quarante dollars qu'elle\nbattra en sautant n'importe quelle grenouille du comte de Calaveras.\n\n\"L'individu reflechit one seconde et dit comma attriste:--Je ne suis\nqu'un etranger ici, je n'ai pas de grenouille; mais, si j'en\navais une, je tiendrais le pari.\n\n\"--Fort bien! repond Smiley.  Rien de plus facile. Si vous voulez tenir\nma boite one minute, j'irai vous chercher une grenouille.--Voile donc\nl'individu qui garde la boite, qui met ses quarante dollars sur ceux de\nSmiley et qui attend.  Il attend assez longtemps, reflechissant tout\nseul, et figurez-vous qu'il prend Daniel, lui ouvre la bouche de force at\navec une cuiller a the l'emplit de menu plomb de chasse, mail l'emplit\njusqu'au menton, puis il le pose par terre.  Smiley pendant ce temps\netait a barboter dans une mare.  Finalement il attrape une grenouille,\nl'apporte cet individu et dit:--Maintenant, si vous etes pret, mettez-la\ntout contra Daniel, avec leurs pattes de devant sur la meme ligne, et je\ndonnerai le signal; puis il ajoute:--Un, deux, trois, sautez!\n\n\"Lui et l'individu touchent leurs grenouilles par derriere, et la\ngrenouille neuve se met h sautiller, mais Daniel se souleve lourdement,\nhausse les epaules ainsi, comma un Francais; a quoi bon? il ne pouvait\nbouger, il etait plante solide comma une enclume, il n'avancait pas plus\nque si on l'eut mis a l'ancre. Smiley fut surpris et degoute, mais il ne\nse doutait pas du tour, bien entendu.  L'individu empoche l'argent, s'en\nva, et en s'en allant est-ce qu'il ne donna pas un coup de pouce\npardessus l'epaule, comma ca, au pauvre Daniel, en disant de son air\ndelibere:--Eh bien! je ne vois pas qua cette grenouille ait rien de muiex\nqu'une autre.\n\n\"Smiley se gratta longtemps la tete, les yeux fixes Sur Daniel; jusqu'a\nce qu'enfin il dit:--je me demande comment diable il se fait qua cette\nbite ait refuse, . . . Est-ce qu'elle aurait quelque chose? . . . On\ncroirait qu'elle est enflee.\n\n\"Il empoigne Daniel par la peau du coo, le souleve et dit:--Le loup me\ncroque, s'il ne pese pas cinq livres.\n\n\"Il le retourne, et le malheureux crache deux poignees de plomb.  Quand\nSmiley reconnut ce qui en etait, il fut comme fou.  Vous le voyez d'ici\nposer sa grenouille par terra et courir apres cet individu, mais il ne le\nrattrapa jamais, et ....\"\n\n\n\n[Translation of the above back from the French:]\n\nTHE FROG JUMPING OF THE COUNTY OF CALAVERAS\n\nIt there was one time here an individual known under the name of Jim\nSmiley; it was in the winter of '89, possibly well at the spring of '50,\nI no me recollect not exactly.  This which me makes to believe that it\nwas the one or the other, it is that I shall remember that the grand\nflume is not achieved when he arrives at the camp for the first time, but\nof all sides he was the man the most fond of to bet which one have seen,\nbetting upon all that which is presented, when he could find an\nadversary; and when he not of it could not, he passed to the side\nopposed.  All that which convenienced to the other to him convenienced\nalso; seeing that he had a bet Smiley was satisfied.  And he had a\nchance! a chance even worthless; nearly always he gained.  It must to say\nthat he was always near to himself expose, but one no could mention the\nleast thing without that this gaillard offered to bet the bottom, no\nmatter what, and to take the side that one him would, as I you it said\nall at the hour (tout a l'heure).  If it there was of races, you him find\nrich or ruined at the end; if it, here is a combat of dogs, he bring his\nbet; he himself laid always for a combat of cats, for a combat of cocks\n--by-blue!  If you have see two birds upon a fence, he you should have\noffered of to bet which of those birds shall fly the first; and if there\nis meeting at the camp (meeting au camp) he comes to bet regularly for\nthe cure Walker, which he judged to be the best predicator of the\nneighborhood (predicateur des environs) and which he was in effect, and a\nbrave man.  He would encounter a bug of wood in the road, whom he will\nbet upon the time which he shall take to go where she would go--and if\nyou him have take at the word, he will follow the bug as far as Mexique,\nwithout himself caring to go so far; neither of the time which he there\nlost.  One time the woman of the cure Walker is very sick during long\ntime, it seemed that one not her saved not; but one morning the cure\narrives, and Smiley him demanded how she goes, and he said that she is\nwell better, grace to the infinite misery (lui demande comment elle va,\net il dit qu'elle est bien mieux, grace a l'infinie misericorde) so much\nbetter that with the benediction of the Providence she herself of it\nwould pull out (elle s'en tirerait); and behold that without there\nthinking Smiley responds: \"Well, I gage two-and-half that she will die\nall of same.\"\n\nThis Smiley had an animal which the boys called the nag of the quarter of\nhour, but solely for pleasantry, you comprehend, because, well\nunderstand, she was more fast as that! [Now why that exclamation?--M. T.]\nAnd it was custom of to gain of the silver with this beast,\nnotwithstanding she was poussive, cornarde, always taken of asthma, of\ncolics or of consumption, or something of approaching.  One him would\ngive two or three hundred yards at the departure, then one him passed\nwithout pain; but never at the last she not fail of herself echauffer,\nof herself exasperate, and she arrives herself ecartant, se defendant,\nher legs greles in the air before the obstacles, sometimes them elevating\nand making with this more of dust than any horse, more of noise above\nwith his eternumens and reniflemens--crac! she arrives then always first\nby one head, as just as one can it measure.  And he had a small bulldog\n(bouledogue!) who, to him see, no value, not a cent; one would believe\nthat to bet against him it was to steal, so much he was ordinary; but as\nsoon as the game made, she becomes another dog.  Her jaw inferior\ncommence to project like a deck of before, his teeth themselves discover\nbrilliant like some furnaces, and a dog could him tackle (le taquiner),\nhim excite, him murder (le mordre), him throw two or three times over his\nshoulder, Andre Jackson--this was the name of the dog--Andre Jackson\ntakes that tranquilly, as if he not himself was never expecting other\nthing, and when the bets were doubled and redoubled against him, he you\nseize the other dog just at the articulation of the leg of behind, and he\nnot it leave more, not that he it masticate, you conceive, but he himself\nthere shall be holding during until that one throws the sponge in the\nair, must he wait a year.  Smiley gained always with this beast-la;\nunhappily they have finished by elevating a dog who no had not of feet of\nbehind, because one them had sawed; and when things were at the point\nthat he would, and that he came to himself throw upon his morsel\nfavorite, the poor dog comprehended in an instant that he himself was\ndeceived in him, and that the other dog him had.  You no have never seen\nperson having the air more penaud and more discouraged; he not made no\neffort to gain the combat, and was rudely shucked.\n\nEh bien! this Smiley nourished some terriers a rats, and some cocks of\ncombat, and some pats, and all sorts of things; and with his rage of\nbetting one no had more of repose.  He trapped one day a frog and him\nimported with him (et l'emporta chez lui) saying that he pretended to\nmake his education.  You me believe if you will, but during three months\nhe not has nothing done but to him apprehend to jump (apprendre a sauter)\nin a court retired of her mansion (de sa maison).  And I you respond that\nhe have succeeded.  He him gives a small blow by behind, and the instant\nafter you shall see the frog turn in the air like a grease-biscuit, make\none summersault, sometimes two, when she was well started, and refall\nupon his feet like a cat.  He him had accomplished in the art of to\ngobble the flies (gober des mouches), and him there exercised continually\n--so well that a fly at the most far that she appeared was a fly lost.\nSmiley had custom to say that all which lacked to a frog it was the\neducation, but with the education she could do nearly all--and I him\nbelieve.  Tenez, I him have seen pose Daniel Webster there upon this\nplank--Daniel Webster was the name of the frog--and to him sing, \"Some\nflies, Daniel, some fifes!\"--in a flash of the eye Daniel 30\nhad bounded and seized a fly here upon the counter, then jumped anew at\nthe earth, where he rested truly to himself scratch the head with his\nbehind foot, as if he no had not the least idea of his superiority.\nNever you not have seen frog as modest, as natural, sweet as she was.\nAnd when he himself agitated to jump purely and simply upon plain earth,\nshe does more ground in one jump than any beast of his species than you\ncan know.  To jump plain-this was his strong.  When he himself agitated\nfor that, Smiley multiplied the bets upon her as long as there to him\nremained a red.  It must to know, Smiley was monstrously proud of his\nfrog, and he of it was right, for some men who were traveled, who had all\nseen, said that they to him would be injurious to him compare, to another\nfrog.  Smiley guarded Daniel in a little box latticed which he carried\nbytimes to the village for some bet.\n\nOne day an individual stranger at the camp him arrested with his box and\nhim said:\n\n\"What is this that you have them shut up there within?\"\n\nSmiley said, with an air indifferent:\n\n\"That could be a paroquet, or a syringe (ou un serin), but this no is\nnothing of such, it not is but a frog.\"\n\nThe individual it took, it regarded with care, it turned from one side\nand from the other, then he said:\n\n\"Tiens! in effect!--At what is she good?\"\n\n\"My God!\" respond Smiley, always with an air disengaged, \"she is good for\none thing, to my notice (A mon avis), she can better in jumping (elle pent\nbattre en sautant) all frogs of the county of Calaveras.\"\n\nThe individual retook the box, it examined of new longly, and it rendered\nto Smiley in saying with an air deliberate:\n\n\"Eh bien! I no saw not that that frog had nothing of better than each\nfrog.\"  (Je ne vois pas que cette grenouille ait rien de mieux qu'aucune\ngrenouille.) [If that isn't grammar gone to seed, then I count myself no\njudge.--M.  T.]\n\n\"Possible that you not it saw not,\" said Smiley, \"possible that you--you\ncomprehend frogs; possible that you not you there comprehend nothing;\npossible that you had of the experience, and possible that you not be but\nan amateur.  Of all manner (De toute maniere) I bet forty dollars that\nshe better in jumping no matter which frog of the county of Calaveras.\"\n\nThe individual reflected a second, and said like sad:\n\n\"I not am but a stranger here, I no have not a frog; but if I of it had\none, I would embrace the bet.\"\n\n\"Strong well!\" respond Smiley; \"nothing of more facility.  If you will\nhold my box a minute, I go you to search a frog (j'irai vous chercher).\"\n\nBehold, then, the individual, who guards the box, who puts his forty\ndollars upon those of Smiley, and who attends (et qui attend).  He\nattended enough long times, reflecting all solely.  And figure you that\nhe takes Daniel, him opens the mouth by force and with a teaspoon him\nfills with shot of the hunt, even him fills just to the chin, then he him\nputs by the earth.  Smiley during these times was at slopping in a swamp.\nFinally he trapped (attrape) a frog, him carried to that individual, and\nsaid:\n\n\"Now if you be ready, put him all against Daniel with their before feet\nupon the same line, and I give the signal\"--then he added: \"One, two,\nthree--advance!\"\n\nHim and the individual touched their frogs by behind, and the frog new\nput to jump smartly, but Daniel himself lifted ponderously, exalted the\nshoulders thus, like a Frenchman--to what good? he not could budge, he\nis planted solid like a church he not advance no more than if one him had\nput at the anchor.\n\nSmiley was surprised and disgusted, but he no himself doubted not of the\nturn being intended (mais il ne se doutait pas du tour, bien entendu).\nThe individual empocketed the silver, himself with it went, and of it\nhimself in going is it that he no gives not a jerk of thumb over the\nshoulder--like that--at the poor Daniel, in saying with his air\ndeliberate--(L'individu empoche l'argent, s'en va et en s'en allant\nest-ce qu'il ne donne pas un coup d pouce par-dessus l'epaule, comme ga,\nau pauvre Daniel, en disant de son air delibere):\n\n\"Eh bien! I no see not that that frog has nothin of better than another.\"\n\nSmiley himself scratched longtimes the head, the eyes fixed upon Daniel,\nuntil that which at last he said:\n\n\"I me demand how the devil it makes itself that this beast has refused.\nIs it that she had something?  One would believe that she is stuffed.\"\n\nHe grasped Daniel by the skin of the neck, him lifted and said:\n\n\"The wolf me bite if he no weigh not five pounds:\"\n\nHe him reversed and the unhappy belched two handfuls of shot (et le\nmalheureux, etc.).  When Smiley recognized how it was, he was like mad.\nHe deposited his frog by the earth and ran after that individual, but he\nnot him caught never.\n\n\nSuch is the jumping Frog, to the distorted French eye.  I claim that I\nnever put together such an odious mixture of bad grammar and delirium\ntremens in my life.  And what has a poor foreigner like me done, to be\nabused and misrepresented like this?  When I say, \"Well, I don't see no\npints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog,\" is it kind,\nis it just, for this Frenchman to try to make it appear that I said, \"Eh\nbien! I no saw not that that frog had nothing of better than each frog\"?\nI have no heart to write more.  I never felt so about anything before.\n\nHARTFORD, March, 1875.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJOURNALISM IN TENNESSEE--[Written about 1871.]\n\n     The editor of the Memphis Avalanche swoops thus mildly down upon a\n     correspondent who posted him as a Radical:--\"While he was writing\n     the first word, the middle, dotting his i's, crossing his t's, and\n     punching his period, he knew he was concocting a sentence that was\n     saturated with infamy and reeking with falsehood.\"--Exchange.\n\nI was told by the physician that a Southern climate would improve my\nhealth, and so I went down to Tennessee, and got a berth on the Morning\nGlory and Johnson County War-Whoop as associate editor.  When I went on\nduty I found the chief editor sitting tilted back in a three-legged chair\nwith his feet on a pine table.  There was another pine table in the room\nand another afflicted chair, and both were half buried under newspapers\nand scraps and sheets of manuscript.  There was a wooden box of sand,\nsprinkled with cigar stubs and \"old soldiers,\" and a stove with a door\nhanging by its upper hinge.  The chief editor had a long-tailed black\ncloth frock-coat on, and white linen pants.  His boots were small and\nneatly blacked.  He wore a ruffled shirt, a large seal-ring, a standing\ncollar of obsolete pattern, and a checkered neckerchief with the ends\nhanging down.  Date of costume about 1848.  He was smoking a cigar, and\ntrying to think of a word, and in pawing his hair he had rumpled his\nlocks a good deal.  He was scowling fearfully, and I judged that he was\nconcocting a particularly knotty editorial.  He told me to take the\nexchanges and skim through them and write up the \"Spirit of the Tennessee\nPress,\" condensing into the article all of their contents that seemed of\ninterest.\n\nI wrote as follows:\n\n                    SPIRIT OF THE TENNESSEE PRESS\n\n     The editors of the Semi-Weekly Earthquake evidently labor under a\n     misapprehension with regard to the Dallyhack railroad.  It is not\n     the object of the company to leave Buzzardville off to one side.\n     On the contrary, they consider it one of the most important points\n     along the line, and consequently can have no desire to slight it.\n     The gentlemen of the Earthquake will, of course, take pleasure in\n     making the correction.\n\n     John W. Blossom, Esq., the able editor of the Higginsville\n     Thunderbolt and Battle Cry of Freedom, arrived in the city\n     yesterday.  He is stopping at the Van Buren House.\n\n     We observe that our contemporary of the Mud Springs Morning Howl has\n     fallen into the error of supposing that the election of Van Werter\n     is not an established fact, but he will have discovered his mistake\n     before this reminder reaches him, no doubt.  He was doubtless misled\n     by incomplete election returns.\n\n     It is pleasant to note that the city of Blathersville is endeavoring\n     to contract with some New York gentlemen to pave its well-nigh\n     impassable streets with the Nicholson pavement.  The Daily Hurrah\n     urges the measure with ability, and seems confident of ultimate\n     success.\n\nI passed my manuscript over to the chief editor for acceptance,\nalteration, or destruction.  He glanced at it and his face clouded.  He\nran his eye down the pages, and his countenance grew portentous.  It was\neasy to see that something was wrong.  Presently he sprang up and said:\n\n\"Thunder and lightning! Do you suppose I am going to speak of those\ncattle that way?  Do you suppose my subscribers are going to stand such\ngruel as that?  Give me the pen!\"\n\nI never saw a pen scrape and scratch its way so viciously, or plow\nthrough another man's verbs and adjectives so relentlessly.  While he was\nin the midst of his work, somebody shot at him through the open window,\nand marred the symmetry of my ear.\n\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"that is that scoundrel Smith, of the Moral Volcano--he\nwas due yesterday.\"  And he snatched a navy revolver from his belt and\nfired--Smith dropped, shot in the thigh.  The shot spoiled Smith's aim,\nwho was just taking a second chance and he crippled a stranger.  It was\nme.  Merely a finger shot off.\n\nThen the chief editor went on with his erasure; and interlineations.\nJust as he finished them a hand grenade came down the stove-pipe, and the\nexplosion shivered the stove into a thousand fragments.  However, it did\nno further damage, except that a vagrant piece knocked a couple of my\nteeth out.\n\n\"That stove is utterly ruined,\" said the chief editor.\n\nI said I believed it was.\n\n\"Well, no matter--don't want it this kind of weather.  I know the man\nthat did it.  I'll get him.  Now, here is the way this stuff ought to be\nwritten.\"\n\nI took the manuscript.  It was scarred with erasures and interlineations\ntill its mother wouldn't have known it if it had had one.  It now read as\nfollows:\n\n                    SPIRIT OF THE TENNESSEE PRESS\n\n     The inveterate liars of the Semi-Weekly Earthquake are evidently\n     endeavoring to palm off upon a noble and chivalrous people another\n     of their vile and brutal falsehoods with regard to that most\n     glorious conception of the nineteenth century, the Ballyhack\n     railroad.  The idea that Buzzardville was to be left off at one side\n     originated in their own fulsome brains--or rather in the settlings\n     which they regard as brains.  They had better, swallow this lie if\n     they want to save their abandoned reptile carcasses the cowhiding\n     they so richly deserve.\n\n     That ass, Blossom, of the Higginsville Thunderbolt and Battle Cry of\n     Freedom, is down here again sponging at the Van Buren.\n\n     We observe that the besotted blackguard of the Mud Springs Morning\n     Howl is giving out, with his usual propensity for lying, that Van\n     Werter is not elected.  The heaven-born mission of journalism is to\n     disseminate truth; to eradicate error; to educate, refine, and\n     elevate the tone of public morals and manners, and make all men more\n     gentle, more virtuous, more charitable, and in all ways better, and\n     holier, and happier; and yet this blackhearted scoundrel degrades\n     his great office persistently to the dissemination of falsehood,\n     calumny, vituperation, and vulgarity.\n\n     Blathersville wants a Nicholson pavement--it wants a jail and a\n     poorhouse more.  The idea of a pavement in a one-horse town composed\n     of two gin-mills, a blacksmith shop, and that mustard-plaster of a\n     newspaper, the Daily Hurrah!  The crawling insect, Buckner, who\n     edits the Hurrah, is braying about his business with his customary\n     imbecility, and imagining that he is talking sense.\n\n\n\"Now that is the way to write--peppery and to the point.  Mush-and-milk\njournalism gives me the fan-tods.\"\n\nAbout this time a brick came through the window with a splintering crash,\nand gave me a considerable of a jolt in the back.  I moved out of range\n--I began to feel in the way.\n\nThe chief said, \"That was the Colonel, likely.  I've been expecting him\nfor two days.  He will be up now right away.\"\n\nHe was correct.  The Colonel appeared in the door a moment afterward with\na dragoon revolver in his hand.\n\nHe said, \"Sir, have I the honor of addressing the poltroon who edits this\nmangy sheet?\"\n\n\"You have.  Be seated, sir.  Be careful of the chair, one of its legs is\ngone.  I believe I have the honor of addressing the putrid liar, Colonel\nBlatherskite Tecumseh?\"\n\n\"Right, Sir.  I have a little account to settle with you.  If you are at\nleisure we will begin.\"\n\n\"I have an article on the 'Encouraging Progress of Moral and Intellectual\nDevelopment in America' to finish, but there is no hurry.  Begin.\"\n\nBoth pistols rang out their fierce clamor at the same instant.  The chief\nlost a lock of his hair, and the Colonel's bullet ended its career in the\nfleshy part of my thigh.  The Colonel's left shoulder was clipped a\nlittle.  They fired again.  Both missed their men this time, but I got my\nshare, a shot in the arm.  At the third fire both gentlemen were wounded\nslightly, and I had a knuckle chipped.  I then said, I believed I would\ngo out and take a walk, as this was a private matter, and I had a\ndelicacy about participating in it further.  But both gentlemen begged me\nto keep my seat, and assured me that I was not in the way.\n\nThey then talked about the elections and the crops while they reloaded,\nand I fell to tying up my wounds.  But presently they opened fire again\nwith animation, and every shot took effect--but it is proper to remark\nthat five out of the six fell to my share.  The sixth one mortally\nwounded the Colonel, who remarked, with fine humor, that he would have to\nsay good morning now, as he had business uptown.  He then inquired the\nway to the undertaker's and left.\n\nThe chief turned to me and said, \"I am expecting company to dinner, and\nshall have to get ready.  It will be a favor to me if you will read proof\nand attend to the customers.\"\n\nI winced a little at the idea of attending to the customers, but I was\ntoo bewildered by the fusillade that was still ringing in my ears to\nthink of anything to say.\n\nHe continued, \"Jones will be here at three--cowhide him.  Gillespie will\ncall earlier, perhaps--throw him out of the window.  Ferguson will be\nalong about four--kill him.  That is all for today, I believe.  If you\nhave any odd time, you may write a blistering article on the police--give\nthe chief inspector rats.  The cowhides are under the table; weapons in\nthe drawer--ammunition there in the corner--lint and bandages up there in\nthe pigeonholes.  In case of accident, go to Lancet, the surgeon,\ndownstairs.  He advertises--we take it out in trade.\"\n\nHe was gone.  I shuddered.  At the end of the next three hours I had been\nthrough perils so awful that all peace of mind and all cheerfulness were\ngone from me.  Gillespie had called and thrown me out of the window.\nJones arrived promptly, and when I got ready to do the cowhiding he took\nthe job off my hands.  In an encounter with a stranger, not in the bill\nof fare, I had lost my scalp.  Another stranger, by the name of Thompson,\nleft me a mere wreck and ruin of chaotic rags.  And at last, at bay in\nthe corner, and beset by an infuriated mob of editors, blacklegs,\npoliticians, and desperadoes, who raved and swore and flourished their\nweapons about my head till the air shimmered with glancing flashes of\nsteel, I was in the act of resigning my berth on the paper when the chief\narrived, and with him a rabble of charmed and enthusiastic friends.  Then\nensued a scene of riot and carnage such as no human pen, or steel one\neither, could describe.  People were shot, probed, dismembered, blown up,\nthrown out of the window.  There was a brief tornado of murky blasphemy,\nwith a confused and frantic war-dance glimmering through it, and then all\nwas over.  In five minutes there was silence, and the gory chief and I\nsat alone and surveyed the sanguinary ruin that strewed the floor around\nus.\n\nHe said, \"You'll like this place when you get used to it.\"\n\nI said, \"I'll have to get you to excuse me; I think maybe I might write\nto suit you after a while; as soon as I had had some practice and learned\nthe language I am confident I could.  But, to speak the plain truth, that\nsort of energy of expression has its inconveniences, and a, man is liable\nto interruption.\n\n\"You see that yourself.  Vigorous writing is calculated to elevate the\npublic, no doubt, but then I do not like to attract so much attention as\nit calls forth.  I can't write with comfort when I am interrupted so much\nas I have been to-day.  I like this berth well enough, but I don't like\nto be left here to wait on the customers.  The experiences are novel,\nI grant you, and entertaining, too, after a fashion, but they are not\njudiciously distributed.  A gentleman shoots at you through the window\nand cripples me; a bombshell comes down the stovepipe for your\ngratification and sends the stove door down my throat; a friend drops in\nto swap compliments with you, and freckles me with bullet-holes till my\nskin won't hold my principles; you go to dinner, and Jones comes with his\ncowhide, Gillespie throws me out of the window, Thompson tears all my\nclothes off, and an entire stranger takes my scalp with the easy freedom\nof an old acquaintance; and in less than five minutes all the blackguards\nin the country arrive in their war-paint, and proceed to scare the rest\nof me to death with their tomahawks.  Take it altogether, I never had\nsuch a spirited time in all my life as I have had to-day.  No; I like\nyou, and I like your calm unruffled way of explaining things to the\ncustomers, but you see I am not used to it.  The Southern heart is too\nimpulsive; Southern hospitality is too lavish with the stranger.  The\nparagraphs which I have written to-day, and into whose cold sentences\nyour masterly hand has infused the fervent spirit of Tennesseean\njournalism, will wake up another nest of hornets.  All that mob of\neditors will come--and they will come hungry, too, and want somebody for\nbreakfast.  I shall have to bid you adieu.  I decline to be present at\nthese festivities.  I came South for my health, I will go back on the\nsame errand, and suddenly.  Tennesseean journalism is too stirring for\nme.\"\n\nAfter which we parted with mutual regret, and I took apartments at the\nhospital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STORY OF THE BAD LITTLE BOY--[Written about 1865]\n\nOnce there was a bad little boy whose name was Jim--though, if you will\nnotice, you will find that bad little boys are nearly always called James\nin your Sunday-school books.  It was strange, but still it was true, that\nthis one was called Jim.\n\nHe didn't have any sick mother, either--a sick mother who was pious and\nhad the consumption, and would be glad to lie down in the grave and be at\nrest but for the strong love she bore her boy, and the anxiety she felt\nthat the world might be harsh and cold toward him when she was gone.\nMost bad boys in the Sunday books are named James, and have sick mothers,\nwho teach them to say, \"Now, I lay me down,\" etc., and sing them to sleep\nwith sweet, plaintive voices, and then kiss them good night, and kneel\ndown by the bedside and weep.  But it was different with this fellow.\nHe was named Jim, and there wasn't anything the matter with his mother\n--no consumption, nor anything of that kind.  She was rather stout than\notherwise, and she was not pious; moreover, she was not anxious on Jim's\naccount.  She said if he were to break his neck it wouldn't be much loss.\nShe always spanked Jim to sleep, and she never kissed him good night; on\nthe contrary, she boxed his ears when she was ready to leave him.\n\nOnce this little bad boy stole the key of the pantry, and slipped in\nthere and helped himself to some jam, and filled up the vessel with tar,\nso that his mother would never know the difference; but all at once a\nterrible feeling didn't come over him, and something didn't seem to\nwhisper to him, \"Is it right to disobey my mother?  Isn't it sinful to do\nthis?  Where do bad little boys go who gobble up their good kind mother's\njam?\" and then he didn't kneel down all alone and promise never to be\nwicked any more, and rise up with a light, happy heart, and go and tell\nhis mother all about it, and beg her forgiveness, and be blessed by her\nwith tears of pride and thankfulness in her eyes.  No; that is the way\nwith all other bad boys in the books; but it happened otherwise with this\nJim, strangely enough.  He ate that jam, and said it was bully, in his\nsinful, vulgar way; and he put in the tar, and said that was bully also,\nand laughed, and observed \"that the old woman would get up and snort\"\nwhen she found it out; and when she did find it out, he denied knowing\nanything about it, and she whipped him severely, and he did the crying\nhimself.  Everything about this boy was curious--everything turned out\ndifferently with him from the way it does to the bad Jameses in the\nbooks.\n\nOnce he climbed up in Farmer Acorn's apple tree to steal apples, and the\nlimb didn't break, and he didn't fall and break his arm, and get torn by\nthe farmer's great dog, and then languish on a sickbed for weeks, and\nrepent and become good.  Oh, no; he stole as many apples as he wanted and\ncame down all right; and he was all ready for the dog, too, and knocked\nhim endways with a brick when he came to tear him.  It was very strange\n--nothing like it ever happened in those mild little books with marbled\nbacks, and with pictures in them of men with swallow-tailed coats and\nbell-crowned hats, and pantaloons that are short in the legs, and women\nwith the waists of their dresses under their arms, and no hoops on.\nNothing like it in any of the Sunday-school books.\n\nOnce he stole the teacher's penknife, and, when he was afraid it would be\nfound out and he would get whipped, he slipped it into George Wilson's\ncap poor Widow Wilson's son, the moral boy, the good little boy of the\nvillage, who always obeyed his mother, and never told an untruth, and was\nfond of his lessons, and infatuated with Sunday-school.  And when the\nknife dropped from the cap, and poor George hung his head and blushed,\nas if in conscious guilt, and the grieved teacher charged the theft upon\nhim, and was just in the very act of bringing the switch down upon his\ntrembling shoulders, a white-haired, improbable justice of the peace did\nnot suddenly appear in their midst, and strike an attitude and say,\n\"Spare this noble boy--there stands the cowering culprit!  I was passing\nthe school door at recess, and, unseen myself, I saw the theft\ncommitted!\"  And then Jim didn't get whaled, and the venerable justice\ndidn't read the tearful school a homily, and take George by the hand and\nsay such boy deserved to be exalted, and then tell him come and make his\nhome with him, and sweep out the office, and make fires, and run errands,\nand chop wood, and study law, and help his wife do household labors, and\nhave all the balance of the time to play and get forty cents a month, and\nbe happy.  No it would have happened that way in the books, but didn't\nhappen that way to Jim.  No meddling old clam of a justice dropped in to\nmake trouble, and so the model boy George got thrashed, and Jim was glad\nof it because, you know, Jim hated moral boys.  Jim said he was \"down on\nthem milksops.\"  Such was the coarse language of this bad, neglected boy.\n\nBut the strangest thing that ever happened to Jim was the time he went\nboating on Sunday, and didn't get drowned, and that other time that he\ngot caught out in the storm when he was fishing on Sunday and didn't get\nstruck by lightning.  Why, you might look, and look, all through the\nSunday-school books from now till next Christmas, and you would never\ncome across anything like this.  Oh, no; you would find that all the bad\nboys who go boating on Sunday invariably get drowned; and all the bad\nboys who get caught out in storms when they are fishing on Sunday\ninfallibly get struck by lightning.  Boats with bad boys in them always\nupset on Sunday, and it always storms when bad boys go fishing on the\nSabbath.  How this Jim ever escaped is a  mystery to me.\n\nThis Jim bore a charmed life--that must have been the way of it.  Nothing\ncould hurt him.  He even gave the elephant in the menagerie a plug of\ntobacco, and the elephant didn't knock the top of his head off with his\ntrunk.  He browsed around the cupboard after essence-of peppermint, and\ndidn't make a mistake and drink aqua fortis.  He stole his father's gun\nand went hunting on the Sabbath, and didn't shoot three or four of his\nfingers off.  He struck his little sister on the temple with his fist\nwhen he was angry, and she didn't linger in pain through long summer\ndays, and die with sweet words of forgiveness upon her lips that\nredoubled the anguish of his breaking heart.  No; she got over it.  He\nran off and went to sea at last, and didn't come back and find himself\nsad and alone in the world, his loved ones sleeping in the quiet\nchurchyard, and the vine-embowered home of his boyhood tumbled down and\ngone to decay.  Ah, no; he came home as drunk as a piper, and got into\nthe station-house the first thing.\n\nAnd he grew up and married, and raised a large family, and brained them\nall with an ax one night, and got wealthy by all manner of cheating and\nrascality; and now he is the infernalest wickedest scoundrel in his\nnative village, and is universally respected, and belongs to the\nlegislature.\n\nSo you see there never was a bad James in the Sunday-school books that\nhad such a streak of luck as this sinful Jim with the charmed life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STORY OF THE GOOD LITTLE BOY--[Written about 1865]\n\nOnce there was a good little boy by the name of Jacob Blivens.  He always\nobeyed his parents, no matter how absurd and unreasonable their demands\nwere; and he always learned his book, and never was late at\nSabbath-school.  He would not play hookey, even when his sober judgment\ntold him it was the most profitable thing he could do.  None of the other\nboys could ever make that boy out, he acted so strangely.  He wouldn't\nlie, no matter how convenient it was.  He just said it was wrong to lie,\nand that was sufficient for him.  And he was so honest that he was simply\nridiculous.  The curious ways that that Jacob had, surpassed everything.\nHe wouldn't play marbles on Sunday, he wouldn't rob birds' nests, he\nwouldn't give hot pennies to organ-grinders' monkeys; he didn't seem to\ntake any interest in any kind of rational amusement.  So the other boys\nused to try to reason it out and come to an understanding of him, but\nthey couldn't arrive at any satisfactory conclusion.  As I said before,\nthey could only figure out a sort of vague idea that he was \"afflicted,\"\nand so they took him under their protection, and never allowed any harm\nto come to him.\n\nThis good little boy read all the Sunday-school books; they were his\ngreatest delight.  This was the whole secret of it.  He believed in the\ngood little boys they put in the Sunday-school book; he had every\nconfidence in them.  He longed to come across one of them alive once;\nbut he never did.  They all died before his time, maybe.  Whenever he\nread about a particularly good one he turned over quickly to the end to\nsee what became of him, because he wanted to travel thousands of miles\nand gaze on him; but it wasn't any use; that good little boy always died\nin the last chapter, and there was a picture of the funeral, with all his\nrelations and the Sunday-school children standing around the grave in\npantaloons that were too short, and bonnets that were too large, and\neverybody crying into handkerchiefs that had as much as a yard and a half\nof stuff in them.  He was always headed off in this way.  He never could\nsee one of those good little boys on account of his always dying in the\nlast chapter.\n\nJacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday school book.  He wanted\nto be put in, with pictures representing him gloriously declining to lie\nto his mother, and her weeping for joy about it; and pictures\nrepresenting him standing on the doorstep giving a penny to a poor\nbeggar-woman with six children, and telling her to spend it freely, but\nnot to be extravagant, because extravagance is a sin; and pictures of him\nmagnanimously refusing to tell on the bad boy who always lay in wait for\nhim around the corner as he came from school, and welted him so over the\nhead with a lath, and then chased him home, saying, \"Hi! hi!\" as he\nproceeded.  That was the ambition of young Jacob Blivens.  He wished to\nbe put in a Sunday-school book.  It made him feel a lithe uncomfortable\nsometimes when he reflected that the good little boys always died.  He\nloved to live, you know, and this was the most unpleasant feature about\nbeing a Sunday-school-boo boy.  He knew it was not healthy to be good.\nHe knew it was more fatal than consumption to be so supernaturally good\nas the boys in the books were he knew that none of them had ever been\nable to stand it long, and it pained him to think that if they put him in\na book he wouldn't ever see it, or even if they did get the book out\nbefore he died it wouldn't be popular without any picture of his funeral\nin the back part of it.  It couldn't be much of a Sunday-school book that\ncouldn't tell about the advice he gave to the community when he was\ndying.  So at last, of course, he had to make up his mind to do the best\nhe could under the circumstances--to live right, and hang on as long as\nhe could and have his dying speech all ready when his time came.\n\nBut somehow nothing ever went right with the good little boy; nothing\never turned out with him the way it turned out with the good little boys\nin the books.  They always had a good time, and the bad boys had the\nbroken legs; but in his case there was a screw loose somewhere, and it\nall happened just the other way.  When he found Jim Blake stealing\napples, and went under the tree to read to him about the bad little boy\nwho fell out of a neighbor's apple tree and broke his arm, Jim fell out\nof the tree, too, but he fell on him and broke his arm, and Jim wasn't\nhurt at all.  Jacob couldn't understand that.  There wasn't anything in\nthe books like it.\n\nAnd once, when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in the mud, and\nJacob ran to help him up and receive his blessing, the blind man did not\ngive him any blessing at all, but whacked him over the head with his\nstick and said he would like to catch him shoving him again, and then\npretending to help him up.  This was not in accordance with any of the\nbooks.  Jacob looked them all over to see.\n\nOne thing that Jacob wanted to do was to find a lame dog that hadn't any\nplace to stay, and was hungry and persecuted, and bring him home and pet\nhim and have that dog's imperishable gratitude.  And at last he found one\nand was happy; and he brought him home and fed him, but when he was going\nto pet him the dog flew at him and tore all the clothes off him except\nthose that were in front, and made a spectacle of him that was\nastonishing.  He examined authorities, but he could not understand the\nmatter.  It was of the same breed of dogs that was in the books, but it\nacted very differently.  Whatever this boy did he got into trouble.  The\nvery things the boys in the books got rewarded for turned out to be about\nthe most unprofitable things he could invest in.\n\nOnce, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, he saw some bad boys\nstarting off pleasuring in a sailboat.  He was filled with consternation,\nbecause he knew from his reading that boys who went sailing on Sunday\ninvariably got drowned.  So he ran out on a raft to warn them, but a log\nturned with him and slid him into the river.  A man got him out pretty\nsoon, and the doctor pumped the water out of him, and gave him a fresh\nstart with his bellows, but he caught cold and lay sick abed nine weeks.\nBut the most unaccountable thing about it was that the bad boys in the\nboat had a good time all day, and then reached home alive and well in the\nmost surprising manner.  Jacob Blivens said there was nothing like these\nthings in the books.  He was perfectly dumfounded.\n\nWhen he got well he was a little discouraged, but he resolved to keep on\ntrying anyhow.  He knew that so far his experiences wouldn't do to go in\na book, but he hadn't yet reached the allotted term of life for good\nlittle boys, and he hoped to be able to make a record yet if he could\nhold on till his time was fully up.  If everything else failed he had his\ndying speech to fall back on.\n\nHe examined his authorities, and found that it was now time for him to go\nto sea as a cabin-boy.  He called on a ship-captain and made his\napplication, and when the captain asked for his recommendations he\nproudly drew out a tract and pointed to the word, \"To Jacob Blivens, from\nhis affectionate teacher.\"  But the captain was a coarse, vulgar man, and\nhe said, \"Oh, that be blowed! that wasn't any proof that he knew how to\nwash dishes or handle a slush-bucket, and he guessed he didn't want him.\"\nThis was altogether the most extraordinary thing that ever happened to\nJacob in all his life.  A compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had\nnever failed to move the tenderest emotions of ship-captains, and open\nthe way to all offices of honor and profit in their gift it never had in\nany book that ever he had read.  He could hardly believe his senses.\n\nThis boy always had a hard time of it.  Nothing ever came out according\nto the authorities with him.  At last, one day, when he was around\nhunting up bad little boys to admonish, he found a lot of them in the old\niron-foundry fixing up a little joke on fourteen or fifteen dogs, which\nthey had tied together in long procession, and were going to ornament\nwith empty nitroglycerin cans made fast to their tails.  Jacob's heart\nwas touched.  He sat down on one of those cans (for he never minded\ngrease when duty was before him), and he took hold of the foremost dog by\nthe collar, and turned his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones.  But just\nat that moment Alderman McWelter, full of wrath, stepped in.  All the bad\nboys ran away, but Jacob Blivens rose in conscious innocence and began\none of those stately little Sunday-school-book speeches which always\ncommence with \"Oh, sir!\" in dead opposition to the fact that no boy, good\nor bad, ever starts a remark with \"Oh, sir.\"  But the alderman never\nwaited to hear the rest.  He took Jacob Blivens by the ear and turned him\naround, and hit him a whack in the rear with the flat of his hand; and in\nan instant that good little boy shot out through the roof and soared away\ntoward the sun with the fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing after\nhim like the tail of a kite.  And there wasn't a sign of that alderman or\nthat old iron-foundry left on the face of the earth; and, as for young\nJacob Blivens, he never got a chance to make his last dying speech after\nall his trouble fixing it up, unless he made it to the birds; because,\nalthough the bulk of him came down all right in a tree-top in an\nadjoining county, the rest of him was apportioned around among four\ntownships, and so they had to hold five inquests on him to find out\nwhether he was dead or not, and how it occurred.  You never saw a boy\nscattered so.--[This glycerin catastrophe is borrowed from a floating\nnewspaper item, whose author's name I would give if I knew it.--M. T.]\n\nThus perished the good little boy who did the best he could, but didn't\ncome out according to the books.  Every boy who ever did as he did\nprospered except him.  His case is truly remarkable.  It will probably\nnever be accounted for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA COUPLE OF POEMS BY TWAIN AND MOORE--[Written about 1865]\n\n\n                         THOSE EVENING BELLS\n\n                           BY THOMAS MOORE\n\n               Those evening bells! those evening bells!\n               How many a tale their music tells\n               Of youth, and home, and that sweet time\n               When last I heard their soothing chime.\n\n               Those joyous hours are passed away;\n               And many a heart that then was gay,\n               Within the tomb now darkly dwells,\n               And hears no more those evening bells.\n\n               And so 'twill be when I am gone\n               That tuneful peal will still ring on;\n               While other bards shall walk these dells,\n               And sing your praise, sweet evening bells.\n\n\n                         THOSE ANNUAL BILLS\n\n                           BY MARK TWAIN\n\n               These annual bills! these annual bills!\n               How many a song their discord trills\n               Of \"truck\" consumed, enjoyed, forgot,\n               Since I was skinned by last year's lot!\n\n               Those joyous beans are passed away;\n               Those onions blithe, O where are they?\n               Once loved, lost, mourned--now vexing ILLS\n               Your shades troop back in annual bills!\n\n               And so 'twill be when I'm aground\n               These yearly duns will still go round,\n               While other bards, with frantic quills,\n               Shall damn and damn these annual bills!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIAGARA [ Written about 1871.]\n\nNiagara Falls is a most enjoyable place of resort.  The hotels are\nexcellent, and the prices not at all exorbitant.  The opportunities for\nfishing are not surpassed in the country; in fact, they are not even\nequaled elsewhere.  Because, in other localities, certain places in the\nstreams are much better than others; but at Niagara one place is just as\ngood as another, for the reason that the fish do not bite anywhere, and\nso there is no use in your walking five miles to fish, when you can\ndepend on being just as unsuccessful nearer home.  The advantages of this\nstate of things have never heretofore been properly placed before the\npublic.\n\nThe weather is cool in summer, and the walks and drives are all pleasant\nand none of them fatiguing.  When you start out to \"do\" the Falls you\nfirst drive down about a mile, and pay a small sum for the privilege of\nlooking down from a precipice into the narrowest part of the Niagara\nRiver.  A railway \"cut\" through a hill would be as comely if it had the\nangry river tumbling and foaming through its bottom.  You can descend a\nstaircase here a hundred and fifty feet down, and stand at the edge of\nthe water.  After you have done it, you will wonder why you did it; but\nyou will then be too late.\n\nThe guide will explain to you, in his blood-curdling way, how he saw the\nlittle steamer, Maid of the Mist, descend the fearful rapids--how first\none paddle-box was out of sight behind the raging billows and then the\nother, and at what point it was that her smokestack toppled overboard,\nand where her planking began to break and part asunder--and how she did\nfinally live through the trip, after accomplishing the incredible feat of\ntraveling seventeen miles in six minutes, or six miles in seventeen\nminutes, I have really forgotten which.  But it was very extraordinary,\nanyhow.  It is worth the price of admission to hear the guide tell the\nstory nine times in succession to different parties, and never miss a\nword or alter a sentence or a gesture.\n\nThen you drive over to Suspension Bridge, and divide your misery between\nthe chances of smashing down two hundred feet into the river below, and\nthe chances of having the railway-train overhead smashing down onto you.\nEither possibility is discomforting taken by itself, but, mixed together,\nthey amount in the aggregate to positive unhappiness.\n\nOn the Canada side you drive along the chasm between long ranks of\nphotographers standing guard behind their cameras, ready to make an\nostentatious frontispiece of you and your decaying ambulance, and your\nsolemn crate with a hide on it, which you are expected to regard in the\nlight of a horse, and a diminished and unimportant background of sublime\nNiagara; and a great many people have the incredible effrontery or the\nnative depravity to aid and abet this sort of crime.\n\nAny day, in the hands of these photographers, you may see stately\npictures of papa and mamma, Johnny and Bub and Sis or a couple of country\ncousins, all smiling vacantly, and all disposed in studied and\nuncomfortable attitudes in their carriage, and all looming up in their\nawe-inspiring imbecility before the snubbed and diminished presentment of\nthat majestic presence whose ministering spirits are the rainbows, whose\nvoice is the thunder, whose awful front is veiled in clouds, who was\nmonarch here dead and forgotten ages before this sackful of small\nreptiles was deemed temporarily necessary to fill a crack in the world's\nunnoted myriads, and will still be monarch here ages and decades of ages\nafter they shall have gathered themselves to their blood-relations, the\nother worms, and been mingled with the unremembering dust.\n\nThere is no actual harm in making Niagara a background whereon to display\none's marvelous insignificance in a good strong light, but it requires a\nsort of superhuman self-complacency to enable one to do it.\n\nWhen you have examined the stupendous Horseshoe Fall till you are\nsatisfied you cannot improve on it, you return to America by the new\nSuspension Bridge, and follow up the bank to where they exhibit the Cave\nof the Winds.\n\nHere I followed instructions, and divested myself of all my clothing, and\nput on a waterproof jacket and overalls.  This costume is picturesque,\nbut not beautiful.  A guide, similarly dressed, led the way down a flight\nof winding stairs, which wound and wound, and still kept on winding long\nafter the thing ceased to be a novelty, and then terminated long before\nit had begun to be a pleasure.  We were then well down under the\nprecipice, but still considerably above the level of the river.\n\nWe now began to creep along flimsy bridges of a single plank, our persons\nshielded from destruction by a crazy wooden railing, to which I clung\nwith both hands--not because I was afraid, but because I wanted to.\nPresently the descent became steeper and the bridge flimsier, and sprays\nfrom the American Fall began to rain down on us in fast increasing sheets\nthat soon became blinding, and after that our progress was mostly in the\nnature of groping.  Nova a furious wind began to rush out from behind the\nwaterfall, which seemed determined to sweep us from the bridge, and\nscatter us on the rocks and among the torrents below.  I remarked that I\nwanted to go home; but it was too late.  We were almost under the\nmonstrous wall of water thundering down from above, and speech was in\nvain in the midst of such a pitiless crash of sound.\n\nIn another moment the guide disappeared behind the deluge, and bewildered\nby the thunder, driven helplessly by the wind, and smitten by the arrowy\ntempest of rain, I followed.  All was darkness.  Such a mad storming,\nroaring, and bellowing of warring wind and water never crazed my ears\nbefore.  I bent my head, and seemed to receive the Atlantic on my back.\nThe world seemed going to destruction.  I could not see anything, the\nflood poured down savagely.  I raised my head, with open mouth, and the\nmost of the American cataract went down my throat.  If I had sprung a\nleak now I had been lost.  And at this moment I discovered that the\nbridge had ceased, and we must trust for a foothold to the slippery and\nprecipitous rocks.  I never was so scared before and survived it.  But we\ngot through at last, and emerged into the open day, where we could stand\nin front of the laced and frothy and seething world of descending water,\nand look at it.  When I saw how much of it there was, and how fearfully\nin earnest it was, I was sorry I had gone behind it.\n\nThe noble Red Man has always been a friend and darling of mine.  I love\nto read about him in tales and legends and romances.  I love to read of\nhis inspired sagacity, and his love of the wild free life of mountain and\nforest, and his general nobility of character, and his stately\nmetaphorical manner of speech, and his chivalrous love for the dusky\nmaiden, and the picturesque pomp of his dress and accoutrements.\nEspecially the picturesque pomp of his dress and accoutrements.  When I\nfound the shops at Niagara Falls full of dainty Indian beadwork, and\nstunning moccasins, and equally stunning toy figures representing human\nbeings who carried their weapons in holes bored through their arms and\nbodies, and had feet shaped like a pie, I was filled with emotion.\nI knew that now, at last, I was going to come face to face with the noble\nRed Man.\n\nA lady clerk in a shop told me, indeed, that all her grand array of\ncuriosities were made by the Indians, and that they were plenty about the\nFalls, and that they were friendly, and it would not be dangerous to\nspeak to them.  And sure enough, as I approached the bridge leading over\nto Luna Island, I came upon a noble Son of the Forest sitting under a\ntree, diligently at work on a bead reticule.  He wore a slouch hat and\nbrogans, and had a short black pipe in his mouth.  Thus does the baneful\ncontact with our effeminate civilization dilute the picturesque pomp\nwhich is so natural to the Indian when far removed from us in his native\nhaunts.  I addressed the relic as follows:\n\n\"Is the Wawhoo-Wang-Wang of the Whack-a-Whack happy?  Does the great\nSpeckled Thunder sigh for the war-path, or is his heart contented with\ndreaming of the dusky maiden, the Pride of the Forest?  Does the mighty\nSachem yearn to drink the blood of his enemies, or is he satisfied to\nmake bead reticules for the pappooses of the paleface?  Speak, sublime\nrelic of bygone grandeur--venerable ruin, speak!\"\n\nThe relic said:\n\n\"An' is it mesilf, Dennis Hooligan, that ye'd be takon' for a dirty\nInjin, ye drawlin', lantern-jawed, spider-legged divil!  By the piper\nthat played before Moses, I'll ate ye!\"\n\nI went away from there.\n\nBy and by, in the neighborhood of the Terrapin Tower, I came upon a\ngentle daughter of the aborigines in fringed and beaded buckskin\nmoccasins and leggins, seated on a bench with her pretty wares about her.\nShe had just carved out a wooden chief that had a strong family\nresemblance to a clothes-pin, and was now boring a hole through his\nabdomen to put his bow through.  I hesitated a moment, and then addressed\nher:\n\n\"Is the heart of the forest maiden heavy?  Is the Laughing Tadpole\nlonely?  Does she mourn over the extinguished council-fires of her race,\nand the vanished glory of her ancestors?  Or does her sad spirit wander\nafar toward the hunting-grounds whither her brave Gobbler-of-the-\nLightnings is gone?  Why is my daughter silent?  Has she ought against\nthe paleface stranger?\"\n\nThe maiden said:\n\n\"Faix, an' is it Biddy Malone ye dare to be callin' names?  Lave this, or\nI'll shy your lean carcass over the cataract, ye sniveling blaggard!\"\n\nI adjourned from there also.\n\n\"Confound these Indians!\" I said.  \"They told me they were tame; but, if\nappearances go for anything, I should say they were all on the warpath.\"\n\nI made one more attempt to fraternize with them, and only one.  I came\nupon a camp of them gathered in the shade of a great tree, making wampum\nand moccasins, and addressed them in the language of friendship:\n\n\"Noble Red Men, Braves, Grand Sachems, War Chiefs, Squaws, and High\nMuck-a-Mucks, the paleface from the land of the setting sun greets you!\nYou, Beneficent Polecat--you, Devourer of Mountains--you, Roaring\nThundergust --you, Bully Boy with a Glass eye--the paleface from beyond\nthe great waters greets you all! War and pestilence have thinned your\nranks and destroyed your once proud nation.  Poker and seven-up, and a\nvain modern expense for soap, unknown to your glorious ancestors, have\ndepleted your purses.  Appropriating, in your simplicity, the property of\nothers has gotten you into trouble.  Misrepresenting facts, in your\nsimple innocence, has damaged your reputation with the soulless usurper.\nTrading for forty-rod whisky, to enable you to get drunk and happy and\ntomahawk your families, has played the everlasting mischief with the\npicturesque pomp of your dress, and here you are, in the broad light of\nthe nineteenth century, gotten up like the ragtag and bobtail of the\npurlieus of New York.  For shame!  Remember your ancestors!  Recall their\nmighty deeds!  Remember Uncas!--and Red jacket! and Hole in the Day!--and\nWhoopdedoodledo!  Emulate their achievements!  Unfurl yourselves under my\nbanner, noble savages, illustrious guttersnipes--\"\n\n\"Down wid him!\"  \"Scoop the blaggard!\"  \"Burn him!\"  \"Bang him!\"\n\"Dhround him!\"\n\nIt was the quickest operation that ever was.  I simply saw a sudden flash\nin the air of clubs, brickbats, fists, bead-baskets, and moccasins--a\nsingle flash, and they all appeared to hit me at once, and no two of them\nin the same place.  In the next instant the entire tribe was upon me.\nThey tore half the clothes off me; they broke my arms and legs; they gave\nme a thump that dented the top of my head till it would hold coffee like\na saucer; and, to crown their disgraceful proceedings and add insult to\ninjury, they threw me over the Niagara Falls, and I got wet.\n\nAbout ninety or a hundred feet from the top, the remains of my vest\ncaught on a projecting rock, and I was almost drowned before I could get\nloose.  I finally fell, and brought up in a world of white foam at the\nfoot of the Fall, whose celled and bubbly masses towered up several\ninches above my head.  Of course I got into the eddy.  I sailed round and\nround in it forty-four times--chasing a chip and gaining on it--each\nround trip a half-mile--reaching for the same bush on the bank forty-four\ntimes, and just exactly missing it by a hair's-breadth every time.\n\nAt last a man walked down and sat down close to that bush, and put a pipe\nin his mouth, and lit a match, and followed me with one eye and kept the\nother on the match, while he sheltered it in his hands from the wind.\nPresently a puff of wind blew it out.  The next time I swept around he\nsaid:\n\n\"Got a match?\"\n\n\"Yes; in my other vest.  Help me out, please.\"\n\n\"Not for Joe.\"\n\nWhen I came round again, I said:\n\n\"Excuse the seemingly impertinent curiosity of a drowning man, but will\nyou explain this singular conduct of yours?\"\n\n\"With pleasure.  I am the coroner.  Don't hurry on my account.  I can\nwait for you.  But I wish I had a match.\"\n\nI said: \"Take my place, and I'll go and get you one.\"\n\nHe declined.  This lack of confidence on his part created a coldness\nbetween us, and from that time forward I avoided him.  It was my idea,\nin case anything happened to me, to so time the occurrence as to throw my\ncustom into the hands of the opposition coroner on the American side.\n\nAt last a policeman came along, and arrested me for disturbing the peace\nby yelling at people on shore for help.  The judge fined me, but had the\nadvantage of him.  My money was with my pantaloons, and my pantaloons\nwere with the Indians.\n\nThus I escaped.  I am now lying in a very critical condition.  At least I\nam lying anyway---critical or not critical.  I am hurt all over, but I\ncannot tell the full extent yet, because the doctor is not done taking\ninventory.  He will make out my manifest this evening.  However, thus far\nhe thinks only sixteen of my wounds are fatal.  I don't mind the others.\n\nUpon regaining my right mind, I said:\n\n\"It is an awful savage tribe of Indians that do the beadwork and\nmoccasins for Niagara Falls, doctor.  Where are they from?\"\n\n\"Limerick, my son.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an\nindividual\u2014he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom\nI knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.\n\nThe odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and\nslaves in the West at the period of this story\u2014that is to say, thirty or\nforty years ago.\n\nAlthough my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and\ngirls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account,\nfor part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what\nthey once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked,\nand what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.\n\nTHE AUTHOR.\n\nHARTFORD, 1876.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\n\u201cTom!\u201d\n\nNo answer.\n\n\u201cTOM!\u201d\n\nNo answer.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!\u201d\n\nNo answer.\n\nThe old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the\nroom; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or\nnever looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were\nher state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for \u201cstyle,\u201d not\nservice\u2014she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.\nShe looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but\nstill loud enough for the furniture to hear:\n\n\u201cWell, I lay if I get hold of you I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n\nShe did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching\nunder the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the\npunches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.\n\n\u201cI never did see the beat of that boy!\u201d\n\nShe went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the\ntomato vines and \u201cjimpson\u201d weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So\nshe lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:\n\n\u201cY-o-u-u TOM!\u201d\n\nThere was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize\na small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.\n\n\u201cThere! I might \u2019a\u2019 thought of that closet. What you been doing in\nthere?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that\ntruck?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, aunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I know. It\u2019s jam\u2014that\u2019s what it is. Forty times I\u2019ve said if you\ndidn\u2019t let that jam alone I\u2019d skin you. Hand me that switch.\u201d\n\nThe switch hovered in the air\u2014the peril was desperate\u2014\n\n\u201cMy! Look behind you, aunt!\u201d\n\nThe old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.\nThe lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and\ndisappeared over it.\n\nHis aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle\nlaugh.\n\n\u201cHang the boy, can\u2019t I never learn anything? Ain\u2019t he played me tricks\nenough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old\nfools is the biggest fools there is. Can\u2019t learn an old dog new tricks,\nas the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,\nand how is a body to know what\u2019s coming? He \u2019pears to know just how long\nhe can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make\nout to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it\u2019s all down again and\nI can\u2019t hit him a lick. I ain\u2019t doing my duty by that boy, and that\u2019s\nthe Lord\u2019s truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as\nthe Good Book says. I\u2019m a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I\nknow. He\u2019s full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he\u2019s my own dead\nsister\u2019s boy, poor thing, and I ain\u2019t got the heart to lash him,\nsomehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and\nevery time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is\nborn of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says,\nand I reckon it\u2019s so. He\u2019ll play hookey this evening,[*] and I\u2019ll just\nbe obleeged to make him work, tomorrow, to punish him. It\u2019s mighty hard\nto make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he\nhates work more than he hates anything else, and I\u2019ve _got_ to do some\nof my duty by him, or I\u2019ll be the ruination of the child.\u201d\n\n[*] Southwestern for \u201cafternoon\u201d\n\nTom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home\nbarely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day\u2019s wood\nand split the kindlings before supper\u2014at least he was there in time\nto tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.\nTom\u2019s younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through\nwith his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,\nand had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.\n\nWhile Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity\noffered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and\nvery deep\u2014for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like\nmany other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she\nwas endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she\nloved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low\ncunning. Said she:\n\n\u201cTom, it was middling warm in school, warn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2019m.\u201d\n\n\u201cPowerful warm, warn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2019m.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?\u201d\n\nA bit of a scare shot through Tom\u2014a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He\nsearched Aunt Polly\u2019s face, but it told him nothing. So he said:\n\n\u201cNo\u2019m\u2014well, not very much.\u201d\n\nThe old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom\u2019s shirt, and said:\n\n\u201cBut you ain\u2019t too warm now, though.\u201d And it flattered her to reflect\nthat she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing\nthat that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew\nwhere the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:\n\n\u201cSome of us pumped on our heads\u2014mine\u2019s damp yet. See?\u201d\n\nAunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of\ncircumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new\ninspiration:\n\n\u201cTom, you didn\u2019t have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to\npump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!\u201d\n\nThe trouble vanished out of Tom\u2019s face. He opened his jacket. His shirt\ncollar was securely sewed.\n\n\u201cBother! Well, go \u2019long with you. I\u2019d made sure you\u2019d played hookey\nand been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you\u2019re a kind of a\nsinged cat, as the saying is\u2014better\u2019n you look. _This_ time.\u201d\n\nShe was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom\nhad stumbled into obedient conduct for once.\n\nBut Sidney said:\n\n\u201cWell, now, if I didn\u2019t think you sewed his collar with white thread,\nbut it\u2019s black.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, I did sew it with white! Tom!\u201d\n\nBut Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:\n\n\u201cSiddy, I\u2019ll lick you for that.\u201d\n\nIn a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into\nthe lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them\u2014one needle\ncarried white thread and the other black. He said:\n\n\u201cShe\u2019d never noticed if it hadn\u2019t been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes\nshe sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to\ngee-miny she\u2019d stick to one or t\u2019other\u2014I can\u2019t keep the run of \u2019em. But\nI bet you I\u2019ll lam Sid for that. I\u2019ll learn him!\u201d\n\nHe was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well\nthough\u2014and loathed him.\n\nWithin two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not\nbecause his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a\nman\u2019s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore\nthem down and drove them out of his mind for the time\u2014just as men\u2019s\nmisfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new\ninterest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired\nfrom a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. It\nconsisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,\nproduced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short\nintervals in the midst of the music\u2014the reader probably remembers how to\ndo it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him\nthe knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of\nharmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer\nfeels who has discovered a new planet\u2014no doubt, as far as strong, deep,\nunalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the\nastronomer.\n\nThe summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom\nchecked his whistle. A stranger was before him\u2014a boy a shade larger\nthan himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an impressive\ncuriosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy\nwas well dressed, too\u2014well dressed on a week-day. This was simply\nastounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth\nroundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes\non\u2014and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of\nribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom\u2019s vitals. The\nmore Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose\nat his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to\nhim to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved\u2014but only\nsidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the\ntime. Finally Tom said:\n\n\u201cI can lick you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I can do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo you can\u2019t, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t!\u201d\n\nAn uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Tisn\u2019t any of your business, maybe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I \u2019low I\u2019ll _make_ it my business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell why don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you say much, I will.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch\u2014much\u2014_much_. There now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you think you\u2019re mighty smart, _don\u2019t_ you? I could lick you with\none hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell why don\u2019t you _do_ it? You _say_ you can do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I _will_, if you fool with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes\u2014I\u2019ve seen whole families in the same fix.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmarty! You think you\u2019re _some_, now, _don\u2019t_ you? Oh, what a hat!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can lump that hat if you don\u2019t like it. I dare you to knock it\noff\u2014and anybody that\u2019ll take a dare will suck eggs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a liar!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re another.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fighting liar and dasn\u2019t take it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAw\u2014take a walk!\u201d\n\n\u201cSay\u2014if you give me much more of your sass I\u2019ll take and bounce a rock\noff\u2019n your head.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, of _course_ you will.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I _will_.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell why don\u2019t you _do_ it then? What do you keep _saying_ you will\nfor? Why don\u2019t you _do_ it? It\u2019s because you\u2019re afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI _ain\u2019t_ afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are.\u201d\n\nAnother pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently\nthey were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:\n\n\u201cGet away from here!\u201d\n\n\u201cGo away yourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t either.\u201d\n\nSo they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both\nshoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But\nneither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and\nflushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a coward and a pup. I\u2019ll tell my big brother on you, and he can\nthrash you with his little finger, and I\u2019ll make him do it, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I care for your big brother? I\u2019ve got a brother that\u2019s bigger\nthan he is\u2014and what\u2019s more, he can throw him over that fence, too.\u201d\n [Both brothers were imaginary.]\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Your_ saying so don\u2019t make it so.\u201d\n\nTom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:\n\n\u201cI dare you to step over that, and I\u2019ll lick you till you can\u2019t stand\nup. Anybody that\u2019ll take a dare will steal sheep.\u201d\n\nThe new boy stepped over promptly, and said:\n\n\u201cNow you said you\u2019d do it, now let\u2019s see you do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you crowd me now; you better look out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you _said_ you\u2019d do it\u2014why don\u2019t you do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy jingo! for two cents I _will_ do it.\u201d\n\nThe new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out\nwith derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys\nwere rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and\nfor the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other\u2019s hair and\nclothes, punched and scratched each other\u2019s nose, and covered themselves\nwith dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the\nfog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him\nwith his fists. \u201cHoller \u2019nuff!\u201d said he.\n\nThe boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying\u2014mainly from rage.\n\n\u201cHoller \u2019nuff!\u201d\u2014and the pounding went on.\n\nAt last the stranger got out a smothered \u201c\u2019Nuff!\u201d and Tom let him up and\nsaid:\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019ll learn you. Better look out who you\u2019re fooling with next\ntime.\u201d\n\nThe new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,\nsnuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and\nthreatening what he would do to Tom the \u201cnext time he caught him out.\u201d\n To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and\nas soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it\nand hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like\nan antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he\nlived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the\nenemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the\nwindow and declined. At last the enemy\u2019s mother appeared, and called Tom\na bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but\nhe said he \u201c\u2019lowed\u201d to \u201clay\u201d for that boy.\n\nHe got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in\nat the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and\nwhen she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his\nSaturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its\nfirmness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nSaturday morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and\nfresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if\nthe heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in\nevery face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom\nand the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond\nthe village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far\nenough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.\n\nTom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a\nlong-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and\na deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board\nfence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a\nburden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost\nplank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant\nwhitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed\nfence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at\nthe gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from\nthe town pump had always been hateful work in Tom\u2019s eyes, before, but\nnow it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at\nthe pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there\nwaiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,\nskylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred\nand fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an\nhour\u2014and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:\n\n\u201cSay, Jim, I\u2019ll fetch the water if you\u2019ll whitewash some.\u201d\n\nJim shook his head and said:\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an\u2019 git dis water\nan\u2019 not stop foolin\u2019 roun\u2019 wid anybody. She say she spec\u2019 Mars Tom gwine\nto ax me to whitewash, an\u2019 so she tole me go \u2019long an\u2019 \u2019tend to my own\nbusiness\u2014she \u2019lowed _she\u2019d_ \u2019tend to de whitewashin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That\u2019s the way she always talks.\nGimme the bucket\u2014I won\u2019t be gone only a a minute. _She_ won\u2019t ever\nknow.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I dasn\u2019t, Mars Tom. Ole missis she\u2019d take an\u2019 tar de head off\u2019n me.\n\u2019Deed she would.\u201d\n\n\u201c_She_! She never licks anybody\u2014whacks \u2019em over the head with her\nthimble\u2014and who cares for that, I\u2019d like to know. She talks awful, but\ntalk don\u2019t hurt\u2014anyways it don\u2019t if she don\u2019t cry. Jim, I\u2019ll give you a\nmarvel. I\u2019ll give you a white alley!\u201d\n\nJim began to waver.\n\n\u201cWhite alley, Jim! And it\u2019s a bully taw.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy! Dat\u2019s a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I\u2019s powerful\n\u2019fraid ole missis\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd besides, if you will I\u2019ll show you my sore toe.\u201d\n\nJim was only human\u2014this attraction was too much for him. He put down\nhis pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing\ninterest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he\nwas flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was\nwhitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with\na slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.\n\nBut Tom\u2019s energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had\nplanned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys\nwould come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and\nthey would make a world of fun of him for having to work\u2014the very\nthought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and\nexamined it\u2014bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange\nof _work_, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour\nof pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and\ngave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless\nmoment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great,\nmagnificent inspiration.\n\nHe took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in\nsight presently\u2014the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been\ndreading. Ben\u2019s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump\u2014proof enough that his\nheart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and\ngiving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned\nding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As\nhe drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned\nfar over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp\nand circumstance\u2014for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered\nhimself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and\nengine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own\nhurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:\n\n\u201cStop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!\u201d The headway ran almost out, and he\ndrew up slowly toward the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cShip up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!\u201d His arms straightened and stiffened\ndown his sides.\n\n\u201cSet her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!\nChow!\u201d His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles\u2014for it was\nrepresenting a forty-foot wheel.\n\n\u201cLet her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!\u201d\n The left hand began to describe circles.\n\n\u201cStop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on\nthe stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow!\nTing-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! _lively_ now!\nCome\u2014out with your spring-line\u2014what\u2019re you about there! Take a turn\nround that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now\u2014let her\ngo! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH\u2019T! S\u2019H\u2019T! SH\u2019T!\u201d\n(trying the gauge-cocks).\n\nTom went on whitewashing\u2014paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared\na moment and then said: \u201c_Hi-Yi! You\u2019re_ up a stump, ain\u2019t you!\u201d\n\nNo answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then\nhe gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as\nbefore. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom\u2019s mouth watered for the\napple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:\n\n\u201cHello, old chap, you got to work, hey?\u201d\n\nTom wheeled suddenly and said:\n\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s you, Ben! I warn\u2019t noticing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay\u2014I\u2019m going in a-swimming, I am. Don\u2019t you wish you could? But of\ncourse you\u2019d druther _work_\u2014wouldn\u2019t you? Course you would!\u201d\n\nTom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:\n\n\u201cWhat do you call work?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, ain\u2019t _that_ work?\u201d\n\nTom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:\n\n\u201cWell, maybe it is, and maybe it ain\u2019t. All I know, is, it suits Tom\nSawyer.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh come, now, you don\u2019t mean to let on that you _like_ it?\u201d\n\nThe brush continued to move.\n\n\u201cLike it? Well, I don\u2019t see why I oughtn\u2019t to like it. Does a boy get a\nchance to whitewash a fence every day?\u201d\n\nThat put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple.\nTom swept his brush daintily back and forth\u2014stepped back to note the\neffect\u2014added a touch here and there\u2014criticised the effect again\u2014Ben\nwatching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more\nabsorbed. Presently he said:\n\n\u201cSay, Tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.\u201d\n\nTom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:\n\n\u201cNo\u2014no\u2014I reckon it wouldn\u2019t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly\u2019s awful\nparticular about this fence\u2014right here on the street, you know\u2014but if it\nwas the back fence I wouldn\u2019t mind and _she_ wouldn\u2019t. Yes, she\u2019s awful\nparticular about this fence; it\u2019s got to be done very careful; I reckon\nthere ain\u2019t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it\nthe way it\u2019s got to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014is that so? Oh come, now\u2014lemme just try. Only just a little\u2014I\u2019d let\n_you_, if you was me, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cBen, I\u2019d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly\u2014well, Jim wanted to do\nit, but she wouldn\u2019t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn\u2019t let\nSid. Now don\u2019t you see how I\u2019m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence\nand anything was to happen to it\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shucks, I\u2019ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say\u2014I\u2019ll give you\nthe core of my apple.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, here\u2014No, Ben, now don\u2019t. I\u2019m afeard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you _all_ of it!\u201d\n\nTom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his\nheart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the\nsun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,\ndangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more\ninnocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every\nlittle while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time\nBen was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for\na kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in\nfor a dead rat and a string to swing it with\u2014and so on, and so on, hour\nafter hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a\npoor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in\nwealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part\nof a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool\ncannon, a key that wouldn\u2019t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a\nglass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,\nsix fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a\ndog-collar\u2014but no dog\u2014the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel,\nand a dilapidated old window sash.\n\nHe had had a nice, good, idle time all the while\u2014plenty of company\u2014and\nthe fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn\u2019t run out of\nwhitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.\n\nTom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He\nhad discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it\u2014namely,\nthat in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary\nto make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and\nwise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have\ncomprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is _obliged_ to do,\nand that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And\nthis would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or\nperforming on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing\nMont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England\nwho drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a\ndaily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable\nmoney; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn\nit into work and then they would resign.\n\nThe boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place\nin his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to\nreport.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nTom presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an\nopen window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,\nbreakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer\nair, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing\nmurmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her\nknitting\u2014for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her\nlap. Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had\nthought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at\nseeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He\nsaid: \u201cMayn\u2019t I go and play now, aunt?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, a\u2019ready? How much have you done?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all done, aunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, don\u2019t lie to me\u2014I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t, aunt; it _is_ all done.\u201d\n\nAunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for\nherself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of\nTom\u2019s statement true. When she found the entire fence white-washed, and\nnot only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a\nstreak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She\nsaid:\n\n\u201cWell, I never! There\u2019s no getting round it, you can work when you\u2019re a\nmind to, Tom.\u201d And then she diluted the compliment by adding, \u201cBut it\u2019s\npowerful seldom you\u2019re a mind to, I\u2019m bound to say. Well, go \u2019long and\nplay; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I\u2019ll tan you.\u201d\n\nShe was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took\nhim into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,\nalong with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat\ntook to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.\nAnd while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he \u201chooked\u201d a\ndoughnut.\n\nThen he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway\nthat led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and\nthe air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a\nhail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties\nand sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect,\nand Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general\nthing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at\npeace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his\nblack thread and getting him into trouble.\n\nTom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the\nback of his aunt\u2019s cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach\nof capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the\nvillage, where two \u201cmilitary\u201d companies of boys had met for conflict,\naccording to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these\narmies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two\ngreat commanders did not condescend to fight in person\u2014that being better\nsuited to the still smaller fry\u2014but sat together on an eminence\nand conducted the field operations by orders delivered through\naides-de-camp. Tom\u2019s army won a great victory, after a long and\nhard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged,\nthe terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the\nnecessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and\nmarched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.\n\nAs he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new\ngirl in the garden\u2014a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow\nhair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered\npantalettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A\ncertain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a\nmemory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction;\nhe had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor\nlittle evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had\nconfessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest\nboy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time\nshe had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is\ndone.\n\nHe worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had\ndiscovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and\nbegan to \u201cshow off\u201d in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win\nher admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time;\nbut by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic\nperformances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending\nher way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it,\ngrieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a\nmoment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great\nsigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up,\nright away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she\ndisappeared.\n\nThe boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and\nthen shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as\nif he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.\nPresently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his\nnose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side,\nin his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his\nbare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped\naway with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a\nminute\u2014only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next\nhis heart\u2014or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in\nanatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.\n\nHe returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, \u201cshowing\noff,\u201d as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom\ncomforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some\nwindow, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode\nhome reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.\n\nAll through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered \u201cwhat\nhad got into the child.\u201d He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and\ndid not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his\naunt\u2019s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:\n\n\u201cAunt, you don\u2019t whack Sid when he takes it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Sid don\u2019t torment a body the way you do. You\u2019d be always into\nthat sugar if I warn\u2019t watching you.\u201d\n\nPresently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity,\nreached for the sugar-bowl\u2014a sort of glorying over Tom which was\nwellnigh unbearable. But Sid\u2019s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and\nbroke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled\nhis tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a\nword, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she\nasked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be\nnothing so good in the world as to see that pet model \u201ccatch it.\u201d He was\nso brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old\nlady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath\nfrom over her spectacles. He said to himself, \u201cNow it\u2019s coming!\u201d And the\nnext instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted\nto strike again when Tom cried out:\n\n\u201cHold on, now, what \u2019er you belting _me_ for?\u2014Sid broke it!\u201d\n\nAunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when\nshe got her tongue again, she only said:\n\n\u201cUmf! Well, you didn\u2019t get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some\nother audacious mischief when I wasn\u2019t around, like enough.\u201d\n\nThen her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something\nkind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a\nconfession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.\nSo she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.\nTom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart\nhis aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the\nconsciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice\nof none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then,\nthrough a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured\nhimself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching\none little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and\ndie with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured\nhimself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and\nhis sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how\nher tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back\nher boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would\nlie there cold and white and make no sign\u2014a poor little sufferer, whose\ngriefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of\nthese dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke;\nand his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked,\nand ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to\nhim was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any\nworldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too\nsacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced\nin, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit\nof one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness\nout at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.\n\nHe wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate\nplaces that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the river\ninvited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated\nthe dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could\nonly be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the\nuncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought of his flower.\nHe got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal\nfelicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would she\ncry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and\ncomfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world?\nThis picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he\nworked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and\nvaried lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing\nand departed in the darkness.\n\nAbout half-past nine or ten o\u2019clock he came along the deserted street to\nwhere the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon\nhis listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain\nof a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the\nfence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under\nthat window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him\ndown on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his\nhands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower.\nAnd thus he would die\u2014out in the cold world, with no shelter over his\nhomeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow,\nno loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And\nthus _she_ would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and\noh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would\nshe heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted,\nso untimely cut down?\n\nThe window went up, a maid-servant\u2019s discordant voice profaned the holy\ncalm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr\u2019s remains!\n\nThe strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz\nas of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound\nas of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the\nfence and shot away in the gloom.\n\nNot long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his\ndrenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he\nhad any dim idea of making any \u201creferences to allusions,\u201d he thought\nbetter of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom\u2019s eye.\n\nTom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made mental\nnote of the omission.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nThe sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful\nvillage like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family\nworship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid\ncourses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of\noriginality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of\nthe Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.\n\nThen Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to \u201cget\nhis verses.\u201d Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his\nenergies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the\nSermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.\nAt the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,\nbut no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human\nthought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took\nhis book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the\nfog:\n\n\u201cBlessed are the\u2014a\u2014a\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor\u201d\u2014\n\n\u201cYes\u2014poor; blessed are the poor\u2014a\u2014a\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIn spirit\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIn spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they\u2014they\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c_Theirs_\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFor _theirs_. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom\nof heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they\u2014they\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSh\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFor they\u2014a\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cS, H, A\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFor they S, H\u2014Oh, I don\u2019t know what it is!\u201d\n\n\u201c_Shall_!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, _shall_! for they shall\u2014for they shall\u2014a\u2014a\u2014shall\nmourn\u2014a\u2014a\u2014blessed are they that shall\u2014they that\u2014a\u2014they that\nshall mourn, for they shall\u2014a\u2014shall _what_? Why don\u2019t you tell me,\nMary?\u2014what do you want to be so mean for?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I\u2019m not teasing you. I wouldn\u2019t\ndo that. You must go and learn it again. Don\u2019t you be discouraged, Tom,\nyou\u2019ll manage it\u2014and if you do, I\u2019ll give you something ever so nice.\nThere, now, that\u2019s a good boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever you mind, Tom. You know if I say it\u2019s nice, it is nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bet you that\u2019s so, Mary. All right, I\u2019ll tackle it again.\u201d\n\nAnd he did \u201ctackle it again\u201d\u2014and under the double pressure of curiosity\nand prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a\nshining success. Mary gave him a brand-new \u201cBarlow\u201d knife worth twelve\nand a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system\nshook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything,\nbut it was a \u201csure-enough\u201d Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur\nin that\u2014though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a\nweapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing\nmystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the\ncupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was\ncalled off to dress for Sunday-school.\n\nMary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went\noutside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he\ndipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;\npoured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen\nand began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But\nMary removed the towel and said:\n\n\u201cNow ain\u2019t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn\u2019t be so bad. Water won\u2019t hurt\nyou.\u201d\n\nTom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he\nstood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath\nand began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut\nand groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of\nsuds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from\nthe towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped\nshort at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line\nthere was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in\nfront and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she\nwas done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of\ncolor, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls\nwrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately\nsmoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his\nhair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his\nown filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his\nclothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years\u2014they were\nsimply called his \u201cother clothes\u201d\u2014and so by that we know the size of his\nwardrobe. The girl \u201cput him to rights\u201d after he had dressed himself;\nshe buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt\ncollar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with\nhis speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and\nuncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there\nwas a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He\nhoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she\ncoated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought\nthem out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do\neverything he didn\u2019t want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:\n\n\u201cPlease, Tom\u2014that\u2019s a good boy.\u201d\n\nSo he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three\nchildren set out for Sunday-school\u2014a place that Tom hated with his whole\nheart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.\n\nSabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church\nservice. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,\nand the other always remained too\u2014for stronger reasons. The church\u2019s\nhigh-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons;\nthe edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board\ntree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step\nand accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:\n\n\u201cSay, Billy, got a yaller ticket?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll you take for her?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll you give?\u201d\n\n\u201cPiece of lickrish and a fish-hook.\u201d\n\n\u201cLess see \u2019em.\u201d\n\nTom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.\nThen Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some\nsmall trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other\nboys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten\nor fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm\nof clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started\na quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave,\nelderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a\nboy\u2019s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy\nturned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear\nhim say \u201cOuch!\u201d and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom\u2019s whole\nclass were of a pattern\u2014restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came\nto recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but\nhad to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each\ngot his reward\u2014in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture\non it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten\nblue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red\ntickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent\ngave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy\ntimes) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and\napplication to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dor\u00e9 Bible? And\nyet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way\u2014it was the patient work of\ntwo years\u2014and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once\nrecited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his\nmental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot\nfrom that day forth\u2014a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great\noccasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it)\nhad always made this boy come out and \u201cspread himself.\u201d Only the older\npupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work\nlong enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes\nwas a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so\ngreat and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar\u2019s\nheart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple\nof weeks. It is possible that Tom\u2019s mental stomach had never really\nhungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being\nhad for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.\n\nIn due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with\na closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its\nleaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent\nmakes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as\nnecessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer\nwho stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert\u2014though\nwhy, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music\nis ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim\ncreature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he\nwore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears\nand whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth\u2014a\nfence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the\nwhole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a\nspreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had\nfringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion\nof the day, like sleigh-runners\u2014an effect patiently and laboriously\nproduced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a\nwall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very\nsincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places\nin such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that\nunconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar\nintonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this\nfashion:\n\n\u201cNow, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as\nyou can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There\u2014that\nis it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one\nlittle girl who is looking out of the window\u2014I am afraid she thinks I\nam out there somewhere\u2014perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech\nto the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it\nmakes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a\nplace like this, learning to do right and be good.\u201d And so forth and so\non. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a\npattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.\n\nThe latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights\nand other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings\nand whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of\nisolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound\nceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters\u2019 voice, and the\nconclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.\n\nA good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was\nmore or less rare\u2014the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied\nby a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman\nwith iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter\u2019s\nwife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of\nchafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too\u2014he could not meet Amy\nLawrence\u2019s eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this\nsmall newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next\nmoment he was \u201cshowing off\u201d with all his might\u2014cuffing boys, pulling\nhair, making faces\u2014in a word, using every art that seemed likely to\nfascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one\nalloy\u2014the memory of his humiliation in this angel\u2019s garden\u2014and that\nrecord in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that\nwere sweeping over it now.\n\nThe visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.\nWalters\u2019 speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The\nmiddle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage\u2014no less a one\nthan the county judge\u2014altogether the most august creation these children\nhad ever looked upon\u2014and they wondered what kind of material he was made\nof\u2014and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might,\ntoo. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away\u2014so he had travelled,\nand seen the world\u2014these very eyes had looked upon the county\ncourt-house\u2014which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these\nreflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the\nranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of\ntheir own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar\nwith the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music\nto his soul to hear the whisperings:\n\n\u201cLook at him, Jim! He\u2019s a going up there. Say\u2014look! he\u2019s a going to\nshake hands with him\u2014he _is_ shaking hands with him! By jings, don\u2019t you\nwish you was Jeff?\u201d\n\nMr. Walters fell to \u201cshowing off,\u201d with all sorts of official bustlings\nand activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging\ndirections here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The\nlibrarian \u201cshowed off\u201d\u2014running hither and thither with his arms full of\nbooks and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority\ndelights in. The young lady teachers \u201cshowed off\u201d\u2014bending sweetly over\npupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers\nat bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen\nteachers \u201cshowed off\u201d with small scoldings and other little displays of\nauthority and fine attention to discipline\u2014and most of the teachers, of\nboth sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was\nbusiness that frequently had to be done over again two or three times\n(with much seeming vexation). The little girls \u201cshowed off\u201d in various\nways, and the little boys \u201cshowed off\u201d with such diligence that the air\nwas thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it\nall the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all\nthe house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur\u2014for he was\n\u201cshowing off,\u201d too.\n\nThere was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters\u2019 ecstasy complete,\nand that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.\nSeveral pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough\u2014he had been\naround among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now,\nto have that German lad back again with a sound mind.\n\nAnd now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with\nnine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded\na Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not\nexpecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But\nthere was no getting around it\u2014here were the certified checks, and they\nwere good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with\nthe Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from\nheadquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and\nso profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the\njudicial one\u2019s altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon\nin place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy\u2014but those that\nsuffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they\nthemselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to\nTom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.\nThese despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a\nguileful snake in the grass.\n\nThe prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the\nsuperintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked\nsomewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow\u2019s instinct taught him\nthat there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,\nperhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two\nthousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises\u2014a dozen would\nstrain his capacity, without a doubt.\n\nAmy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in\nher face\u2014but he wouldn\u2019t look. She wondered; then she was just a grain\ntroubled; next a dim suspicion came and went\u2014came again; she watched;\na furtive glance told her worlds\u2014and then her heart broke, and she was\njealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most\nof all (she thought).\n\nTom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath\nwould hardly come, his heart quaked\u2014partly because of the awful\ngreatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would\nhave liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The\nJudge put his hand on Tom\u2019s head and called him a fine little man, and\nasked him what his name was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:\n\n\u201cTom.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, not Tom\u2014it is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThomas.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That\u2019s very well.\nBut you\u2019ve another one I daresay, and you\u2019ll tell it to me, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,\u201d said Walters, \u201cand say\nsir. You mustn\u2019t forget your manners.\u201d\n\n\u201cThomas Sawyer\u2014sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it! That\u2019s a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two\nthousand verses is a great many\u2014very, very great many. And you never can\nbe sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth\nmore than anything there is in the world; it\u2019s what makes great men\nand good men; you\u2019ll be a great man and a good man yourself, some\nday, Thomas, and then you\u2019ll look back and say, It\u2019s all owing to the\nprecious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood\u2014it\u2019s all owing to\nmy dear teachers that taught me to learn\u2014it\u2019s all owing to the good\nsuperintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a\nbeautiful Bible\u2014a splendid elegant Bible\u2014to keep and have it all for my\nown, always\u2014it\u2019s all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will\nsay, Thomas\u2014and you wouldn\u2019t take any money for those two thousand\nverses\u2014no indeed you wouldn\u2019t. And now you wouldn\u2019t mind telling me and\nthis lady some of the things you\u2019ve learned\u2014no, I know you wouldn\u2019t\u2014for\nwe are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no doubt you know the names\nof all the twelve disciples. Won\u2019t you tell us the names of the first\ntwo that were appointed?\u201d\n\nTom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed,\nnow, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters\u2019 heart sank within him. He said\nto himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest\nquestion\u2014why _did_ the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up\nand say:\n\n\u201cAnswer the gentleman, Thomas\u2014don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\n\nTom still hung fire.\n\n\u201cNow I know you\u2019ll tell me,\u201d said the lady. \u201cThe names of the first two\ndisciples were\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c_David and Goliah!_\u201d\n\nLet us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nAbout half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,\nand presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The\nSunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and\noccupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt\nPolly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her\u2014Tom being placed next\nthe aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window\nand the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up\nthe aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days;\nthe mayor and his wife\u2014for they had a mayor there, among other\nunnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglas, fair,\nsmart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill\nmansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much\nthe most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could\nboast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the\nnew notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by\na troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all\nthe young clerks in town in a body\u2014for they had stood in the vestibule\nsucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering\nadmirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came\nthe Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as\nif she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was\nthe pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so\ngood. And besides, he had been \u201cthrown up to them\u201d so much. His\nwhite handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on\nSundays\u2014accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys\nwho had as snobs.\n\nThe congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,\nto warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the\nchurch which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the\nchoir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all\nthrough service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,\nbut I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago,\nand I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in\nsome foreign country.\n\nThe minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a\npeculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His\nvoice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a\ncertain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word\nand then plunged down as if from a spring-board:\n\n  Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow\u2019ry _beds_\n                                                        of ease,\n\n  Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro\u2019 _blood_\n                                                        -y seas?\n\nHe was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church \u201csociables\u201d he was\nalways called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies\nwould lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,\nand \u201cwall\u201d their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, \u201cWords\ncannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal\nearth.\u201d\n\nAfter the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into\na bulletin-board, and read off \u201cnotices\u201d of meetings and societies and\nthings till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of\ndoom\u2014a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities,\naway here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is\nto justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.\n\nAnd now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went\ninto details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the\nchurch; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;\nfor the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United\nStates; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the\nPresident; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed\nby stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of\nEuropean monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light\nand the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear\nwithal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with\na supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace\nand favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a\ngrateful harvest of good. Amen.\n\nThere was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.\nThe boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he\nonly endured it\u2014if he even did that much. He was restive all through it;\nhe kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously\u2014for he was not\nlistening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman\u2019s regular\nroute over it\u2014and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,\nhis ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered\nadditions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had\nlit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by\ncalmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and\npolishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with\nthe body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping\nits wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they\nhad been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if\nit knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom\u2019s\nhands itched to grab for it they did not dare\u2014he believed his soul would\nbe instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going\non. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal\nforward; and the instant the \u201cAmen\u201d was out the fly was a prisoner of\nwar. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.\n\nThe minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an\nargument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod\u2014and\nyet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and\nthinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly\nworth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he\nalways knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything\nelse about the discourse. However, this time he was really interested\nfor a little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the\nassembling together of the world\u2019s hosts at the millennium when the lion\nand the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead\nthem. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle\nwere lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the\nprincipal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the\nthought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child,\nif it was a tame lion.\n\nNow he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.\nPresently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was\na large black beetle with formidable jaws\u2014a \u201cpinchbug,\u201d he called it. It\nwas in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to\ntake him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went\nfloundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went\ninto the boy\u2019s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,\nunable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out\nof his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in\nthe beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came\nidling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the\nquiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the\ndrooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around\nit; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew\nbolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly\nsnatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy\nthe diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,\nand continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent\nand absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin\ndescended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp,\na flirt of the poodle\u2019s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards\naway, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators\nshook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and\nhand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,\nand probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a\ncraving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on\nit again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his\nfore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at\nit with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But\nhe grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a\nfly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close\nto the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the\nbeetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony\nand the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so\ndid the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew\ndown the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the\nhome-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was\nbut a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of\nlight. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang\ninto its master\u2019s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of\ndistress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.\n\nBy this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with\nsuppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.\nThe discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all\npossibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest\nsentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of\nunholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson\nhad said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole\ncongregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.\n\nTom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was\nsome satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety\nin it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog\nshould play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in\nhim to carry it off.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nMonday morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found\nhim so\u2014because it began another week\u2019s slow suffering in school. He\ngenerally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday,\nit made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.\n\nTom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was\nsick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility.\nHe canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated\nagain. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he\nbegan to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew\nfeeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly\nhe discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This\nwas lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a \u201cstarter,\u201d as he\ncalled it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that\nargument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought\nhe would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.\nNothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing\nthe doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or\nthree weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly\ndrew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.\nBut now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed\nwell worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable\nspirit.\n\nBut Sid slept on unconscious.\n\nTom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.\n\nNo result from Sid.\n\nTom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then\nswelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.\n\nSid snored on.\n\nTom was aggravated. He said, \u201cSid, Sid!\u201d and shook him. This course\nworked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then\nbrought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.\nTom went on groaning. Sid said:\n\n\u201cTom! Say, Tom!\u201d [No response.] \u201cHere, Tom! TOM! What is the matter,\nTom?\u201d And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.\n\nTom moaned out:\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t, Sid. Don\u2019t joggle me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, what\u2019s the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014never mind. It\u2019ll be over by and by, maybe. Don\u2019t call anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I must! _Don\u2019t_ groan so, Tom, it\u2019s awful. How long you been this\nway?\u201d\n\n\u201cHours. Ouch! Oh, don\u2019t stir so, Sid, you\u2019ll kill me.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, why didn\u2019t you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, _don\u2019t!_ It makes my flesh\ncrawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cI forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you\u2019ve ever done to\nme. When I\u2019m gone\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Tom, you ain\u2019t dying, are you? Don\u2019t, Tom\u2014oh, don\u2019t. Maybe\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell \u2019em so, Sid. And Sid, you give\nmy window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that\u2019s come to\ntown, and tell her\u2014\u201d\n\nBut Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality,\nnow, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had\ngathered quite a genuine tone.\n\nSid flew downstairs and said:\n\n\u201cOh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom\u2019s dying!\u201d\n\n\u201cDying!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2019m. Don\u2019t wait\u2014come quick!\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbage! I don\u2019t believe it!\u201d\n\nBut she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels.\nAnd her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the\nbedside she gasped out:\n\n\u201cYou, Tom! Tom, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, auntie, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you\u2014what is the matter with you, child?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, auntie, my sore toe\u2019s mortified!\u201d\n\nThe old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a\nlittle, then did both together. This restored her and she said:\n\n\u201cTom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and\nclimb out of this.\u201d\n\nThe groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a\nlittle foolish, and he said:\n\n\u201cAunt Polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my\ntooth at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour tooth, indeed! What\u2019s the matter with your tooth?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of them\u2019s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, now, don\u2019t begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.\nWell\u2014your tooth _is_ loose, but you\u2019re not going to die about that.\nMary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.\u201d\n\nTom said:\n\n\u201cOh, please, auntie, don\u2019t pull it out. It don\u2019t hurt any more. I wish\nI may never stir if it does. Please don\u2019t, auntie. I don\u2019t want to stay\nhome from school.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you don\u2019t, don\u2019t you? So all this row was because you thought you\u2019d\nget to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so,\nand you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your\noutrageousness.\u201d By this time the dental instruments were ready. The old\nlady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom\u2019s tooth with a loop\nand tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and\nsuddenly thrust it almost into the boy\u2019s face. The tooth hung dangling\nby the bedpost, now.\n\nBut all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after\nbreakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his\nupper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable\nway. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition;\nand one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and\nhomage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,\nand shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain\nwhich he did not feel that it wasn\u2019t anything to spit like Tom Sawyer;\nbut another boy said, \u201cSour grapes!\u201d and he wandered away a dismantled\nhero.\n\nShortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry\nFinn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and\ndreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless\nand vulgar and bad\u2014and because all their children admired him so, and\ndelighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like\nhim. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied\nHuckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders\nnot to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.\nHuckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown\nmen, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat\nwas a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat,\nwhen he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons\nfar down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of\nthe trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged\nin the dirt when not rolled up.\n\nHuckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps\nin fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to\nschool or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could\ngo fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it\nsuited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he\npleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring\nand the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor\nput on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything\nthat goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed,\nhampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.\n\nTom hailed the romantic outcast:\n\n\u201cHello, Huckleberry!\u201d\n\n\u201cHello yourself, and see how you like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that you got?\u201d\n\n\u201cDead cat.\u201d\n\n\u201cLemme see him, Huck. My, he\u2019s pretty stiff. Where\u2019d you get him?\u201d\n\n\u201cBought him off\u2019n a boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you give?\u201d\n\n\u201cI give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you get the blue ticket?\u201d\n\n\u201cBought it off\u2019n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay\u2014what is dead cats good for, Huck?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood for? Cure warts with.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! Is that so? I know something that\u2019s better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet you don\u2019t. What is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, spunk-water.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpunk-water! I wouldn\u2019t give a dern for spunk-water.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t you? D\u2019you ever try it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I hain\u2019t. But Bob Tanner did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told you so!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny\ntold Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the\nnigger told me. There now!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what of it? They\u2019ll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I\ndon\u2019t know _him_. But I never see a nigger that _wouldn\u2019t_ lie. Shucks!\nNow you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water\nwas.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the daytime?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith his face to the stump?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Least I reckon so.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he say anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t reckon he did. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool\nway as that! Why, that ain\u2019t a-going to do any good. You got to go all\nby yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there\u2019s a\nspunk-water stump, and just as it\u2019s midnight you back up against the\nstump and jam your hand in and say:\n\n    \u2018Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,\n    Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,\u2019\n\nand then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then\nturn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.\nBecause if you speak the charm\u2019s busted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that sounds like a good way; but that ain\u2019t the way Bob Tanner\ndone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir, you can bet he didn\u2019t, becuz he\u2019s the wartiest boy in this\ntown; and he wouldn\u2019t have a wart on him if he\u2019d knowed how to work\nspunk-water. I\u2019ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,\nHuck. I play with frogs so much that I\u2019ve always got considerable many\nwarts. Sometimes I take \u2019em off with a bean.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, bean\u2019s good. I\u2019ve done that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you? What\u2019s your way?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood,\nand then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig\na hole and bury it \u2019bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the\nmoon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece\nthat\u2019s got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to\nfetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the\nwart, and pretty soon off she comes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s it, Huck\u2014that\u2019s it; though when you\u2019re burying it if you\nsay \u2018Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!\u2019 it\u2019s better.\nThat\u2019s the way Joe Harper does, and he\u2019s been nearly to Coonville and\nmost everywheres. But say\u2014how do you cure \u2019em with dead cats?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard \u2019long about\nmidnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it\u2019s\nmidnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can\u2019t see\n\u2019em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear \u2019em talk;\nand when they\u2019re taking that feller away, you heave your cat after \u2019em\nand say, \u2018Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I\u2019m\ndone with ye!\u2019 That\u2019ll fetch _any_ wart.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds right. D\u2019you ever try it, Huck?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but old Mother Hopkins told me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I reckon it\u2019s so, then. Becuz they say she\u2019s a witch.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay! Why, Tom, I _know_ she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own\nself. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he\ntook up a rock, and if she hadn\u2019t dodged, he\u2019d a got her. Well, that\nvery night he rolled off\u2019n a shed wher\u2019 he was a layin drunk, and broke\nhis arm.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, that\u2019s awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?\u201d\n\n\u201cLord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right\nstiddy, they\u2019re a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when\nthey mumble they\u2019re saying the Lord\u2019s Prayer backards.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo-night. I reckon they\u2019ll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they buried him Saturday. Didn\u2019t they get him Saturday night?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?\u2014and\n_then_ it\u2019s Sunday. Devils don\u2019t slosh around much of a Sunday, I don\u2019t\nreckon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never thought of that. That\u2019s so. Lemme go with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course\u2014if you ain\u2019t afeard.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfeard! \u2019Tain\u2019t likely. Will you meow?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep\u2019 me\na-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says\n\u2018Dern that cat!\u2019 and so I hove a brick through his window\u2014but don\u2019t you\ntell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but\nI\u2019ll meow this time. Say\u2014what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing but a tick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you get him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOut in the woods.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll you take for him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to sell him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right. It\u2019s a mighty small tick, anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, anybody can run a tick down that don\u2019t belong to them. I\u2019m\nsatisfied with it. It\u2019s a good enough tick for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSho, there\u2019s ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of \u2019em if I wanted\nto.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you? Becuz you know mighty well you can\u2019t. This is a\npretty early tick, I reckon. It\u2019s the first one I\u2019ve seen this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, Huck\u2014I\u2019ll give you my tooth for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cLess see it.\u201d\n\nTom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed\nit wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:\n\n\u201cIs it genuwyne?\u201d\n\nTom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.\n\n\u201cWell, all right,\u201d said Huckleberry, \u201cit\u2019s a trade.\u201d\n\nTom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the\npinchbug\u2019s prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than\nbefore.\n\nWhen Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in\nbriskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He\nhung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like\nalacrity. The master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom\narm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The\ninterruption roused him.\n\n\u201cThomas Sawyer!\u201d\n\nTom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.\n\n\u201cSir!\u201d\n\n\u201cCome up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?\u201d\n\nTom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of\nyellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric\nsympathy of love; and by that form was _the only vacant place_ on the\ngirls\u2019 side of the school-house. He instantly said:\n\n\u201c_I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn!_\u201d\n\nThe master\u2019s pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of\nstudy ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his\nmind. The master said:\n\n\u201cYou\u2014you did what?\u201d\n\n\u201cStopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.\u201d\n\nThere was no mistaking the words.\n\n\u201cThomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever\nlistened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your\njacket.\u201d\n\nThe master\u2019s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches\nnotably diminished. Then the order followed:\n\n\u201cNow, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.\u201d\n\nThe titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but\nin reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe\nof his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good\nfortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched\nherself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and\nwhispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the\nlong, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.\n\nBy and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur\nrose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal\nfurtive glances at the girl. She observed it, \u201cmade a mouth\u201d at him\nand gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she\ncautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it\naway. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less\nanimosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it\nremain. Tom scrawled on his slate, \u201cPlease take it\u2014I got more.\u201d The\ngirl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw\nsomething on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time\nthe girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began\nto manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,\napparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt\nto see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she\ngave in and hesitatingly whispered:\n\n\u201cLet me see it.\u201d\n\nTom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends\nto it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl\u2019s\ninterest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything\nelse. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice\u2014make a man.\u201d\n\nThe artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He\ncould have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;\nshe was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful man\u2014now make me coming along.\u201d\n\nTom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed\nthe spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ever so nice\u2014I wish I could draw.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d whispered Tom, \u201cI\u2019ll learn you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, will you? When?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt noon. Do you go home to dinner?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay if you will.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood\u2014that\u2019s a whack. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecky Thatcher. What\u2019s yours? Oh, I know. It\u2019s Thomas Sawyer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the name they lick me by. I\u2019m Tom when I\u2019m good. You call me\nTom, will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nNow Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from\nthe girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom\nsaid:\n\n\u201cOh, it ain\u2019t anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo it ain\u2019t. You don\u2019t want to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I won\u2019t\u2014deed and deed and double deed won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t ever tell _any_body. Now let me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, _you_ don\u2019t want to see!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that you treat me so, I _will_ see.\u201d And she put her small hand\nupon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in\nearnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were\nrevealed: \u201c_I love you_.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you bad thing!\u201d And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and\nlooked pleased, nevertheless.\n\nJust at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his\near, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the\nhouse and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles\nfrom the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful\nmoments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But\nalthough Tom\u2019s ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.\n\nAs the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but\nthe turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the\nreading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and\nturned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into\ncontinents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and\ngot \u201cturned down,\u201d by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought\nup at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with\nostentation for months.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nThe harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas\nwandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed\nto him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead.\nThere was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days.\nThe drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed\nthe soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the\nflaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a\nshimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds\nfloated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible\nbut some cows, and they were asleep. Tom\u2019s heart ached to be free, or\nelse to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.\nHis hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of\ngratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively\nthe percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on\nthe long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that\namounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when\nhe started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and\nmade him take a new direction.\n\nTom\u2019s bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and\nnow he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in\nan instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn\nfriends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a\npin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.\nThe sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were\ninterfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit\nof the tick. So he put Joe\u2019s slate on the desk and drew a line down the\nmiddle of it from top to bottom.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cas long as he is on your side you can stir him up and\nI\u2019ll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,\nyou\u2019re to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, go ahead; start him up.\u201d\n\nThe tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe\nharassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This\nchange of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with\nabsorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the\ntwo heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all\nthings else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The\ntick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as\nanxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would\nhave victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom\u2019s fingers would\nbe twitching to begin, Joe\u2019s pin would deftly head him off, and keep\npossession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too\nstrong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in\na moment. Said he:\n\n\u201cTom, you let him alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir, it ain\u2019t fair; you just let him alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlame it, I ain\u2019t going to stir him much.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet him alone, I tell you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shall\u2014he\u2019s on my side of the line.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care whose tick he is\u2014he\u2019s on my side of the line, and you\nsha\u2019n\u2019t touch him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll just bet I will, though. He\u2019s my tick and I\u2019ll do what I\nblame please with him, or die!\u201d\n\nA tremendous whack came down on Tom\u2019s shoulders, and its duplicate on\nJoe\u2019s; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from\nthe two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been\ntoo absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile\nbefore when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them.\nHe had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed\nhis bit of variety to it.\n\nWhen school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered\nin her ear:\n\n\u201cPut on your bonnet and let on you\u2019re going home; and when you get to\nthe corner, give the rest of \u2019em the slip, and turn down through the\nlane and come back. I\u2019ll go the other way and come it over \u2019em the same\nway.\u201d\n\nSo the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with\nanother. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and\nwhen they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they\nsat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil\nand held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising\nhouse. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking.\nTom was swimming in bliss. He said:\n\n\u201cDo you love rats?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! I hate them!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I do, too\u2014_live_ ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your\nhead with a string.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you? I\u2019ve got some. I\u2019ll let you chew it awhile, but you must give\nit back to me.\u201d\n\nThat was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs\nagainst the bench in excess of contentment.\n\n\u201cWas you ever at a circus?\u201d said Tom.\n\n\u201cYes, and my pa\u2019s going to take me again some time, if I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\n\u201cI been to the circus three or four times\u2014lots of times. Church ain\u2019t\nshucks to a circus. There\u2019s things going on at a circus all the time.\nI\u2019m going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, are you! That will be nice. They\u2019re so lovely, all spotted up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s so. And they get slathers of money\u2014most a dollar a day, Ben\nRogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, engaged to be married.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you like to?\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon so. I don\u2019t know. What is it like?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike? Why it ain\u2019t like anything. You only just tell a boy you won\u2019t\never have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that\u2019s\nall. Anybody can do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cKiss? What do you kiss for?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, that, you know, is to\u2014well, they always do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, yes, everybody that\u2019s in love with each other. Do you remember\nwhat I wrote on the slate?\u201d\n\n\u201cYe\u2014yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI sha\u2019n\u2019t tell you.\u201d\n\n\u201cShall I tell _you_?\u201d\n\n\u201cYe\u2014yes\u2014but some other time.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not now\u2014to-morrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, _now_. Please, Becky\u2014I\u2019ll whisper it, I\u2019ll whisper it ever so\neasy.\u201d\n\nBecky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about\nher waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to\nher ear. And then he added:\n\n\u201cNow you whisper it to me\u2014just the same.\u201d\n\nShe resisted, for a while, and then said:\n\n\u201cYou turn your face away so you can\u2019t see, and then I will. But you\nmustn\u2019t ever tell anybody\u2014_will_ you, Tom? Now you won\u2019t, _will_ you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, indeed, indeed I won\u2019t. Now, Becky.\u201d\n\nHe turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred\nhis curls and whispered, \u201cI\u2014love\u2014you!\u201d\n\nThen she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,\nwith Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little\nwhite apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:\n\n\u201cNow, Becky, it\u2019s all done\u2014all over but the kiss. Don\u2019t you be afraid\nof that\u2014it ain\u2019t anything at all. Please, Becky.\u201d And he tugged at her\napron and the hands.\n\nBy and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing\nwith the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and\nsaid:\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain\u2019t\never to love anybody but me, and you ain\u2019t ever to marry anybody but me,\never never and forever. Will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I\u2019ll never marry anybody\nbut you\u2014and you ain\u2019t to ever marry anybody but me, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly. Of course. That\u2019s _part_ of it. And always coming to school\nor when we\u2019re going home, you\u2019re to walk with me, when there ain\u2019t\nanybody looking\u2014and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because\nthat\u2019s the way you do when you\u2019re engaged.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so nice. I never heard of it before.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence\u2014\u201d\n\nThe big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.\n\n\u201cOh, Tom! Then I ain\u2019t the first you\u2019ve ever been engaged to!\u201d\n\nThe child began to cry. Tom said:\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t cry, Becky, I don\u2019t care for her any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you do, Tom\u2014you know you do.\u201d\n\nTom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and\nturned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with\nsoothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was\nup, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and\nuneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping\nshe would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began\nto feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle\nwith him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and\nentered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with\nher face to the wall. Tom\u2019s heart smote him. He went to her and stood a\nmoment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:\n\n\u201cBecky, I\u2014I don\u2019t care for anybody but you.\u201d\n\nNo reply\u2014but sobs.\n\n\u201cBecky\u201d\u2014pleadingly. \u201cBecky, won\u2019t you say something?\u201d\n\nMore sobs.\n\nTom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron,\nand passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:\n\n\u201cPlease, Becky, won\u2019t you take it?\u201d\n\nShe struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over\nthe hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently\nBecky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she\nflew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:\n\n\u201cTom! Come back, Tom!\u201d\n\nShe listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions\nbut silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid\nherself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she\nhad to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross\nof a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers about\nher to exchange sorrows with.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nTom dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the\ntrack of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed\na small \u201cbranch\u201d two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile\nsuperstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later\nhe was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff\nHill, and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the\nvalley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to\nthe centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.\nThere was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even\nstilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken\nby no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and\nthis seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the\nmore profound. The boy\u2019s soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings\nwere in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows\non his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him\nthat life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy\nHodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie\nand slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through\nthe trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and\nnothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a\nclean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with\nit all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant\nthe best in the world, and been treated like a dog\u2014like a very dog. She\nwould be sorry some day\u2014maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only\ndie _temporarily_!\n\nBut the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained\nshape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into\nthe concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and\ndisappeared mysteriously? What if he went away\u2014ever so far away, into\nunknown countries beyond the seas\u2014and never came back any more! How\nwould she feel then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only\nto fill him with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights\nwere an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was\nexalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be\na soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious.\nNo\u2014better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on\nthe warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the\nFar West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with\nfeathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy\nsummer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs\nof all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was\nsomething gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it!\n_now_ his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable\nsplendor. How his name would fill the world, and make people shudder!\nHow gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low,\nblack-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying\nat the fore! And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear\nat the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in\nhis black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson\nsash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass\nat his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled,\nwith the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy\nthe whisperings, \u201cIt\u2019s Tom Sawyer the Pirate!\u2014the Black Avenger of the\nSpanish Main!\u201d\n\nYes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from\nhome and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore\nhe must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together.\nHe went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of\nit with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He\nput his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:\n\n\u201cWhat hasn\u2019t come here, come! What\u2019s here, stay here!\u201d\n\nThen he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it\nup and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides\nwere of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom\u2019s astonishment was boundless!\nHe scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:\n\n\u201cWell, that beats anything!\u201d\n\nThen he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The\ntruth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and\nall his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried\na marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a\nfortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just\nused, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered\nthemselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been\nseparated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed.\nTom\u2019s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had\nmany a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing\nbefore. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times\nbefore, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He\npuzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch\nhad interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself\non that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot\nwith a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and\nput his mouth close to this depression and called\u2014\n\n\u201cDoodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,\ndoodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!\u201d\n\nThe sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a\nsecond and then darted under again in a fright.\n\n\u201cHe dasn\u2019t tell! So it _was_ a witch that done it. I just knowed it.\u201d\n\nHe well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he\ngave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have\nthe marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a\npatient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to his\ntreasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing\nwhen he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his\npocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:\n\n\u201cBrother, go find your brother!\u201d\n\nHe watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must\nhave fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last\nrepetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each\nother.\n\nJust here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green\naisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned\na suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,\ndisclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and\nin a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged,\nwith fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an\nanswering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way\nand that. He said cautiously\u2014to an imaginary company:\n\n\u201cHold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.\u201d\n\nNow appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.\nTom called:\n\n\u201cHold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?\u201d\n\n\u201cGuy of Guisborne wants no man\u2019s pass. Who art thou that\u2014that\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDares to hold such language,\u201d said Tom, prompting\u2014for they talked \u201cby\nthe book,\u201d from memory.\n\n\u201cWho art thou that dares to hold such language?\u201d\n\n\u201cI, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute\nwith thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!\u201d\n\nThey took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,\nstruck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful\ncombat, \u201ctwo up and two down.\u201d Presently Tom said:\n\n\u201cNow, if you\u2019ve got the hang, go it lively!\u201d\n\nSo they \u201cwent it lively,\u201d panting and perspiring with the work. By and\nby Tom shouted:\n\n\u201cFall! fall! Why don\u2019t you fall?\u201d\n\n\u201cI sha\u2019n\u2019t! Why don\u2019t you fall yourself? You\u2019re getting the worst of\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, that ain\u2019t anything. I can\u2019t fall; that ain\u2019t the way it is in the\nbook. The book says, \u2018Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy\nof Guisborne.\u2019 You\u2019re to turn around and let me hit you in the back.\u201d\n\nThere was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the\nwhack and fell.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Joe, getting up, \u201cyou got to let me kill _you_. That\u2019s\nfair.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, I can\u2019t do that, it ain\u2019t in the book.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s blamed mean\u2014that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller\u2019s son, and lam\nme with a quarter-staff; or I\u2019ll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be\nRobin Hood a little while and kill me.\u201d\n\nThis was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then\nTom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to\nbleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe,\nrepresenting a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,\ngave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, \u201cWhere this arrow\nfalls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.\u201d Then he\nshot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle\nand sprang up too gaily for a corpse.\n\nThe boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off\ngrieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern\ncivilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.\nThey said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than\nPresident of the United States forever.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nAt half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.\nThey said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and\nwaited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be\nnearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He\nwould have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was\nafraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark.\nEverything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little,\nscarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking\nof the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack\nmysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad.\nA measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly\u2019s chamber. And now the\ntiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate,\nbegan. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the\nbed\u2019s head made Tom shudder\u2014it meant that somebody\u2019s days were numbered.\nThen the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered\nby a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last\nhe was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to\ndoze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear\nit. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most\nmelancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed\nhim. A cry of \u201cScat! you devil!\u201d and the crash of an empty bottle\nagainst the back of his aunt\u2019s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a\nsingle minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping\nalong the roof of the \u201cell\u201d on all fours. He \u201cmeow\u2019d\u201d with caution once\nor twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence\nto the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys\nmoved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they\nwere wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.\n\nIt was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill,\nabout a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence\naround it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the\ntime, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the\nwhole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a\ntombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over\nthe graves, leaning for support and finding none. \u201cSacred to the memory\nof\u201d So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have\nbeen read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.\n\nA faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the\nspirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked\nlittle, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the\npervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the\nsharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the\nprotection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of\nthe grave.\n\nThen they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of\na distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom\u2019s\nreflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a\nwhisper:\n\n\u201cHucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?\u201d\n\nHuckleberry whispered:\n\n\u201cI wisht I knowed. It\u2019s awful solemn like, _ain\u2019t_ it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet it is.\u201d\n\nThere was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter\ninwardly. Then Tom whispered:\n\n\u201cSay, Hucky\u2014do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?\u201d\n\n\u201cO\u2019 course he does. Least his sperrit does.\u201d\n\nTom, after a pause:\n\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody\ncalls him Hoss.\u201d\n\n\u201cA body can\u2019t be too partic\u2019lar how they talk \u2019bout these-yer dead\npeople, Tom.\u201d\n\nThis was a damper, and conversation died again.\n\nPresently Tom seized his comrade\u2019s arm and said:\n\n\u201cSh!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it, Tom?\u201d And the two clung together with beating hearts.\n\n\u201cSh! There \u2019tis again! Didn\u2019t you hear it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere! Now you hear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLord, Tom, they\u2019re coming! They\u2019re coming, sure. What\u2019ll we do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dono. Think they\u2019ll see us?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn\u2019t\ncome.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be afeard. I don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll bother us. We ain\u2019t doing\nany harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won\u2019t notice us at\nall.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I\u2019m all of a shiver.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen!\u201d\n\nThe boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled\nsound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.\n\n\u201cLook! See there!\u201d whispered Tom. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.\u201d\n\nSome vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an\nold-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable\nlittle spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a\nshudder:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the devils sure enough. Three of \u2019em! Lordy, Tom, we\u2019re goners!\nCan you pray?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try, but don\u2019t you be afeard. They ain\u2019t going to hurt us. \u2018Now I\nlay me down to sleep, I\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSh!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it, Huck?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re _humans_! One of \u2019em is, anyway. One of \u2019em\u2019s old Muff Potter\u2019s\nvoice.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014\u2019tain\u2019t so, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet I know it. Don\u2019t you stir nor budge. He ain\u2019t sharp enough to\nnotice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely\u2014blamed old rip!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll keep still. Now they\u2019re stuck. Can\u2019t find it. Here they\ncome again. Now they\u2019re hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They\u2019re\np\u2019inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o\u2019 them voices; it\u2019s\nInjun Joe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so\u2014that murderin\u2019 half-breed! I\u2019d druther they was devils a dern\nsight. What kin they be up to?\u201d\n\nThe whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the\ngrave and stood within a few feet of the boys\u2019 hiding-place.\n\n\u201cHere it is,\u201d said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern\nup and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.\n\nPotter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple\nof shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open the grave.\nThe doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat\ndown with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so close the\nboys could have touched him.\n\n\u201cHurry, men!\u201d he said, in a low voice; \u201cthe moon might come out at any\nmoment.\u201d\n\nThey growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no\nnoise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of\nmould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon\nthe coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two\nthe men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with\ntheir shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The\nmoon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.\nThe barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a\nblanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a large\nspring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:\n\n\u201cNow the cussed thing\u2019s ready, Sawbones, and you\u2019ll just out with\nanother five, or here she stays.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the talk!\u201d said Injun Joe.\n\n\u201cLook here, what does this mean?\u201d said the doctor. \u201cYou required your\npay in advance, and I\u2019ve paid you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and you done more than that,\u201d said Injun Joe, approaching the\ndoctor, who was now standing. \u201cFive years ago you drove me away from\nyour father\u2019s kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to\neat, and you said I warn\u2019t there for any good; and when I swore I\u2019d get\neven with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for\na vagrant. Did you think I\u2019d forget? The Injun blood ain\u2019t in me for\nnothing. And now I\u2019ve _got_ you, and you got to _settle_, you know!\u201d\n\nHe was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time.\nThe doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.\nPotter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:\n\n\u201cHere, now, don\u2019t you hit my pard!\u201d and the next moment he had grappled\nwith the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main,\ntrampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe\nsprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter\u2019s\nknife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about\nthe combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung\nhimself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams\u2019 grave and felled\nPotter to the earth with it\u2014and in the same instant the half-breed saw\nhis chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man\u2019s breast. He\nreeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in\nthe same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the\ntwo frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.\n\nPresently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the\ntwo forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave\na long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:\n\n\u201c_That_ score is settled\u2014damn you.\u201d\n\nThen he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter\u2019s\nopen right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three\u2014four\u2014five\nminutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed\nupon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a\nshudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and\nthen around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe\u2019s.\n\n\u201cLord, how is this, Joe?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dirty business,\u201d said Joe, without moving.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do it for?\u201d\n\n\u201cI! I never done it!\u201d\n\n\u201cLook here! That kind of talk won\u2019t wash.\u201d\n\nPotter trembled and grew white.\n\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d got sober. I\u2019d no business to drink to-night. But it\u2019s\nin my head yet\u2014worse\u2019n when we started here. I\u2019m all in a muddle;\ncan\u2019t recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe\u2014_honest_, now,\nold feller\u2014did I do it? Joe, I never meant to\u2014\u2019pon my soul and honor, I\nnever meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it\u2019s awful\u2014and him so\nyoung and promising.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard\nand you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering\nlike, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched\nyou another awful clip\u2014and here you\u2019ve laid, as dead as a wedge til\nnow.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I\ndid. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon.\nI never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I\u2019ve fought, but never\nwith weepons. They\u2019ll all say that. Joe, don\u2019t tell! Say you won\u2019t tell,\nJoe\u2014that\u2019s a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you,\ntoo. Don\u2019t you remember? You _won\u2019t_ tell, _will_ you, Joe?\u201d And the\npoor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and\nclasped his appealing hands.\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019ve always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I\nwon\u2019t go back on you. There, now, that\u2019s as fair as a man can say.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Joe, you\u2019re an angel. I\u2019ll bless you for this the longest day I\nlive.\u201d And Potter began to cry.\n\n\u201cCome, now, that\u2019s enough of that. This ain\u2019t any time for blubbering.\nYou be off yonder way and I\u2019ll go this. Move, now, and don\u2019t leave any\ntracks behind you.\u201d\n\nPotter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed\nstood looking after him. He muttered:\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he\nhad the look of being, he won\u2019t think of the knife till he\u2019s gone so\nfar he\u2019ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by\nhimself\u2014chicken-heart!\u201d\n\nTwo or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the\nlidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the\nmoon\u2019s. The stillness was complete again, too.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nThe two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with\nhorror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,\napprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump\nthat started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them\ncatch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay\nnear the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give\nwings to their feet.\n\n\u201cIf we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!\u201d whispered\nTom, in short catches between breaths. \u201cI can\u2019t stand it much longer.\u201d\n\nHuckleberry\u2019s hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed\ntheir eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.\nThey gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst\nthrough the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering\nshadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:\n\n\u201cHuckleberry, what do you reckon\u2019ll come of this?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging\u2019ll come of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you though?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, I _know_ it, Tom.\u201d\n\nTom thought a while, then he said:\n\n\u201cWho\u2019ll tell? We?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? S\u2019pose something happened and Injun Joe\n_didn\u2019t_ hang? Why, he\u2019d kill us some time or other, just as dead sure\nas we\u2019re a laying here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he\u2019s fool enough. He\u2019s\ngenerally drunk enough.\u201d\n\nTom said nothing\u2014went on thinking. Presently he whispered:\n\n\u201cHuck, Muff Potter don\u2019t know it. How can he tell?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the reason he don\u2019t know it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019d just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D\u2019you reckon\nhe could see anything? D\u2019you reckon he knowed anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy hokey, that\u2019s so, Tom!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd besides, look-a-here\u2014maybe that whack done for _him_!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, \u2019taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and\nbesides, he always has. Well, when pap\u2019s full, you might take and belt\nhim over the head with a church and you couldn\u2019t phase him. He says so,\nhis own self. So it\u2019s the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man\nwas dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.\u201d\n\nAfter another reflective silence, Tom said:\n\n\u201cHucky, you sure you can keep mum?\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, we _got_ to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn\u2019t\nmake any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak\n\u2019bout this and they didn\u2019t hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take\nand swear to one another\u2014that\u2019s what we got to do\u2014swear to keep mum.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m agreed. It\u2019s the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear\nthat we\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, that wouldn\u2019t do for this. That\u2019s good enough for little\nrubbishy common things\u2014specially with gals, cuz _they_ go back on you\nanyway, and blab if they get in a huff\u2014but there orter be writing \u2019bout\na big thing like this. And blood.\u201d\n\nTom\u2019s whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful;\nthe hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it.\nHe picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a\nlittle fragment of \u201cred keel\u201d out of his pocket, got the moon on\nhis work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow\ndown-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the\npressure on the up-strokes.\n\n  \u201cHuck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and\n   They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell\n   and Rot.\u201d\n\nHuckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom\u2019s facility in writing, and\nthe sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and\nwas going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:\n\n\u201cHold on! Don\u2019t do that. A pin\u2019s brass. It might have verdigrease on\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s verdigrease?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s p\u2019ison. That\u2019s what it is. You just swaller some of it once\u2014you\u2019ll\nsee.\u201d\n\nSo Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked\nthe ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after\nmany squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his\nlittle finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and\nan F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the\nwall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters\nthat bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown\naway.\n\nA figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined\nbuilding, now, but they did not notice it.\n\n\u201cTom,\u201d whispered Huckleberry, \u201cdoes this keep us from _ever_\ntelling\u2014_always_?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it does. It don\u2019t make any difference _what_ happens, we got\nto keep mum. We\u2019d drop down dead\u2014don\u2019t _you_ know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I reckon that\u2019s so.\u201d\n\nThey continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up\na long, lugubrious howl just outside\u2014within ten feet of them. The boys\nclasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.\n\n\u201cWhich of us does he mean?\u201d gasped Huckleberry.\n\n\u201cI dono\u2014peep through the crack. Quick!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, _you_, Tom!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t _do_ it, Huck!\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, Tom. There \u2019tis again!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, lordy, I\u2019m thankful!\u201d whispered Tom. \u201cI know his voice. It\u2019s Bull\nHarbison.\u201d *\n\n[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of\nhim as \u201cHarbison\u2019s Bull,\u201d but a son or a dog of that name was \u201cBull\nHarbison.\u201d]\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s good\u2014I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I\u2019d a bet\nanything it was a _stray_ dog.\u201d\n\nThe dog howled again. The boys\u2019 hearts sank once more.\n\n\u201cOh, my! that ain\u2019t no Bull Harbison!\u201d whispered Huckleberry. \u201c_Do_,\nTom!\u201d\n\nTom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His\nwhisper was hardly audible when he said:\n\n\u201cOh, Huck, _it\u2019s a stray dog_!\u201d\n\n\u201cQuick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, he must mean us both\u2014we\u2019re right together.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Tom, I reckon we\u2019re goners. I reckon there ain\u2019t no mistake \u2019bout\nwhere _I\u2019ll_ go to. I been so wicked.\u201d\n\n\u201cDad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a\nfeller\u2019s told _not_ to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I\u2019d a\ntried\u2014but no, I wouldn\u2019t, of course. But if ever I get off this time,\nI lay I\u2019ll just _waller_ in Sunday-schools!\u201d And Tom began to snuffle a\nlittle.\n\n\u201c_You_ bad!\u201d and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. \u201cConsound it, Tom\nSawyer, you\u2019re just old pie, \u2019long-side o\u2019 what I am. Oh, _lordy_,\nlordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.\u201d\n\nTom choked off and whispered:\n\n\u201cLook, Hucky, look! He\u2019s got his _back_ to us!\u201d\n\nHucky looked, with joy in his heart.\n\n\u201cWell, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you\nknow. _Now_ who can he mean?\u201d\n\nThe howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.\n\n\u201cSh! What\u2019s that?\u201d he whispered.\n\n\u201cSounds like\u2014like hogs grunting. No\u2014it\u2019s somebody snoring, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat _is_ it! Where \u2019bouts is it, Huck?\u201d\n\n\u201cI bleeve it\u2019s down at \u2019tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep\nthere, sometimes, \u2019long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts\nthings when _he_ snores. Besides, I reckon he ain\u2019t ever coming back to\nthis town any more.\u201d\n\nThe spirit of adventure rose in the boys\u2019 souls once more.\n\n\u201cHucky, do you das\u2019t to go if I lead?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to, much. Tom, s\u2019pose it\u2019s Injun Joe!\u201d\n\nTom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the\nboys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their\nheels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down,\nthe one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the\nsnorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man\nmoaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was\nMuff Potter. The boys\u2019 hearts had stood still, and their hopes too,\nwhen the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tip-toed out,\nthrough the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance\nto exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night\nair again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few\nfeet of where Potter was lying, and _facing_ Potter, with his nose\npointing heavenward.\n\n\u201cOh, geeminy, it\u2019s _him_!\u201d exclaimed both boys, in a breath.\n\n\u201cSay, Tom\u2014they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller\u2019s\nhouse, \u2019bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come\nin and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there\nain\u2019t anybody dead there yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I know that. And suppose there ain\u2019t. Didn\u2019t Gracie Miller fall\nin the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but she ain\u2019t _dead_. And what\u2019s more, she\u2019s getting better, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, you wait and see. She\u2019s a goner, just as dead sure as Muff\nPotter\u2019s a goner. That\u2019s what the niggers say, and they know all about\nthese kind of things, Huck.\u201d\n\nThen they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window\nthe night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and\nfell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He\nwas not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for\nan hour.\n\nWhen Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the\nlight, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not\nbeen called\u2014persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled\nhim with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs,\nfeeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had\nfinished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted\neyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill\nto the culprit\u2019s heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it\nwas up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into\nsilence and let his heart sink down to the depths.\n\nAfter breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in\nthe hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt\nwept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so;\nand finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs\nwith sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more.\nThis was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom\u2019s heart was sorer now\nthan his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform\nover and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that\nhe had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble\nconfidence.\n\nHe left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward\nSid; and so the latter\u2019s prompt retreat through the back gate was\nunnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,\nalong with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the\nair of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to\ntrifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his\ndesk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony\nstare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.\nHis elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time\nhe slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with\na sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal\nsigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!\n\nThis final feather broke the camel\u2019s back.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nClose upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified\nwith the ghastly news. No need of the as yet un-dreamed-of telegraph;\nthe tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house,\nwith little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave\nholiday for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of\nhim if he had not.\n\nA gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been\nrecognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter\u2014so the story ran. And\nit was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself\nin the \u201cbranch\u201d about one or two o\u2019clock in the morning, and that Potter\nhad at once sneaked off\u2014suspicious circumstances, especially the washing\nwhich was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town had\nbeen ransacked for this \u201cmurderer\u201d (the public are not slow in the\nmatter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he\ncould not be found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every\ndirection, and the Sheriff \u201cwas confident\u201d that he would be captured\nbefore night.\n\nAll the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom\u2019s heartbreak\nvanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not\na thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,\nunaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he\nwormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle.\nIt seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody pinched\nhis arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry\u2019s. Then both looked\nelsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their\nmutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly\nspectacle before them.\n\n\u201cPoor fellow!\u201d \u201cPoor young fellow!\u201d \u201cThis ought to be a lesson to grave\nrobbers!\u201d \u201cMuff Potter\u2019ll hang for this if they catch him!\u201d This was the\ndrift of remark; and the minister said, \u201cIt was a judgment; His hand is\nhere.\u201d\n\nNow Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid\nface of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,\nand voices shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s him! it\u2019s him! he\u2019s coming himself!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho? Who?\u201d from twenty voices.\n\n\u201cMuff Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cHallo, he\u2019s stopped!\u2014Look out, he\u2019s turning! Don\u2019t let him get away!\u201d\n\nPeople in the branches of the trees over Tom\u2019s head said he wasn\u2019t\ntrying to get away\u2014he only looked doubtful and perplexed.\n\n\u201cInfernal impudence!\u201d said a bystander; \u201cwanted to come and take a quiet\nlook at his work, I reckon\u2014didn\u2019t expect any company.\u201d\n\nThe crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously\nleading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow\u2019s face was haggard, and\nhis eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the\nmurdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands\nand burst into tears.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do it, friends,\u201d he sobbed; \u201c\u2019pon my word and honor I never\ndone it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s accused you?\u201d shouted a voice.\n\nThis shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around\nhim with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and\nexclaimed:\n\n\u201cOh, Injun Joe, you promised me you\u2019d never\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that your knife?\u201d and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.\n\nPotter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the\nground. Then he said:\n\n\u201cSomething told me \u2019t if I didn\u2019t come back and get\u2014\u201d He shuddered; then\nwaved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, \u201cTell \u2019em,\nJoe, tell \u2019em\u2014it ain\u2019t any use any more.\u201d\n\nThen Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the\nstony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every\nmoment that the clear sky would deliver God\u2019s lightnings upon his head,\nand wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had\nfinished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to\nbreak their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner\u2019s life faded and\nvanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and\nit would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you leave? What did you want to come here for?\u201d somebody\nsaid.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it\u2014I couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d Potter moaned. \u201cI wanted to\nrun away, but I couldn\u2019t seem to come anywhere but here.\u201d And he fell to\nsobbing again.\n\nInjun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes\nafterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the\nlightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that\nJoe had sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the most\nbalefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could\nnot take their fascinated eyes from his face.\n\nThey inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should\noffer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.\n\nInjun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in\na wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering\ncrowd that the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy\ncircumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were\ndisappointed, for more than one villager remarked:\n\n\u201cIt was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.\u201d\n\nTom\u2019s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as\nmuch as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:\n\n\u201cTom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me\nawake half the time.\u201d\n\nTom blanched and dropped his eyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad sign,\u201d said Aunt Polly, gravely. \u201cWhat you got on your mind,\nTom?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing. Nothing \u2019t I know of.\u201d But the boy\u2019s hand shook so that he\nspilled his coffee.\n\n\u201cAnd you do talk such stuff,\u201d Sid said. \u201cLast night you said, \u2018It\u2019s\nblood, it\u2019s blood, that\u2019s what it is!\u2019 You said that over and over.\nAnd you said, \u2018Don\u2019t torment me so\u2014I\u2019ll tell!\u2019 Tell _what_? What is it\nyou\u2019ll tell?\u201d\n\nEverything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have\nhappened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly\u2019s face\nand she came to Tom\u2019s relief without knowing it. She said:\n\n\u201cSho! It\u2019s that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night\nmyself. Sometimes I dream it\u2019s me that done it.\u201d\n\nMary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied.\nTom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after\nthat he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every\nnight. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently\nslipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good\nwhile at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place\nagain. Tom\u2019s distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew\nirksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of\nTom\u2019s disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.\n\nIt seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding\ninquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind.\nSid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries,\nthough it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises;\nhe noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness\u2014and that was strange;\nand Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion\nto these inquests, and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled,\nbut said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and\nceased to torture Tom\u2019s conscience.\n\nEvery day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his\nopportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such\nsmall comforts through to the \u201cmurderer\u201d as he could get hold of. The\njail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge\nof the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it\nwas seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom\u2019s\nconscience.\n\nThe villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride\nhim on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character\nthat nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the\nmatter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of his\ninquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery\nthat preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in\nthe courts at present.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nOne of the reasons why Tom\u2019s mind had drifted away from its secret\ntroubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest\nitself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had\nstruggled with his pride a few days, and tried to \u201cwhistle her down the\nwind,\u201d but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father\u2019s\nhouse, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she\nshould die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an\ninterest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there\nwas nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;\nthere was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to\ntry all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who\nare infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of\nproducing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in\nthese things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a\nfever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing,\nbut on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the\n\u201cHealth\u201d periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance\nthey were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the \u201crot\u201d they\ncontained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up,\nand what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and\nwhat frame of mind to keep one\u2019s self in, and what sort of clothing\nto wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her\nhealth-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they\nhad recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest\nas the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered\ntogether her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed\nwith death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with\n\u201chell following after.\u201d But she never suspected that she was not an\nangel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering\nneighbors.\n\nThe water treatment was new, now, and Tom\u2019s low condition was a windfall\nto her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the\nwood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed\nhim down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she\nrolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she\nsweated his soul clean and \u201cthe yellow stains of it came through his\npores\u201d\u2014as Tom said.\n\nYet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and\npale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and\nplunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the\nwater with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his\ncapacity as she would a jug\u2019s, and filled him up every day with quack\ncure-alls.\n\nTom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase\nfilled the old lady\u2019s heart with consternation. This indifference must\nbe broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first\ntime. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with\ngratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water\ntreatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer.\nShe gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the\nresult. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again;\nfor the \u201cindifference\u201d was broken up. The boy could not have shown a\nwilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.\n\nTom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be\nromantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have\ntoo little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he\nthought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of\nprofessing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he\nbecame a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and\nquit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings\nto alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle\nclandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it\ndid not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in\nthe sitting-room floor with it.\n\nOne day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt\u2019s yellow\ncat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging\nfor a taste. Tom said:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask for it unless you want it, Peter.\u201d\n\nBut Peter signified that he did want it.\n\n\u201cYou better make sure.\u201d\n\nPeter was sure.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019ve asked for it, and I\u2019ll give it to you, because there ain\u2019t\nanything mean about me; but if you find you don\u2019t like it, you mustn\u2019t\nblame anybody but your own self.\u201d\n\nPeter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down\nthe Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then\ndelivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging\nagainst furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next\nhe rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment,\nwith his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his\nunappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again\nspreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time\nto see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah,\nand sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots\nwith him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over\nher glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.\n\n\u201cTom, what on earth ails that cat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, aunt,\u201d gasped the boy.\n\n\u201cWhy, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?\u201d\n\n\u201cDeed I don\u2019t know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they\u2019re having a\ngood time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do, do they?\u201d There was something in the tone that made Tom\napprehensive.\n\n\u201cYes\u2019m. That is, I believe they do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou _do_?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2019m.\u201d\n\nThe old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized\nby anxiety. Too late he divined her \u201cdrift.\u201d The handle of the telltale\ntea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it\nup. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual\nhandle\u2014his ear\u2014and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.\n\n\u201cNow, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?\u201d\n\n\u201cI done it out of pity for him\u2014because he hadn\u2019t any aunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cHadn\u2019t any aunt!\u2014you numskull. What has that got to do with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHeaps. Because if he\u2019d had one she\u2019d a burnt him out herself! She\u2019d a\nroasted his bowels out of him \u2019thout any more feeling than if he was a\nhuman!\u201d\n\nAunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in\na new light; what was cruelty to a cat _might_ be cruelty to a boy, too.\nShe began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she\nput her hand on Tom\u2019s head and said gently:\n\n\u201cI was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it _did_ do you good.\u201d\n\nTom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping\nthrough his gravity.\n\n\u201cI know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It\ndone _him_ good, too. I never see him get around so since\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, go \u2019long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try\nand see if you can\u2019t be a good boy, for once, and you needn\u2019t take any\nmore medicine.\u201d\n\nTom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing\nhad been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late,\nhe hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his\ncomrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to\nbe looking everywhere but whither he really was looking\u2014down the road.\nPresently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom\u2019s face lighted; he gazed\na moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom\naccosted him; and \u201cled up\u201d warily to opportunities for remark about\nBecky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and\nwatched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the\nowner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks\nceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered\nthe empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed\nin at the gate, and Tom\u2019s heart gave a great bound. The next instant he\nwas out, and \u201cgoing on\u201d like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys,\njumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings,\nstanding on his head\u2014doing all the heroic things he could conceive of,\nand keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher\nwas noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never\nlooked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there?\nHe carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping\naround, snatched a boy\u2019s cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse,\nbroke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and\nfell sprawling, himself, under Becky\u2019s nose, almost upsetting her\u2014and\nshe turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: \u201cMf! some\npeople think they\u2019re mighty smart\u2014always showing off!\u201d\n\nTom\u2019s cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and\ncrestfallen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nTom\u2019s mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a\nforsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out\nwhat they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried\nto do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing\nwould do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame\n_him_ for the consequences\u2014why shouldn\u2019t they? What right had the\nfriendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would\nlead a life of crime. There was no choice.\n\nBy this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to\n\u201ctake up\u201d tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he\nshould never, never hear that old familiar sound any more\u2014it was very\nhard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold\nworld, he must submit\u2014but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick and\nfast.\n\nJust at this point he met his soul\u2019s sworn comrade, Joe\nHarper\u2014hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his\nheart. Plainly here were \u201ctwo souls with but a single thought.\u201d Tom,\nwiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about\na resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by\nroaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping\nthat Joe would not forget him.\n\nBut it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going\nto make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother\nhad whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and\nknew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished\nhim to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but\nsuccumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her\npoor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.\n\nAs the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand\nby each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved\nthem of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for\nbeing a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying,\nsome time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he\nconceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of\ncrime, and so he consented to be a pirate.\n\nThree miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River\nwas a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island,\nwith a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a\nrendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further\nshore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson\u2019s\nIsland was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a\nmatter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn,\nand he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was\nindifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the\nriver-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour\u2014which was\nmidnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture.\nEach would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal\nin the most dark and mysterious way\u2014as became outlaws. And before the\nafternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of\nspreading the fact that pretty soon the town would \u201chear something.\u201d All\nwho got this vague hint were cautioned to \u201cbe mum and wait.\u201d\n\nAbout midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,\nand stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the\nmeeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay\nlike an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the\nquiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under\nthe bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the\nsame way. Then a guarded voice said:\n\n\u201cWho goes there?\u201d\n\n\u201cTom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.\u201d Tom\nhad furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.\n\n\u201c\u2019Tis well. Give the countersign.\u201d\n\nTwo hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the\nbrooding night:\n\n\u201c_Blood_!\u201d\n\nThen Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,\ntearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was\nan easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked\nthe advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.\n\nThe Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn\nhimself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a\nskillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought\na few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or\n\u201cchewed\u201d but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it\nwould never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought;\nmatches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering\nupon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily\nthither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing\nadventure of it, saying, \u201cHist!\u201d every now and then, and suddenly\nhalting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts;\nand giving orders in dismal whispers that if \u201cthe foe\u201d stirred, to \u201clet\nhim have it to the hilt,\u201d because \u201cdead men tell no tales.\u201d They knew\nwell enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying\nin stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their\nconducting this thing in an unpiratical way.\n\nThey shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and\nJoe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded\narms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:\n\n\u201cLuff, and bring her to the wind!\u201d\n\n\u201cAye-aye, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cSteady, steady-y-y-y!\u201d\n\n\u201cSteady it is, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet her go off a point!\u201d\n\n\u201cPoint it is, sir!\u201d\n\nAs the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream\nit was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for\n\u201cstyle,\u201d and were not intended to mean anything in particular.\n\n\u201cWhat sail\u2019s she carrying?\u201d\n\n\u201cCourses, tops\u2019ls, and flying-jib, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend the r\u2019yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of\nye\u2014foretopmaststuns\u2019l! Lively, now!\u201d\n\n\u201cAye-aye, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cShake out that maintogalans\u2019l! Sheets and braces! _now_ my hearties!\u201d\n\n\u201cAye-aye, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cHellum-a-lee\u2014hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port,\nport! _Now_, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!\u201d\n\n\u201cSteady it is, sir!\u201d\n\nThe raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head\nright, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was\nnot more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during\nthe next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before\nthe distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay,\npeacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water,\nunconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black\nAvenger stood still with folded arms, \u201clooking his last\u201d upon the scene\nof his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing \u201cshe\u201d could see\nhim now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless\nheart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but\na small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson\u2019s Island beyond\neye-shot of the village, and so he \u201clooked his last\u201d with a broken and\nsatisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and\nthey all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift\nthem out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in\ntime, and made shift to avert it. About two o\u2019clock in the morning the\nraft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,\nand they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part\nof the little raft\u2019s belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they\nspread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions;\nbut they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as\nbecame outlaws.\n\nThey built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps\nwithin the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in\nthe frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn \u201cpone\u201d stock\nthey had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild,\nfree way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,\nfar from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to\ncivilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy\nglare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the\nvarnished foliage and festooning vines.\n\nWhen the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance\nof corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,\nfilled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but\nthey would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting\ncampfire.\n\n\u201c_Ain\u2019t_ it gay?\u201d said Joe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s _nuts_!\u201d said Tom. \u201cWhat would the boys say if they could see us?\u201d\n\n\u201cSay? Well, they\u2019d just die to be here\u2014hey, Hucky!\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon so,\u201d said Huckleberry; \u201canyways, I\u2019m suited. I don\u2019t want\nnothing better\u2019n this. I don\u2019t ever get enough to eat, gen\u2019ally\u2014and here\nthey can\u2019t come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the life for me,\u201d said Tom. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to get up,\nmornings, and you don\u2019t have to go to school, and wash, and all that\nblame foolishness. You see a pirate don\u2019t have to do _anything_, Joe,\nwhen he\u2019s ashore, but a hermit _he_ has to be praying considerable, and\nthen he don\u2019t have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, that\u2019s so,\u201d said Joe, \u201cbut I hadn\u2019t thought much about it, you\nknow. I\u2019d a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I\u2019ve tried it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d said Tom, \u201cpeople don\u2019t go much on hermits, nowadays, like\nthey used to in old times, but a pirate\u2019s always respected. And\na hermit\u2019s got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put\nsackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?\u201d inquired Huck.\n\n\u201cI dono. But they\u2019ve _got_ to do it. Hermits always do. You\u2019d have to do\nthat if you was a hermit.\u201d\n\n\u201cDern\u2019d if I would,\u201d said Huck.\n\n\u201cWell, what would you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dono. But I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, Huck, you\u2019d _have_ to. How\u2019d you get around it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, I just wouldn\u2019t stand it. I\u2019d run away.\u201d\n\n\u201cRun away! Well, you _would_ be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You\u2019d be\na disgrace.\u201d\n\nThe Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished\ngouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with\ntobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of\nfragrant smoke\u2014he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The\nother pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to\nacquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:\n\n\u201cWhat does pirates have to do?\u201d\n\nTom said:\n\n\u201cOh, they have just a bully time\u2014take ships and burn them, and get the\nmoney and bury it in awful places in their island where there\u2019s ghosts\nand things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships\u2014make \u2019em walk a\nplank.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they carry the women to the island,\u201d said Joe; \u201cthey don\u2019t kill the\nwomen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d assented Tom, \u201cthey don\u2019t kill the women\u2014they\u2019re too noble. And\nthe women\u2019s always beautiful, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver\nand di\u2019monds,\u201d said Joe, with enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d said Huck.\n\n\u201cWhy, the pirates.\u201d\n\nHuck scanned his own clothing forlornly.\n\n\u201cI reckon I ain\u2019t dressed fitten for a pirate,\u201d said he, with a\nregretful pathos in his voice; \u201cbut I ain\u2019t got none but these.\u201d\n\nBut the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,\nafter they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand\nthat his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for\nwealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.\n\nGradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the\neyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the\nRed-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.\nThe Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had\nmore difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly,\nand lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them\nkneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at\nall, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they\nmight call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at\nonce they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep\u2014but an\nintruder came, now, that would not \u201cdown.\u201d It was conscience. They began\nto feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and\nnext they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came.\nThey tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had\npurloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not\nto be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the\nend, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking\nsweetmeats was only \u201chooking,\u201d while taking bacon and hams and such\nvaluables was plain simple stealing\u2014and there was a command against that\nin the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in\nthe business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the\ncrime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously\ninconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nWhen Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and\nrubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool\ngray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the\ndeep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not\na sound obtruded upon great Nature\u2019s meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood\nupon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire,\nand a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck\nstill slept.\n\nNow, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently\nthe hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray\nof the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life\nmanifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going\nto work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came\ncrawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air\nfrom time to time and \u201csniffing around,\u201d then proceeding again\u2014for he\nwas measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own\naccord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,\nby turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to\ngo elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its\ncurved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom\u2019s leg and\nbegan a journey over him, his whole heart was glad\u2014for that meant that\nhe was going to have a new suit of clothes\u2014without the shadow of a\ndoubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared,\nfrom nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled\nmanfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,\nand lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed\nthe dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and\nsaid, \u201cLady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your\nchildren\u2019s alone,\u201d and she took wing and went off to see about it\u2014which\ndid not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was\ncredulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity\nmore than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and\nTom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body\nand pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A\ncatbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom\u2019s head, and trilled\nout her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then\na shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig\nalmost within the boy\u2019s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the\nstrangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow\nof the \u201cfox\u201d kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to\ninspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never\nseen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.\nAll Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight\npierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few\nbutterflies came fluttering upon the scene.\n\nTom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with\na shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and\ntumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white\nsandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the\ndistance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a\nslight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only\ngratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge\nbetween them and civilization.\n\nThey came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and\nravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a\nspring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak\nor hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood\ncharm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While Joe\nwas slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a\nminute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in\ntheir lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time\nto get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass,\na couple of sun-perch and a small catfish\u2014provisions enough for quite a\nfamily. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for\nno fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the\nquicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better\nhe is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping,\nopen-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.\n\nThey lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,\nand then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They\ntramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush,\namong solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the\nground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came\nupon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.\n\nThey found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be\nastonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles\nlong and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to\nwas only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards\nwide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle\nof the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too hungry to\nstop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw\nthemselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag,\nand then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods,\nand the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys.\nThey fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This\ntook dim shape, presently\u2014it was budding homesickness. Even Finn the\nRed-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they\nwere all ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak\nhis thought.\n\nFor some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar\nsound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a\nclock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound\nbecame more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started,\nglanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude. There\nwas a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came\nfloating down out of the distance.\n\n\u201cWhat is it!\u201d exclaimed Joe, under his breath.\n\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d said Tom in a whisper.\n\n\u201c\u2019Tain\u2019t thunder,\u201d said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, \u201cbecuz thunder\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHark!\u201d said Tom. \u201cListen\u2014don\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\nThey waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom\ntroubled the solemn hush.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go and see.\u201d\n\nThey sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They\nparted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little\nsteam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the\ncurrent. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great\nmany skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood\nof the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in\nthem were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the\nferryboat\u2019s side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same\ndull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.\n\n\u201cI know now!\u201d exclaimed Tom; \u201csomebody\u2019s drownded!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d said Huck; \u201cthey done that last summer, when Bill Turner\ngot drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes\nhim come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put\nquicksilver in \u2019em and set \u2019em afloat, and wherever there\u2019s anybody\nthat\u2019s drownded, they\u2019ll float right there and stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard about that,\u201d said Joe. \u201cI wonder what makes the bread\ndo that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it ain\u2019t the bread, so much,\u201d said Tom; \u201cI reckon it\u2019s mostly what\nthey _say_ over it before they start it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they don\u2019t say anything over it,\u201d said Huck. \u201cI\u2019ve seen \u2019em and\nthey don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s funny,\u201d said Tom. \u201cBut maybe they say it to themselves. Of\n_course_ they do. Anybody might know that.\u201d\n\nThe other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because\nan ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not\nbe expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such\ngravity.\n\n\u201cBy jings, I wish I was over there, now,\u201d said Joe.\n\n\u201cI do too,\u201d said Huck. \u201cI\u2019d give heaps to know who it is.\u201d\n\nThe boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought\nflashed through Tom\u2019s mind, and he exclaimed:\n\n\u201cBoys, I know who\u2019s drownded\u2014it\u2019s us!\u201d\n\nThey felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they\nwere missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account;\ntears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor\nlost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being\nindulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town,\nand the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was\nconcerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.\n\nAs twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business\nand the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were\njubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble\nthey were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then\nfell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them;\nand the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were\ngratifying to look upon\u2014from their point of view. But when the shadows\nof night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing\ninto the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The\nexcitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts\nof certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as\nmuch as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a\nsigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a\nroundabout \u201cfeeler\u201d as to how the others might look upon a return to\ncivilization\u2014not right now, but\u2014\n\nTom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined\nin with Tom, and the waverer quickly \u201cexplained,\u201d and was glad to get\nout of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness\nclinging to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to\nrest for the moment.\n\nAs the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore.\nJoe followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time,\nwatching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees,\nand went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung\nby the campfire. He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders\nof the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed\nto suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something\nupon each of these with his \u201cred keel\u201d; one he rolled up and put in his\njacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe\u2019s hat and removed it to a\nlittle distance from the owner. And he also put into the hat certain\nschoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value\u2014among them a lump of\nchalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind\nof marbles known as a \u201csure \u2019nough crystal.\u201d Then he tiptoed his way\ncautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and\nstraightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nA few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward\nthe Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway\nover; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out\nconfidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering\nupstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had\nexpected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till\nhe found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket\npocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods,\nfollowing the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten\no\u2019clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the\nferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything\nwas quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching\nwith all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes\nand climbed into the skiff that did \u201cyawl\u201d duty at the boat\u2019s stern. He\nlaid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.\n\nPresently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to \u201ccast\noff.\u201d A minute or two later the skiff\u2019s head was standing high up,\nagainst the boat\u2019s swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in\nhis success, for he knew it was the boat\u2019s last trip for the night. At\nthe end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and\nTom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards\ndownstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.\n\nHe flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his\naunt\u2019s back fence. He climbed over, approached the \u201cell,\u201d and looked\nin at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There\nsat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper\u2019s mother, grouped together,\ntalking. They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the\ndoor. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then\nhe pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing\ncautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might\nsqueeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,\nwarily.\n\n\u201cWhat makes the candle blow so?\u201d said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. \u201cWhy,\nthat door\u2019s open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange\nthings now. Go \u2019long and shut it, Sid.\u201d\n\nTom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and \u201cbreathed\u201d\n himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his\naunt\u2019s foot.\n\n\u201cBut as I was saying,\u201d said Aunt Polly, \u201che warn\u2019t _bad_, so to say\u2014only\nmisch_ee_vous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn\u2019t\nany more responsible than a colt. _He_ never meant any harm, and he was\nthe best-hearted boy that ever was\u201d\u2014and she began to cry.\n\n\u201cIt was just so with my Joe\u2014always full of his devilment, and up to\nevery kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he\ncould be\u2014and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking\nthat cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because\nit was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never, never,\nnever, poor abused boy!\u201d And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would\nbreak.\n\n\u201cI hope Tom\u2019s better off where he is,\u201d said Sid, \u201cbut if he\u2019d been\nbetter in some ways\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c_Sid!_\u201d Tom felt the glare of the old lady\u2019s eye, though he could not\nsee it. \u201cNot a word against my Tom, now that he\u2019s gone! God\u2019ll take care\nof _him_\u2014never you trouble _your_self, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don\u2019t\nknow how to give him up! I don\u2019t know how to give him up! He was such a\ncomfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, \u2019most.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away\u2014Blessed be the name of\nthe Lord! But it\u2019s so hard\u2014Oh, it\u2019s so hard! Only last Saturday my Joe\nbusted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling.\nLittle did I know then, how soon\u2014Oh, if it was to do over again I\u2019d hug\nhim and bless him for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just\nexactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took\nand filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would\ntear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom\u2019s head with my\nthimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he\u2019s out of all his troubles now.\nAnd the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach\u2014\u201d\n\nBut this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely\ndown. Tom was snuffling, now, himself\u2014and more in pity of himself than\nanybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word\nfor him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself\nthan ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt\u2019s grief\nto long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy\u2014and\nthe theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his\nnature, too, but he resisted and lay still.\n\nHe went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was\nconjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim;\nthen the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing\nlads had promised that the village should \u201chear something\u201d soon; the\nwise-heads had \u201cput this and that together\u201d and decided that the lads\nhad gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below,\npresently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the\nMissouri shore some five or six miles below the village\u2014and then hope\nperished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home\nby nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the\nbodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must\nhave occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would\notherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the bodies\ncontinued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the\nfunerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered.\n\nMrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. Then with a\nmutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other\u2019s\narms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was\ntender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to Sid and Mary. Sid\nsnuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.\n\nAunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly,\nand with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,\nthat he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.\n\nHe had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making\nbroken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and\nturning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her\nsleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the\ncandle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full\nof pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the\ncandle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.\nHis face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark\nhastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and\nstraightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.\n\nHe threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large\nthere, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was\ntenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and\nslept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped\ninto it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a\nmile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself\nstoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for\nthis was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture\nthe skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore\nlegitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be\nmade for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and\nentered the woods.\n\nHe sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep\nawake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far\nspent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the\nisland bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the\ngreat river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream. A\nlittle later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and\nheard Joe say:\n\n\u201cNo, Tom\u2019s true-blue, Huck, and he\u2019ll come back. He won\u2019t desert. He\nknows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom\u2019s too proud for that\nsort of thing. He\u2019s up to something or other. Now I wonder what?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the things is ours, anyway, ain\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain\u2019t\nback here to breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich he is!\u201d exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping\ngrandly into camp.\n\nA sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the\nboys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.\nThey were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done.\nThen Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the\nother pirates got ready to fish and explore.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nAfter dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar.\nThey went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft\nplace they went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes\nthey would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly\nround white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a\nfamous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.\n\nAfter breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and\nchased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until\nthey were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal\nwater of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their\nlegs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.\nAnd now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each\nother\u2019s faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with\naverted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and\nstruggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all\nwent under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing,\nsputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.\n\nWhen they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry,\nhot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by\nbreak for the water again and go through the original performance once\nmore. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented\nflesh-colored \u201ctights\u201d very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and\nhad a circus\u2014with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest\npost to his neighbor.\n\nNext they got their marbles and played \u201cknucks\u201d and \u201cringtaw\u201d and\n\u201ckeeps\u201d till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another\nswim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off\nhis trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his\nankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the\nprotection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he\nhad found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to\nrest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the \u201cdumps,\u201d and\nfell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay\ndrowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing \u201cBECKY\u201d in the sand with\nhis big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his\nweakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He\nerased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving\nthe other boys together and joining them.\n\nBut Joe\u2019s spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so\nhomesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay\nvery near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted,\nbut tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready\nto tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he\nwould have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:\n\n\u201cI bet there\u2019s been pirates on this island before, boys. We\u2019ll explore\nit again. They\u2019ve hid treasures here somewhere. How\u2019d you feel to light\non a rotten chest full of gold and silver\u2014hey?\u201d\n\nBut it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply.\nTom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was\ndiscouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking\nvery gloomy. Finally he said:\n\n\u201cOh, boys, let\u2019s give it up. I want to go home. It\u2019s so lonesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, Joe, you\u2019ll feel better by and by,\u201d said Tom. \u201cJust think of the\nfishing that\u2019s here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care for fishing. I want to go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, Joe, there ain\u2019t such another swimming-place anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cSwimming\u2019s no good. I don\u2019t seem to care for it, somehow, when there\nain\u2019t anybody to say I sha\u2019n\u2019t go in. I mean to go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I _do_ want to see my mother\u2014and you would, too, if you had one. I\nain\u2019t any more baby than you are.\u201d And Joe snuffled a little.\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won\u2019t we, Huck? Poor\nthing\u2014does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here,\ndon\u2019t you, Huck? We\u2019ll stay, won\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nHuck said, \u201cY-e-s\u201d\u2014without any heart in it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never speak to you again as long as I live,\u201d said Joe, rising.\n\u201cThere now!\u201d And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.\n\n\u201cWho cares!\u201d said Tom. \u201cNobody wants you to. Go \u2019long home and get\nlaughed at. Oh, you\u2019re a nice pirate. Huck and me ain\u2019t crybabies. We\u2019ll\nstay, won\u2019t we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get\nalong without him, per\u2019aps.\u201d\n\nBut Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly\non with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying\nJoe\u2019s preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence.\nPresently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the\nIllinois shore. Tom\u2019s heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck\ncould not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:\n\n\u201cI want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now\nit\u2019ll be worse. Let\u2019s us go, too, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, I better go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, go \u2019long\u2014who\u2019s hendering you.\u201d\n\nHuck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:\n\n\u201cTom, I wisht you\u2019d come, too. Now you think it over. We\u2019ll wait for you\nwhen we get to shore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ll wait a blame long time, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nHuck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a\nstrong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along\ntoo. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It\nsuddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made\none final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades,\nyelling:\n\n\u201cWait! Wait! I want to tell you something!\u201d\n\nThey presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they\nwere, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till\nat last they saw the \u201cpoint\u201d he was driving at, and then they set up a\nwarwhoop of applause and said it was \u201csplendid!\u201d and said if he had\ntold them at first, they wouldn\u2019t have started away. He made a plausible\nexcuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret\nwould keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had\nmeant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.\n\nThe lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will,\nchattering all the time about Tom\u2019s stupendous plan and admiring the\ngenius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to\nlearn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to\ntry, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never\nsmoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they \u201cbit\u201d the\ntongue, and were not considered manly anyway.\n\nNow they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,\ncharily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste,\nand they gagged a little, but Tom said:\n\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s just as easy! If I\u2019d a knowed this was all, I\u2019d a learnt long\nago.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo would I,\u201d said Joe. \u201cIt\u2019s just nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, many a time I\u2019ve looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish\nI could do that; but I never thought I could,\u201d said Tom.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the way with me, hain\u2019t it, Huck? You\u2019ve heard me talk just\nthat way\u2014haven\u2019t you, Huck? I\u2019ll leave it to Huck if I haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014heaps of times,\u201d said Huck.\n\n\u201cWell, I have too,\u201d said Tom; \u201coh, hundreds of times. Once down by the\nslaughter-house. Don\u2019t you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and\nJohnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don\u2019t you remember,\nHuck, \u2019bout me saying that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s so,\u201d said Huck. \u201cThat was the day after I lost a white\nalley. No, \u2019twas the day before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2014I told you so,\u201d said Tom. \u201cHuck recollects it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,\u201d said Joe. \u201cI don\u2019t feel\nsick.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither do I,\u201d said Tom. \u201cI could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff\nThatcher couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cJeff Thatcher! Why, he\u2019d keel over just with two draws. Just let him\ntry it once. _He\u2019d_ see!\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet he would. And Johnny Miller\u2014I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle\nit once.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t I!\u201d said Joe. \u201cWhy, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn\u2019t any more\ndo this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch _him_.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Deed it would, Joe. Say\u2014I wish the boys could see us now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo do I.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay\u2014boys, don\u2019t say anything about it, and some time when they\u2019re\naround, I\u2019ll come up to you and say, \u2018Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.\u2019\nAnd you\u2019ll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn\u2019t anything, you\u2019ll\nsay, \u2018Yes, I got my _old_ pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain\u2019t\nvery good.\u2019 And I\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s all right, if it\u2019s _strong_\nenough.\u2019 And then you\u2019ll out with the pipes, and we\u2019ll light up just as\nca\u2019m, and then just see \u2019em look!\u201d\n\n\u201cBy jings, that\u2019ll be gay, Tom! I wish it was _now_!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo do I! And when we tell \u2019em we learned when we was off pirating,\nwon\u2019t they wish they\u2019d been along?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I reckon not! I\u2019ll just _bet_ they will!\u201d\n\nSo the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and\ngrow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously\nincreased. Every pore inside the boys\u2019 cheeks became a spouting\nfountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues\nfast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their\nthroats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings\nfollowed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,\nnow. Joe\u2019s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom\u2019s followed. Both\nfountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and\nmain. Joe said feebly:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.\u201d\n\nTom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you. You go over that way and I\u2019ll hunt around by the spring.\nNo, you needn\u2019t come, Huck\u2014we can find it.\u201d\n\nSo Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,\nand went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both\nvery pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had\nhad any trouble they had got rid of it.\n\nThey were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,\nand when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare\ntheirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well\u2014something they ate\nat dinner had disagreed with them.\n\nAbout midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding\noppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys\nhuddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of\nthe fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was\nstifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued.\nBeyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the\nblackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that\nvaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by\nanother came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came\nsighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting\nbreath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit\nof the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned\nnight into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and\ndistinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,\nstartled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling\ndown the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A\nsweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the\nflaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the\nforest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops\nright over the boys\u2019 heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick\ngloom that followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves.\n\n\u201cQuick! boys, go for the tent!\u201d exclaimed Tom.\n\nThey sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no\ntwo plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through\nthe trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after\nanother came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching\nrain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the\nground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the\nbooming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one\nthey straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared,\nand streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something\nto be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so\nfuriously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest\nrose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its\nfastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each\nothers\u2019 hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter\nof a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its\nhighest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed\nin the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless\ndistinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the\ndriving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on\nthe other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting\nveil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight\nand fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging\nthunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp,\nand unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort\nthat seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to\nthe treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one\nand the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be\nout in.\n\nBut at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and\nweaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The\nboys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still\nsomething to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter\nof their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were\nnot under it when the catastrophe happened.\n\nEverything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but\nheedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against\nrain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and\nchilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently\ndiscovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had\nbeen built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from\nthe ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they\npatiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under\nsides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they\npiled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were\ngladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast,\nand after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their\nmidnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep\non, anywhere around.\n\nAs the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over\nthem, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got\nscorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After\nthe meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once\nmore. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as\nhe could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or\nanything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of\ncheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was\nto knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change.\nThey were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were\nstripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many\nzebras\u2014all of them chiefs, of course\u2014and then they went tearing through\nthe woods to attack an English settlement.\n\nBy and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each\nother from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each\nother by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely\nsatisfactory one.\n\nThey assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now\na difficulty arose\u2014hostile Indians could not break the bread of\nhospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple\nimpossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other\nprocess that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished\nthey had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such\nshow of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and\ntook their whiff as it passed, in due form.\n\nAnd behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had\ngained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without\nhaving to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to\nbe seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high\npromise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper,\nwith right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were\nprouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been\nin the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We will leave them to\nsmoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at\npresent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nBut there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil Saturday\nafternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly\u2019s family, were being put into\nmourning, with great grief and many tears. An unusual quiet possessed\nthe village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience.\nThe villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air, and talked\nlittle; but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to\nthe children. They had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them\nup.\n\nIn the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted\nschoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found nothing\nthere to comfort her. She soliloquized:\n\n\u201cOh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven\u2019t got\nanything now to remember him by.\u201d And she choked back a little sob.\n\nPresently she stopped, and said to herself:\n\n\u201cIt was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn\u2019t say\nthat\u2014I wouldn\u2019t say it for the whole world. But he\u2019s gone now; I\u2019ll\nnever, never, never see him any more.\u201d\n\nThis thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling\ndown her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls\u2014playmates of Tom\u2019s\nand Joe\u2019s\u2014came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and talking\nin reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw\nhim, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with awful\nprophecy, as they could easily see now!)\u2014and each speaker pointed out\nthe exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and then added\nsomething like \u201cand I was a-standing just so\u2014just as I am now, and as if\nyou was him\u2014I was as close as that\u2014and he smiled, just this way\u2014and then\nsomething seemed to go all over me, like\u2014awful, you know\u2014and I never\nthought what it meant, of course, but I can see now!\u201d\n\nThen there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and\nmany claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or\nless tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided\nwho _did_ see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them,\nthe lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance,\nand were gaped at and envied by all the rest. One poor chap, who had\nno other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the\nremembrance:\n\n\u201cWell, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.\u201d\n\nBut that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that,\nand so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered away,\nstill recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.\n\nWhen the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell\nbegan to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still\nSabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush\nthat lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment\nin the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there\nwas no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses\nas the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. None\ncould remember when the little church had been so full before. There\nwas finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly\nentered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in\ndeep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose\nreverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.\nThere was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled\nsobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving\nhymn was sung, and the text followed: \u201cI am the Resurrection and the\nLife.\u201d\n\nAs the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the\ngraces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that\nevery soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang\nin remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always\nbefore, and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor\nboys. The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the\ndeparted, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the\npeople could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes\nwere, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had\nseemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The congregation\nbecame more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last\nthe whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus\nof anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and\ncrying in the pulpit.\n\nThere was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later\nthe church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above\nhis handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then another pair\nof eyes followed the minister\u2019s, and then almost with one impulse the\ncongregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up\nthe aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags,\nsneaking sheepishly in the rear! They had been hid in the unused gallery\nlistening to their own funeral sermon!\n\nAunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored\nones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while\npoor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what\nto do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and\nstarted to slink away, but Tom seized him and said:\n\n\u201cAunt Polly, it ain\u2019t fair. Somebody\u2019s got to be glad to see Huck.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so they shall. I\u2019m glad to see him, poor motherless thing!\u201d And\nthe loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing\ncapable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.\n\nSuddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: \u201cPraise God from\nwhom all blessings flow\u2014_sing_!\u2014and put your hearts in it!\u201d\n\nAnd they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and\nwhile it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the\nenvying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the\nproudest moment of his life.\n\nAs the \u201csold\u201d congregation trooped out they said they would almost be\nwilling to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that\nonce more.\n\nTom got more cuffs and kisses that day\u2014according to Aunt Polly\u2019s varying\nmoods\u2014than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew which\nexpressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nThat was Tom\u2019s great secret\u2014the scheme to return home with his brother\npirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to the\nMissouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six miles\nbelow the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town\ntill nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and alleys\nand finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of\ninvalided benches.\n\nAt breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to\nTom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of\ntalk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody\nsuffering \u2019most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you\ncould be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come over\non a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a\nhint some way that you warn\u2019t dead, but only run off.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you could have done that, Tom,\u201d said Mary; \u201cand I believe you\nwould if you had thought of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you, Tom?\u201d said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. \u201cSay,\nnow, would you, if you\u2019d thought of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014well, I don\u2019t know. \u2019Twould \u2019a\u2019 spoiled everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, I hoped you loved me that much,\u201d said Aunt Polly, with a grieved\ntone that discomforted the boy. \u201cIt would have been something if you\u2019d\ncared enough to _think_ of it, even if you didn\u2019t _do_ it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, auntie, that ain\u2019t any harm,\u201d pleaded Mary; \u201cit\u2019s only Tom\u2019s giddy\nway\u2014he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore\u2019s the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and\n_done_ it, too. Tom, you\u2019ll look back, some day, when it\u2019s too late,\nand wish you\u2019d cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so\nlittle.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, auntie, you know I do care for you,\u201d said Tom.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d know it better if you acted more like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish now I\u2019d thought,\u201d said Tom, with a repentant tone; \u201cbut I dreamt\nabout you, anyway. That\u2019s something, ain\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t much\u2014a cat does that much\u2014but it\u2019s better than nothing. What\ndid you dream?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the\nbed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, so we did. So we always do. I\u2019m glad your dreams could take even\nthat much trouble about us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I dreamt that Joe Harper\u2019s mother was here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, she was here! Did you dream any more?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, lots. But it\u2019s so dim, now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, try to recollect\u2014can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomehow it seems to me that the wind\u2014the wind blowed the\u2014the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTry harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!\u201d\n\nTom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then\nsaid:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it now! I\u2019ve got it now! It blowed the candle!\u201d\n\n\u201cMercy on us! Go on, Tom\u2014go on!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it seems to me that you said, \u2018Why, I believe that that door\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cGo _on_, Tom!\u201d\n\n\u201cJust let me study a moment\u2014just a moment. Oh, yes\u2014you said you believed\nthe door was open.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m sitting here, I did! Didn\u2019t I, Mary! Go on!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then\u2014and then\u2014well I won\u2019t be certain, but it seems like as if you\nmade Sid go and\u2014and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made him\u2014you\u2014Oh, you made him shut it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, for the land\u2019s sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my\ndays! Don\u2019t tell _me_ there ain\u2019t anything in dreams, any more. Sereny\nHarper shall know of this before I\u2019m an hour older. I\u2019d like to see her\nget around _this_ with her rubbage \u2019bout superstition. Go on, Tom!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I warn\u2019t\n_bad_, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible\nthan\u2014than\u2014I think it was a colt, or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then you began to cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and\nshe wished she hadn\u2019t whipped him for taking cream when she\u2019d throwed it\nout her own self\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying\u2014that\u2019s what you\nwas doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen Sid he said\u2014he said\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I said anything,\u201d said Sid.\n\n\u201cYes you did, Sid,\u201d said Mary.\n\n\u201cShut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said\u2014I _think_ he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone\nto, but if I\u2019d been better sometimes\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c_There_, d\u2019you hear that! It was his very words!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you shut him up sharp.\u201d\n\n\u201cI lay I did! There must \u2019a\u2019 been an angel there. There _was_ an angel\nthere, somewheres!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you\ntold about Peter and the Pain-killer\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as true as I live!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then there was a whole lot of talk \u2019bout dragging the river for us,\nand \u2019bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper\nhugged and cried, and she went.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I\u2019m a-sitting in\nthese very tracks. Tom, you couldn\u2019t told it more like if you\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 seen\nit! And then what? Go on, Tom!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I thought you prayed for me\u2014and I could see you and hear every\nword you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and\nwrote on a piece of sycamore bark, \u2018We ain\u2019t dead\u2014we are only off being\npirates,\u2019 and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked\nso good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and\nkissed you on the lips.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you, Tom, _did_ you! I just forgive you everything for that!\u201d And\nshe seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the\nguiltiest of villains.\n\n\u201cIt was very kind, even though it was only a\u2014dream,\u201d Sid soliloquized\njust audibly.\n\n\u201cShut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he\u2019d do if he was\nawake. Here\u2019s a big Milum apple I\u2019ve been saving for you, Tom, if you\nwas ever found again\u2014now go \u2019long to school. I\u2019m thankful to the good\nGod and Father of us all I\u2019ve got you back, that\u2019s long-suffering and\nmerciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness\nknows I\u2019m unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings\nand had His hand to help them over the rough places, there\u2019s few enough\nwould smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes.\nGo \u2019long Sid, Mary, Tom\u2014take yourselves off\u2014you\u2019ve hendered me long\nenough.\u201d\n\nThe children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper\nand vanquish her realism with Tom\u2019s marvellous dream. Sid had better\njudgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the\nhouse. It was this: \u201cPretty thin\u2014as long a dream as that, without any\nmistakes in it!\u201d\n\nWhat a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing,\nbut moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the\npublic eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see\nthe looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and\ndrink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as proud\nto be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer\nat the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into\ntown. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at\nall; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would have\ngiven anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of his, and his\nglittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a\ncircus.\n\nAt school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered\nsuch eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were\nnot long in becoming insufferably \u201cstuck-up.\u201d They began to tell their\nadventures to hungry listeners\u2014but they only began; it was not a\nthing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish\nmaterial. And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely\npuffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.\n\nTom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory\nwas sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished,\nmaybe she would be wanting to \u201cmake up.\u201d Well, let her\u2014she should see\nthat he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she\narrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group\nof boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was\ntripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,\npretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter\nwhen she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her\ncaptures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye\nin his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity\nthat was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only \u201cset him up\u201d\n the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he\nknew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved\nirresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and\nwistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more\nparticularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang\nand grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her\nfeet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to\na girl almost at Tom\u2019s elbow\u2014with sham vivacity:\n\n\u201cWhy, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn\u2019t you come to Sunday-school?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did come\u2014didn\u2019t you see me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, no! Did you? Where did you sit?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was in Miss Peters\u2019 class, where I always go. I saw _you_.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you? Why, it\u2019s funny I didn\u2019t see you. I wanted to tell you about\nthe picnic.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s jolly. Who\u2019s going to give it?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy ma\u2019s going to let me have one.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, goody; I hope she\u2019ll let _me_ come.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, she will. The picnic\u2019s for me. She\u2019ll let anybody come that I\nwant, and I want you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ever so nice. When is it going to be?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy and by. Maybe about vacation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, won\u2019t it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, every one that\u2019s friends to me\u2014or wants to be\u201d; and she glanced\never so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence\nabout the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the\ngreat sycamore tree \u201call to flinders\u201d while he was \u201cstanding within\nthree feet of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, may I come?\u201d said Grace Miller.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd me?\u201d said Sally Rogers.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd me, too?\u201d said Susy Harper. \u201cAnd Joe?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nAnd so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged\nfor invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still\ntalking, and took Amy with him. Becky\u2019s lips trembled and the tears\ncame to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on\nchattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of\neverything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and\nhad what her sex call \u201ca good cry.\u201d Then she sat moody, with wounded\npride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast\nin her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what\n_she\u2019d_ do.\n\nAt recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant\nself-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate\nher with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden\nfalling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind\nthe schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple\u2014and so\nabsorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,\nthat they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.\nJealousy ran red-hot through Tom\u2019s veins. He began to hate himself for\nthrowing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He\ncalled himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He\nwanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,\nfor her heart was singing, but Tom\u2019s tongue had lost its function. He\ndid not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly\nhe could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced\nas otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and\nagain, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could\nnot help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that\nBecky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the\nliving. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her\nfight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.\n\nAmy\u2019s happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had\nto attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in\nvain\u2014the girl chirped on. Tom thought, \u201cOh, hang her, ain\u2019t I ever going\nto get rid of her?\u201d At last he must be attending to those things\u2014and she\nsaid artlessly that she would be \u201caround\u201d when school let out. And he\nhastened away, hating her for it.\n\n\u201cAny other boy!\u201d Tom thought, grating his teeth. \u201cAny boy in the whole\ntown but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is\naristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw this\ntown, mister, and I\u2019ll lick you again! You just wait till I catch you\nout! I\u2019ll just take and\u2014\u201d\n\nAnd he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy\u2014pummelling\nthe air, and kicking and gouging. \u201cOh, you do, do you? You holler\n\u2019nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!\u201d And so the imaginary\nflogging was finished to his satisfaction.\n\nTom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy\u2019s\ngrateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other\ndistress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the\nminutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to\ncloud and she lost interest; gravity and absentmindedness followed,\nand then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at\na footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew\nentirely miserable and wished she hadn\u2019t carried it so far. When\npoor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept\nexclaiming: \u201cOh, here\u2019s a jolly one! look at this!\u201d she lost patience at\nlast, and said, \u201cOh, don\u2019t bother me! I don\u2019t care for them!\u201d and burst\ninto tears, and got up and walked away.\n\nAlfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she\nsaid:\n\n\u201cGo away and leave me alone, can\u2019t you! I hate you!\u201d\n\nSo the boy halted, wondering what he could have done\u2014for she had said\nshe would look at pictures all through the nooning\u2014and she walked on,\ncrying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was\nhumiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth\u2014the girl\nhad simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.\nHe was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.\nHe wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much\nrisk to himself. Tom\u2019s spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his\nopportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and\npoured ink upon the page.\n\nBecky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,\nand moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now,\nintending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their\ntroubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she\nhad changed her mind. The thought of Tom\u2019s treatment of her when she was\ntalking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame.\nShe resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book\u2019s\naccount, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nTom arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said\nto him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising\nmarket:\n\n\u201cTom, I\u2019ve a notion to skin you alive!\u201d\n\n\u201cAuntie, what have I done?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old\nsofty, expecting I\u2019m going to make her believe all that rubbage about\nthat dream, when lo and behold you she\u2019d found out from Joe that you was\nover here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don\u2019t know\nwhat is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so\nbad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool\nof myself and never say a word.\u201d\n\nThis was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had\nseemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked\nmean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to\nsay for a moment. Then he said:\n\n\u201cAuntie, I wish I hadn\u2019t done it\u2014but I didn\u2019t think.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your\nown selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from\nJackson\u2019s Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could\nthink to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn\u2019t ever think\nto pity us and save us from sorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cAuntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn\u2019t mean to be mean. I didn\u2019t,\nhonest. And besides, I didn\u2019t come over here to laugh at you that\nnight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you come for, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn\u2019t got\ndrownded.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could\nbelieve you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never\ndid\u2014and I know it, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed and \u2019deed I did, auntie\u2014I wish I may never stir if I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Tom, don\u2019t lie\u2014don\u2019t do it. It only makes things a hundred times\nworse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t a lie, auntie; it\u2019s the truth. I wanted to keep you from\ngrieving\u2014that was all that made me come.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d give the whole world to believe that\u2014it would cover up a power\nof sins, Tom. I\u2019d \u2019most be glad you\u2019d run off and acted so bad. But it\nain\u2019t reasonable; because, why didn\u2019t you tell me, child?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all\nfull of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn\u2019t\nsomehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and\nkept mum.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat bark?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bark I had wrote on to tell you we\u2019d gone pirating. I wish, now,\nyou\u2019d waked up when I kissed you\u2014I do, honest.\u201d\n\nThe hard lines in his aunt\u2019s face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned\nin her eyes.\n\n\u201c_Did_ you kiss me, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, yes, I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure you did, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, yes, I did, auntie\u2014certain sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you kiss me for, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.\u201d\n\nThe words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in\nher voice when she said:\n\n\u201cKiss me again, Tom!\u2014and be off with you to school, now, and don\u2019t\nbother me any more.\u201d\n\nThe moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a\njacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her\nhand, and said to herself:\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t dare. Poor boy, I reckon he\u2019s lied about it\u2014but it\u2019s a\nblessed, blessed lie, there\u2019s such a comfort come from it. I hope\nthe Lord\u2014I _know_ the Lord will forgive him, because it was such\ngood-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don\u2019t want to find out it\u2019s a\nlie. I won\u2019t look.\u201d\n\nShe put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out\nher hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more\nshe ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought:\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good lie\u2014it\u2019s a good lie\u2014I won\u2019t let it grieve me.\u201d So she\nsought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom\u2019s piece of\nbark through flowing tears and saying: \u201cI could forgive the boy, now, if\nhe\u2019d committed a million sins!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nThere was something about Aunt Polly\u2019s manner, when she kissed Tom, that\nswept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again. He\nstarted to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the\nhead of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner. Without a\nmoment\u2019s hesitation he ran to her and said:\n\n\u201cI acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I\u2019m so sorry. I won\u2019t ever, ever\ndo that way again, as long as ever I live\u2014please make up, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nThe girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll thank you to keep yourself _to_ yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I\u2019ll\nnever speak to you again.\u201d\n\nShe tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not\neven presence of mind enough to say \u201cWho cares, Miss Smarty?\u201d until the\nright time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a\nfine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were\na boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently\nencountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled\none in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in\nher hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to \u201ctake in,\u201d\n she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book.\nIf she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple, Tom\u2019s\noffensive fling had driven it entirely away.\n\nPoor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.\nThe master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied\nambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but\npoverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village\nschoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and\nabsorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept\nthat book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was\nperishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy\nand girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories\nwere alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.\nNow, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she\nnoticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She\nglanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the\nbook in her hands. The titlepage\u2014Professor Somebody\u2019s _Anatomy_\u2014carried\nno information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She came at\nonce upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece\u2014a human figure,\nstark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer\nstepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky\nsnatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the\npictured page half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk,\nturned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.\n\n\u201cTom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person\nand look at what they\u2019re looking at.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could I know you was looking at anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you\u2019re\ngoing to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I\u2019ll be\nwhipped, and I never was whipped in school.\u201d\n\nThen she stamped her little foot and said:\n\n\u201c_Be_ so mean if you want to! I know something that\u2019s going to happen.\nYou just wait and you\u2019ll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!\u201d\u2014and she flung\nout of the house with a new explosion of crying.\n\nTom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said\nto himself:\n\n\u201cWhat a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in\nschool! Shucks! What\u2019s a licking! That\u2019s just like a girl\u2014they\u2019re so\nthin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain\u2019t going to tell\nold Dobbins on this little fool, because there\u2019s other ways of getting\neven on her, that ain\u2019t so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask\nwho it was tore his book. Nobody\u2019ll answer. Then he\u2019ll do just the way\nhe always does\u2014ask first one and then t\u2019other, and when he comes to the\nright girl he\u2019ll know it, without any telling. Girls\u2019 faces always tell\non them. They ain\u2019t got any backbone. She\u2019ll get licked. Well, it\u2019s a\nkind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain\u2019t any way\nout of it.\u201d Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: \u201cAll\nright, though; she\u2019d like to see me in just such a fix\u2014let her sweat it\nout!\u201d\n\nTom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the\nmaster arrived and school \u201ctook in.\u201d Tom did not feel a strong interest\nin his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls\u2019 side of the\nroom Becky\u2019s face troubled him. Considering all things, he did not want\nto pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He could get\nup no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently the\nspelling-book discovery was made, and Tom\u2019s mind was entirely full\nof his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her\nlethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She\ndid not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he\nspilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only\nseemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad\nof that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she\nwas not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse\nto get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced\nherself to keep still\u2014because, said she to herself, \u201che\u2019ll tell about me\ntearing the picture sure. I wouldn\u2019t say a word, not to save his life!\u201d\n\nTom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all\nbroken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly\nupset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout\u2014he\nhad denied it for form\u2019s sake and because it was custom, and had stuck\nto the denial from principle.\n\nA whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air\nwas drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened\nhimself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book,\nbut seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the\npupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched\nhis movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently\nfor a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!\nTom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit\nlook as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot\nhis quarrel with her. Quick\u2014something must be done! done in a flash,\ntoo! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.\nGood!\u2014he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring\nthrough the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little\ninstant, and the chance was lost\u2014the master opened the volume. If Tom\nonly had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help\nfor Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.\nEvery eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even\nthe innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten\u2014the\nmaster was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: \u201cWho tore this book?\u201d\n\nThere was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness\ncontinued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.\n\n\u201cBenjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?\u201d\n\nA denial. Another pause.\n\n\u201cJoseph Harper, did you?\u201d\n\nAnother denial. Tom\u2019s uneasiness grew more and more intense under the\nslow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of\nboys\u2014considered a while, then turned to the girls:\n\n\u201cAmy Lawrence?\u201d\n\nA shake of the head.\n\n\u201cGracie Miller?\u201d\n\nThe same sign.\n\n\u201cSusan Harper, did you do this?\u201d\n\nAnother negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling\nfrom head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the\nsituation.\n\n\u201cRebecca Thatcher\u201d [Tom glanced at her face\u2014it was white with\nterror]\u2014\u201cdid you tear\u2014no, look me in the face\u201d [her hands rose in\nappeal]\u2014\u201cdid you tear this book?\u201d\n\nA thought shot like lightning through Tom\u2019s brain. He sprang to his feet\nand shouted\u2014\u201cI done it!\u201d\n\nThe school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a\nmoment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward\nto go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that\nshone upon him out of poor Becky\u2019s eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred\nfloggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without\nan outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever\nadministered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a\ncommand to remain two hours after school should be dismissed\u2014for he\nknew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not\ncount the tedious time as loss, either.\n\nTom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for\nwith shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own\ntreachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to\npleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky\u2019s latest words\nlingering dreamily in his ear\u2014\n\n\u201cTom, how _could_ you be so noble!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nVacation was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer\nand more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good\nshowing on \u201cExamination\u201d day. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle\nnow\u2014at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young\nladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins\u2019 lashings\nwere very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a\nperfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there\nwas no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached,\nall the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a\nvindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence\nwas, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and\ntheir nights in plotting revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do\nthe master a mischief. But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution\nthat followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that\nthe boys always retired from the field badly worsted. At last they\nconspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory.\nThey swore in the signpainter\u2019s boy, told him the scheme, and asked his\nhelp. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded\nin his father\u2019s family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him.\nThe master\u2019s wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and\nthere would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always\nprepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and\nthe signpainter\u2019s boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper\ncondition on Examination Evening he would \u201cmanage the thing\u201d while he\nnapped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time\nand hurried away to school.\n\nIn the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in\nthe evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with\nwreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in\nhis great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.\nHe was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and\nsix rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town\nand by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of\ncitizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the\nscholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of\nsmall boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;\nrows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in\nlawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their\ngrandmothers\u2019 ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and\nthe flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with\nnon-participating scholars.\n\nThe exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited,\n\u201cYou\u2019d scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,\u201d\n etc.\u2014accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic\ngestures which a machine might have used\u2014supposing the machine to be a\ntrifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared,\nand got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and\nretired.\n\nA little shamefaced girl lisped, \u201cMary had a little lamb,\u201d etc.,\nperformed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and\nsat down flushed and happy.\n\nTom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into\nthe unquenchable and indestructible \u201cGive me liberty or give me death\u201d\n speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the\nmiddle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under\nhim and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the\nhouse but he had the house\u2019s silence, too, which was even worse than\nits sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom\nstruggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak\nattempt at applause, but it died early.\n\n\u201cThe Boy Stood on the Burning Deck\u201d followed; also \u201cThe Assyrian Came\nDown,\u201d and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises,\nand a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The\nprime feature of the evening was in order, now\u2014original \u201ccompositions\u201d\nby the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the\nplatform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty\nribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to \u201cexpression\u201d\nand punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon\nsimilar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and\ndoubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the\nCrusades. \u201cFriendship\u201d was one; \u201cMemories of Other Days\u201d; \u201cReligion in\nHistory\u201d; \u201cDream Land\u201d; \u201cThe Advantages of Culture\u201d; \u201cForms of Political\nGovernment Compared and Contrasted\u201d; \u201cMelancholy\u201d; \u201cFilial Love\u201d; \u201cHeart\nLongings,\u201d etc., etc.\n\nA prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted\nmelancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of \u201cfine language\u201d;\nanother was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words\nand phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that\nconspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable\nsermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of\nthem. No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was\nmade to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious\nmind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of\nthese sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the\nfashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will\nbe sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in all\nour land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their\ncompositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the\nmost frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the\nlongest and the most relentlessly pious. But enough of this. Homely\ntruth is unpalatable.\n\nLet us return to the \u201cExamination.\u201d The first composition that was read\nwas one entitled \u201cIs this, then, Life?\u201d Perhaps the reader can endure an\nextract from it:\n\n\u201cIn the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the\nyouthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity!\nImagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the\nvoluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, \u2018the\nobserved of all observers.\u2019 Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes,\nis whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest,\nher step is lightest in the gay assembly.\n\n\u201cIn such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour\narrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has\nhad such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her\nenchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the last. But\nafter a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is\nvanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly\nupon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and with wasted health\nand imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly\npleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!\u201d\n\nAnd so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to\ntime during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of \u201cHow\nsweet!\u201d \u201cHow eloquent!\u201d \u201cSo true!\u201d etc., and after the thing had closed\nwith a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.\n\nThen arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the \u201cinteresting\u201d\n paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a \u201cpoem.\u201d Two\nstanzas of it will do:\n\n\u201cA MISSOURI MAIDEN\u2019S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA\n\n\u201cAlabama, goodbye! I love thee well!\n    But yet for a while do I leave thee now!\nSad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,\n    And burning recollections throng my brow!\nFor I have wandered through thy flowery woods;\n    Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa\u2019s stream;\nHave listened to Tallassee\u2019s warring floods,\n    And wooed on Coosa\u2019s side Aurora\u2019s beam.\n\n\u201cYet shame I not to bear an o\u2019erfull heart,\n    Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;\n\u2019Tis from no stranger land I now must part,\n    \u2019Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.\nWelcome and home were mine within this State,\n    Whose vales I leave\u2014whose spires fade fast from me\nAnd cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and t\u00eate,\n    When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!\u201d\n\nThere were very few there who knew what \u201c_t\u00eate_\u201d meant, but the poem\nwas very satisfactory, nevertheless.\n\nNext appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady,\nwho paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began\nto read in a measured, solemn tone:\n\n                              A VISION\n\nDark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single\nstar quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly\nvibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry\nmood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the power\nexerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous\nwinds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered\nabout as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.\n\nAt such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit\nsighed; but instead thereof,\n\n     \u2018My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide\u2014\n     My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,\u2019 came to my side.\n\nShe moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks\nof fancy\u2019s Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned\nsave by her own transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it\nfailed to make even a sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by\nher genial touch, as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided\naway unperceived\u2014unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features,\nlike icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the\ncontending elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings\npresented.\n\nThis nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a\nsermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took\nthe first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest\neffort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize\nto the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by\nfar the most \u201celoquent\u201d thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel\nWebster himself might well be proud of it.\n\nIt may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which\nthe word \u201cbeauteous\u201d was over-fondled, and human experience referred to\nas \u201clife\u2019s page,\u201d was up to the usual average.\n\nNow the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair\naside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of\nAmerica on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he\nmade a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter\nrippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to\nright it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted\nthem more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his\nentire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down\nby the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined\nhe was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly\nincreased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced with\na scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat,\nsuspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about\nher head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she\ncurved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed\nat the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher\u2014the cat was\nwithin six inches of the absorbed teacher\u2019s head\u2014down, down, a little\nlower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it,\nand was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still\nin her possession! And how the light did blaze abroad from the master\u2019s\nbald pate\u2014for the signpainter\u2019s boy had _gilded_ it!\n\nThat broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.\n\n[*] NOTE:\u2014The pretended \u201ccompositions\u201d quoted in this chapter are taken\nwithout alteration from a volume entitled \u201cProse and Poetry, by a\nWestern Lady\u201d\u2014but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl\npattern, and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nTom joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the\nshowy character of their \u201cregalia.\u201d He promised to abstain from smoking,\nchewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he found out\na new thing\u2014namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way\nin the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon\nfound himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire\ngrew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display\nhimself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth\nof July was coming; but he soon gave that up\u2014gave it up before he had\nworn his shackles over forty-eight hours\u2014and fixed his hopes upon old\nJudge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed\nand would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official.\nDuring three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge\u2019s condition\nand hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high\u2014so high that\nhe would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the\nlooking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating.\nAt last he was pronounced upon the mend\u2014and then convalescent. Tom was\ndisgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation\nat once\u2014and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom\nresolved that he would never trust a man like that again.\n\nThe funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated\nto kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again,\nhowever\u2014there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now\u2014but\nfound to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he\ncould, took the desire away, and the charm of it.\n\nTom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning\nto hang a little heavily on his hands.\n\nHe attempted a diary\u2014but nothing happened during three days, and so he\nabandoned it.\n\nThe first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a\nsensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were happy\nfor two days.\n\nEven the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained\nhard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man\nin the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States\nSenator, proved an overwhelming disappointment\u2014for he was not\ntwenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.\n\nA circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents\nmade of rag carpeting\u2014admission, three pins for boys, two for girls\u2014and\nthen circusing was abandoned.\n\nA phrenologist and a mesmerizer came\u2014and went again and left the village\nduller and drearier than ever.\n\nThere were some boys-and-girls\u2019 parties, but they were so few and so\ndelightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.\n\nBecky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her\nparents during vacation\u2014so there was no bright side to life anywhere.\n\nThe dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very\ncancer for permanency and pain.\n\nThen came the measles.\n\nDuring two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its\nhappenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got\nupon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown, a melancholy change had\ncome over everything and every creature. There had been a \u201crevival,\u201d and\neverybody had \u201cgot religion,\u201d not only the adults, but even the boys and\ngirls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed\nsinful face, but disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Joe\nHarper studying a Testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing\nspectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him visiting the poor with a\nbasket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his attention to\nthe precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. Every boy\nhe encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in\ndesperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn\nand was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he\ncrept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost,\nforever and forever.\n\nAnd that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful\nclaps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his head\nwith the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for\nhe had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him.\nHe believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the\nextremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might have\nseemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a\nbattery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the\ngetting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from\nunder an insect like himself.\n\nBy and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its\nobject. The boy\u2019s first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His\nsecond was to wait\u2014for there might not be any more storms.\n\nThe next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks he\nspent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad\nat last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how\nlonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted\nlistlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a\njuvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her\nvictim, a bird. He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a\nstolen melon. Poor lads! they\u2014like Tom\u2014had suffered a relapse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nAt last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred\u2014and vigorously: the murder\ntrial came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village\ntalk immediately. Tom could not get away from it. Every reference to\nthe murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience\nand fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in\nhis hearing as \u201cfeelers\u201d; he did not see how he could be suspected of\nknowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable\nin the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the time.\nHe took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It would be some\nrelief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of\ndistress with another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself\nthat Huck had remained discreet.\n\n\u201cHuck, have you ever told anybody about\u2014that?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Bout what?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2014\u2019course I haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever a word?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I was afeard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn\u2019t be alive two days if that got found out.\n_You_ know that.\u201d\n\nTom felt more comfortable. After a pause:\n\n\u201cHuck, they couldn\u2019t anybody get you to tell, could they?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet me to tell? Why, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they\ncould get me to tell. They ain\u2019t no different way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s all right, then. I reckon we\u2019re safe as long as we keep\nmum. But let\u2019s swear again, anyway. It\u2019s more surer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m agreed.\u201d\n\nSo they swore again with dread solemnities.\n\n\u201cWhat is the talk around, Huck? I\u2019ve heard a power of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk? Well, it\u2019s just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the\ntime. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so\u2019s I want to hide som\u2019ers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he\u2019s a goner.\nDon\u2019t you feel sorry for him, sometimes?\u201d\n\n\u201cMost always\u2014most always. He ain\u2019t no account; but then he hain\u2019t ever\ndone anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to\nget drunk on\u2014and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do\nthat\u2014leastways most of us\u2014preachers and such like. But he\u2019s kind of\ngood\u2014he give me half a fish, once, when there warn\u2019t enough for two; and\nlots of times he\u2019s kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line.\nI wish we could get him out of there.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy! we couldn\u2019t get him out, Tom. And besides, \u2019twouldn\u2019t do any good;\nthey\u2019d ketch him again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014so they would. But I hate to hear \u2019em abuse him so like the dickens\nwhen he never done\u2014that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do too, Tom. Lord, I hear \u2019em say he\u2019s the bloodiest looking villain\nin this country, and they wonder he wasn\u2019t ever hung before.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, they talk like that, all the time. I\u2019ve heard \u2019em say that if he\nwas to get free they\u2019d lynch him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019d do it, too.\u201d\n\nThe boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the\ntwilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood\nof the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that\nsomething would happen that might clear away their difficulties. But\nnothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in\nthis luckless captive.\n\nThe boys did as they had often done before\u2014went to the cell grating and\ngave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor and\nthere were no guards.\n\nHis gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences\nbefore\u2014it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and\ntreacherous to the last degree when Potter said:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been mighty good to me, boys\u2014better\u2019n anybody else in this town.\nAnd I don\u2019t forget it, I don\u2019t. Often I says to myself, says I, \u2018I used\nto mend all the boys\u2019 kites and things, and show \u2019em where the good\nfishin\u2019 places was, and befriend \u2019em what I could, and now they\u2019ve\nall forgot old Muff when he\u2019s in trouble; but Tom don\u2019t, and Huck\ndon\u2019t\u2014_they_ don\u2019t forget him,\u2019 says I, \u2018and I don\u2019t forget them.\u2019 Well,\nboys, I done an awful thing\u2014drunk and crazy at the time\u2014that\u2019s the only\nway I account for it\u2014and now I got to swing for it, and it\u2019s right.\nRight, and _best_, too, I reckon\u2014hope so, anyway. Well, we won\u2019t talk\nabout that. I don\u2019t want to make _you_ feel bad; you\u2019ve befriended me.\nBut what I want to say, is, don\u2019t _you_ ever get drunk\u2014then you won\u2019t\never get here. Stand a litter furder west\u2014so\u2014that\u2019s it; it\u2019s a prime\ncomfort to see faces that\u2019s friendly when a body\u2019s in such a muck\nof trouble, and there don\u2019t none come here but yourn. Good friendly\nfaces\u2014good friendly faces. Git up on one another\u2019s backs and let me\ntouch \u2019em. That\u2019s it. Shake hands\u2014yourn\u2019ll come through the bars, but\nmine\u2019s too big. Little hands, and weak\u2014but they\u2019ve helped Muff Potter a\npower, and they\u2019d help him more if they could.\u201d\n\nTom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors.\nThe next day and the day after, he hung about the courtroom, drawn by an\nalmost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out.\nHuck was having the same experience. They studiously avoided each other.\nEach wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination\nalways brought them back presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers\nsauntered out of the courtroom, but invariably heard distressing\nnews\u2014the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor\nPotter. At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect\nthat Injun Joe\u2019s evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was\nnot the slightest question as to what the jury\u2019s verdict would be.\n\nTom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He\nwas in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to\nsleep. All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning, for\nthis was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented\nin the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took\ntheir places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and\nhopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all\nthe curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,\nstolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and\nthe sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings\namong the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These\ndetails and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation\nthat was as impressive as it was fascinating.\n\nNow a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing\nin the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was\ndiscovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After some further\nquestioning, counsel for the prosecution said:\n\n\u201cTake the witness.\u201d\n\nThe prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when\nhis own counsel said:\n\n\u201cI have no questions to ask him.\u201d\n\nThe next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.\nCounsel for the prosecution said:\n\n\u201cTake the witness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no questions to ask him,\u201d Potter\u2019s lawyer replied.\n\nA third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter\u2019s\npossession.\n\n\u201cTake the witness.\u201d\n\nCounsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience\nbegan to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his\nclient\u2019s life without an effort?\n\nSeveral witnesses deposed concerning Potter\u2019s guilty behavior when\nbrought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the stand\nwithout being cross-questioned.\n\nEvery detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the\ngraveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was\nbrought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined\nby Potter\u2019s lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house\nexpressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.\nCounsel for the prosecution now said:\n\n\u201cBy the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have\nfastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the\nunhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.\u201d\n\nA groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and\nrocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned\nin the courtroom. Many men were moved, and many women\u2019s compassion\ntestified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:\n\n\u201cYour honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we\nforeshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed\nwhile under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced\nby drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer that plea.\u201d [Then\nto the clerk:] \u201cCall Thomas Sawyer!\u201d\n\nA puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting\nPotter\u2019s. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as\nhe rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked wild enough,\nfor he was badly scared. The oath was administered.\n\n\u201cThomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the\nhour of midnight?\u201d\n\nTom glanced at Injun Joe\u2019s iron face and his tongue failed him. The\naudience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few\nmoments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed\nto put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:\n\n\u201cIn the graveyard!\u201d\n\n\u201cA little bit louder, please. Don\u2019t be afraid. You were\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the graveyard.\u201d\n\nA contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWere you anywhere near Horse Williams\u2019 grave?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak up\u2014just a trifle louder. How near were you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNear as I am to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere you hidden, or not?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was hid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cBehind the elms that\u2019s on the edge of the grave.\u201d\n\nInjun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.\n\n\u201cAny one with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir. I went there with\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWait\u2014wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion\u2019s name. We\nwill produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with\nyou.\u201d\n\nTom hesitated and looked confused.\n\n\u201cSpeak out, my boy\u2014don\u2019t be diffident. The truth is always respectable.\nWhat did you take there?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly a\u2014a\u2014dead cat.\u201d\n\nThere was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.\n\n\u201cWe will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us\neverything that occurred\u2014tell it in your own way\u2014don\u2019t skip anything,\nand don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\n\nTom began\u2014hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his\nwords flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased\nbut his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and\nbated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time,\nrapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent\nemotion reached its climax when the boy said:\n\n\u201c\u2014and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell, Injun\nJoe jumped with the knife and\u2014\u201d\n\nCrash! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window, tore his\nway through all opposers, and was gone!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nTom was a glittering hero once more\u2014the pet of the old, the envy of the\nyoung. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper\nmagnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet,\nif he escaped hanging.\n\nAs usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom\nand fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort\nof conduct is to the world\u2019s credit; therefore it is not well to find\nfault with it.\n\nTom\u2019s days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights\nwere seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always\nwith doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy\nto stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of\nwretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer\nthe night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid\nthat his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding\nInjun Joe\u2019s flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.\nThe poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of\nthat? Since Tom\u2019s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the\nlawyer\u2019s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had\nbeen sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck\u2019s\nconfidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated.\n\nDaily Muff Potter\u2019s gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly\nhe wished he had sealed up his tongue.\n\nHalf the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the\nother half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a\nsafe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.\n\nRewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun\nJoe was found. One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels, a\ndetective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked\nwise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that\ncraft usually achieve. That is to say, he \u201cfound a clew.\u201d But you can\u2019t\nhang a \u201cclew\u201d for murder, and so after that detective had got through\nand gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.\n\nThe slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened\nweight of apprehension.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nThere comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy\u2019s life when he has\na raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This desire\nsuddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find Joe Harper,\nbut failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone fishing.\nPresently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck would\nanswer. Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him\nconfidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was always willing to take a hand\nin any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital,\nfor he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is\nnot money. \u201cWhere\u2019ll we dig?\u201d said Huck.\n\n\u201cOh, most anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, is it hid all around?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, indeed it ain\u2019t. It\u2019s hid in mighty particular places,\nHuck\u2014sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of\na limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but\nmostly under the floor in ha\u2019nted houses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho hides it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, robbers, of course\u2014who\u2019d you reckon? Sunday-school\nsup\u2019rintendents?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. If \u2019twas mine I wouldn\u2019t hide it; I\u2019d spend it and have a\ngood time.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo would I. But robbers don\u2019t do that way. They always hide it and\nleave it there.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t they come after it any more?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or else\nthey die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and\nby somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks\u2014a\npaper that\u2019s got to be ciphered over about a week because it\u2019s mostly\nsigns and hy\u2019roglyphics.\u201d\n\n\u201cHyro\u2014which?\u201d\n\n\u201cHy\u2019roglyphics\u2014pictures and things, you know, that don\u2019t seem to mean\nanything.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you got one of them papers, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then, how you going to find the marks?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any marks. They always bury it under a ha\u2019nted house or on\nan island, or under a dead tree that\u2019s got one limb sticking out. Well,\nwe\u2019ve tried Jackson\u2019s Island a little, and we can try it again some\ntime; and there\u2019s the old ha\u2019nted house up the Still-House branch, and\nthere\u2019s lots of dead-limb trees\u2014dead loads of \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it under all of them?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow you talk! No!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen how you going to know which one to go for?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo for all of \u2019em!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, Tom, it\u2019ll take all summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars\nin it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di\u2019monds. How\u2019s\nthat?\u201d\n\nHuck\u2019s eyes glowed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred\ndollars and I don\u2019t want no di\u2019monds.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right. But I bet you I ain\u2019t going to throw off on di\u2019monds. Some\nof \u2019em\u2019s worth twenty dollars apiece\u2014there ain\u2019t any, hardly, but\u2019s\nworth six bits or a dollar.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! Is that so?\u201d\n\n\u201cCert\u2019nly\u2014anybody\u2019ll tell you so. Hain\u2019t you ever seen one, Huck?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot as I remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, kings have slathers of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019 know no kings, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon you don\u2019t. But if you was to go to Europe you\u2019d see a raft of\n\u2019em hopping around.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo they hop?\u201d\n\n\u201cHop?\u2014your granny! No!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what did you say they did, for?\u201d\n\n\u201cShucks, I only meant you\u2019d _see_ \u2019em\u2014not hopping, of course\u2014what do\nthey want to hop for?\u2014but I mean you\u2019d just see \u2019em\u2014scattered around,\nyou know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard.\u201d\n\n\u201cRichard? What\u2019s his other name?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have any other name. Kings don\u2019t have any but a given name.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don\u2019t want to be a king\nand have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say\u2014where you going\nto dig first?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. S\u2019pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the\nhill t\u2019other side of Still-House branch?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m agreed.\u201d\n\nSo they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their\nthree-mile tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves\ndown in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.\n\n\u201cI like this,\u201d said Tom.\n\n\u201cSo do I.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your\nshare?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I\u2019ll go to every\ncircus that comes along. I bet I\u2019ll have a gay time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, ain\u2019t you going to save any of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSave it? What for?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, so as to have something to live on, by and by.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that ain\u2019t any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day\nand get his claws on it if I didn\u2019t hurry up, and I tell you he\u2019d clean\nit out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to buy a new drum, and a sure\u2019nough sword, and a red necktie\nand a bull pup, and get married.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarried!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, you\u2014why, you ain\u2019t in your right mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait\u2014you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my\nmother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty\nwell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t anything. The girl I\u2019m going to marry won\u2019t fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, I reckon they\u2019re all alike. They\u2019ll all comb a body. Now you\nbetter think \u2019bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What\u2019s the name\nof the gal?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t a gal at all\u2014it\u2019s a girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl\u2014both\u2019s\nright, like enough. Anyway, what\u2019s her name, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you some time\u2014not now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014that\u2019ll do. Only if you get married I\u2019ll be more lonesomer\nthan ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo you won\u2019t. You\u2019ll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and\nwe\u2019ll go to digging.\u201d\n\nThey worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled another\nhalfhour. Still no result. Huck said:\n\n\u201cDo they always bury it as deep as this?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes\u2014not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven\u2019t got the right\nplace.\u201d\n\nSo they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little,\nbut still they made progress. They pegged away in silence for some time.\nFinally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from his\nbrow with his sleeve, and said:\n\n\u201cWhere you going to dig next, after we get this one?\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon maybe we\u2019ll tackle the old tree that\u2019s over yonder on Cardiff\nHill back of the widow\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon that\u2019ll be a good one. But won\u2019t the widow take it away from\nus, Tom? It\u2019s on her land.\u201d\n\n\u201c_She_ take it away! Maybe she\u2019d like to try it once. Whoever finds one\nof these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don\u2019t make any difference\nwhose land it\u2019s on.\u201d\n\nThat was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said:\n\n\u201cBlame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is mighty curious, Huck. I don\u2019t understand it. Sometimes witches\ninterfere. I reckon maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s the trouble now.\u201d\n\n\u201cShucks! Witches ain\u2019t got no power in the daytime.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s so. I didn\u2019t think of that. Oh, I know what the matter is!\nWhat a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow\nof the limb falls at midnight, and that\u2019s where you dig!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen consound it, we\u2019ve fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang\nit all, we got to come back in the night. It\u2019s an awful long way. Can\nyou get out?\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet I will. We\u2019ve got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees\nthese holes they\u2019ll know in a minute what\u2019s here and they\u2019ll go for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll come around and maow tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s hide the tools in the bushes.\u201d\n\nThe boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in\nthe shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by\nold traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked\nin the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the\ndistance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were\nsubdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged\nthat twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to\ndig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and\ntheir industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened,\nbut every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon\nsomething, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone\nor a chunk. At last Tom said:\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t any use, Huck, we\u2019re wrong again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, but we _can\u2019t_ be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know it, but then there\u2019s another thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too\nearly.\u201d\n\nHuck dropped his shovel.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d said he. \u201cThat\u2019s the very trouble. We got to give this one\nup. We can\u2019t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing\u2019s\ntoo awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering\naround so. I feel as if something\u2019s behind me all the time; and I\u2019m\nafeard to turn around, becuz maybe there\u2019s others in front a-waiting for\na chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a\ndead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLordy!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, they do. I\u2019ve always heard that.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, I don\u2019t like to fool around much where there\u2019s dead people. A\nbody\u2019s bound to get into trouble with \u2019em, sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to stir \u2019em up, either. S\u2019pose this one here was to stick\nhis skull out and say something!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Tom! It\u2019s awful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it just is. Huck, I don\u2019t feel comfortable a bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, Tom, let\u2019s give this place up, and try somewheres else.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, I reckon we better.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll it be?\u201d\n\nTom considered awhile; and then said:\n\n\u201cThe ha\u2019nted house. That\u2019s it!\u201d\n\n\u201cBlame it, I don\u2019t like ha\u2019nted houses, Tom. Why, they\u2019re a dern sight\nworse\u2019n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don\u2019t come\nsliding around in a shroud, when you ain\u2019t noticing, and peep over your\nshoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I\ncouldn\u2019t stand such a thing as that, Tom\u2014nobody could.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but, Huck, ghosts don\u2019t travel around only at night. They won\u2019t\nhender us from digging there in the daytime.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s so. But you know mighty well people don\u2019t go about that\nha\u2019nted house in the day nor the night.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s mostly because they don\u2019t like to go where a man\u2019s been\nmurdered, anyway\u2014but nothing\u2019s ever been seen around that house except\nin the night\u2014just some blue lights slipping by the windows\u2014no regular\nghosts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom,\nyou can bet there\u2019s a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason.\nBecuz you know that they don\u2019t anybody but ghosts use \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s so. But anyway they don\u2019t come around in the daytime, so\nwhat\u2019s the use of our being afeard?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, all right. We\u2019ll tackle the ha\u2019nted house if you say so\u2014but I\nreckon it\u2019s taking chances.\u201d\n\nThey had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle of the\nmoonlit valley below them stood the \u201cha\u2019nted\u201d house, utterly isolated,\nits fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the\nchimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof\ncaved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit\npast a window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the\ncircumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted\nhouse a wide berth, and took their way homeward through the woods that\nadorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nAbout noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come\nfor their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was\nmeasurably so, also\u2014but suddenly said:\n\n\u201cLookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?\u201d\n\nTom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his\neyes with a startled look in them\u2014\n\n\u201cMy! I never once thought of it, Huck!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was\nFriday.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlame it, a body can\u2019t be too careful, Huck. We might \u2019a\u2019 got into an\nawful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Might_! Better say we _would_! There\u2019s some lucky days, maybe, but\nFriday ain\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny fool knows that. I don\u2019t reckon _you_ was the first that found it\nout, Huck.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain\u2019t all, neither. I had a\nrotten bad dream last night\u2014dreampt about rats.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s good, Huck. When they don\u2019t fight it\u2019s only a sign that\nthere\u2019s trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty\nsharp and keep out of it. We\u2019ll drop this thing for today, and play. Do\nyou know Robin Hood, Huck?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Who\u2019s Robin Hood?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England\u2014and the\nbest. He was a robber.\u201d\n\n\u201cCracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But\nhe never bothered the poor. He loved \u2019em. He always divided up with \u2019em\nperfectly square.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he must \u2019a\u2019 been a brick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was.\nThey ain\u2019t any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in\nEngland, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow\nand plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a _yew_ bow?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that\ndime only on the edge he would set down and cry\u2014and curse. But we\u2019ll\nplay Robin Hood\u2014it\u2019s nobby fun. I\u2019ll learn you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m agreed.\u201d\n\nSo they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a\nyearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the\nmorrow\u2019s prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink\ninto the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows\nof the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff\nHill.\n\nOn Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again.\nThey had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their\nlast hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were\nso many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down\nwithin six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and\nturned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this\ntime, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling\nthat they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the\nrequirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.\n\nWhen they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and\ngrisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun,\nand something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the\nplace, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they\ncrept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown,\nfloorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows,\na ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and\nabandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened\npulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound,\nand muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.\n\nIn a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the\nplace a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own\nboldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look upstairs.\nThis was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring\neach other, and of course there could be but one result\u2014they threw their\ntools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of\ndecay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the\npromise was a fraud\u2014there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now\nand well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work when\u2014\n\n\u201cSh!\u201d said Tom.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d whispered Huck, blanching with fright.\n\n\u201cSh!... There!... Hear it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!... Oh, my! Let\u2019s run!\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep still! Don\u2019t you budge! They\u2019re coming right toward the door.\u201d\n\nThe boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to\nknotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve stopped.... No\u2014coming.... Here they are. Don\u2019t whisper another\nword, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!\u201d\n\nTwo men entered. Each boy said to himself: \u201cThere\u2019s the old deaf and\ndumb Spaniard that\u2019s been about town once or twice lately\u2014never saw\nt\u2019other man before.\u201d\n\n\u201cT\u2019other\u201d was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant\nin his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white\nwhiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore\ngreen goggles. When they came in, \u201ct\u2019other\u201d was talking in a low voice;\nthey sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the\nwall, and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became less\nguarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said he, \u201cI\u2019ve thought it all over, and I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s\ndangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cDangerous!\u201d grunted the \u201cdeaf and dumb\u201d Spaniard\u2014to the vast surprise\nof the boys. \u201cMilksop!\u201d\n\nThis voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe\u2019s! There was\nsilence for some time. Then Joe said:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s any more dangerous than that job up yonder\u2014but nothing\u2019s come of\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s different. Away up the river so, and not another house about.\n\u2019Twon\u2019t ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn\u2019t succeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!\u2014anybody\nwould suspicion us that saw us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that. But there warn\u2019t any other place as handy after that fool\nof a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it\nwarn\u2019t any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys\nplaying over there on the hill right in full view.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose infernal boys\u201d quaked again under the inspiration of this remark,\nand thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and\nconcluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had waited a\nyear.\n\nThe two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and\nthoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:\n\n\u201cLook here, lad\u2014you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there\ntill you hear from me. I\u2019ll take the chances on dropping into this town\njust once more, for a look. We\u2019ll do that \u2018dangerous\u2019 job after I\u2019ve\nspied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas!\nWe\u2019ll leg it together!\u201d\n\nThis was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe\nsaid:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dead for sleep! It\u2019s your turn to watch.\u201d\n\nHe curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred\nhim once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to\nnod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.\n\nThe boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:\n\n\u201cNow\u2019s our chance\u2014come!\u201d\n\nHuck said:\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014I\u2019d die if they was to wake.\u201d\n\nTom urged\u2014Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and\nstarted alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak\nfrom the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never\nmade a second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging moments\ntill it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray;\nand then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.\n\nNow one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around\u2014smiled grimly upon\nhis comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees\u2014stirred him up with\nhis foot and said:\n\n\u201cHere! _You\u2019re_ a watchman, ain\u2019t you! All right, though\u2014nothing\u2019s\nhappened.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy! have I been asleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What\u2019ll we\ndo with what little swag we\u2019ve got left?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014leave it here as we\u2019ve always done, I reckon. No use to\ntake it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver\u2019s\nsomething to carry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014all right\u2014it won\u2019t matter to come here once more.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014but I\u2019d say come in the night as we used to do\u2014it\u2019s better.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right\nchance at that job; accidents might happen; \u2019tain\u2019t in such a very good\nplace; we\u2019ll just regularly bury it\u2014and bury it deep.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down,\nraised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled\npleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself\nand as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on\nhis knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.\n\nThe boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. With\ngloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck!\u2014the splendor of it was\nbeyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make\nhalf a dozen boys rich! Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest\nauspices\u2014there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to\ndig. They nudged each other every moment\u2014eloquent nudges and easily\nunderstood, for they simply meant\u2014\u201cOh, but ain\u2019t you glad _now_ we\u2019re\nhere!\u201d\n\nJoe\u2019s knife struck upon something.\n\n\u201cHello!\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d said his comrade.\n\n\u201cHalf-rotten plank\u2014no, it\u2019s a box, I believe. Here\u2014bear a hand and we\u2019ll\nsee what it\u2019s here for. Never mind, I\u2019ve broke a hole.\u201d\n\nHe reached his hand in and drew it out\u2014\n\n\u201cMan, it\u2019s money!\u201d\n\nThe two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys\nabove were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.\n\nJoe\u2019s comrade said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make quick work of this. There\u2019s an old rusty pick over amongst\nthe weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace\u2014I saw it a\nminute ago.\u201d\n\nHe ran and brought the boys\u2019 pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the\npick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to\nhimself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was\nnot very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the\nslow years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in\nblissful silence.\n\n\u201cPard, there\u2019s thousands of dollars here,\u201d said Injun Joe.\n\n\u201c\u2019Twas always said that Murrel\u2019s gang used to be around here one\nsummer,\u201d the stranger observed.\n\n\u201cI know it,\u201d said Injun Joe; \u201cand this looks like it, I should say.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you won\u2019t need to do that job.\u201d\n\nThe halfbreed frowned. Said he:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know me. Least you don\u2019t know all about that thing. \u2019Tain\u2019t\nrobbery altogether\u2014it\u2019s _revenge_!\u201d and a wicked light flamed in his\neyes. \u201cI\u2019ll need your help in it. When it\u2019s finished\u2014then Texas. Go home\nto your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014if you say so; what\u2019ll we do with this\u2014bury it again?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] _No_! by the great Sachem, no!\n[Profound distress overhead.] I\u2019d nearly forgot. That pick had fresh\nearth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What business\nhas a pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth on\nthem? Who brought them here\u2014and where are they gone? Have you heard\nanybody?\u2014seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and\nsee the ground disturbed? Not exactly\u2014not exactly. We\u2019ll take it to my\nden.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number\nOne?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014Number Two\u2014under the cross. The other place is bad\u2014too common.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right. It\u2019s nearly dark enough to start.\u201d\n\nInjun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping\nout. Presently he said:\n\n\u201cWho could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be\nupstairs?\u201d\n\nThe boys\u2019 breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife,\nhalted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The\nboys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came\ncreaking up the stairs\u2014the intolerable distress of the situation woke\nthe stricken resolution of the lads\u2014they were about to spring for the\ncloset, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on\nthe ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself\nup cursing, and his comrade said:\n\n\u201cNow what\u2019s the use of all that? If it\u2019s anybody, and they\u2019re up there,\nlet them _stay_ there\u2014who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and get\ninto trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes\u2014and then\nlet them follow us if they want to. I\u2019m willing. In my opinion, whoever\nhove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or\ndevils or something. I\u2019ll bet they\u2019re running yet.\u201d\n\nJoe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight\nwas left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving.\nShortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening\ntwilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.\n\nTom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them\nthrough the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not they. They\nwere content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take the\ntownward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were too much\nabsorbed in hating themselves\u2014hating the ill luck that made them take\nthe spade and the pick there. But for that, Injun Joe never would have\nsuspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait\nthere till his \u201crevenge\u201d was satisfied, and then he would have had the\nmisfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that\nthe tools were ever brought there!\n\nThey resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to\ntown spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to\n\u201cNumber Two,\u201d wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred to\nTom.\n\n\u201cRevenge? What if he means _us_, Huck!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t!\u201d said Huck, nearly fainting.\n\nThey talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe\nthat he might possibly mean somebody else\u2014at least that he might at\nleast mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.\n\nVery, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company\nwould be a palpable improvement, he thought.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nThe adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom\u2019s dreams that night.\nFour times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times\nit wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and\nwakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay\nin the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he\nnoticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away\u2014somewhat as if\nthey had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it\noccurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There\nwas one very strong argument in favor of this idea\u2014namely, that the\nquantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen\nas much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of\nhis age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to\n\u201chundreds\u201d and \u201cthousands\u201d were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that\nno such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for\na moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in\nactual money in any one\u2019s possession. If his notions of hidden treasure\nhad been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of\nreal dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.\n\nBut the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer\nunder the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found\nhimself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a\ndream, after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a\nhurried breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale\nof a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking\nvery melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If\nhe did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a\ndream.\n\n\u201cHello, Huck!\u201d\n\n\u201cHello, yourself.\u201d\n\nSilence, for a minute.\n\n\u201cTom, if we\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 left the blame tools at the dead tree, we\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 got\nthe money. Oh, ain\u2019t it awful!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Tain\u2019t a dream, then, \u2019tain\u2019t a dream! Somehow I most wish it was.\nDog\u2019d if I don\u2019t, Huck.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat ain\u2019t a dream?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cDream! If them stairs hadn\u2019t broke down you\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 seen how much dream\nit was! I\u2019ve had dreams enough all night\u2014with that patch-eyed Spanish\ndevil going for me all through \u2019em\u2014rot him!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not rot him. _Find_ him! Track the money!\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, we\u2019ll never find him. A feller don\u2019t have only one chance for such\na pile\u2014and that one\u2019s lost. I\u2019d feel mighty shaky if I was to see him,\nanyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, so\u2019d I; but I\u2019d like to see him, anyway\u2014and track him out\u2014to his\nNumber Two.\u201d\n\n\u201cNumber Two\u2014yes, that\u2019s it. I been thinking \u2019bout that. But I can\u2019t make\nnothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dono. It\u2019s too deep. Say, Huck\u2014maybe it\u2019s the number of a house!\u201d\n\n\u201cGoody!... No, Tom, that ain\u2019t it. If it is, it ain\u2019t in this one-horse\ntown. They ain\u2019t no numbers here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s so. Lemme think a minute. Here\u2014it\u2019s the number of a\nroom\u2014in a tavern, you know!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s the trick! They ain\u2019t only two taverns. We can find out\nquick.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stay here, Huck, till I come.\u201d\n\nTom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck\u2019s company in public\nplaces. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No.\n2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied.\nIn the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper\u2019s\nyoung son said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody\ngo into it or come out of it except at night; he did not know any\nparticular reason for this state of things; had had some little\ncuriosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery\nby entertaining himself with the idea that that room was \u201cha\u2019nted\u201d; had\nnoticed that there was a light in there the night before.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve found out, Huck. I reckon that\u2019s the very No. 2 we\u2019re\nafter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cLemme think.\u201d\n\nTom thought a long time. Then he said:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out\ninto that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap\nof a brick store. Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and\nI\u2019ll nip all of auntie\u2019s, and the first dark night we\u2019ll go there and\ntry \u2019em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he\nwas going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get\nhis revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don\u2019t go to\nthat No. 2, that ain\u2019t the place.\u201d\n\n\u201cLordy, I don\u2019t want to foller him by myself!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019ll be night, sure. He mightn\u2019t ever see you\u2014and if he did,\nmaybe he\u2019d never think anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if it\u2019s pretty dark I reckon I\u2019ll track him. I dono\u2014I dono. I\u2019ll\ntry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bet I\u2019ll follow him, if it\u2019s dark, Huck. Why, he might \u2019a\u2019 found\nout he couldn\u2019t get his revenge, and be going right after that money.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so, Tom, it\u2019s so. I\u2019ll foller him; I will, by jingoes!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re _talking_! Don\u2019t you ever weaken, Huck, and I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nThat night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung about\nthe neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley\nat a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or\nleft it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern\ndoor. The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the\nunderstanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck\nwas to come and \u201cmaow,\u201d whereupon he would slip out and try the keys.\nBut the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to\nbed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.\n\nTuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday\nnight promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt\u2019s\nold tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the\nlantern in Huck\u2019s sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before\nmidnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts)\nwere put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the\nalley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned,\nthe perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of\ndistant thunder.\n\nTom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the\ntowel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.\nHuck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was\na season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck\u2019s spirits like a\nmountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern\u2014it\nwould frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive\nyet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have\nfainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and\nexcitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer\nand closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and\nmomentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away\nhis breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to\ninhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the\nway it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came\ntearing by him: \u201cRun!\u201d said he; \u201crun, for your life!\u201d\n\nHe needn\u2019t have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or\nforty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never\nstopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the\nlower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm\nburst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breath he said:\n\n\u201cHuck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;\nbut they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn\u2019t hardly\nget my breath I was so scared. They wouldn\u2019t turn in the lock, either.\nWell, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and\nopen comes the door! It warn\u2019t locked! I hopped in, and shook off the\ntowel, and, _Great Caesar\u2019s Ghost!_\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!\u2014what\u2019d you see, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe\u2019s hand!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch\non his eye and his arms spread out.\u201d\n\n\u201cLordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and\nstarted!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never \u2019a\u2019 thought of the towel, I bet!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, Tom, did you see that box?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, I didn\u2019t wait to look around. I didn\u2019t see the box, I didn\u2019t see\nthe cross. I didn\u2019t see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor\nby Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room.\nDon\u2019t you see, now, what\u2019s the matter with that ha\u2019nted room?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s ha\u2019nted with whiskey! Maybe _all_ the Temperance Taverns have\ngot a ha\u2019nted room, hey, Huck?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I reckon maybe that\u2019s so. Who\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 thought such a thing? But\nsay, Tom, now\u2019s a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe\u2019s\ndrunk.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, that! You try it!\u201d\n\nHuck shuddered.\n\n\u201cWell, no\u2014I reckon not.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain\u2019t\nenough. If there\u2019d been three, he\u2019d be drunk enough and I\u2019d do it.\u201d\n\nThere was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:\n\n\u201cLookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun\nJoe\u2019s not in there. It\u2019s too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we\u2019ll\nbe dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we\u2019ll\nsnatch that box quicker\u2019n lightning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m agreed. I\u2019ll watch the whole night long, and I\u2019ll do it every\nnight, too, if you\u2019ll do the other part of the job.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a\nblock and maow\u2014and if I\u2019m asleep, you throw some gravel at the window\nand that\u2019ll fetch me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed, and good as wheat!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, Huck, the storm\u2019s over, and I\u2019ll go home. It\u2019ll begin to be\ndaylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will\nyou?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said I would, Tom, and I will. I\u2019ll ha\u2019nt that tavern every night for\na year! I\u2019ll sleep all day and I\u2019ll stand watch all night.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. Now, where you going to sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Ben Rogers\u2019 hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap\u2019s nigger man,\nUncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any\ntime I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.\nThat\u2019s a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don\u2019t ever act as\nif I was above him. Sometime I\u2019ve set right down and eat _with_ him. But\nyou needn\u2019t tell that. A body\u2019s got to do things when he\u2019s awful hungry\nhe wouldn\u2019t want to do as a steady thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if I don\u2019t want you in the daytime, I\u2019ll let you sleep. I won\u2019t\ncome bothering around. Any time you see something\u2019s up, in the night,\njust skip right around and maow.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nThe first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of\nnews\u2014Judge Thatcher\u2019s family had come back to town the night before.\nBoth Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a\nmoment, and Becky took the chief place in the boy\u2019s interest. He saw her\nand they had an exhausting good time playing \u201chispy\u201d and \u201cgully-keeper\u201d\n with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in\na peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint\nthe next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she\nconsented. The child\u2019s delight was boundless; and Tom\u2019s not more\nmoderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway\nthe young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation\nand pleasurable anticipation. Tom\u2019s excitement enabled him to keep\nawake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck\u2019s\n\u201cmaow,\u201d and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers\nwith, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.\n\nMorning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o\u2019clock a giddy and\nrollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher\u2019s, and everything was\nready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the\npicnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough\nunder the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young\ngentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was\nchartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main\nstreet laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss\nthe fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.\nThatcher said to Becky, was:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll not get back till late. Perhaps you\u2019d better stay all night with\nsome of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well. And mind and behave yourself and don\u2019t be any trouble.\u201d\n\nPresently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:\n\n\u201cSay\u2014I\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019ll do. \u2019Stead of going to Joe Harper\u2019s we\u2019ll\nclimb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas\u2019. She\u2019ll have\nice-cream! She has it most every day\u2014dead loads of it. And she\u2019ll be\nawful glad to have us.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that will be fun!\u201d\n\nThen Becky reflected a moment and said:\n\n\u201cBut what will mamma say?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019ll she ever know?\u201d\n\nThe girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:\n\n\u201cI reckon it\u2019s wrong\u2014but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut shucks! Your mother won\u2019t know, and so what\u2019s the harm? All she\nwants is that you\u2019ll be safe; and I bet you she\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 said go there if\nshe\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 thought of it. I know she would!\u201d\n\nThe Widow Douglas\u2019 splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and\nTom\u2019s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say\nnothing to anybody about the night\u2019s programme. Presently it occurred to\nTom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The\nthought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he\ncould not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas\u2019. And why should he\ngive it up, he reasoned\u2014the signal did not come the night before, so\nwhy should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the\nevening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined\nto yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of\nthe box of money another time that day.\n\nThree miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody\nhollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest\ndistances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and\nlaughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone\nthrough with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified\nwith responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things\nbegan. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in\nthe shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s ready for the cave?\u201d\n\nEverybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there\nwas a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the\nhillside\u2014an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood\nunbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled\nby Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was\nromantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out\nupon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the\nsituation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment\na candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a\nstruggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked\ndown or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a\nnew chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went\nfiling down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of\nlights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of\njunction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than\neight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower\ncrevices branched from it on either hand\u2014for McDougal\u2019s cave was but a\nvast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again\nand led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights\ntogether through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never\nfind the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and\nstill down, into the earth, and it was just the same\u2014labyrinth under\nlabyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man \u201cknew\u201d the cave. That was\nan impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it\nwas not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer\nknew as much of the cave as any one.\n\nThe procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of\na mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch\navenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise\nat points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude\neach other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the\n\u201cknown\u201d ground.\n\nBy-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth\nof the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow\ndrippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of\nthe day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking\nno note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had\nbeen calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day\u2019s\nadventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat\nwith her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for\nthe wasted time but the captain of the craft.\n\nHuck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat\u2019s lights went\nglinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young\npeople were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly\ntired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not\nstop at the wharf\u2014and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his\nattention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten\no\u2019clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began\nto wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village\nbetook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the\nsilence and the ghosts. Eleven o\u2019clock came, and the tavern lights were\nput out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long\ntime, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use?\nWas there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?\n\nA noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley\ndoor closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next\nmoment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under\nhis arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure.\nWhy call Tom now? It would be absurd\u2014the men would get away with the box\nand never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow\nthem; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So\ncommuning with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the\nmen, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough\nahead not to be invisible.\n\nThey moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up\na crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the\npath that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old\nWelshman\u2019s house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still\nclimbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry.\nBut they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit.\nThey plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and\nwere at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his\ndistance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along\nawhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved\non a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that\nhe seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an\nowl came over the hill\u2014ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was\neverything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man\ncleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck\u2019s heart shot into his\nthroat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as\nif a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he\nthought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He\nknew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas\u2019\ngrounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won\u2019t be hard\nto find.\n\nNow there was a voice\u2014a very low voice\u2014Injun Joe\u2019s:\n\n\u201cDamn her, maybe she\u2019s got company\u2014there\u2019s lights, late as it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see any.\u201d\n\nThis was that stranger\u2019s voice\u2014the stranger of the haunted house. A\ndeadly chill went to Huck\u2019s heart\u2014this, then, was the \u201crevenge\u201d job! His\nthought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been\nkind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder\nher. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn\u2019t\ndare\u2014they might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in\nthe moment that elapsed between the stranger\u2019s remark and Injun Joe\u2019s\nnext\u2014which was\u2014\n\n\u201cBecause the bush is in your way. Now\u2014this way\u2014now you see, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Well, there _is_ company there, I reckon. Better give it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and\nmaybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I\u2019ve told you\nbefore, I don\u2019t care for her swag\u2014you may have it. But her husband was\nrough on me\u2014many times he was rough on me\u2014and mainly he was the justice\nof the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain\u2019t all. It ain\u2019t\na millionth part of it! He had me _horsewhipped_!\u2014horsewhipped in\nfront of the jail, like a nigger!\u2014with all the town looking on!\n_Horsewhipped_!\u2014do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But\nI\u2019ll take it out of _her_.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t kill her! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d\n\n\u201cKill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill _him_ if he was\nhere; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don\u2019t\nkill her\u2014bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils\u2014you notch her\nears like a sow!\u201d\n\n\u201cBy God, that\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I\u2019ll tie her\nto the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I\u2019ll not cry, if\nshe does. My friend, you\u2019ll help me in this thing\u2014for _my_ sake\u2014that\u2019s\nwhy you\u2019re here\u2014I mightn\u2019t be able alone. If you flinch, I\u2019ll kill you.\nDo you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I\u2019ll kill her\u2014and\nthen I reckon nobody\u2019ll ever know much about who done this business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if it\u2019s got to be done, let\u2019s get at it. The quicker the\nbetter\u2014I\u2019m all in a shiver.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it _now_? And company there? Look here\u2014I\u2019ll get suspicious of you,\nfirst thing you know. No\u2014we\u2019ll wait till the lights are out\u2014there\u2019s no\nhurry.\u201d\n\nHuck felt that a silence was going to ensue\u2014a thing still more awful\nthan any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped\ngingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,\none-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one\nside and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same\nelaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and\u2014a twig\nsnapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no\nsound\u2014the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he\nturned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes\u2014turned\nhimself as carefully as if he were a ship\u2014and then stepped quickly but\ncautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and\nso he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he\nreached the Welshman\u2019s. He banged at the door, and presently the heads\nof the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the row there? Who\u2019s banging? What do you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me in\u2014quick! I\u2019ll tell everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, who are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuckleberry Finn\u2014quick, let me in!\u201d\n\n\u201cHuckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain\u2019t a name to open many doors, I judge!\nBut let him in, lads, and let\u2019s see what\u2019s the trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t ever tell I told you,\u201d were Huck\u2019s first words when he got\nin. \u201cPlease don\u2019t\u2014I\u2019d be killed, sure\u2014but the widow\u2019s been good friends\nto me sometimes, and I want to tell\u2014I _will_ tell if you\u2019ll promise you\nwon\u2019t ever say it was me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy George, he _has_ got something to tell, or he wouldn\u2019t act so!\u201d\n exclaimed the old man; \u201cout with it and nobody here\u2019ll ever tell, lad.\u201d\n\nThree minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the\nhill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in\ntheir hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great\nbowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence, and\nthen all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.\n\nHuck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as\nfast as his legs could carry him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nAs the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came\ngroping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman\u2019s door. The\ninmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger,\non account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a\nwindow:\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there!\u201d\n\nHuck\u2019s scared voice answered in a low tone:\n\n\u201cPlease let me in! It\u2019s only Huck Finn!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a name that can open this door night or day, lad!\u2014and welcome!\u201d\n\nThese were strange words to the vagabond boy\u2019s ears, and the pleasantest\nhe had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever\nbeen applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he\nentered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall\nsons speedily dressed themselves.\n\n\u201cNow, my boy, I hope you\u2019re good and hungry, because breakfast will be\nready as soon as the sun\u2019s up, and we\u2019ll have a piping hot one, too\u2014make\nyourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you\u2019d turn up and stop\nhere last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was awful scared,\u201d said Huck, \u201cand I run. I took out when the pistols\nwent off, and I didn\u2019t stop for three mile. I\u2019ve come now becuz I wanted\nto know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn\u2019t\nwant to run across them devils, even if they was dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, poor chap, you do look as if you\u2019d had a hard night of it\u2014but\nthere\u2019s a bed here for you when you\u2019ve had your breakfast. No, they\nain\u2019t dead, lad\u2014we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right\nwhere to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along\non tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them\u2014dark as a cellar that\nsumach path was\u2014and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the\nmeanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use\u2014\u2019twas bound to\ncome, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when\nthe sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path,\nI sung out, \u2018Fire boys!\u2019 and blazed away at the place where the rustling\nwas. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and\nwe after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them.\nThey fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by\nand didn\u2019t do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet\nwe quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a\nposse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it\nis light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys\nwill be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of\nthose rascals\u2014\u2019twould help a good deal. But you couldn\u2019t see what they\nwere like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSplendid! Describe them\u2014describe them, my boy!\u201d\n\n\u201cOne\u2019s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that\u2019s ben around here once or\ntwice, and t\u2019other\u2019s a mean-looking, ragged\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back\nof the widow\u2019s one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and\ntell the sheriff\u2014get your breakfast tomorrow morning!\u201d\n\nThe Welshman\u2019s sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck\nsprang up and exclaimed:\n\n\u201cOh, please don\u2019t tell _any_body it was me that blowed on them! Oh,\nplease!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what\nyou did.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, no! Please don\u2019t tell!\u201d\n\nWhen the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t tell\u2014and I won\u2019t. But why don\u2019t you want it known?\u201d\n\nHuck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too\nmuch about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew\nanything against him for the whole world\u2014he would be killed for knowing\nit, sure.\n\nThe old man promised secrecy once more, and said:\n\n\u201cHow did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking\nsuspicious?\u201d\n\nHuck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:\n\n\u201cWell, you see, I\u2019m a kind of a hard lot,\u2014least everybody says so, and\nI don\u2019t see nothing agin it\u2014and sometimes I can\u2019t sleep much, on account\nof thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of\ndoing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn\u2019t sleep, and so I\ncome along upstreet \u2019bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I\ngot to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed\nup agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes\nthese two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their\narm, and I reckoned they\u2019d stole it. One was a-smoking, and t\u2019other one\nwanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up\ntheir faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard,\nby his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t\u2019other one was a\nrusty, ragged-looking devil.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould you see the rags by the light of the cigars?\u201d\n\nThis staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know\u2014but somehow it seems as if I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen they went on, and you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFollered \u2019em\u2014yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up\u2014they sneaked\nalong so. I dogged \u2019em to the widder\u2019s stile, and stood in the dark and\nheard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he\u2019d\nspile her looks just as I told you and your two\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! The _deaf and dumb_ man said all that!\u201d\n\nHuck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep\nthe old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be,\nand yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of\nall he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape,\nbut the old man\u2019s eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder.\nPresently the Welshman said:\n\n\u201cMy boy, don\u2019t be afraid of me. I wouldn\u2019t hurt a hair of your head for\nall the world. No\u2014I\u2019d protect you\u2014I\u2019d protect you. This Spaniard is\nnot deaf and dumb; you\u2019ve let that slip without intending it; you can\u2019t\ncover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want\nto keep dark. Now trust me\u2014tell me what it is, and trust me\u2014I won\u2019t\nbetray you.\u201d\n\nHuck looked into the old man\u2019s honest eyes a moment, then bent over and\nwhispered in his ear:\n\n\u201c\u2019Tain\u2019t a Spaniard\u2014it\u2019s Injun Joe!\u201d\n\nThe Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and\nslitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because\nwhite men don\u2019t take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That\u2019s a\ndifferent matter altogether.\u201d\n\nDuring breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man\nsaid that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going\nto bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for\nmarks of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of\u2014\n\n\u201cOf _what_?\u201d\n\nIf the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more\nstunning suddenness from Huck\u2019s blanched lips. His eyes were staring\nwide, now, and his breath suspended\u2014waiting for the answer. The Welshman\nstarted\u2014stared in return\u2014three seconds\u2014five seconds\u2014ten\u2014then replied:\n\n\u201cOf burglar\u2019s tools. Why, what\u2019s the _matter_ with you?\u201d\n\nHuck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The\nWelshman eyed him gravely, curiously\u2014and presently said:\n\n\u201cYes, burglar\u2019s tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what\ndid give you that turn? What were _you_ expecting we\u2019d found?\u201d\n\nHuck was in a close place\u2014the inquiring eye was upon him\u2014he would have\ngiven anything for material for a plausible answer\u2014nothing suggested\nitself\u2014the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper\u2014a senseless\nreply offered\u2014there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered\nit\u2014feebly:\n\n\u201cSunday-school books, maybe.\u201d\n\nPoor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and\njoyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and\nended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man\u2019s pocket, because\nit cut down the doctor\u2019s bill like everything. Then he added:\n\n\u201cPoor old chap, you\u2019re white and jaded\u2014you ain\u2019t well a bit\u2014no wonder\nyou\u2019re a little flighty and off your balance. But you\u2019ll come out of it.\nRest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.\u201d\n\nHuck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such\na suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel\nbrought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the\ntalk at the widow\u2019s stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure,\nhowever\u2014he had not known that it wasn\u2019t\u2014and so the suggestion of a\ncaptured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole\nhe felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all\nquestion that that bundle was not _the_ bundle, and so his mind was\nat rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be\ndrifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still\nin No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and\nTom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of\ninterruption.\n\nJust as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck\njumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even\nremotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and\ngentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of\ncitizens were climbing up the hill\u2014to stare at the stile. So the news\nhad spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the\nvisitors. The widow\u2019s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say a word about it, madam. There\u2019s another that you\u2019re more\nbeholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don\u2019t allow me\nto tell his name. We wouldn\u2019t have been there but for him.\u201d\n\nOf course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the\nmain matter\u2014but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his\nvisitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he\nrefused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the\nwidow said:\n\n\u201cI went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that\nnoise. Why didn\u2019t you come and wake me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe judged it warn\u2019t worth while. Those fellows warn\u2019t likely to come\nagain\u2014they hadn\u2019t any tools left to work with, and what was the use of\nwaking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard\nat your house all the rest of the night. They\u2019ve just come back.\u201d\n\nMore visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple\nof hours more.\n\nThere was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody\nwas early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came\nthat not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the\nsermon was finished, Judge Thatcher\u2019s wife dropped alongside of Mrs.\nHarper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:\n\n\u201cIs my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired\nto death.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Becky?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d with a startled look\u2014\u201cdidn\u2019t she stay with you last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, no.\u201d\n\nMrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly,\ntalking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:\n\n\u201cGoodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I\u2019ve got a boy\nthat\u2019s turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last\nnight\u2014one of you. And now he\u2019s afraid to come to church. I\u2019ve got to\nsettle with him.\u201d\n\nMrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t stay with us,\u201d said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A\nmarked anxiety came into Aunt Polly\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cJoe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2019m.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen did you see him last?\u201d\n\nJoe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had\nstopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding\nuneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously\nquestioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed\nwhether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip;\nit was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One\nyoung man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave!\nMrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her\nhands.\n\nThe alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to\nstreet, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and\nthe whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant\ninsignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs\nwere manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half\nan hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward\nthe cave.\n\nAll the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women\nvisited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They\ncried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the\ntedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at\nlast, all the word that came was, \u201cSend more candles\u2014and send food.\u201d\n Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher\nsent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed\nno real cheer.\n\nThe old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with\ncandle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck\nstill in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with\nfever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came\nand took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him,\nbecause, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord\u2019s,\nand nothing that was the Lord\u2019s was a thing to be neglected. The\nWelshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:\n\n\u201cYou can depend on it. That\u2019s the Lord\u2019s mark. He don\u2019t leave it off.\nHe never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his\nhands.\u201d\n\nEarly in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the\nvillage, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the\nnews that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being\nransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and\ncrevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered\nthrough the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither\nand thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their\nhollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place,\nfar from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names \u201cBECKY &\nTOM\u201d had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and\nnear at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the\nribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever\nhave of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so\nprecious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the\nawful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away\nspeck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst\nforth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle\u2014and then a\nsickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there;\nit was only a searcher\u2019s light.\n\nThree dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and\nthe village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything.\nThe accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the\nTemperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the\npublic pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck\nfeebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked\u2014dimly\ndreading the worst\u2014if anything had been discovered at the Temperance\nTavern since he had been ill.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the widow.\n\nHuck started up in bed, wildeyed:\n\n\u201cWhat? What was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cLiquor!\u2014and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child\u2014what a turn you\ndid give me!\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly tell me just one thing\u2014only just one\u2014please! Was it Tom Sawyer\nthat found it?\u201d\n\nThe widow burst into tears. \u201cHush, hush, child, hush! I\u2019ve told you\nbefore, you must _not_ talk. You are very, very sick!\u201d\n\nThen nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great\npowwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever\u2014gone\nforever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should\ncry.\n\nThese thoughts worked their dim way through Huck\u2019s mind, and under the\nweariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:\n\n\u201cThere\u2014he\u2019s asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody\ncould find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain\u2019t many left, now, that\u2019s got hope\nenough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nNow to return to Tom and Becky\u2019s share in the picnic. They tripped along\nthe murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar\nwonders of the cave\u2014wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names,\nsuch as \u201cThe Drawing-Room,\u201d \u201cThe Cathedral,\u201d \u201cAladdin\u2019s Palace,\u201d and\nso on. Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky\nengaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle\nwearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their\ncandles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates,\npostoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been\nfrescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they\nscarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls\nwere not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging\nshelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream\nof water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with\nit, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara\nin gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind\nit in order to illuminate it for Becky\u2019s gratification. He found that\nit curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between\nnarrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.\n\nBecky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future\nguidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that,\nfar down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and\nbranched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In\none place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a\nmultitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of\na man\u2019s leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and\npresently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into\nit. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was\nincrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst\nof a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which\nhad been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites\ntogether, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the\nroof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a\nbunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by\nhundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their\nways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky\u2019s hand and\nhurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for\na bat struck Becky\u2019s light out with its wing while she was passing out\nof the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the\nfugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got\nrid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly,\nwhich stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the\nshadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would\nbe best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the\ndeep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the\nchildren. Becky said:\n\n\u201cWhy, I didn\u2019t notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of\nthe others.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome to think, Becky, we are away down below them\u2014and I don\u2019t know how\nfar away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn\u2019t hear\nthem here.\u201d\n\nBecky grew apprehensive.\n\n\u201cI wonder how long we\u2019ve been down here, Tom? We better start back.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I reckon we better. P\u2019raps we better.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you find the way, Tom? It\u2019s all a mixed-up crookedness to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon I could find it\u2014but then the bats. If they put our candles\nout it will be an awful fix. Let\u2019s try some other way, so as not to go\nthrough there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell. But I hope we won\u2019t get lost. It would be so awful!\u201d and the girl\nshuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.\n\nThey started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long\nway, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar\nabout the look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an\nexamination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he\nwould say cheerily:\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s all right. This ain\u2019t the one, but we\u2019ll come to it right\naway!\u201d\n\nBut he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began\nto turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of\nfinding the one that was wanted. He still said it was \u201call right,\u201d but\nthere was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their\nring and sounded just as if he had said, \u201cAll is lost!\u201d Becky clung to\nhis side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears,\nbut they would come. At last she said:\n\n\u201cOh, Tom, never mind the bats, let\u2019s go back that way! We seem to get\nworse and worse off all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen!\u201d said he.\n\nProfound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were\nconspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down\nthe empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that\nresembled a ripple of mocking laughter.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,\u201d said Becky.\n\n\u201cIt is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,\u201d and\nhe shouted again.\n\nThe \u201cmight\u201d was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so\nconfessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but\nthere was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried\nhis steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his\nmanner revealed another fearful fact to Becky\u2014he could not find his way\nback!\n\n\u201cOh, Tom, you didn\u2019t make any marks!\u201d\n\n\u201cBecky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to\ncome back! No\u2014I can\u2019t find the way. It\u2019s all mixed up.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, Tom, we\u2019re lost! we\u2019re lost! We never can get out of this awful\nplace! Oh, why _did_ we ever leave the others!\u201d\n\nShe sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom\nwas appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He\nsat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in\nhis bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing\nregrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom\nbegged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell\nto blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable\nsituation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope\nagain, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he\nwould not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she,\nshe said.\n\nSo they moved on again\u2014aimlessly\u2014simply at random\u2014all they could do\nwas to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of\nreviving\u2014not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its\nnature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and\nfamiliarity with failure.\n\nBy-and-by Tom took Becky\u2019s candle and blew it out. This economy meant so\nmuch! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again.\nShe knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his\npockets\u2014yet he must economize.\n\nBy-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay\nattention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was\ngrown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction,\nwas at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to\ninvite death and shorten its pursuit.\n\nAt last Becky\u2019s frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down.\nTom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there,\nand the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom\ntried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements\nwere grown thread-bare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore\nso heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful.\nHe sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural\nunder the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and\nrested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing\ninto his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and\ndreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a\nbreezy little laugh\u2014but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan\nfollowed it.\n\n\u201cOh, how _could_ I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I\ndon\u2019t, Tom! Don\u2019t look so! I won\u2019t say it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve slept, Becky; you\u2019ll feel rested, now, and we\u2019ll find\nthe way out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can try, Tom; but I\u2019ve seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I\nreckon we are going there.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let\u2019s go on trying.\u201d\n\nThey rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried\nto estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was\nthat it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not\nbe, for their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this\u2014they\ncould not tell how long\u2014Tom said they must go softly and listen for\ndripping water\u2014they must find a spring. They found one presently, and\nTom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky\nsaid she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to\nhear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom\nfastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought\nwas soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the\nsilence:\n\n\u201cTom, I am so hungry!\u201d\n\nTom took something out of his pocket.\n\n\u201cDo you remember this?\u201d said he.\n\nBecky almost smiled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our wedding-cake, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it\u2019s all we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup\npeople do with wedding-cake\u2014but it\u2019ll be our\u2014\u201d\n\nShe dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky\nate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was\nabundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky\nsuggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he\nsaid:\n\n\u201cBecky, can you bear it if I tell you something?\u201d\n\nBecky\u2019s face paled, but she thought she could.\n\n\u201cWell, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there\u2019s water to drink.\nThat little piece is our last candle!\u201d\n\nBecky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort\nher, but with little effect. At length Becky said:\n\n\u201cTom!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Becky?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll miss us and hunt for us!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, they will! Certainly they will!\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re hunting for us now, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen would they miss us, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they get back to the boat, I reckon.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, it might be dark then\u2014would they notice we hadn\u2019t come?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they\ngot home.\u201d\n\nA frightened look in Becky\u2019s face brought Tom to his senses and he saw\nthat he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night!\nThe children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of\ngrief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers\nalso\u2014that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher\ndiscovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper\u2019s.\n\nThe children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it\nmelt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone\nat last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of\nsmoke, linger at its top a moment, and then\u2014the horror of utter darkness\nreigned!\n\nHow long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that\nshe was crying in Tom\u2019s arms, neither could tell. All that they knew\nwas, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of\na dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said\nit might be Sunday, now\u2014maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but\nher sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that\nthey must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going\non. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in\nthe darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no\nmore.\n\nThe hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A\nportion of Tom\u2019s half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But\nthey seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted\ndesire.\n\nBy-and-by Tom said:\n\n\u201cSH! Did you hear that?\u201d\n\nBoth held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the\nfaintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by\nthe hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently\nhe listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little\nnearer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s them!\u201d said Tom; \u201cthey\u2019re coming! Come along, Becky\u2014we\u2019re all\nright now!\u201d\n\nThe joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow,\nhowever, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded\nagainst. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three\nfeet deep, it might be a hundred\u2014there was no passing it at any rate.\nTom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No\nbottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They\nlistened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant!\na moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking\nmisery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He\ntalked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no\nsounds came again.\n\nThe children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged\non; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed\nit must be Tuesday by this time.\n\nNow an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It\nwould be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the\nheavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to\na projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the\nline as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended\nin a \u201cjumping-off place.\u201d Tom got down on his knees and felt below,\nand then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands\nconveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the\nright, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding\na candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout,\nand instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to\u2014Injun\nJoe\u2019s! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the\nnext moment, to see the \u201cSpaniard\u201d take to his heels and get himself out\nof sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come\nover and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have\ndisguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom\u2019s\nfright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he\nhad strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and\nnothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He\nwas careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he\nhad only shouted \u201cfor luck.\u201d\n\nBut hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.\nAnother tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought\nchanges. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed\nthat it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now,\nand that the search had been given over. He proposed to explore another\npassage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But\nBecky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be\nroused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and die\u2014it would\nnot be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he\nchose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak\nto her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would\nstay by her and hold her hand until all was over.\n\nTom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show\nof being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave;\nthen he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the\npassages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with\nbodings of coming doom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nTuesday afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St.\nPetersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public\nprayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer\nthat had the petitioner\u2019s whole heart in it; but still no good news came\nfrom the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the quest\nand gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the\nchildren could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great\npart of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her\ncall her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time,\nthen lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into\na settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The\nvillage went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.\n\nAway in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village\nbells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad\npeople, who shouted, \u201cTurn out! turn out! they\u2019re found! they\u2019re found!\u201d\n Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself\nand moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage\ndrawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward\nmarch, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after\nhuzzah!\n\nThe village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the\ngreatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour\na procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher\u2019s house, seized\nthe saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s hand, tried to\nspeak but couldn\u2019t\u2014and drifted out raining tears all over the place.\n\nAunt Polly\u2019s happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s nearly so. It\nwould be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the\ngreat news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon\na sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the\nwonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it\nwithal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went\non an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his\nkite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch\nof the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off\nspeck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,\npushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad\nMississippi rolling by!\n\nAnd if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that\nspeck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He\ntold how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told\nhim not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was\ngoing to die, and wanted to. He described how he labored with her and\nconvinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to\nwhere she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way\nout at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried\nfor gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them\nand told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men\ndidn\u2019t believe the wild tale at first, \u201cbecause,\u201d said they, \u201cyou are\nfive miles down the river below the valley the cave is in\u201d\u2014then took\nthem aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two\nor three hours after dark and then brought them home.\n\nBefore day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him\nwere tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind\nthem, and informed of the great news.\n\nThree days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to\nbe shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were\nbedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and\nmore tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday,\nwas downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky\ndid not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had\npassed through a wasting illness.\n\nTom learned of Huck\u2019s sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could\nnot be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday.\nHe was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his\nadventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by\nto see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event;\nalso that the \u201cragged man\u2019s\u201d body had eventually been found in the river\nnear the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape,\nperhaps.\n\nAbout a fortnight after Tom\u2019s rescue from the cave, he started off to\nvisit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting\ntalk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge\nThatcher\u2019s house was on Tom\u2019s way, and he stopped to see Becky. The\nJudge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him\nironically if he wouldn\u2019t like to go to the cave again. Tom said he\nthought he wouldn\u2019t mind it. The Judge said:\n\n\u201cWell, there are others just like you, Tom, I\u2019ve not the least doubt.\nBut we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any\nmore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and\ntriple-locked\u2014and I\u2019ve got the keys.\u201d\n\nTom turned as white as a sheet.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!\u201d\n\nThe water was brought and thrown into Tom\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cAh, now you\u2019re all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Judge, Injun Joe\u2019s in the cave!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nWithin a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of\nmen were on their way to McDougal\u2019s cave, and the ferryboat, well filled\nwith passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore\nJudge Thatcher.\n\nWhen the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in\nthe dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,\ndead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing\neyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer\nof the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own\nexperience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but\nnevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,\nwhich revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated\nbefore how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day\nhe lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.\n\nInjun Joe\u2019s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great\nfoundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with\ntedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a\nsill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought\nno effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there\nhad been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless\nstill, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have\nsqueezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked\nthat place in order to be doing something\u2014in order to pass the weary\ntime\u2014in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could\nfind half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this\nvestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner\nhad searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a\nfew bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The\npoor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a\nstalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded\nby the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off\nthe stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had\nscooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once\nin every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick\u2014a\ndessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling\nwhen the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome\nwere laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the\nBritish empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was\n\u201cnews.\u201d\n\nIt is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall\nhave sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition,\nand been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a\npurpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand\nyears to be ready for this flitting human insect\u2019s need? and has it\nanother important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No\nmatter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped\nout the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist\nstares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when\nhe comes to see the wonders of McDougal\u2019s cave. Injun Joe\u2019s cup stands\nfirst in the list of the cavern\u2019s marvels; even \u201cAladdin\u2019s Palace\u201d\n cannot rival it.\n\nInjun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked\nthere in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and\nhamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and\nall sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as\nsatisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the\nhanging.\n\nThis funeral stopped the further growth of one thing\u2014the petition to the\ngovernor for Injun Joe\u2019s pardon. The petition had been largely signed;\nmany tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of\nsappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the\ngovernor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty\nunder foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the\nvillage, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself there would\nhave been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a\npardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired\nand leaky water-works.\n\nThe morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have\nan important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom\u2019s adventure from the\nWelshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned\nthere was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted\nto talk about now. Huck\u2019s face saddened. He said:\n\n\u201cI know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but\nwhiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must \u2019a\u2019 ben\nyou, soon as I heard \u2019bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you\nhadn\u2019t got the money becuz you\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 got at me some way or other and\ntold me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something\u2019s always\ntold me we\u2019d never get holt of that swag.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. _You_ know his tavern\nwas all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don\u2019t you remember you\nwas to watch there that night?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes! Why, it seems \u2019bout a year ago. It was that very night that I\nfollered Injun Joe to the widder\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201c_You_ followed him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe\u2019s left friends behind him, and\nI don\u2019t want \u2019em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn\u2019t\nben for me he\u2019d be down in Texas now, all right.\u201d\n\nThen Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only\nheard of the Welshman\u2019s part of it before.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, \u201cwhoever\nnipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon\u2014anyways\nit\u2019s a goner for us, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, that money wasn\u2019t ever in No. 2!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Huck searched his comrade\u2019s face keenly. \u201cTom, have you got on\nthe track of that money again?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, it\u2019s in the cave!\u201d\n\nHuck\u2019s eyes blazed.\n\n\u201cSay it again, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe money\u2019s in the cave!\u201d\n\n\u201cTom\u2014honest injun, now\u2014is it fun, or earnest?\u201d\n\n\u201cEarnest, Huck\u2014just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in\nthere with me and help get it out?\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet I will! I will if it\u2019s where we can blaze our way to it and not\nget lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the\nworld.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood as wheat! What makes you think the money\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don\u2019t find it I\u2019ll\nagree to give you my drum and every thing I\u2019ve got in the world. I will,\nby jings.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014it\u2019s a whiz. When do you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,\nnow, but I can\u2019t walk more\u2019n a mile, Tom\u2014least I don\u2019t think I could.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck,\nbut there\u2019s a mighty short cut that they don\u2019t anybody but me know\nabout. Huck, I\u2019ll take you right to it in a skiff. I\u2019ll float the skiff\ndown there, and I\u2019ll pull it back again all by myself. You needn\u2019t ever\nturn your hand over.\u201d\n\n\u201cLess start right off, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little\nbag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled\nthings they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many\u2019s the time I wished I\nhad some when I was in there before.\u201d\n\nA trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who\nwas absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles\nbelow \u201cCave Hollow,\u201d Tom said:\n\n\u201cNow you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the\ncave hollow\u2014no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see\nthat white place up yonder where there\u2019s been a landslide? Well, that\u2019s\none of my marks. We\u2019ll get ashore, now.\u201d\n\nThey landed.\n\n\u201cNow, Huck, where we\u2019re a-standing you could touch that hole I got out\nof with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.\u201d\n\nHuck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly\nmarched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:\n\n\u201cHere you are! Look at it, Huck; it\u2019s the snuggest hole in this country.\nYou just keep mum about it. All along I\u2019ve been wanting to be a robber,\nbut I knew I\u2019d got to have a thing like this, and where to run across\nit was the bother. We\u2019ve got it now, and we\u2019ll keep it quiet, only we\u2019ll\nlet Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in\u2014because of course there\u2019s got to be a\nGang, or else there wouldn\u2019t be any style about it. Tom Sawyer\u2019s Gang\u2014it\nsounds splendid, don\u2019t it, Huck?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it just does, Tom. And who\u2019ll we rob?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, most anybody. Waylay people\u2014that\u2019s mostly the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd kill them?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a ransom?\u201d\n\n\u201cMoney. You make them raise all they can, off\u2019n their friends; and after\nyou\u2019ve kept them a year, if it ain\u2019t raised then you kill them. That\u2019s\nthe general way. Only you don\u2019t kill the women. You shut up the women,\nbut you don\u2019t kill them. They\u2019re always beautiful and rich, and awfully\nscared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat\noff and talk polite. They ain\u2019t anybody as polite as robbers\u2014you\u2019ll see\nthat in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they\u2019ve\nbeen in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that\nyou couldn\u2019t get them to leave. If you drove them out they\u2019d turn right\naround and come back. It\u2019s so in all the books.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s real bully, Tom. I believe it\u2019s better\u2019n to be a pirate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s better in some ways, because it\u2019s close to home and circuses\nand all that.\u201d\n\nBy this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in\nthe lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then\nmade their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought\nthem to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him.\nHe showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay\nagainst the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame\nstruggle and expire.\n\nThe boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and\ngloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently\nentered and followed Tom\u2019s other corridor until they reached the\n\u201cjumping-off place.\u201d The candles revealed the fact that it was not\nreally a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet\nhigh. Tom whispered:\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019ll show you something, Huck.\u201d\n\nHe held his candle aloft and said:\n\n\u201cLook as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There\u2014on the\nbig rock over yonder\u2014done with candle-smoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, it\u2019s a _cross_!\u201d\n\n\u201c_Now_ where\u2019s your Number Two? \u2018_under the cross_,\u2019 hey? Right yonder\u2019s\nwhere I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!\u201d\n\nHuck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:\n\n\u201cTom, less git out of here!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! and leave the treasure?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014leave it. Injun Joe\u2019s ghost is round about there, certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo it ain\u2019t, Huck, no it ain\u2019t. It would ha\u2019nt the place where he\ndied\u2014away out at the mouth of the cave\u2014five mile from here.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Tom, it wouldn\u2019t. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of\nghosts, and so do you.\u201d\n\nTom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in his mind.\nBut presently an idea occurred to him\u2014\n\n\u201cLookyhere, Huck, what fools we\u2019re making of ourselves! Injun Joe\u2019s\nghost ain\u2019t a going to come around where there\u2019s a cross!\u201d\n\nThe point was well taken. It had its effect.\n\n\u201cTom, I didn\u2019t think of that. But that\u2019s so. It\u2019s luck for us, that\ncross is. I reckon we\u2019ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.\u201d\n\nTom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.\nHuck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the\ngreat rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result.\nThey found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with\na pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some\nbacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there\nwas no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this place, but in\nvain. Tom said:\n\n\u201cHe said _under_ the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the\ncross. It can\u2019t be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the\nground.\u201d\n\nThey searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck\ncould suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:\n\n\u201cLookyhere, Huck, there\u2019s footprints and some candle-grease on the clay\nabout one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what\u2019s\nthat for? I bet you the money _is_ under the rock. I\u2019m going to dig in\nthe clay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t no bad notion, Tom!\u201d said Huck with animation.\n\nTom\u2019s \u201creal Barlow\u201d was out at once, and he had not dug four inches\nbefore he struck wood.\n\n\u201cHey, Huck!\u2014you hear that?\u201d\n\nHuck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and\nremoved. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.\nTom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he\ncould, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed\nto explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended\ngradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to\nthe left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and\nexclaimed:\n\n\u201cMy goodness, Huck, lookyhere!\u201d\n\nIt was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern,\nalong with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two\nor three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish\nwell soaked with the water-drip.\n\n\u201cGot it at last!\u201d said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with\nhis hand. \u201cMy, but we\u2019re rich, Tom!\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, I always reckoned we\u2019d get it. It\u2019s just too good to believe, but\nwe _have_ got it, sure! Say\u2014let\u2019s not fool around here. Let\u2019s snake it\nout. Lemme see if I can lift the box.\u201d\n\nIt weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward\nfashion, but could not carry it conveniently.\n\n\u201cI thought so,\u201d he said; \u201c_They_ carried it like it was heavy, that day\nat the ha\u2019nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of\nfetching the little bags along.\u201d\n\nThe money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross\nrock.\n\n\u201cNow less fetch the guns and things,\u201d said Huck.\n\n\u201cNo, Huck\u2014leave them there. They\u2019re just the tricks to have when we\ngo to robbing. We\u2019ll keep them there all the time, and we\u2019ll hold our\norgies there, too. It\u2019s an awful snug place for orgies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat orgies?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we\u2019ve got to\nhave them, too. Come along, Huck, we\u2019ve been in here a long time. It\u2019s\ngetting late, I reckon. I\u2019m hungry, too. We\u2019ll eat and smoke when we get\nto the skiff.\u201d\n\nThey presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily\nout, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the\nskiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got\nunder way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting\ncheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.\n\n\u201cNow, Huck,\u201d said Tom, \u201cwe\u2019ll hide the money in the loft of the widow\u2019s\nwoodshed, and I\u2019ll come up in the morning and we\u2019ll count it and divide,\nand then we\u2019ll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be\nsafe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook\nBenny Taylor\u2019s little wagon; I won\u2019t be gone a minute.\u201d\n\nHe disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small\nsacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off,\ndragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman\u2019s\nhouse, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the\nWelshman stepped out and said:\n\n\u201cHallo, who\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck and Tom Sawyer.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.\nHere\u2014hurry up, trot ahead\u2014I\u2019ll haul the wagon for you. Why, it\u2019s not as\nlight as it might be. Got bricks in it?\u2014or old metal?\u201d\n\n\u201cOld metal,\u201d said Tom.\n\n\u201cI judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away\nmore time hunting up six bits\u2019 worth of old iron to sell to the foundry\nthan they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that\u2019s\nhuman nature\u2014hurry along, hurry along!\u201d\n\nThe boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.\n\n\u201cNever mind; you\u2019ll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas\u2019.\u201d\n\nHuck said with some apprehension\u2014for he was long used to being falsely\naccused:\n\n\u201cMr. Jones, we haven\u2019t been doing nothing.\u201d\n\nThe Welshman laughed.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, Huck, my boy. I don\u2019t know about that. Ain\u2019t you\nand the widow good friends?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Well, she\u2019s ben good friends to me, anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?\u201d\n\nThis question was not entirely answered in Huck\u2019s slow mind before he\nfound himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas\u2019 drawing-room.\nMr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.\n\nThe place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence\nin the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the\nRogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great\nmany more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys\nas heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They\nwere covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson\nwith humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered\nhalf as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:\n\n\u201cTom wasn\u2019t at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and\nHuck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you did just right,\u201d said the widow. \u201cCome with me, boys.\u201d\n\nShe took them to a bedchamber and said:\n\n\u201cNow wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of\nclothes\u2014shirts, socks, everything complete. They\u2019re Huck\u2019s\u2014no, no\nthanks, Huck\u2014Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they\u2019ll fit both\nof you. Get into them. We\u2019ll wait\u2014come down when you are slicked up\nenough.\u201d\n\nThen she left.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nHuck said: \u201cTom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain\u2019t\nhigh from the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cShucks! what do you want to slope for?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I ain\u2019t used to that kind of a crowd. I can\u2019t stand it. I ain\u2019t\ngoing down there, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, bother! It ain\u2019t anything. I don\u2019t mind it a bit. I\u2019ll take care of\nyou.\u201d\n\nSid appeared.\n\n\u201cTom,\u201d said he, \u201cauntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon. Mary\ngot your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody\u2019s been fretting about you.\nSay\u2014ain\u2019t this grease and clay, on your clothes?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, Mr. Siddy, you jist \u2019tend to your own business. What\u2019s all this\nblowout about, anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the widow\u2019s parties that she\u2019s always having. This time\nit\u2019s for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they\nhelped her out of the other night. And say\u2014I can tell you something, if\nyou want to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people\nhere tonight, but I overheard him tell auntie today about it, as a\nsecret, but I reckon it\u2019s not much of a secret now. Everybody knows\u2014the\nwidow, too, for all she tries to let on she don\u2019t. Mr. Jones was bound\nHuck should be here\u2014couldn\u2019t get along with his grand secret without\nHuck, you know!\u201d\n\n\u201cSecret about what, Sid?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout Huck tracking the robbers to the widow\u2019s. I reckon Mr. Jones was\ngoing to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop\npretty flat.\u201d\n\nSid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.\n\n\u201cSid, was it you that told?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, never mind who it was. _Somebody_ told\u2014that\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cSid, there\u2019s only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and\nthat\u2019s you. If you had been in Huck\u2019s place you\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 sneaked down the\nhill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can\u2019t do any but mean\nthings, and you can\u2019t bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.\nThere\u2014no thanks, as the widow says\u201d\u2014and Tom cuffed Sid\u2019s ears and helped\nhim to the door with several kicks. \u201cNow go and tell auntie if you\ndare\u2014and tomorrow you\u2019ll catch it!\u201d\n\nSome minutes later the widow\u2019s guests were at the supper-table, and a\ndozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room,\nafter the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr.\nJones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the\nhonor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was\nanother person whose modesty\u2014\n\nAnd so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck\u2019s share in\nthe adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the\nsurprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and\neffusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However,\nthe widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many\ncompliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot\nthe nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely\nintolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody\u2019s gaze\nand everybody\u2019s laudations.\n\nThe widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him\neducated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in\nbusiness in a modest way. Tom\u2019s chance was come. He said:\n\n\u201cHuck don\u2019t need it. Huck\u2019s rich.\u201d\n\nNothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept\nback the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But\nthe silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:\n\n\u201cHuck\u2019s got money. Maybe you don\u2019t believe it, but he\u2019s got lots of it.\nOh, you needn\u2019t smile\u2014I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute.\u201d\n\nTom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed\ninterest\u2014and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.\n\n\u201cSid, what ails Tom?\u201d said Aunt Polly. \u201cHe\u2014well, there ain\u2019t ever any\nmaking of that boy out. I never\u2014\u201d\n\nTom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly\ndid not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the\ntable and said:\n\n\u201cThere\u2014what did I tell you? Half of it\u2019s Huck\u2019s and half of it\u2019s mine!\u201d\n\nThe spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for\na moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said\nhe could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of\ninterest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the\ncharm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:\n\n\u201cI thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it\ndon\u2019t amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I\u2019m\nwilling to allow.\u201d\n\nThe money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand\ndollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time\nbefore, though several persons were there who were worth considerably\nmore than that in property.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nThe reader may rest satisfied that Tom\u2019s and Huck\u2019s windfall made a\nmighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a\nsum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked\nabout, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the citizens\ntottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every \u201chaunted\u201d\nhouse in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected,\nplank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden\ntreasure\u2014and not by boys, but men\u2014pretty grave, unromantic men, too,\nsome of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted, admired,\nstared at. The boys were not able to remember that their remarks had\npossessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and\nrepeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as\nremarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying\ncommonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and\ndiscovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper\npublished biographical sketches of the boys.\n\nThe Widow Douglas put Huck\u2019s money out at six per cent., and Judge\nThatcher did the same with Tom\u2019s at Aunt Polly\u2019s request. Each lad had\nan income, now, that was simply prodigious\u2014a dollar for every weekday in\nthe year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got\u2014no,\nit was what he was promised\u2014he generally couldn\u2019t collect it. A dollar\nand a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old\nsimple days\u2014and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.\n\nJudge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no\ncommonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When\nBecky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her\nwhipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded\ngrace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that\nwhipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine\noutburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie\u2014a lie that\nwas worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to\nbreast with George Washington\u2019s lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky\nthought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he\nwalked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight\noff and told Tom about it.\n\nJudge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some\nday. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the\nNational Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school\nin the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or\nboth.\n\nHuck Finn\u2019s wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas\u2019\nprotection introduced him into society\u2014no, dragged him into it, hurled\nhim into it\u2014and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The\nwidow\u2019s servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they\nbedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot\nor stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. He had\nto eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate;\nhe had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so\nproperly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he\nturned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him\nhand and foot.\n\nHe bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up\nmissing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in\ngreat distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched high\nand low, they dragged the river for his body. Early the third morning\nTom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind\nthe abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee.\nHuck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and\nends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. He was\nunkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made\nhim picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him\nout, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home.\nHuck\u2019s face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy cast. He\nsaid:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk about it, Tom. I\u2019ve tried it, and it don\u2019t work; it don\u2019t\nwork, Tom. It ain\u2019t for me; I ain\u2019t used to it. The widder\u2019s good to me,\nand friendly; but I can\u2019t stand them ways. She makes me get up just\nat the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all\nto thunder; she won\u2019t let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them\nblamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don\u2019t seem to any air\ngit through \u2019em, somehow; and they\u2019re so rotten nice that I can\u2019t\nset down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher\u2019s; I hain\u2019t slid on a\ncellar-door for\u2014well, it \u2019pears to be years; I got to go to church\nand sweat and sweat\u2014I hate them ornery sermons! I can\u2019t ketch a fly in\nthere, I can\u2019t chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by\na bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell\u2014everything\u2019s so\nawful reg\u2019lar a body can\u2019t stand it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, everybody does that way, Huck.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, it don\u2019t make no difference. I ain\u2019t everybody, and I can\u2019t\n_stand_ it. It\u2019s awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy\u2014I don\u2019t\ntake no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing;\nI got to ask to go in a-swimming\u2014dern\u2019d if I hain\u2019t got to ask to do\neverything. Well, I\u2019d got to talk so nice it wasn\u2019t no comfort\u2014I\u2019d got\nto go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste\nin my mouth, or I\u2019d a died, Tom. The widder wouldn\u2019t let me smoke;\nshe wouldn\u2019t let me yell, she wouldn\u2019t let me gape, nor stretch, nor\nscratch, before folks\u2014\u201d [Then with a spasm of special irritation and\ninjury]\u2014\u201cAnd dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a\nwoman! I _had_ to shove, Tom\u2014I just had to. And besides, that school\u2019s\ngoing to open, and I\u2019d a had to go to it\u2014well, I wouldn\u2019t stand _that_,\nTom. Looky-here, Tom, being rich ain\u2019t what it\u2019s cracked up to be. It\u2019s\njust worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead\nall the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar\u2019l suits me, and\nI ain\u2019t ever going to shake \u2019em any more. Tom, I wouldn\u2019t ever got into\nall this trouble if it hadn\u2019t \u2019a\u2019 ben for that money; now you just take\nmy sheer of it along with your\u2019n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes\u2014not\nmany times, becuz I don\u2019t give a dern for a thing \u2019thout it\u2019s tollable\nhard to git\u2014and you go and beg off for me with the widder.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Huck, you know I can\u2019t do that. \u2019Tain\u2019t fair; and besides if you\u2019ll\ntry this thing just a while longer you\u2019ll come to like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike it! Yes\u2014the way I\u2019d like a hot stove if I was to set on it long\nenough. No, Tom, I won\u2019t be rich, and I won\u2019t live in them cussed\nsmothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and\nI\u2019ll stick to \u2019em, too. Blame it all! just as we\u2019d got guns, and a cave,\nand all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to come up\nand spile it all!\u201d\n\nTom saw his opportunity\u2014\n\n\u201cLookyhere, Huck, being rich ain\u2019t going to keep me back from turning\nrobber.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as dead earnest as I\u2019m sitting here. But Huck, we can\u2019t let you\ninto the gang if you ain\u2019t respectable, you know.\u201d\n\nHuck\u2019s joy was quenched.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t let me in, Tom? Didn\u2019t you let me go for a pirate?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but that\u2019s different. A robber is more high-toned than what a\npirate is\u2014as a general thing. In most countries they\u2019re awful high up in\nthe nobility\u2014dukes and such.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, Tom, hain\u2019t you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn\u2019t shet me\nout, would you, Tom? You wouldn\u2019t do that, now, _would_ you, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuck, I wouldn\u2019t want to, and I _don\u2019t_ want to\u2014but what would people\nsay? Why, they\u2019d say, \u2018Mph! Tom Sawyer\u2019s Gang! pretty low characters in\nit!\u2019 They\u2019d mean you, Huck. You wouldn\u2019t like that, and I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHuck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he\nsaid:\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I\ncan come to stand it, if you\u2019ll let me b\u2019long to the gang, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, Huck, it\u2019s a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I\u2019ll ask the\nwidow to let up on you a little, Huck.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you, Tom\u2014now will you? That\u2019s good. If she\u2019ll let up on some of\nthe roughest things, I\u2019ll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd\nthrough or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, right off. We\u2019ll get the boys together and have the initiation\ntonight, maybe.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave the which?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave the initiation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang\u2019s\nsecrets, even if you\u2019re chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and\nall his family that hurts one of the gang.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s gay\u2014that\u2019s mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I bet it is. And all that swearing\u2019s got to be done at midnight,\nin the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find\u2014a ha\u2019nted house is the\nbest, but they\u2019re all ripped up now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, midnight\u2019s good, anyway, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, so it is. And you\u2019ve got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with\nblood.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s something _like_! Why, it\u2019s a million times bullier than\npirating. I\u2019ll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be\na reg\u2019lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking \u2019bout it, I reckon\nshe\u2019ll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.\u201d\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSo endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a _boy_, it\nmust stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the\nhistory of a _man_. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows\nexactly where to stop\u2014that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of\njuveniles, he must stop where he best can.\n\nMost of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are\nprosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the\nstory of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they\nturned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that\npart of their lives at present.\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            "}

Since then I have deciphered some more of Adam\u2019s\nhieroglyphics, and think he has now become sufficiently important as a\npublic character to justify this publication.\u2014M. T.]\n\n\n\n\nMonday\n\n\nThis new creature with the long hair is a good deal in the way. It is\nalways hanging around and following me about. I don\u2019t like this; I am\nnot used to company. I wish it would stay with the other animals.\nCloudy to-day, wind in the east; think we shall have rain\u2026. Where did I\nget that word?\u2026 I remember now\u2014the new creature uses it.\n\n\n\n\nTuesday\n\n\nBeen examining the great waterfall. It is the finest thing on the\nestate, I think. The new creature calls it Niagara Falls\u2014why, I am sure\nI do not know. Says it looks like Niagara Falls. That is not a reason;\nit is mere waywardness and imbecility. I get no chance to name anything\nmyself. The new creature names everything that comes along, before I\ncan get in a protest. And always that same pretext is offered\u2014it looks\nlike the thing. There is the dodo, for instance. Says the moment one\nlooks at it one sees at a glance that it \u201clooks like a dodo.\u201d It will\nhave to keep that name, no doubt. It wearies me to fret about it, and\nit does no good, anyway. Dodo! It looks no more like a dodo than I do.\n\n\n\n\nWednesday\n\n\nBuilt me a shelter against the rain, but could not have it to myself in\npeace. The new creature intruded. When I tried to put it out it shed\nwater out of the holes it looks with, and wiped it away with the back\nof its paws, and made a noise such as some of the other animals make\nwhen they are in distress. I wish it would not talk; it is always\ntalking. That sounds like a cheap fling at the poor creature, a slur;\nbut I do not mean it so. I have never heard the human voice before, and\nany new and strange sound intruding itself here upon the solemn hush of\nthese dreaming solitudes offends my ear and seems a false note. And\nthis new sound is so close to me; it is right at my shoulder, right at\nmy ear, first on one side and then on the other, and I am used only to\nsounds that are more or less distant from me.\n\n\n\n\nFriday\n\n\nThe naming goes recklessly on, in spite of anything I can do. I had a\nvery good name for the estate, and it was musical and pretty\n\u2014GARDEN-OF-EDEN. Privately, I continue to call it that, but not any\nlonger publicly. The new creature says it is all woods and rocks and\nscenery, and therefore has no resemblance to a garden. Says it looks\nlike a park, and does not look like anything but a park. Consequently,\nwithout consulting me, it has been new-named \u2014NIAGARA FALLS PARK. This\nis sufficiently high-handed, it seems to me. And already there is a\nsign up:\n\nKEEP OFF THE GRASS\n\nMy life is not as happy as it was.\n\n\n\n\nSaturday\n\n\nThe new creature eats too much fruit. We are going to run short, most\nlikely. \u201cWe\u201d again\u2014that is its word; mine too, now, from hearing it so\nmuch. Good deal of fog this morning. I do not go out in the fog myself.\nThe new creature does. It goes out in all weathers, and stumps right in\nwith its muddy feet. And talks. It used to be so pleasant and quiet\nhere.\n\n\n\n\nSunday\n\n\nPulled through. This day is getting to be more and more trying. It was\nselected and set apart last November as a day of rest. I already had\nsix of them per week, before. This morning found the new creature\ntrying to clod apples out of that forbidden tree.\n\n\n\n\nMonday\n\n\nThe new creature says its name is Eve. That is all right, I have no\nobjections. Says it is to call it by when I want it to come. I said it\nwas superfluous, then. The word evidently raised me in its respect; and\nindeed it is a large, good word, and will bear repetition. It says it\nis not an It, it is a She. This is probably doubtful; yet it is all one\nto me; what she is were nothing to me if she would but go by herself\nand not talk.\n\n\n\n\nTuesday\n\n\nShe has littered the whole estate with execrable names and offensive\nsigns:\n\nTHIS WAY TO THE WHIRLPOOL.\n\nTHIS WAY TO GOAT ISLAND.\n\nCAVE OF THE WINDS THIS WAY.\n\nShe says this park would make a tidy summer resort, if there was any\ncustom for it. Summer resort\u2014another invention of hers\u2014just words,\nwithout any meaning. What is a summer resort? But it is best not to ask\nher, she has such a rage for explaining.\n\n\n\n\nFriday\n\n\nShe has taken to beseeching me to stop going over the Falls. What harm\ndoes it do? Says it makes her shudder. I wonder why. I have always done\nit\u2014always liked the plunge, and the excitement, and the coolness. I\nsupposed it was what the Falls were for. They have no other use that I\ncan see, and they must have been made for something. She says they were\nonly made for scenery\u2014like the rhinoceros and the mastodon.\n\nI went over the Falls in a barrel\u2014not satisfactory to her. Went over in\na tub\u2014still not satisfactory. Swam the Whirlpool and the Rapids in a\nfig-leaf suit. It got much damaged. Hence, tedious complaints about my\nextravagance. I am too much hampered here. What I need is change of\nscene.\n\n\n\n\nSaturday\n\n\nI escaped last Tuesday night, and travelled two days, and built me\nanother shelter, in a secluded place, and obliterated my tracks as well\nas I could, but she hunted me out by means of a beast which she has\ntamed and calls a wolf, and came making that pitiful noise again, and\nshedding that water out of the places she looks with. I was obliged to\nreturn with her, but will presently emigrate again, when occasion\noffers. She engages herself in many foolish things: among others,\ntrying to study out why the animals called lions and tigers live on\ngrass and flowers, when, as she says, the sort of teeth they wear would\nindicate that they were intended to eat each other. This is foolish,\nbecause to do that would be to kill each other, and that would\nintroduce what, as I understand it, is called \u201cdeath;\u201d and death, as I\nhave been told, has not yet entered the Park. Which is a pity, on some\naccounts.\n\n\n\n\nSunday\n\n\nPulled through.\n\n\n\n\nMonday\n\n\nI believe I see what the week is for: it is to give time to rest up\nfrom the weariness of Sunday. It seems a good idea\u2026. She has been\nclimbing that tree again. Clodded her out of it. She said nobody was\nlooking. Seems to consider that a sufficient justification for chancing\nany dangerous thing. Told her that. The word justification moved her\nadmiration\u2014and envy too, I thought. It is a good word.\n\n\n\n\nThursday\n\n\nShe told me she was made out of a rib taken from my body. This is at\nleast doubtful, if not more than that. I have not missed any rib\u2026. She\nis in much trouble about the buzzard; says grass does not agree with\nit; is afraid she can\u2019t raise it; thinks it was intended to live on\ndecayed flesh. The buzzard must get along the best it can with what is\nprovided. We cannot overturn the whole scheme to accommodate the\nbuzzard.\n\n\n\n\nSaturday\n\n\nShe fell in the pond yesterday, when she was looking at herself in it,\nwhich she is always doing. She nearly strangled, and said it was most\nuncomfortable. This made her sorry for the creatures which live in\nthere, which she calls fish, for she continues to fasten names on to\nthings that don\u2019t need them and don\u2019t come when they are called by\nthem, which is a matter of no consequence to her, as she is such a\nnumskull anyway; so she got a lot of them out and brought them in last\nnight and put them in my bed to keep warm, but I have noticed them now\nand then all day, and I don\u2019t see that they are any happier there than\nthey were before, only quieter. When night comes I shall throw them\nout-doors. I will not sleep with them again, for I find them clammy and\nunpleasant to lie among when a person hasn\u2019t anything on.\n\n\n\n\nSunday\n\n\nPulled through.\n\n\n\n\nTuesday\n\n\nShe has taken up with a snake now. The other animals are glad, for she\nwas always experimenting with them and bothering them; and I am glad,\nbecause the snake talks, and this enables me to get a rest.\n\n\n\n\nFriday\n\n\nShe says the snake advises her to try the fruit of that tree, and says\nthe result will be a great and fine and noble education. I told her\nthere would be another result, too\u2014it would introduce death into the\nworld. That was a mistake\u2014it had been better to keep the remark to\nmyself; it only gave her an idea\u2014she could save the sick buzzard, and\nfurnish fresh meat to the despondent lions and tigers. I advised her to\nkeep away from the tree. She said she wouldn\u2019t. I foresee trouble. Will\nemigrate.\n\n\n\n\nWednesday\n\n\nI have had a variegated time. I escaped that night, and rode a horse\nall night as fast as he could go, hoping to get clear out of the Park\nand hide in some other country before the trouble should begin; but it\nwas not to be. About an hour after sunup, as I was riding through a\nflowery plain where thousands of animals were grazing, slumbering, or\nplaying with each other, according to their wont, all of a sudden they\nbroke into a tempest of frightful noises, and in one moment the plain\nwas in a frantic commotion and every beast was destroying its neighbor.\nI knew what it meant\u2014Eve had eaten that fruit, and death was come into\nthe world\u2026. The tigers ate my horse, paying no attention when I ordered\nthem to desist, and they would even have eaten me if I had stayed\u2014which\nI didn\u2019t, but went away in much haste\u2026. I found this place, outside the\nPark, and was fairly comfortable for a few days, but she has found me\nout. Found me out, and has named the place Tonawanda\u2014says it looks like\nthat. In fact, I was not sorry she came, for there are but meagre\npickings here, and she brought some of those apples. I was obliged to\neat them, I was so hungry. It was against my principles, but I find\nthat principles have no real force except when one is well fed\u2026. She\ncame curtained in boughs and bunches of leaves, and when I asked her\nwhat she meant by such nonsense, and snatched them away and threw them\ndown, she tittered and blushed. I had never seen a person titter and\nblush before, and to me it seemed unbecoming and idiotic. She said I\nwould soon know how it was myself. This was correct. Hungry as I was, I\nlaid down the apple half eaten\u2014certainly the best one I ever saw,\nconsidering the lateness of the season\u2014and arrayed myself in the\ndiscarded boughs and branches, and then spoke to her with some severity\nand ordered her to go and get some more and not make such a spectacle\nof herself. She did it, and after this we crept down to where the\nwild-beast battle had been, and collected some skins, and I made her\npatch together a couple of suits proper for public occasions. They are\nuncomfortable, it is true, but stylish, and that is the main point\nabout clothes. \u2026 I find she is a good deal of a companion. I see I\nshould be lonesome and depressed without her, now that I have lost my\nproperty. Another thing, she says it is ordered that we work for our\nliving hereafter. She will be useful. I will superintend.\n\n\n\n\nTen Days Later\n\n\nShe accuses me of being the cause of our disaster! She says, with\napparent sincerity and truth, that the Serpent assured her that the\nforbidden fruit was not apples, it was chestnuts. I said I was\ninnocent, then, for I had not eaten any chestnuts. She said the Serpent\ninformed her that \u201cchestnut\u201d was a figurative term meaning an aged and\nmouldy joke. I turned pale at that, for I have made many jokes to pass\nthe weary time, and some of them could have been of that sort, though I\nhad honestly supposed that they were new when I made them. She asked me\nif I had made one just at the time of the catastrophe. I was obliged to\nadmit that I had made one to myself, though not aloud. It was this. I\nwas thinking about the Falls, and I said to myself, \u201cHow wonderful it\nis to see that vast body of water tumble down there!\u201d Then in an\ninstant a bright thought flashed into my head, and I let it fly,\nsaying, \u201cIt would be a deal more wonderful to see it tumble up\nthere!\u201d\u2014and I was just about to kill myself with laughing at it when\nall nature broke loose in war and death, and I had to flee for my life.\n\u201cThere,\u201d she said, with triumph, \u201cthat is just it; the Serpent\nmentioned that very jest, and called it the First Chestnut, and said it\nwas coeval with the creation.\u201d Alas, I am indeed to blame. Would that I\nwere not witty; oh, would that I had never had that radiant thought!\n\n\n\n\nNext Year\n\n\nWe have named it Cain. She caught it while I was up country trapping on\nthe North Shore of the Erie; caught it in the timber a couple of miles\nfrom our dug-out\u2014or it might have been four, she isn\u2019t certain which.\nIt resembles us in some ways, and may be a relation. That is what she\nthinks, but this is an error, in my judgment. The difference in size\nwarrants the conclusion that it is a different and new kind of animal\u2014a\nfish, perhaps, though when I put it in the water to see, it sank, and\nshe plunged in and snatched it out before there was opportunity for the\nexperiment to determine the matter. I still think it is a fish, but she\nis indifferent about what it is, and will not let me have it to try. I\ndo not understand this. The coming of the creature seems to have\nchanged her whole nature and made her unreasonable about experiments.\nShe thinks more of it than she does of any of the other animals, but is\nnot able to explain why. Her mind is disordered\u2014everything shows it.\nSometimes she carries the fish in her arms half the night when it\ncomplains and wants to get to the water. At such times the water comes\nout of the places in her face that she looks out of, and she pats the\nfish on the back and makes soft sounds with her mouth to soothe it, and\nbetrays sorrow and solicitude in a hundred ways. I have never seen her\ndo like this with any other fish, and it troubles me greatly. She used\nto carry the young tigers around so, and play with them, before we lost\nour property; but it was only play; she never took on about them like\nthis when their dinner disagreed with them.\n\n\n\n\nSunday\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t work Sundays, but lies around all tired out, and likes to\nhave the fish wallow over her; and she makes fool noises to amuse it,\nand pretends to chew its paws, and that makes it laugh. I have not seen\na fish before that could laugh. This makes me doubt\u2026. I have come to\nlike Sunday myself. Superintending all the week tires a body so. There\nought to be more Sundays. In the old days they were tough, but now they\ncome handy.\n\n\n\n\nWednesday\n\n\nIt isn\u2019t a fish. I cannot quite make out what it is. It makes curious,\ndevilish noises when not satisfied, and says \u201cgoo-goo\u201d when it is. It\nis not one of us, for it doesn\u2019t walk; it is not a bird, for it doesn\u2019t\nfly; it is not a frog, for it doesn\u2019t hop; it is not a snake, for it\ndoesn\u2019t crawl; I feel sure it is not a fish, though I cannot get a\nchance to find out whether it can swim or not. It merely lies around,\nand mostly on its back, with its feet up. I have not seen any other\nanimal do that before. I said I believed it was an enigma, but she only\nadmired the word without understanding it. In my judgment it is either\nan enigma or some kind of a bug. If it dies, I will take it apart and\nsee what its arrangements are. I never had a thing perplex me so.\n\n\n\n\nThree Months Later\n\n\nThe perplexity augments instead of diminishing. I sleep but little. It\nhas ceased from lying around, and goes about on its four legs now. Yet\nit differs from the other four-legged animals in that its front legs\nare unusually short, consequently this causes the main part of its\nperson to stick up uncomfortably high in the air, and this is not\nattractive. It is built much as we are, but its method of travelling\nshows that it is not of our breed. The short front legs and long hind\nones indicate that it is of the kangaroo family, but it is a marked\nvariation of the species, since the true kangaroo hops, whereas this\none never does. Still, it is a curious and interesting variety, and has\nnot been catalogued before. As I discovered it, I have felt justified\nin securing the credit of the discovery by attaching my name to it, and\nhence have called it Kangaroorum Adamiensis\u2026. It must have been a young\none when it came, for it has grown exceedingly since. It must be five\ntimes as big, now, as it was then, and when discontented is able to\nmake from twenty-two to thirty-eight times the noise it made at first.\nCoercion does not modify this, but has the contrary effect. For this\nreason I discontinued the system. She reconciles it by persuasion, and\nby giving it things which she had previously told it she wouldn\u2019t give\nit. As already observed, I was not at home when it first came, and she\ntold me she found it in the woods. It seems odd that it should be the\nonly one, yet it must be so, for I have worn myself out these many\nweeks trying to find another one to add to my collection, and for this\none to play with; for surely then it would be quieter, and we could\ntame it more easily. But I find none, nor any vestige of any; and\nstrangest of all, no tracks. It has to live on the ground, it cannot\nhelp itself; therefore, how does it get about without leaving a track?\nI have set a dozen traps, but they do no good. I catch all small\nanimals except that one; animals that merely go into the trap out of\ncuriosity, I think, to see what the milk is there for. They never drink\nit.\n\n\n\n\nThree Months Later\n\n\nThe kangaroo still continues to grow, which is very strange and\nperplexing. I never knew one to be so long getting its growth. It has\nfur on its head now; not like kangaroo fur, but exactly like our hair,\nexcept that it is much finer and softer, and instead of being black is\nred. I am like to lose my mind over the capricious and harassing\ndevelopments of this unclassifiable zoological freak. If I could catch\nanother one\u2014but that is hopeless; it is a new variety, and the only\nsample; this is plain. But I caught a true kangaroo and brought it in,\nthinking that this one, being lonesome, would rather have that for\ncompany than have no kin at all, or any animal it could feel a nearness\nto or get sympathy from in its forlorn condition here among strangers\nwho do not know its ways or habits, or what to do to make it feel that\nit is among friends; but it was a mistake\u2014it went into such fits at the\nsight of the kangaroo that I was convinced it had never seen one\nbefore. I pity the poor noisy little animal, but there is nothing I can\ndo to make it happy. If I could tame it\u2014but that is out of the\nquestion; the more I try, the worse I seem to make it. It grieves me to\nthe heart to see it in its little storms of sorrow and passion. I\nwanted to let it go, but she wouldn\u2019t hear of it. That seemed cruel and\nnot like her; and yet she may be right. It might be lonelier than ever;\nfor since I cannot find another one, how could it?\n\n\n\n\nFive Months Later\n\n\nIt is not a kangaroo. No, for it supports itself by holding to her\nfinger, and thus goes a few steps on its hind legs, and then falls\ndown. It is probably some kind of a bear; and yet it has no tail\u2014as\nyet\u2014and no fur, except on its head. It still keeps on growing\u2014that is a\ncurious circumstance, for bears get their growth earlier than this.\nBears are dangerous\u2014since our catastrophe\u2014and I shall not be satisfied\nto have this one prowling about the place much longer without a muzzle\non. I have offered to get her a kangaroo if she would let this one go,\nbut it did no good\u2014she is determined to run us into all sorts of\nfoolish risks, I think. She was not like this before she lost her mind.\n\n\n\n\nA Fortnight Later\n\n\nI examined its mouth. There is no danger yet; it has only one tooth. It\nhas no tail yet. It makes more noise now than it ever did before\u2014and\nmainly at night. I have moved out. But I shall go over, mornings, to\nbreakfast, and to see if it has more teeth. If it gets a mouthful of\nteeth, it will be time for it to go, tail or no tail, for a bear does\nnot need a tail in order to be dangerous.\n\n\n\n\nFour Months Later\n\n\nI have been off hunting and fishing a month, up in the region that she\ncalls Buffalo; I don\u2019t know why, unless it is because there are not any\nbuffaloes there. Meantime the bear has learned to paddle around all by\nitself on its hind legs, and says \u201cpoppa\u201d and \u201cmomma.\u201d It is certainly\na new species. This resemblance to words may be purely accidental, of\ncourse, and may have no purpose or meaning; but even in that case it is\nstill extraordinary, and is a thing which no other bear can do. This\nimitation of speech, taken together with general absence of fur and\nentire absence of tail, sufficiently indicates that this is a new kind\nof bear. The further study of it will be exceedingly interesting.\nMeantime I will go off on a far expedition among the forests of the\nNorth and make an exhaustive search. There must certainly be another\none somewhere, and this one will be less dangerous when it has company\nof its own species. I will go straightway; but I will muzzle this one\nfirst.\n\n\n\n\nThree Months Later\n\n\nIt has been a weary, weary hunt, yet I have had no success. In the mean\ntime, without stirring from the home estate, she has caught another\none! I never saw such luck. I might have hunted these woods a hundred\nyears, I never should have run across that thing.\n\n\n\n\nNext Day\n\n\nI have been comparing the new one with the old one, and it is perfectly\nplain that they are the same breed.

After all these years, I see that I was\nmistaken about Eve in the beginning; it is better to live outside the\nGarden with her than inside it without her.

I find an\naccount of the affair in the thrilling little book I quoted a paragraph\nfrom in the last chapter--\"The Vigilantes of Montana; being a Reliable\nAccount of the Capture, Trial and Execution of Henry Plummer's Notorious\nRoad Agent Band: By Prof. Thos. J. Dimsdale, Virginia City, M.T.\"\nMr. Dimsdale's chapter is well worth reading, as a specimen of how the\npeople of the frontier deal with criminals when the courts of law prove\ninefficient.  Mr. Dimsdale makes two remarks about Slade, both of which\nare accurately descriptive, and one of which is exceedingly picturesque:\n\"Those who saw him in his natural state only, would pronounce him to be a\nkind husband, a most hospitable host and a courteous gentleman; on the\ncontrary, those who met him when maddened with liquor and surrounded by a\ngang of armed roughs, would pronounce him a fiend incarnate.\"  And this:\n\"From Fort Kearney, west, he was feared a great deal more than the\nalmighty.\"  For compactness, simplicity and vigor of expression, I will\n\"back\" that sentence against anything in literature.  Mr. Dimsdale's\nnarrative is as follows.  In all places where italics occur, they are\nmine:\n\n      After the execution of the five men on the 14th of January, the\n      Vigilantes considered that their work was nearly ended.  They had\n      freed the country of highwaymen and murderers to a great extent, and\n      they determined that in the absence of the regular civil authority\n      they would establish a People's Court where all offenders should be\n      tried by judge and jury.  This was the nearest approach to social\n      order that the circumstances permitted, and, though strict legal\n      authority was wanting, yet the people were firmly determined to\n      maintain its efficiency, and to enforce its decrees.  It may here be\n      mentioned that the overt act which was the last round on the fatal\n      ladder leading to the scaffold on which Slade perished, was the\n      tearing in pieces and stamping upon a writ of this court, followed\n      by his arrest of the Judge Alex. Davis, by authority of a presented\n      Derringer, and with his own hands.\n\n      J. A. Slade was himself, we have been informed, a Vigilante; he\n      openly boasted of it, and said he knew all that they knew.  He was\n      never accused, or even suspected, of either murder or robbery,\n      committed in this Territory (the latter crime was never laid to his\n      charge, in any place); but that he had killed several men in other\n      localities was notorious, and his bad reputation in this respect was\n      a most powerful argument in determining his fate, when he was\n      finally arrested for the offence above mentioned.  On returning from\n      Milk River he became more and more addicted to drinking, until at\n      last it was a common feat for him and his friends to \"take the\n      town.\"  He and a couple of his dependents might often be seen on one\n      horse, galloping through the streets, shouting and yelling, firing\n      revolvers, etc.  On many occasions he would ride his horse into\n      stores, break up bars, toss the scales out of doors and use most\n      insulting language to parties present.  Just previous to the day of\n      his arrest, he had given a fearful beating to one of his followers;\n      but such was his influence over them that the man wept bitterly at\n      the gallows, and begged for his life with all his power.  It had\n      become quite common, when Slade was on a spree, for the shop-keepers\n      and citizens to close the stores and put out all the lights; being\n      fearful of some outrage at his hands.  For his wanton destruction of\n      goods and furniture, he was always ready to pay, when sober, if he\n      had money; but there were not a few who regarded payment as small\n      satisfaction for the outrage, and these men were his personal\n      enemies.\n\n      From time to time Slade received warnings from men that he well knew\n      would not deceive him, of the certain end of his conduct.  There was\n      not a moment, for weeks previous to his arrest, in which the public\n      did not expect to hear of some bloody outrage.  The dread of his\n      very name, and the presence of the armed band of hangers-on who\n      followed him alone prevented a resistance which must certainly have\n      ended in the instant murder or mutilation of the opposing party.\n\n      Slade was frequently arrested by order of the court whose\n      organization we have described, and had treated it with respect by\n      paying one or two fines and promising to pay the rest when he had\n      money; but in the transaction that occurred at this crisis, he\n      forgot even this caution, and goaded by passion and the hatred of\n      restraint, he sprang into the embrace of death.\n\n      Slade had been drunk and \"cutting up\" all night.  He and his\n      companions had made the town a perfect hell.  In the morning, J. M.\n      Fox, the sheriff, met him, arrested him, took him into court and\n      commenced reading a warrant that he had for his arrest, by way of\n      arraignment.  He became uncontrollably furious, and seizing the\n      writ, he tore it up, threw it on the ground and stamped upon it.\n\n      The clicking of the locks of his companions' revolvers was instantly\n      heard, and a crisis was expected.  The sheriff did not attempt his\n      retention; but being at least as prudent as he was valiant, he\n      succumbed, leaving Slade the master of the situation and the\n      conqueror and ruler of the courts, law and law-makers.  This was a\n      declaration of war, and was so accepted.  The Vigilance Committee\n      now felt that the question of social order and the preponderance of\n      the law-abiding citizens had then and there to be decided.  They\n      knew the character of Slade, and they were well aware that they must\n      submit to his rule without murmur, or else that he must be dealt\n      with in such fashion as would prevent his being able to wreak his\n      vengeance on the committee, who could never have hoped to live in\n      the Territory secure from outrage or death, and who could never\n      leave it without encountering his friend, whom his victory would\n      have emboldened and stimulated to a pitch that would have rendered\n      them reckless of consequences.  The day previous he had ridden into\n      Dorris's store, and on being requested to leave, he drew his\n      revolver and threatened to kill the gentleman who spoke to him.\n      Another saloon he had led his horse into, and buying a bottle of\n      wine, he tried to make the animal drink it.  This was not considered\n      an uncommon performance, as he had often entered saloons and\n      commenced firing at the lamps, causing a wild stampede.\n\n      A leading member of the committee met Slade, and informed him in the\n      quiet, earnest manner of one who feels the importance of what he is\n      saying: \"Slade, get your horse at once, and go home, or there will\n      be ---- to pay.\"  Slade started and took a long look, with his dark\n      and piercing eyes, at the gentleman.  \"What do you mean?\"  said he.\n      \"You have no right to ask me what I mean,\" was the quiet reply, \"get\n      your horse at once, and remember what I tell you.\"  After a short\n      pause he promised to do so, and actually got into the saddle; but,\n      being still intoxicated, he began calling aloud to one after another\n      of his friends, and at last seemed to have forgotten the warning he\n      had received and became again uproarious, shouting the name of a\n      well-known courtezan in company with those of two men whom he\n      considered heads of the committee, as a sort of challenge; perhaps,\n      however, as a simple act of bravado.  It seems probable that the\n      intimation of personal danger he had received had not been forgotten\n      entirely; though fatally for him, he took a foolish way of showing\n      his remembrance of it.  He sought out Alexander Davis, the Judge of\n      the Court, and drawing a cocked Derringer, he presented it at his\n      head, and told him that he should hold him as a hostage for his own\n      safety.  As the judge stood perfectly quiet, and offered no\n      resistance to his captor, no further outrage followed on this score.\n      Previous to this, on account of the critical state of affairs, the\n      committee had met, and at last resolved to arrest him.  His\n      execution had not been agreed upon, and, at that time, would have\n      been negatived, most assuredly.  A messenger rode down to Nevada to\n      inform the leading men of what was on hand, as it was desirable to\n      show that there was a feeling of unanimity on the subject, all along\n      the gulch.\n\n      The miners turned out almost en masse, leaving their work and\n      forming in solid column about six hundred strong, armed to the\n      teeth, they marched up to Virginia.  The leader of the body well\n      knew the temper of his men on the subject.  He spurred on ahead of\n      them, and hastily calling a meeting of the executive, he told them\n      plainly that the miners meant \"business,\" and that, if they came up,\n      they would not stand in the street to be shot down by Slade's\n      friends; but that they would take him and hang him.  The meeting was\n      small, as the Virginia men were loath to act at all.  This momentous\n      announcement of the feeling of the Lower Town was made to a cluster\n      of men, who were deliberation behind a wagon, at the rear of a store\n      on Main street.\n\n      The committee were most unwilling to proceed to extremities.  All\n      the duty they had ever performed seemed as nothing to the task\n      before them; but they had to decide, and that quickly.  It was\n      finally agreed that if the whole body of the miners were of the\n      opinion that he should be hanged, that the committee left it in\n      their hands to deal with him.  Off, at hot speed, rode the leader of\n      the Nevada men to join his command.\n\n      Slade had found out what was intended, and the news sobered him\n      instantly.  He went into P. S. Pfouts' store, where Davis was, and\n      apologized for his conduct, saying that he would take it all back.\n\n      The head of the column now wheeled into Wallace street and marched\n      up at quick time.  Halting in front of the store, the executive\n      officer of the committee stepped forward and arrested Slade, who was\n      at once informed of his doom, and inquiry was made as to whether he\n      had any business to settle.  Several parties spoke to him on the\n      subject; but to all such inquiries he turned a deaf ear, being\n      entirely absorbed in the terrifying reflections on his own awful\n      position.  He never ceased his entreaties for life, and to see his\n      dear wife.  The unfortunate lady referred to, between whom and Slade\n      there existed a warm affection, was at this time living at their\n      ranch on the Madison.  She was possessed of considerable personal\n      attractions; tall, well-formed, of graceful carriage, pleasing\n      manners, and was, withal, an accomplished horsewoman.\n\n      A messenger from Slade rode at full speed to inform her of her\n      husband's arrest.  In an instant she was in the saddle, and with all\n      the energy that love and despair could lend to an ardent temperament\n      and a strong physique, she urged her fleet charger over the twelve\n      miles of rough and rocky ground that intervened between her and the\n      object of her passionate devotion.\n\n      Meanwhile a party of volunteers had made the necessary preparations\n      for the execution, in the valley traversed by the branch.  Beneath\n      the site of Pfouts and Russell's stone building there was a corral,\n      the gate-posts of which were strong and high.  Across the top was\n      laid a beam, to which the rope was fastened, and a dry-goods box\n      served for the platform.  To this place Slade was marched,\n      surrounded by a guard, composing the best armed and most numerous\n      force that has ever appeared in Montana Territory.\n\n      The doomed man had so exhausted himself by tears, prayers and\n      lamentations, that he had scarcely strength left to stand under the\n      fatal beam.  He repeatedly exclaimed, \"My God! my God! must I die?\n      Oh, my dear wife!\"\n\n      On the return of the fatigue party, they encountered some friends of\n      Slade, staunch and reliable citizens and members of the committee,\n      but who were personally attached to the condemned.  On hearing of\n      his sentence, one of them, a stout-hearted man, pulled out his\n      handkerchief and walked away, weeping like a child.  Slade still\n      begged to see his wife, most piteously, and it seemed hard to deny\n      his request; but the bloody consequences that were sure to follow\n      the inevitable attempt at a rescue, that her presence and entreaties\n      would have certainly incited, forbade the granting of his request.\n      Several gentlemen were sent for to see him, in his last moments, one\n      of whom (Judge Davis) made a short address to the people; but in\n      such low tones as to be inaudible, save to a few in his immediate\n      vicinity.  One of his friends, after exhausting his powers of\n      entreaty, threw off his coat and declared that the prisoner could\n      not be hanged until he himself was killed.  A hundred guns were\n      instantly leveled at him; whereupon he turned and fled; but, being\n      brought back, he was compelled to resume his coat, and to give a\n      promise of future peaceable demeanor.\n\n      Scarcely a leading man in Virginia could be found, though numbers of\n      the citizens joined the ranks of the guard when the arrest was made.\n      All lamented the stern necessity which dictated the execution.\n\n      Everything being ready, the command was given, \"Men, do your duty,\"\n      and the box being instantly slipped from beneath his feet, he died\n      almost instantaneously.\n\n      The body was cut down and carried to the Virginia Hotel, where, in a\n      darkened room, it was scarcely laid out, when the unfortunate and\n      bereaved companion of the deceased arrived, at headlong speed, to\n      find that all was over, and that she was a widow.  Her grief and\n      heart-piercing cries were terrible evidences of the depth of her\n      attachment for her lost husband, and a considerable period elapsed\n      before she could regain the command of her excited feelings.\n\nThere is something about the desperado-nature that is wholly\nunaccountable--at least it looks unaccountable.  It is this.  The true\ndesperado is gifted with splendid courage, and yet he will take the most\ninfamous advantage of his enemy; armed and free, he will stand up before\na host and fight until he is shot all to pieces, and yet when he is under\nthe gallows and helpless he will cry and plead like a child.  Words are\ncheap, and it is easy to call Slade a coward (all executed men who do not\n\"die game\" are promptly called cowards by unreflecting people), and when\nwe read of Slade that he \"had so exhausted himself by tears, prayers and\nlamentations, that he had scarcely strength left to stand under the fatal\nbeam,\" the disgraceful word suggests itself in a moment--yet in\nfrequently defying and inviting the vengeance of banded Rocky Mountain\ncut-throats by shooting down their comrades and leaders, and never\noffering to hide or fly, Slade showed that he was a man of peerless\nbravery.  No coward would dare that.  Many a notorious coward, many a\nchicken-livered poltroon, coarse, brutal, degraded, has made his dying\nspeech without a quaver in his voice and been swung into eternity with\nwhat looked liked the calmest fortitude, and so we are justified in\nbelieving, from the low intellect of such a creature, that it was not\nmoral courage that enabled him to do it.  Then, if moral courage is not\nthe requisite quality, what could it have been that this stout-hearted\nSlade lacked?--this bloody, desperate, kindly-mannered, urbane gentleman,\nwho never hesitated to warn his most ruffianly enemies that he would kill\nthem whenever or wherever he came across them next!  I think it is a\nconundrum worth investigating.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nJust beyond the breakfast-station we overtook a Mormon emigrant train of\nthirty-three wagons; and tramping wearily along and driving their herd of\nloose cows, were dozens of coarse-clad and sad-looking men, women and\nchildren, who had walked as they were walking now, day after day for\neight lingering weeks, and in that time had compassed the distance our\nstage had come in eight days and three hours--seven hundred and\nninety-eight miles!  They were dusty and uncombed, hatless, bonnetless\nand ragged, and they did look so tired!\n\nAfter breakfast, we bathed in Horse Creek, a (previously) limpid,\nsparkling stream--an appreciated luxury, for it was very seldom that our\nfurious coach halted long enough for an indulgence of that kind.  We\nchanged horses ten or twelve times in every twenty-four hours--changed\nmules, rather--six mules--and did it nearly every time in four minutes.\nIt was lively work.  As our coach rattled up to each station six\nharnessed mules stepped gayly from the stable; and in the twinkling of an\neye, almost, the old team was out, and the new one in and we off and away\nagain.\n\nDuring the afternoon we passed Sweetwater Creek, Independence Rock,\nDevil's Gate and the Devil's Gap.  The latter were wild specimens of\nrugged scenery, and full of interest--we were in the heart of the Rocky\nMountains, now.  And we also passed by \"Alkali\" or \"Soda Lake,\" and we\nwoke up to the fact that our journey had stretched a long way across the\nworld when the driver said that the Mormons often came there from Great\nSalt Lake City to haul away saleratus.  He said that a few days gone by\nthey had shoveled up enough pure saleratus from the ground (it was a dry\nlake) to load two wagons, and that when they got these two wagons-loads\nof a drug that cost them nothing, to Salt Lake, they could sell it for\ntwenty-five cents a pound.\n\nIn the night we sailed by a most notable curiosity, and one we had been\nhearing a good deal about for a day or two, and were suffering to see.\nThis was what might be called a natural ice-house.  It was August, now,\nand sweltering weather in the daytime, yet at one of the stations the men\ncould scape the soil on the hill-side under the lee of a range of\nboulders, and at a depth of six inches cut out pure blocks of ice--hard,\ncompactly frozen, and clear as crystal!\n\nToward dawn we got under way again, and presently as we sat with raised\ncurtains enjoying our early-morning smoke and contemplating the first\nsplendor of the rising sun as it swept down the long array of mountain\npeaks, flushing and gilding crag after crag and summit after summit, as\nif the invisible Creator reviewed his gray veterans and they saluted with\na smile, we hove in sight of South Pass City.  The hotel-keeper, the\npostmaster, the blacksmith, the mayor, the constable, the city marshal\nand the principal citizen and property holder, all came out and greeted\nus cheerily, and we gave him good day.  He gave us a little Indian news,\nand a little Rocky Mountain news, and we gave him some Plains information\nin return.  He then retired to his lonely grandeur and we climbed on up\namong the bristling peaks and the ragged clouds.  South Pass City\nconsisted of four log cabins, one if which was unfinished, and the\ngentleman with all those offices and titles was the chiefest of the ten\ncitizens of the place.  Think of hotel-keeper, postmaster, blacksmith,\nmayor, constable, city marshal and principal citizen all condensed into\none person and crammed into one skin.  Bemis said he was \"a perfect\nAllen's revolver of dignities.\"  And he said that if he were to die as\npostmaster, or as blacksmith, or as postmaster and blacksmith both, the\npeople might stand it; but if he were to die all over, it would be a\nfrightful loss to the community.\n\nTwo miles beyond South Pass City we saw for the first time that\nmysterious marvel which all Western untraveled boys have heard of and\nfully believe in, but are sure to be astounded at when they see it with\ntheir own eyes, nevertheless--banks of snow in dead summer time.  We were\nnow far up toward the sky, and knew all the time that we must presently\nencounter lofty summits clad in the \"eternal snow\" which was so common\nplace a matter of mention in books, and yet when I did see it glittering\nin the sun on stately domes in the distance and knew the month was August\nand that my coat was hanging up because it was too warm to wear it, I was\nfull as much amazed as if I never had heard of snow in August before.\nTruly, \"seeing is believing\"--and many a man lives a long life through,\nthinking he believes certain universally received and well established\nthings, and yet never suspects that if he were confronted by those things\nonce, he would discover that he did not really believe them before, but\nonly thought he believed them.\n\nIn a little while quite a number of peaks swung into view with long claws\nof glittering snow clasping them; and with here and there, in the shade,\ndown the mountain side, a little solitary patch of snow looking no larger\nthan a lady's pocket-handkerchief but being in reality as large as a\n\"public square.\"\n\nAnd now, at last, we were fairly in the renowned SOUTH PASS, and whirling\ngayly along high above the common world.  We were perched upon the\nextreme summit of the great range of the Rocky Mountains, toward which we\nhad been climbing, patiently climbing, ceaselessly climbing, for days and\nnights together--and about us was gathered a convention of Nature's kings\nthat stood ten, twelve, and even thirteen thousand feet high--grand old\nfellows who would have to stoop to see Mount Washington, in the twilight.\nWe were in such an airy elevation above the creeping populations of the\nearth, that now and then when the obstructing crags stood out of the way\nit seemed that we could look around and abroad and contemplate the whole\ngreat globe, with its dissolving views of mountains, seas and continents\nstretching away through the mystery of the summer haze.\n\nAs a general thing the Pass was more suggestive of a valley than a\nsuspension bridge in the clouds--but it strongly suggested the latter at\none spot.  At that place the upper third of one or two majestic purple\ndomes projected above our level on either hand and gave us a sense of a\nhidden great deep of mountains and plains and valleys down about their\nbases which we fancied we might see if we could step to the edge and look\nover.  These Sultans of the fastnesses were turbaned with tumbled volumes\nof cloud, which shredded away from time to time and drifted off fringed\nand torn, trailing their continents of shadow after them; and catching\npresently on an intercepting peak, wrapped it about and brooded there\n--then shredded away again and left the purple peak, as they had left the\npurple domes, downy and white with new-laid snow.  In passing, these\nmonstrous rags of cloud hung low and swept along right over the\nspectator's head, swinging their tatters so nearly in his face that his\nimpulse was to shrink when they came closet.  In the one place I speak\nof, one could look below him upon a world of diminishing crags and\ncanyons leading down, down, and away to a vague plain with a thread in it\nwhich was a road, and bunches of feathers in it which were trees,--a\npretty picture sleeping in the sunlight--but with a darkness stealing\nover it and glooming its features  deeper and deeper under the frown of a\ncoming storm; and then, while no film or shadow marred the noon\nbrightness of his high perch, he could watch the tempest break forth down\nthere and see the lightnings leap from crag to crag and the sheeted rain\ndrive along the canyon-sides, and hear the thunders peal and crash and\nroar.  We had this spectacle; a familiar one to many, but to us a\nnovelty.\n\nWe bowled along cheerily, and presently, at the very summit (though it\nhad been all summit to us, and all equally level, for half an hour or\nmore), we came to a spring which spent its water through two outlets and\nsent it in opposite directions.  The conductor said that one of those\nstreams which we were looking at, was just starting on a journey westward\nto the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean, through hundreds and\neven thousands of miles of desert solitudes.  He said that the other was\njust leaving its home among the snow-peaks on a similar journey eastward\n--and we knew that long after we should have forgotten the simple rivulet\nit would still be plodding its patient way down the mountain sides, and\ncanyon-beds, and between the banks of the Yellowstone; and by and by\nwould join the broad Missouri and flow through unknown plains and deserts\nand unvisited wildernesses; and add a long and troubled pilgrimage among\nsnags and wrecks and sandbars; and enter the Mississippi, touch the\nwharves of St. Louis and still drift on, traversing shoals and rocky\nchannels, then endless chains of bottomless and ample bends, walled with\nunbroken forests, then mysterious byways and secret passages among woody\nislands, then the chained bends again, bordered with wide levels of\nshining sugar-cane in place of the sombre forests; then by New Orleans\nand still other chains of bends--and finally, after two long months of\ndaily and nightly harassment, excitement, enjoyment, adventure, and awful\nperil of parched throats, pumps and evaporation, pass the Gulf and enter\ninto its rest upon the bosom of the tropic sea, never to look upon its\nsnow-peaks again or regret them.\n\nI freighted a leaf with a mental message for the friends at home, and\ndropped it in the stream.  But I put no stamp on it and it was held for\npostage somewhere.\n\nOn the summit we overtook an emigrant train of many wagons, many tired\nmen and women, and many a disgusted sheep and cow.\n\nIn the wofully dusty horseman in charge of the expedition I recognized\nJohn -----.  Of all persons in the world to meet on top of the Rocky\nMountains thousands of miles from home, he was the last one I should have\nlooked for.  We were school-boys together and warm friends for years.\nBut a boyish prank of mine had disruptured this friendship and it had\nnever been renewed.  The act of which I speak was this.  I had been\naccustomed to visit occasionally an editor whose room was in the third\nstory of a building and overlooked the street.  One day this editor gave\nme a watermelon which I made preparations to devour on the spot, but\nchancing to look out of the window, I saw John standing directly under it\nand an irresistible desire came upon me to drop the melon on his head,\nwhich I immediately did.  I was the loser, for it spoiled the melon, and\nJohn never forgave me and we dropped all intercourse and parted, but now\nmet again under these circumstances.\n\nWe recognized each other simultaneously, and hands were grasped as warmly\nas if no coldness had ever existed between us, and no allusion was made\nto any.  All animosities were buried and the simple fact of meeting a\nfamiliar face in that isolated spot so far from home, was sufficient to\nmake us forget all things but pleasant ones, and we parted again with\nsincere \"good-bye\" and \"God bless you\" from both.\n\nWe had been climbing up the long shoulders of the Rocky Mountains for\nmany tedious hours--we started down them, now.  And we went spinning away\nat a round rate too.\n\nWe left the snowy Wind River Mountains and Uinta Mountains behind, and\nsped away, always through splendid scenery but occasionally through long\nranks of white skeletons of mules and oxen--monuments of the huge\nemigration of other days--and here and there were up-ended boards or\nsmall piles of stones which the driver said marked the resting-place of\nmore precious remains.\n\nIt was the loneliest land for a grave!  A land given over to the cayote\nand the raven--which is but another name for desolation and utter\nsolitude.  On damp, murky nights, these scattered skeletons gave forth a\nsoft, hideous glow, like very faint spots of moonlight starring the vague\ndesert.  It was because of the phosphorus in the bones.  But no\nscientific explanation could keep a body from shivering when he drifted\nby one of those ghostly lights and knew that a skull held it.\n\nAt midnight it began to rain, and I never saw anything like it--indeed, I\ndid not even see this, for it was too dark.  We fastened down the\ncurtains and even caulked them with clothing, but the rain streamed in in\ntwenty places, nothwithstanding.  There was no escape.  If one moved his\nfeet out of a stream, he brought his body under one; and if he moved his\nbody he caught one somewhere else.  If he struggled out of the drenched\nblankets and sat up, he was bound to get one down the back of his neck.\nMeantime the stage was wandering about a plain with gaping gullies in it,\nfor the driver could not see an inch before his face nor keep the road,\nand the storm pelted so pitilessly that there was no keeping the horses\nstill.  With the first abatement the conductor turned out with lanterns\nto look for the road, and the first dash he made was into a chasm about\nfourteen feet deep, his lantern following like a meteor.  As soon as he\ntouched bottom he sang out frantically:\n\n\"Don't come here!\"\n\nTo which the driver, who was looking over the precipice where he had\ndisappeared, replied, with an injured air: \"Think I'm a dam fool?\"\n\nThe conductor was more than an hour finding the road--a matter which\nshowed us how far we had wandered and what chances we had been taking.\nHe traced our wheel-tracks to the imminent verge of danger, in two\nplaces.  I have always been glad that we were not killed that night.\nI do not know any particular reason, but I have always been glad.\nIn the morning, the tenth day out, we crossed Green River, a fine, large,\nlimpid stream--stuck in it with the water just up to the top of our\nmail-bed, and waited till extra teams were put on to haul us up the steep\nbank.  But it was nice cool water, and besides it could not find any\nfresh place on us to wet.\n\nAt the Green River station we had breakfast--hot biscuits, fresh antelope\nsteaks, and coffee--the only decent meal we tasted between the United\nStates and Great Salt Lake City, and the only one we were ever really\nthankful for.\n\nThink of the monotonous execrableness of the thirty that went before it,\nto leave this one simple breakfast looming up in my memory like a\nshot-tower after all these years have gone by!\n\nAt five P.M.  we reached Fort Bridger, one hundred and seventeen miles\nfrom the South Pass, and one thousand and twenty-five miles from St.\nJoseph.  Fifty-two miles further on, near the head of Echo Canyon, we met\nsixty United States soldiers from Camp Floyd.  The day before, they had\nfired upon three hundred or four hundred Indians, whom they supposed\ngathered together for no good purpose.  In the fight that had ensued,\nfour Indians were captured, and the main body chased four miles, but\nnobody killed.  This looked like business.  We had a notion to get out\nand join the sixty soldiers, but upon reflecting that there were four\nhundred of the Indians, we concluded to go on and join the Indians.\n\nEcho Canyon is twenty miles long.  It was like a long, smooth, narrow\nstreet, with a gradual descending grade, and shut in by enormous\nperpendicular walls of coarse conglomerate, four hundred feet high in\nmany places, and turreted like mediaeval castles.  This was the most\nfaultless piece of road in the mountains, and the driver said he would\n\"let his team out.\"  He did, and if the Pacific express trains whiz\nthrough there now any faster than we did then in the stage-coach, I envy\nthe passengers the exhilaration of it.  We fairly seemed to pick up our\nwheels and fly--and the mail matter was lifted up free from everything\nand held in solution!  I am not given to exaggeration, and when I say a\nthing I mean it.\n\nHowever, time presses.  At four in the afternoon we arrived on the summit\nof Big Mountain, fifteen miles from Salt Lake City, when all the world\nwas glorified with the setting sun, and the most stupendous panorama of\nmountain peaks yet encountered burst on our sight.  We looked out upon\nthis sublime spectacle from under the arch of a brilliant rainbow!  Even\nthe overland stage-driver stopped his horses and gazed!\n\nHalf an hour or an hour later, we changed horses, and took supper with a\nMormon \"Destroying Angel.\"\n\n\"Destroying Angels,\" as I understand it, are Latter-Day Saints who are\nset apart by the Church to conduct permanent disappearances of obnoxious\ncitizens.  I had heard a deal about these Mormon Destroying Angels and\nthe dark and bloody deeds they had done, and when I entered this one's\nhouse I had my shudder all ready.  But alas for all our romances, he was\nnothing but a loud, profane, offensive, old blackguard!  He was murderous\nenough, possibly, to fill the bill of a Destroyer, but would you have any\nkind of an Angel devoid of dignity?  Could you abide an Angel in an\nunclean shirt and no suspenders?  Could you respect an Angel with a\nhorse-laugh and a swagger like a buccaneer?\n\nThere were other blackguards present--comrades of this one.  And there\nwas one person that looked like a gentleman--Heber C. Kimball's son, tall\nand well made, and thirty years old, perhaps.  A lot of slatternly women\nflitted hither and thither in a hurry, with coffee-pots, plates of bread,\nand other appurtenances to supper, and these were said to be the wives of\nthe Angel--or some of them, at least.  And of course they were; for if\nthey had been hired \"help\" they would not have let an angel from above\nstorm and swear at them as he did, let alone one from the place this one\nhailed from.\n\nThis was our first experience of the western \"peculiar institution,\" and\nit was not very prepossessing.  We did not tarry long to observe it, but\nhurried on to the home of the Latter-Day Saints, the stronghold of the\nprophets, the capital of the only absolute monarch in America--Great Salt\nLake City.  As the night closed in we took sanctuary in the Salt Lake\nHouse and unpacked our baggage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nWe had a fine supper, of the freshest meats and fowls and vegetables--a\ngreat variety and as great abundance.  We walked about the streets some,\nafterward, and glanced in at shops and stores; and there was fascination\nin surreptitiously staring at every creature we took to be a Mormon.\nThis was fairy-land to us, to all intents and purposes--a land of\nenchantment, and goblins, and awful mystery.  We felt a curiosity to ask\nevery child how many mothers it had, and if it could tell them apart; and\nwe experienced a thrill every time a dwelling-house door opened and shut\nas we passed, disclosing a glimpse of human heads and backs and\nshoulders--for we so longed to have a good satisfying look at a Mormon\nfamily in all its comprehensive ampleness, disposed in the customary\nconcentric rings of its home circle.\n\nBy and by the Acting Governor of the Territory introduced us to other\n\"Gentiles,\" and we spent a sociable hour with them.  \"Gentiles\" are\npeople who are not Mormons.  Our fellow-passenger, Bemis, took care of\nhimself, during this part of the evening, and did not make an\noverpowering success of it, either, for he came into our room in the\nhotel about eleven o'clock, full of cheerfulness, and talking loosely,\ndisjointedly and indiscriminately, and every now and then tugging out a\nragged word by the roots that had more hiccups than syllables in it.\nThis, together with his hanging his coat on the floor on one side of a\nchair, and his vest on the floor on the other side, and piling his pants\non the floor just in front of the same chair, and then comtemplating the\ngeneral result with superstitious awe, and finally pronouncing it \"too\nmany for him\" and going to bed with his boots on, led us to fear that\nsomething he had eaten had not agreed with him.\n\nBut we knew afterward that it was something he had been drinking.  It was\nthe exclusively Mormon refresher, \"valley tan.\"\n\nValley tan (or, at least, one form of valley tan) is a kind of whisky,\nor first cousin to it; is of Mormon invention and manufactured only in\nUtah.  Tradition says it is made of (imported) fire and brimstone.  If I\nremember rightly no public drinking saloons were allowed in the kingdom\nby Brigham Young, and no private drinking permitted among the faithful,\nexcept they confined themselves to \"valley tan.\"\n\nNext day we strolled about everywhere through the broad, straight, level\nstreets, and enjoyed the pleasant strangeness of a city of fifteen\nthousand inhabitants with no loafers perceptible in it; and no visible\ndrunkards or noisy people; a limpid stream rippling and dancing through\nevery street in place of a filthy gutter; block after block of trim\ndwellings, built of \"frame\" and sunburned brick--a great thriving orchard\nand garden behind every one of them, apparently--branches from the street\nstream winding and sparkling among the garden beds and fruit trees--and a\ngrand general air of neatness, repair, thrift and comfort, around and\nabout and over the whole.  And everywhere were workshops, factories, and\nall manner of industries; and intent faces and busy hands were to be seen\nwherever one looked; and in one's ears was the ceaseless clink of\nhammers, the buzz of trade and the contented hum of drums and fly-wheels.\n\nThe armorial crest of my own State consisted of two dissolute bears\nholding up the head of a dead and gone cask between them and making the\npertinent remark, \"UNITED, WE STAND--(hic!)--DIVIDED, WE FALL.\"  It was\nalways too figurative for the author of this book.  But the Mormon crest\nwas easy.  And it was simple, unostentatious, and fitted like a glove.\nIt was a representation of a GOLDEN BEEHIVE, with the bees all at work!\n\nThe city lies in the edge of a level plain as broad as the State of\nConnecticut, and crouches close down to the ground under a curving wall\nof mighty mountains whose heads are hidden in the clouds, and whose\nshoulders bear relics of the snows of winter all the summer long.\n\nSeen from one of these dizzy heights, twelve or fifteen miles off, Great\nSalt Lake City is toned down and diminished till it is suggestive of a\nchild's toy-village reposing under the majestic protection of the Chinese\nwall.\n\nOn some of those mountains, to the southwest, it had been raining every\nday for two weeks, but not a drop had fallen in the city.  And on hot\ndays in late spring and early autumn the citizens could quit fanning and\ngrowling and go out and cool off by looking at the luxury of a glorious\nsnow-storm going on in the mountains.  They could enjoy it at a distance,\nat those seasons, every day, though no snow would fall in their streets,\nor anywhere near them.\n\nSalt Lake City was healthy--an extremely healthy city.\n\nThey declared there was only one physician in the place and he was\narrested every week regularly and held to answer under the vagrant act\nfor having \"no visible means of support.\"  They always give you a good\nsubstantial article of truth in Salt Lake, and good measure and good\nweight, too. [Very often, if you wished to weigh one of their airiest\nlittle commonplace statements you would want the hay scales.]\n\nWe desired to visit the famous inland sea, the American \"Dead Sea,\" the\ngreat Salt Lake--seventeen miles, horseback, from the city--for we had\ndreamed about it, and thought about it, and talked about it, and yearned\nto see it, all the first part of our trip; but now when it was only arm's\nlength away it had suddenly lost nearly every bit of its interest.  And\nso we put it off, in a sort of general way, till next day--and that was\nthe last we ever thought of it.  We dined with some hospitable Gentiles;\nand visited the foundation of the prodigious temple; and talked long with\nthat shrewd Connecticut Yankee, Heber C. Kimball (since deceased), a\nsaint of high degree and a mighty man of commerce.\n\nWe saw the \"Tithing-House,\" and the \"Lion House,\" and I do not know or\nremember how many more church and government buildings of various kinds\nand curious names.  We flitted hither and thither and enjoyed every hour,\nand picked up a great deal of useful information and entertaining\nnonsense, and went to bed at night satisfied.\n\nThe second day, we made the acquaintance of Mr. Street (since deceased)\nand put on white shirts and went and paid a state visit to the king.\nHe seemed a quiet, kindly, easy-mannered, dignified, self-possessed old\ngentleman of fifty-five or sixty, and had a gentle craft in his eye that\nprobably belonged there.  He was very simply dressed and was just taking\noff a straw hat as we entered.  He talked about Utah, and the Indians,\nand Nevada, and general American matters and questions, with our\nsecretary and certain government officials who came with us.  But he\nnever paid any attention to me, notwithstanding I made several attempts\nto \"draw him out\" on federal politics and his high handed attitude toward\nCongress.  I thought some of the things I said were rather fine.  But he\nmerely looked around at me, at distant intervals, something as I have\nseen a benignant old cat look around to see which kitten was meddling\nwith her tail.\n\nBy and by I subsided into an indignant silence, and so sat until the end,\nhot and flushed, and execrating him in my heart for an ignorant savage.\nBut he was calm.  His conversation with those gentlemen flowed on as\nsweetly and peacefully and musically as any summer brook.  When the\naudience was ended and we were retiring from the presence, he put his\nhand on my head, beamed down on me in an admiring way and said to my\nbrother:\n\n\"Ah--your child, I presume?  Boy, or girl?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nMr. Street was very busy with his telegraphic matters--and considering\nthat he had eight or nine hundred miles of rugged, snowy, uninhabited\nmountains, and waterless, treeless, melancholy deserts to traverse with\nhis wire, it was natural and needful that he should be as busy as\npossible.  He could not go comfortably along and cut his poles by the\nroad-side, either, but they had to be hauled by ox teams across those\nexhausting deserts--and it was two days' journey from water to water, in\none or two of them.  Mr. Street's contract was a vast work, every way one\nlooked at it; and yet to comprehend what the vague words \"eight hundred\nmiles of rugged mountains and dismal deserts\" mean, one must go over the\nground in person--pen and ink descriptions cannot convey the dreary\nreality to the reader.  And after all, Mr. S.'s mightiest difficulty\nturned out to be one which he had never taken into the account at all.\nUnto Mormons he had sub-let the hardest and heaviest half of his great\nundertaking, and all of a sudden they concluded that they were going to\nmake little or nothing, and so they tranquilly threw their poles\noverboard in mountain or desert, just as it happened when they took the\nnotion, and drove home and went about their customary business!  They\nwere under written contract to Mr. Street, but they did not care anything\nfor that.  They said they would \"admire\" to see a \"Gentile\" force a\nMormon to fulfil a losing contract in Utah!  And they made themselves\nvery merry over the matter.  Street said--for it was he that told us\nthese things:\n\n\"I was in dismay.  I was under heavy bonds to complete my contract in a\ngiven time, and this disaster looked very much like ruin.  It was an\nastounding thing; it was such a wholly unlooked-for difficulty, that I\nwas entirely nonplussed.  I am a business man--have always been a\nbusiness man--do not know anything but business--and so you can imagine\nhow like being struck by lightning it was to find myself in a country\nwhere written contracts were worthless!--that main security, that\nsheet-anchor, that absolute necessity, of business.  My confidence left\nme. There was no use in making new contracts--that was plain.  I talked\nwith first one prominent citizen and then another.  They all sympathized\nwith me, first rate, but they did not know how to help me.  But at last a\nGentile said, 'Go to Brigham Young!--these small fry cannot do you any\ngood.'  I did not think much of the idea, for if the law could not help\nme, what could an individual do who had not even anything to do with\neither making the laws or executing them?  He might be a very good\npatriarch of a church and preacher in its tabernacle, but something\nsterner than religion and moral suasion was needed to handle a hundred\nrefractory, half-civilized sub-contractors.  But what was a man to do? I\nthought if Mr. Young could not do anything else, he might probably be\nable to give me some advice and a valuable hint or two, and so I went\nstraight to him and laid the whole case before him.  He said very little,\nbut he showed strong interest all the way through.  He examined all the\npapers in detail, and whenever there seemed anything like a hitch, either\nin the papers or my statement, he would go back and take up the thread\nand follow it patiently out to an intelligent and satisfactory result.\nThen he made a list of the contractors' names.  Finally he said:\n\n\"'Mr. Street, this is all perfectly plain.  These contracts are strictly\nand legally drawn, and are duly signed and certified.  These men\nmanifestly entered into them with their eyes open.  I see no fault or\nflaw anywhere.'\n\n\"Then Mr. Young turned to a man waiting at the other end of the room and\nsaid: 'Take this list of names to So-and-so, and tell him to have these\nmen here at such-and-such an hour.'\n\n\"They were there, to the minute.  So was I.  Mr. Young asked them a\nnumber of questions, and their answers made my statement good.  Then he\nsaid to them:\n\n\"'You signed these contracts and assumed these obligations of your own\nfree will and accord?'\n\n\"'Yes.'\n\n\"'Then carry them out to the letter, if it makes paupers of you!  Go!'\n\n\"And they did go, too!  They are strung across the deserts now, working\nlike bees.  And I never hear a word out of them.\n\n\"There is a batch of governors, and judges, and other officials here,\nshipped from Washington, and they maintain the semblance of a republican\nform of government--but the petrified truth is that Utah is an absolute\nmonarchy and Brigham Young is king!\"\n\nMr. Street was a fine man, and I believe his story.  I knew him well\nduring several years afterward in San Francisco.\n\nOur stay in Salt Lake City amounted to only two days, and therefore we\nhad no time to make the customary inquisition into the workings of\npolygamy and get up the usual statistics and deductions preparatory to\ncalling the attention of the nation at large once more to the matter.\n\nI had the will to do it.  With the gushing self-sufficiency of youth I\nwas feverish to plunge in headlong and achieve a great reform here--until\nI saw the Mormon women.  Then I was touched.  My heart was wiser than my\nhead.  It warmed toward these poor, ungainly and pathetically \"homely\"\ncreatures, and as I turned to hide the generous moisture in my eyes, I\nsaid, \"No--the man that marries one of them has done an act of Christian\ncharity which entitles him to the kindly applause of mankind, not their\nharsh censure--and the man that marries sixty of them has done a deed of\nopen-handed generosity so sublime that the nations should stand uncovered\nin his presence and worship in silence.\"\n\n      [For a brief sketch of Mormon history, and the noted Mountain Meadow\n      massacre, see Appendices A and B. ]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nIt is a luscious country for thrilling evening stories about\nassassinations of intractable Gentiles.  I cannot easily conceive of\nanything more cosy than the night in Salt Lake which we spent in a\nGentile den, smoking pipes and listening to tales of how Burton galloped\nin among the pleading and defenceless \"Morisites\" and shot them down, men\nand women, like so many dogs.  And how Bill Hickman, a Destroying Angel,\nshot Drown and Arnold dead for bringing suit against him for a debt.\nAnd how Porter Rockwell did this and that dreadful thing.  And how\nheedless people often come to Utah and make remarks about Brigham, or\npolygamy, or some other sacred matter, and the very next morning at\ndaylight such parties are sure to be found lying up some back alley,\ncontentedly waiting for the hearse.\n\nAnd the next most interesting thing is to sit and listen to these\nGentiles talk about polygamy; and how some portly old frog of an elder,\nor a bishop, marries a girl--likes her, marries her sister--likes her,\nmarries another sister--likes her, takes another--likes her, marries her\nmother--likes her, marries her father, grandfather, great grandfather,\nand then comes back hungry and asks for more.  And how the pert young\nthing of eleven will chance to be the favorite wife and her own venerable\ngrandmother have to rank away down toward D 4 in their mutual husband's\nesteem, and have to sleep in the kitchen, as like as not.  And how this\ndreadful sort of thing, this hiving together in one foul nest of mother\nand daughters, and the making a young daughter superior to her own mother\nin rank and authority, are things which Mormon women submit to because\ntheir religion teaches them that the more wives a man has on earth, and\nthe more children he rears, the higher the place they will all have in\nthe world to come--and the warmer, maybe, though they do not seem to say\nanything about that.\n\nAccording to these Gentile friends of ours, Brigham Young's harem\ncontains twenty or thirty wives.  They said that some of them had grown\nold and gone out of active service, but were comfortably housed and cared\nfor in the henery--or the Lion House, as it is strangely named.  Along\nwith each wife were her children--fifty altogether.  The house was\nperfectly quiet and orderly, when the children were still.  They all took\ntheir meals in one room, and a happy and home-like sight it was\npronounced to be.  None of our party got an opportunity to take dinner\nwith Mr. Young, but a Gentile by the name of Johnson professed to have\nenjoyed a sociable breakfast in the Lion House.  He gave a preposterous\naccount of the \"calling of the roll,\" and other preliminaries, and the\ncarnage that ensued when the buckwheat cakes came in.  But he embellished\nrather too much.  He said that Mr. Young told him several smart sayings\nof certain of his \"two-year-olds,\" observing with some pride that for\nmany years he had been the heaviest contributor in that line to one of\nthe Eastern magazines; and then he wanted to show Mr. Johnson one of the\npets that had said the last good thing, but he could not find the child.\n\nHe searched the faces of the children in detail, but could not decide\nwhich one it was.  Finally he gave it up with a sigh and said:\n\n\"I thought I would know the little cub again but I don't.\"  Mr. Johnson\nsaid further, that Mr. Young observed that life was a sad, sad thing\n--\"because the joy of every new marriage a man contracted was so apt to be\nblighted by the inopportune funeral of a less recent bride.\"  And Mr.\nJohnson said that while he and Mr. Young were pleasantly conversing in\nprivate, one of the Mrs. Youngs came in and demanded a breast-pin,\nremarking that she had found out that he had been giving a breast-pin to\nNo. 6, and she, for one, did not propose to let this partiality go on\nwithout making a satisfactory amount of trouble about it.  Mr. Young\nreminded her that there was a stranger present.  Mrs. Young said that if\nthe state of things inside the house was not agreeable to the stranger,\nhe could find room outside.  Mr. Young promised the breast-pin, and she\nwent away.  But in a minute or two another Mrs. Young came in and\ndemanded a breast-pin.  Mr. Young began a remonstrance, but Mrs. Young\ncut him short.  She said No. 6 had got one, and No. 11 was promised one,\nand it was \"no use for him to try to impose on her--she hoped she knew\nher rights.\"  He gave his promise, and she went.  And presently three\nMrs. Youngs entered in a body and opened on their husband a tempest of\ntears, abuse, and entreaty.  They had heard all about No. 6, No. 11, and\nNo. 14.  Three more breast-pins were promised.  They were hardly gone\nwhen nine more Mrs. Youngs filed into the presence, and a new tempest\nburst forth and raged round about the prophet and his guest.  Nine\nbreast-pins were promised, and the weird sisters filed out again.  And in\ncame eleven more, weeping and wailing and gnashing their teeth.  Eleven\npromised breast-pins purchased peace once more.\n\n\"That is a specimen,\" said Mr. Young.  \"You see how it is.  You see what\na life I lead.  A man can't be wise all the time.  In a heedless moment I\ngave my darling No. 6--excuse my calling her thus, as her other name has\nescaped me for the moment--a breast-pin.  It was only worth twenty-five\ndollars--that is, apparently that was its whole cost--but its ultimate\ncost was inevitably bound to be a good deal more.  You yourself have seen\nit climb up to six hundred and fifty dollars--and alas, even that is not\nthe end!  For I have wives all over this Territory of Utah.  I have\ndozens of wives whose numbers, even, I do not know without looking in the\nfamily Bible.  They are scattered far and wide among the mountains and\nvalleys of my realm.  And mark you, every solitary one of them will hear\nof this wretched breast pin, and every last one of them will have one or\ndie.  No. 6's breast pin will cost me twenty-five hundred dollars before\nI see the end of it.  And these creatures will compare these pins\ntogether, and if one is a shade finer than the rest, they will all be\nthrown on my hands, and I will have to order a new lot to keep peace in\nthe family.  Sir, you probably did not know it, but all the time you were\npresent with my children your every movement was watched by vigilant\nservitors of mine.  If you had offered to give a child a dime, or a stick\nof candy, or any trifle of the kind, you would have been snatched out of\nthe house instantly, provided it could be done before your gift left your\nhand.  Otherwise it would be absolutely necessary for you to make an\nexactly similar gift to all my children--and knowing by experience the\nimportance of the thing, I would have stood by and seen to it myself that\nyou did it, and did it thoroughly.  Once a gentleman gave one of my\nchildren a tin whistle--a veritable invention of Satan, sir, and one\nwhich I have an unspeakable horror of, and so would you if you had eighty\nor ninety children in your house.  But the deed was done--the man\nescaped.  I knew what the result was going to be, and I thirsted for\nvengeance.  I ordered out a flock of Destroying Angels, and they hunted\nthe man far into the fastnesses of the Nevada mountains.  But they never\ncaught him.  I am not cruel, sir--I am not vindictive except when sorely\noutraged--but if I had caught him, sir, so help me Joseph Smith, I would\nhave locked him into the nursery till the brats whistled him to death.\nBy the slaughtered body of St. Parley Pratt (whom God assail!) there\nwas never anything on this earth like it!  I knew who gave the whistle to\nthe child, but I could, not make those jealous mothers believe me.  They\nbelieved I did it, and the result was just what any man of reflection\ncould have foreseen: I had to order a hundred and ten whistles--I think\nwe had a hundred and ten children in the house then, but some of them are\noff at college now--I had to order a hundred and ten of those shrieking\nthings, and I wish I may never speak another word if we didn't have to\ntalk on our fingers entirely, from that time forth until the children got\ntired of the whistles.  And if ever another man gives a whistle to a\nchild of mine and I get my hands on him, I will hang him higher than\nHaman!  That is the word with the bark on it!  Shade of Nephi!  You don't\nknow anything about married life.  I am rich, and everybody knows it.  I\nam benevolent, and everybody takes advantage of it.  I have a strong\nfatherly instinct and all the foundlings are foisted on me.\n\n\"Every time a woman wants to do well by her darling, she puzzles her brain\nto cipher out some scheme for getting it into my hands.  Why, sir, a\nwoman came here once with a child of a curious lifeless sort of\ncomplexion (and so had the woman), and swore that the child was mine and\nshe my wife--that I had married her at such-and-such a time in\nsuch-and-such a place, but she had forgotten her number, and of course I\ncould not remember her name.  Well, sir, she called my attention to the\nfact that the child looked like me, and really it did seem to resemble\nme--a common thing in the Territory--and, to cut the story short, I put\nit in my nursery, and she left.  And by the ghost of Orson Hyde, when\nthey came to wash the paint off that child it was an Injun!  Bless my\nsoul, you don't know anything about married life.  It is a perfect dog's\nlife, sir--a perfect dog's life.  You can't economize.  It isn't\npossible.  I have tried keeping one set of bridal attire for all\noccasions.  But it is of no use.  First you'll marry a combination of\ncalico and consumption that's as thin as a rail, and next you'll get a\ncreature that's nothing more than the dropsy in disguise, and then you've\ngot to eke out that bridal dress with an old balloon.  That is the way it\ngoes.  And think of the wash-bill--(excuse these tears)--nine hundred and\neighty-four pieces a week!  No, sir, there is no such a thing as economy\nin a family like mine.  Why, just the one item of cradles--think of it!\nAnd vermifuge! Soothing syrup!  Teething rings!  And 'papa's watches' for\nthe babies to play with!  And things to scratch the furniture with!  And\nlucifer matches for them to eat, and pieces of glass to cut themselves\nwith! The item of glass alone would support your family, I venture to\nsay, sir. Let me scrimp and squeeze all I can, I still can't get ahead as\nfast as I feel I ought to, with my opportunities.  Bless you, sir, at a\ntime when I had seventy-two wives in this house, I groaned under the\npressure of keeping thousands of dollars tied up in seventy-two bedsteads\nwhen the money ought to have been out at interest; and I just sold out\nthe whole stock, sir, at a sacrifice, and built a bedstead seven feet\nlong and ninety-six feet wide.  But it was a failure, sir.  I could not\nsleep. It appeared to me that the whole seventy-two women snored at once.\nThe roar was deafening.  And then the danger of it!  That was what I was\nlooking at.  They would all draw in their breath at once, and you could\nactually see the walls of the house suck in--and then they would all\nexhale their breath at once, and you could see the walls swell out, and\nstrain, and hear the rafters crack, and the shingles grind together. My\nfriend, take an old man's advice, and don't encumber yourself with a\nlarge family--mind, I tell you, don't do it.  In a small family, and in a\nsmall family only, you will find that comfort and that peace of mind\nwhich are the best at last of the blessings this world is able to afford\nus, and for the lack of which no accumulation of wealth, and no\nacquisition of fame, power, and greatness can ever compensate us. Take my\nword for it, ten or eleven wives is all you need--never go over it.\"\n\nSome instinct or other made me set this Johnson down as being unreliable.\nAnd yet he was a very entertaining person, and I doubt if some of the\ninformation he gave us could have been acquired from any other source.\nHe was a pleasant contrast to those reticent Mormons.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nAll men have heard of the Mormon Bible, but few except the \"elect\" have\nseen it, or, at least, taken the trouble to read it.  I brought away a\ncopy from Salt Lake.  The book is a curiosity to me, it is such a\npretentious affair, and yet so \"slow,\" so sleepy; such an insipid mess of\ninspiration.  It is chloroform in print.  If Joseph Smith composed this\nbook, the act was a miracle--keeping awake while he did it was, at any\nrate.  If he, according to tradition, merely translated it from certain\nancient and mysteriously-engraved plates of copper, which he declares he\nfound under a stone, in an out-of-the-way locality, the work of\ntranslating was equally a miracle, for the same reason.\n\nThe book seems to be merely a prosy detail of imaginary history, with the\nOld Testament for a model; followed by a tedious plagiarism of the New\nTestament.  The author labored to give his words and phrases the quaint,\nold-fashioned sound and structure of our King James's translation of the\nScriptures; and the result is a mongrel--half modern glibness, and half\nancient simplicity and gravity.  The latter is awkward and constrained;\nthe former natural, but grotesque by the contrast.  Whenever he found his\nspeech growing too modern--which was about every sentence or two--he\nladled in a few such Scriptural phrases as \"exceeding sore,\" \"and it came\nto pass,\" etc., and made things satisfactory again.  \"And it came to\npass\" was his pet.  If he had left that out, his Bible would have been\nonly a pamphlet.\n\nThe title-page reads as follows:\n\n      THE BOOK OF MORMON: AN ACCOUNT WRITTEN BY THE HAND OF MORMON, UPON\n      PLATES TAKEN FROM THE PLATES OF NEPHI.\n\n      Wherefore it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi,\n      and also of the Lamanites; written to the Lamanites, who are a\n      remnant of the House of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile; written\n      by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of\n      revelation.  Written and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that\n      they might not be destroyed; to come forth by the gift and power of\n      God unto the interpretation thereof; sealed by the hand of Moroni,\n      and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by the way of\n      Gentile; the interpretation thereof by the gift of God.  An\n      abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also; which is a record of\n      the people of Jared; who were scattered at the time the Lord\n      confounded the language of the people when they were building a\n      tower to get to Heaven.\n\n\"Hid up\" is good.  And so is \"wherefore\"--though why \"wherefore\"?  Any\nother word would have answered as well--though--in truth it would not\nhave sounded so Scriptural.\n\nNext comes:\n\n      THE TESTIMONY OF THREE WITNESSES.\n      Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people unto\n      whom this work shall come, that we, through the grace of God the\n      Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which\n      contain this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi, and\n      also of the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of the people of\n      Jared, who came from the tower of which hath been spoken; and we\n      also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of\n      God, for His voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a\n      surety that the work is true.  And we also testify that we have seen\n      the engravings which are upon the plates; and they have been shown\n      unto us by the power of God, and not of man.  And we declare with\n      words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and\n      he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the\n      plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the\n      grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld\n      and bear record that these things are true; and it is marvellous in\n      our eyes; nevertheless the voice of the Lord commanded us that we\n      should bear record of it; wherefore, to be obedient unto the\n      commandments of God, we bear testimony of these things.  And we know\n      that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall rid our garments of the\n      blood of all men, and be found spotless before the judgment-seat of\n      Christ, and shall dwell with Him eternally in the heavens.  And the\n      honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which\n      is one God.  Amen.\n                          OLIVER COWDERY,\n                          DAVID WHITMER,\n                          MARTIN HARRIS.\n\nSome people have to have a world of evidence before they can come\nanywhere in the neighborhood of believing anything; but for me, when a\nman tells me that he has \"seen the engravings which are upon the plates,\"\nand not only that, but an angel was there at the time, and saw him see\nthem, and probably took his receipt for it, I am very far on the road to\nconviction, no matter whether I ever heard of that man before or not, and\neven if I do not know the name of the angel, or his nationality either.\n\nNext is this:\n\n      AND ALSO THE TESTIMONY OF EIGHT WITNESSES.\n      Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people unto\n      whom this work shall come, that Joseph Smith, Jr., the translator of\n      this work, has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken,\n      which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the\n      said Smith has translated, we did handle with our hands; and we also\n      saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of\n      ancient work, and of curious workmanship.  And this we bear record\n      with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shown unto us, for\n      we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith\n      has got the plates of which we have spoken.  And we give our names\n      unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen;\n      and we lie not, God bearing witness of it.\n                          CHRISTIAN WHITMER,\n                          JACOB WHITMER,\n                          PETER WHITMER, JR.,\n                          JOHN WHITMER,\n                          HIRAM PAGE,\n                          JOSEPH SMITH, SR.,\n                          HYRUM SMITH,\n                          SAMUEL H.  SMITH.\n\nAnd when I am far on the road to conviction, and eight men, be they\ngrammatical or otherwise, come forward and tell me that they have seen\nthe plates too; and not only seen those plates but \"hefted\" them, I am\nconvinced.  I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire\nWhitmer family had testified.\n\nThe Mormon Bible consists of fifteen \"books\"--being the books of Jacob,\nEnos, Jarom, Omni, Mosiah, Zeniff, Alma, Helaman, Ether, Moroni, two\n\"books\" of Mormon, and three of Nephi.\n\nIn the first book of Nephi is a plagiarism of the Old Testament, which\ngives an account of the exodus from Jerusalem of the \"children of Lehi\";\nand it goes on to tell of their wanderings in the wilderness, during\neight years, and their supernatural protection by one of their number, a\nparty by the name of Nephi.  They finally reached the land of\n\"Bountiful,\" and camped by the sea.  After they had remained there \"for\nthe space of many days\"--which is more Scriptural than definite--Nephi\nwas commanded from on high to build a ship wherein to \"carry the people\nacross the waters.\"  He travestied Noah's ark--but he obeyed orders in\nthe matter of the plan.  He finished the ship in a single day, while his\nbrethren stood by and made fun of it--and of him, too--\"saying, our\nbrother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship.\"  They did\nnot wait for the timbers to dry, but the whole tribe or nation sailed the\nnext day.  Then a bit of genuine nature cropped out, and is revealed by\noutspoken Nephi with Scriptural frankness--they all got on a spree!\nThey, \"and also their wives, began to make themselves merry, insomuch\nthat they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much rudeness;\nyea, they were lifted up unto exceeding rudeness.\"\n\nNephi tried to stop these scandalous proceedings; but they tied him neck\nand heels, and went on with their lark.  But observe how Nephi the\nprophet circumvented them by the aid of the invisible powers:\n\n      And it came to pass that after they had bound me, insomuch that I\n      could not move, the compass, which had been prepared of the Lord,\n      did cease to work; wherefore, they knew not whither they should\n      steer the ship, insomuch that there arose a great storm, yea, a\n      great and terrible tempest, and we were driven back upon the waters\n      for the space of three days; and they began to be frightened\n      exceedingly, lest they should be drowned in the sea; nevertheless\n      they did not loose me.  And on the fourth day, which we had been\n      driven back, the tempest began to be exceeding sore.  And it came to\n      pass that we were about to be swallowed up in the depths of the sea.\n\nThen they untied him.\n\n      And it came to pass after they had loosed me, behold, I took the\n      compass, and it did work whither I desired it.  And it came to pass\n      that I prayed unto the Lord; and after I had prayed, the winds did\n      cease, and the storm did cease, and there was a great calm.\n\nEquipped with their compass, these ancients appear to have had the\nadvantage of Noah.\n\nTheir voyage was toward a \"promised land\"--the only name they give it.\nThey reached it in safety.\n\nPolygamy is a recent feature in the Mormon religion, and was added by\nBrigham Young after Joseph Smith's death.  Before that, it was regarded\nas an \"abomination.\"  This verse from the Mormon Bible occurs in Chapter\nII. of the book of Jacob:\n\n      For behold, thus saith the Lord, this people begin to wax in\n      iniquity; they understand not the Scriptures; for they seek to\n      excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things\n      which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.  Behold,\n      David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing\n      was abominable before me, saith the Lord; wherefore, thus saith the\n      Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by\n      the power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous\n      branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.  Wherefore, I the Lord\n      God, will no suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old.\n\nHowever, the project failed--or at least the modern Mormon end of it--for\nBrigham \"suffers\" it.  This verse is from the same chapter:\n\n      Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate, because of their\n      filthiness and the cursings which hath come upon their skins, are\n      more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment\n      of the Lord, which was given unto our fathers, that they should\n      have, save it were one wife; and concubines they should have none.\n\nThe following verse (from Chapter IX. of the Book of Nephi) appears to\ncontain information not familiar to everybody:\n\n      And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ascended into heaven,\n      the multitude did disperse, and every man did take his wife and his\n      children, and did return to his own home.\n\n      And it came to pass that on the morrow, when the multitude was\n      gathered together, behold, Nephi and his brother whom he had raised\n      from the dead, whose name was Timothy, and also his son, whose name\n      was Jonas, and also Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his brother, and Kumen,\n      and Kumenenhi, and Jeremiah, and Shemnon, and Jonas, and Zedekiah,\n      and Isaiah; now these were the names of the disciples whom Jesus had\n      chosen.\n\nIn order that the reader may observe how much more grandeur and\npicturesqueness (as seen by these Mormon twelve) accompanied on of the\ntenderest episodes in the life of our Saviour than other eyes seem to\nhave been aware of, I quote the following from the same \"book\"--Nephi:\n\n      And it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise.\n      And they arose from the earth, and He said unto them, Blessed are ye\n      because of your faith.  And now behold, My joy is full.  And when He\n      had said these words, He wept, and the multitude bear record of it,\n      and He took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and\n      prayed unto the Father for them.  And when He had done this He wept\n      again, and He spake unto the multitude, and saith unto them, Behold\n      your little ones.  And as they looked to behold, they cast their\n      eyes toward heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw\n      angels descending out of heaven as it were, in the midst of fire;\n      and they came down and encircled those little ones about, and they\n      were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto\n      them, and the multitude did see and hear and bear record; and they\n      know that their record is true, for they all of them did see and\n      hear, every man for himself; and they were in number about two\n      thousand and five hundred souls; and they did consist of men, women,\n      and children.\n\nAnd what else would they be likely to consist of?\n\nThe Book of Ether is an incomprehensible medley of if \"history,\" much of\nit relating to battles and sieges among peoples whom the reader has\npossibly never heard of; and who inhabited a country which is not set\ndown in the geography.  These was a King with the remarkable name of\nCoriantumr,^^ and he warred with Shared, and Lib, and Shiz, and others,\nin the \"plains of Heshlon\"; and the \"valley of Gilgal\"; and the\n\"wilderness of Akish\"; and the \"land of Moran\"; and the \"plains of\nAgosh\"; and \"Ogath,\" and \"Ramah,\" and the \"land of Corihor,\" and the\n\"hill Comnor,\" by \"the waters of Ripliancum,\" etc., etc., etc.  \"And it\ncame to pass,\" after a deal of fighting, that Coriantumr, upon making\ncalculation of his losses, found that \"there had been slain two millions\nof mighty men, and also their wives and their children\"--say 5,000,000 or\n6,000,000 in all--\"and he began to sorrow in his heart.\"  Unquestionably\nit was time.  So he wrote to Shiz, asking a cessation of hostilities, and\noffering to give up his kingdom to save his people.  Shiz declined,\nexcept upon condition that Coriantumr would come and let him cut his head\noff first--a thing which Coriantumr would not do.  Then there was more\nfighting for a season; then four years were devoted to gathering the\nforces for a final struggle--after which ensued a battle, which, I take\nit, is the most remarkable set forth in history,--except, perhaps, that\nof the Kilkenny cats, which it resembles in some respects.  This is the\naccount of the gathering and the battle:\n\n      7.  And it came to pass that they did gather together all the\n      people, upon all the face of the land, who had not been slain, save\n      it was Ether.  And it came to pass that Ether did behold all the\n      doings of the people; and he beheld that the people who were for\n      Coriantumr, were gathered together to the army of Coriantumr; and\n      the people who were for Shiz, were gathered together to the army of\n      Shiz; wherefore they were for the space of four years gathering\n      together the people, that they might get all who were upon the face\n      of the land, and that they might receive all the strength which it\n      was possible that they could receive.  And it came to pass that when\n      they were all gathered together, every one to the army which he\n      would, with their wives and their children; both men, women, and\n      children being armed with weapons of war, having shields, and\n      breast-plates, and head-plates, and being clothed after the manner\n      of war, they did march forth one against another, to battle; and\n      they fought all that day, and conquered not.  And it came to pass\n      that when it was night they were weary, and retired to their camps;\n      and after they had retired to their camps, they took up a howling\n      and a lamentation for the loss of the slain of their people; and so\n      great were their cries, their howlings and lamentations, that it did\n      rend the air exceedingly.  And it came to pass that on the morrow\n      they did go again to battle, and great and terrible was that day;\n      nevertheless they conquered not, and when the night came again, they\n      did rend the air with their cries, and their howlings, and their\n      mournings, for the loss of the slain of their people.\n\n      8.  And it came to pass that Coriantumr wrote again an epistle unto\n      Shiz, desiring that he would not come again to battle, but that he\n      would take the kingdom, and spare the lives of the people.  But\n      behold, the Spirit of the Lord had ceased striving with them, and\n      Satan had full power over the hearts of the people, for they were\n      given up unto the hardness of their hearts, and the blindness of\n      their minds that they might be destroyed; wherefore they went again\n      to battle.  And it came to pass that they fought all that day, and\n      when the night came they slept upon their swords; and on the morrow\n      they fought even until the night came; and when the night came they\n      were drunken with anger, even as a man who is drunken with wine; and\n      they slept again upon their swords; and on the morrow they fought\n      again; and when the night came they had all fallen by the sword save\n      it were fifty and two of the people of Coriantumr, and sixty and\n      nine of the people of Shiz.  And it came to pass that they slept\n      upon their swords that night, and on the morrow they fought again,\n      and they contended in their mights with their swords, and with their\n      shields, all that day; and when the night came there were thirty and\n      two of the people of Shiz, and twenty and seven of the people of\n      Coriantumr.\n\n      9.  And it came to pass that they ate and slept, and prepared for\n      death on the morrow.  And they were large and mighty men, as to the\n      strength of men.  And it came to pass that they fought for the space\n      of three hours, and they fainted with the loss of blood.  And it\n      came to pass that when the men of Coriantumr had received sufficient\n      strength, that they could walk, they were about to flee for their\n      lives, but behold, Shiz arose, and also his men, and he swore in his\n      wrath that he would slay Coriantumr, or he would perish by the\n      sword: wherefore he did pursue them, and on the morrow he did\n      overtake them; and they fought again with the sword.  And it came to\n      pass that when they had all fallen by the sword, save it were\n      Coriantumr and Shiz, behold Shiz had fainted with loss of blood.\n      And it came to pass that when Coriantumr had leaned upon his sword,\n      that he rested a little, he smote off the head of Shiz.  And it came\n      to pass that after he had smote off the head of Shiz, that Shiz\n      raised upon his hands and fell; and after that he had struggled for\n      breath, he died.  And it came to pass that Coriantumr fell to the\n      earth, and became as if he had no life.  And the Lord spake unto\n      Ether, and said unto him, go forth.  And he went forth, and beheld\n      that the words of the Lord had all been fulfilled; and he finished\n      his record; and the hundredth part I have not written.\n\nIt seems a pity he did not finish, for after all his dreary former\nchapters of commonplace, he stopped just as he was in danger of becoming\ninteresting.\n\nThe Mormon Bible is rather stupid and tiresome to read, but there is\nnothing vicious in its teachings.  Its code of morals is unobjectionable\n--it is \"smouched\" [Milton] from the New Testament and no credit given.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nAt the end of our two days' sojourn, we left Great Salt Lake City hearty\nand well fed and happy--physically superb but not so very much wiser, as\nregards the \"Mormon question,\" than we were when we arrived, perhaps.\nWe had a deal more \"information\" than we had before, of course, but we\ndid not know what portion of it was reliable and what was not--for it all\ncame from acquaintances of a day--strangers, strictly speaking.  We were\ntold, for instance, that the dreadful \"Mountain Meadows Massacre\" was the\nwork of the Indians entirely, and that the Gentiles had meanly tried to\nfasten it upon the Mormons; we were told, likewise, that the Indians were\nto blame, partly, and partly the Mormons; and we were told, likewise, and\njust as positively, that the Mormons were almost if not wholly and\ncompletely responsible for that most treacherous and pitiless butchery.\nWe got the story in all these different shapes, but it was not till\nseveral years afterward that Mrs. Waite's book, \"The Mormon Prophet,\"\ncame out with Judge Cradlebaugh's trial of the accused parties in it and\nrevealed the truth that the latter version was the correct one and that\nthe Mormons were the assassins.  All our \"information\" had three sides to\nit, and so I gave up the idea that I could settle the \"Mormon question\"\nin two days.  Still I have seen newspaper correspondents do it in one.\n\nI left Great Salt Lake a good deal confused as to what state of things\nexisted there--and sometimes even questioning in my own mind whether a\nstate of things existed there at all or not.  But presently I remembered\nwith a lightening sense of relief that we had learned two or three\ntrivial things there which we could be certain of; and so the two days\nwere not wholly lost.  For instance, we had learned that we were at last\nin a pioneer land, in absolute and tangible reality.\n\nThe high prices charged for trifles were eloquent of high freights and\nbewildering distances of freightage.  In the east, in those days, the\nsmallest moneyed denomination was a penny and it represented the smallest\npurchasable quantity of any commodity.  West of Cincinnati the smallest\ncoin in use was the silver five-cent piece and no smaller quantity of an\narticle could be bought than \"five cents' worth.\"  In Overland City the\nlowest coin appeared to be the ten-cent piece; but in Salt Lake there did\nnot seem to be any money in circulation smaller than a quarter, or any\nsmaller quantity purchasable of any commodity than twenty-five cents'\nworth.  We had always been used to half dimes and \"five cents' worth\" as\nthe minimum of financial negotiations; but in Salt Lake if one wanted a\ncigar, it was a quarter; if he wanted a chalk pipe, it was a quarter; if\nhe wanted a peach, or a candle, or a newspaper, or a shave, or a little\nGentile whiskey to rub on his corns to arrest indigestion and keep him\nfrom having the toothache, twenty-five cents was the price, every time.\nWhen we looked at the shot-bag of silver, now and then, we seemed to be\nwasting our substance in riotous living, but if we referred to the\nexpense account we could see that we had not been doing anything of the\nkind.\n\nBut people easily get reconciled to big money and big prices, and fond\nand vain of both--it is a descent to little coins and cheap prices that\nis hardest to bear and slowest to take hold upon one's toleration.  After\na month's acquaintance with the twenty-five cent minimum, the average\nhuman being is ready to blush every time he thinks of his despicable\nfive-cent days.  How sunburnt with blushes I used to get in gaudy Nevada,\nevery time I thought of my first financial experience in Salt Lake.\nIt was on this wise (which is a favorite expression of great authors, and\na very neat one, too, but I never hear anybody say on this wise when they\nare talking).  A young half-breed with a complexion like a yellow-jacket\nasked me if I would have my boots blacked.  It was at the Salt Lake House\nthe morning after we arrived.  I said yes, and he blacked them.  Then I\nhanded him a silver five-cent piece, with the benevolent air of a person\nwho is conferring wealth and blessedness upon poverty and suffering.  The\nyellow-jacket took it with what I judged to be suppressed emotion, and\nlaid it reverently down in the middle of his broad hand.  Then he began\nto contemplate it, much as a philosopher contemplates a gnat's ear in the\nample field of his microscope.  Several mountaineers, teamsters,\nstage-drivers, etc., drew near and dropped into the tableau and fell to\nsurveying the money with that attractive indifference to formality which\nis noticeable in the hardy pioneer.  Presently the yellow-jacket handed\nthe half dime back to me and told me I ought to keep my money in my\npocket-book instead of in my soul, and then I wouldn't get it cramped and\nshriveled up so!\n\nWhat a roar of vulgar laughter there was!  I destroyed the mongrel\nreptile on the spot, but I smiled and smiled all the time I was detaching\nhis scalp, for the remark he made was good for an \"Injun.\"\n\nYes, we had learned in Salt Lake to be charged great prices without\nletting the inward shudder appear on the surface--for even already we had\noverheard and noted the tenor of conversations among drivers, conductors,\nand hostlers, and finally among citizens of Salt Lake, until we were well\naware that these superior beings despised \"emigrants.\"  We permitted no\ntell-tale shudders and winces in our countenances, for we wanted to seem\npioneers, or Mormons, half-breeds, teamsters, stage-drivers, Mountain\nMeadow assassins--anything in the world that the plains and Utah\nrespected and admired--but we were wretchedly ashamed of being\n\"emigrants,\" and sorry enough that we had white shirts and could not\nswear in the presence of ladies without looking the other way.\n\nAnd many a time in Nevada, afterwards, we had occasion to remember with\nhumiliation that we were \"emigrants,\" and consequently a low and inferior\nsort of creatures.  Perhaps the reader has visited Utah, Nevada, or\nCalifornia, even in these latter days, and while communing with himself\nupon the sorrowful banishment of these countries from what he considers\n\"the world,\" has had his wings clipped by finding that he is the one to\nbe pitied, and that there are entire populations around him ready and\nwilling to do it for him--yea, who are complacently doing it for him\nalready, wherever he steps his foot.\n\nPoor thing, they are making fun of his hat; and the cut of his New York\ncoat; and his conscientiousness about his grammar; and his feeble\nprofanity; and his consumingly ludicrous ignorance of ores, shafts,\ntunnels, and other things which he never saw before, and never felt\nenough interest in to read about.  And all the time that he is thinking\nwhat a sad fate it is to be exiled to that far country, that lonely land,\nthe citizens around him are looking down on him with a blighting\ncompassion because he is an \"emigrant\" instead of that proudest and\nblessedest creature that exists on all the earth, a \"FORTY-NINER.\"\n\nThe accustomed coach life began again, now, and by midnight it almost\nseemed as if we never had been out of our snuggery among the mail sacks\nat all.  We had made one alteration, however.  We had provided enough\nbread, boiled ham and hard boiled eggs to last double the six hundred\nmiles of staging we had still to do.\n\nAnd it was comfort in those succeeding days to sit up and contemplate the\nmajestic panorama of mountains and valleys spread out below us and eat\nham and hard boiled eggs while our spiritual natures revelled alternately\nin rainbows, thunderstorms, and peerless sunsets.  Nothing helps scenery\nlike ham and eggs.  Ham and eggs, and after these a pipe--an old, rank,\ndelicious pipe--ham and eggs and scenery, a \"down grade,\" a flying coach,\na fragrant pipe and a contented heart--these make happiness.  It is what\nall the ages have struggled for.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nAt eight in the morning we reached the remnant and ruin of what had been\nthe important military station of \"Camp Floyd,\" some forty-five or fifty\nmiles from Salt Lake City.  At four P.M.  we had doubled our distance and\nwere ninety or a hundred miles from Salt Lake.  And now we entered upon\none of that species of deserts whose concentrated hideousness shames the\ndiffused and diluted horrors of Sahara--an \"alkali\" desert.  For\nsixty-eight miles there was but one break in it.  I do not remember that\nthis was really a break; indeed it seems to me that it was nothing but a\nwatering depot in the midst of the stretch of sixty-eight miles.  If my\nmemory serves me, there was no well or spring at this place, but the\nwater was hauled there by mule and ox teams from the further side of the\ndesert.  There was a stage station there.  It was forty-five miles from\nthe beginning of the desert, and twenty-three from the end of it.\n\nWe plowed and dragged and groped along, the whole live-long night,\nand at the end of this uncomfortable twelve hours we finished the\nforty-five-mile part of the desert and got to the stage station where the\nimported water was.  The sun was just rising.  It was easy enough to\ncross a desert in the night while we were asleep; and it was pleasant to\nreflect, in the morning, that we in actual person had encountered an\nabsolute desert and could always speak knowingly of deserts in presence\nof the ignorant thenceforward.  And it was pleasant also to reflect that\nthis was not an obscure, back country desert, but a very celebrated one,\nthe metropolis itself, as you may say.  All this was very well and very\ncomfortable and satisfactory--but now we were to cross a desert in\ndaylight.  This was fine--novel--romantic--dramatically adventurous\n--this, indeed, was worth living for, worth traveling for!  We would\nwrite home all about it.\n\nThis enthusiasm, this stern thirst for adventure, wilted under the sultry\nAugust sun and did not last above one hour.  One poor little hour--and\nthen we were ashamed that we had \"gushed\" so.  The poetry was all in the\nanticipation--there is none in the reality.  Imagine a vast, waveless\nocean stricken dead and turned to ashes; imagine this solemn waste tufted\nwith ash-dusted sage-bushes; imagine the lifeless silence and solitude\nthat belong to such a place; imagine a coach, creeping like a bug through\nthe midst of this shoreless level, and sending up tumbled volumes of dust\nas if it were a bug that went by steam; imagine this aching monotony of\ntoiling and plowing kept up hour after hour, and the shore still as far\naway as ever, apparently; imagine team, driver, coach and passengers so\ndeeply coated with ashes that they are all one colorless color; imagine\nash-drifts roosting above moustaches and eyebrows like snow accumulations\non boughs and bushes.  This is the reality of it.\n\nThe sun beats down with dead, blistering, relentless malignity; the\nperspiration is welling from every pore in man and beast, but scarcely a\nsign of it finds its way to the surface--it is absorbed before it gets\nthere; there is not the faintest breath of air stirring; there is not a\nmerciful shred of cloud in all the brilliant firmament; there is not a\nliving creature visible in any direction whither one searches the blank\nlevel that stretches its monotonous miles on every hand; there is not a\nsound--not a sigh--not a whisper--not a buzz, or a whir of wings, or\ndistant pipe of bird--not even a sob from the lost souls that doubtless\npeople that dead air.  And so the occasional sneezing of the resting\nmules, and the champing of the bits, grate harshly on the grim stillness,\nnot dissipating the spell but accenting it and making one feel more\nlonesome and forsaken than before.\n\nThe mules, under violent swearing, coaxing and whip-cracking, would make\nat stated intervals a \"spurt,\" and drag the coach a hundred or may be two\nhundred yards, stirring up a billowy cloud of dust that rolled back,\nenveloping the vehicle to the wheel-tops or higher, and making it seem\nafloat in a fog.  Then a rest followed, with the usual sneezing and\nbit-champing.  Then another \"spurt\" of a hundred yards and another rest at\nthe end of it.  All day long we kept this up, without water for the mules\nand without ever changing the team.  At least we kept it up ten hours,\nwhich, I take it, is a day, and a pretty honest one, in an alkali desert.\nIt was from four in the morning till two in the afternoon.  And it was so\nhot! and so close! and our water canteens went dry in the middle of the\nday and we got so thirsty!  It was so stupid and tiresome and dull! and\nthe tedious hours did lag and drag and limp along with such a cruel\ndeliberation!  It was so trying to give one's watch a good long\nundisturbed spell and then take it out and find that it had been fooling\naway the time and not trying to get ahead any!  The alkali dust cut\nthrough our lips, it persecuted our eyes, it ate through the delicate\nmembranes and made our noses bleed and kept them bleeding--and truly and\nseriously the romance all faded far away and disappeared, and left the\ndesert trip nothing but a harsh reality--a thirsty, sweltering, longing,\nhateful reality!\n\nTwo miles and a quarter an hour for ten hours--that was what we\naccomplished.  It was hard to bring the comprehension away down to such a\nsnail-pace as that, when we had been used to making eight and ten miles\nan hour.  When we reached the station on the farther verge of the desert,\nwe were glad, for the first time, that the dictionary was along, because\nwe never could have found language to tell how glad we were, in any sort\nof dictionary but an unabridged one with pictures in it.  But there could\nnot have been found in a whole library of dictionaries language\nsufficient to tell how tired those mules were after their twenty-three\nmile pull.  To try to give the reader an idea of how thirsty they were,\nwould be to \"gild refined gold or paint the lily.\"\n\nSomehow, now that it is there, the quotation does not seem to fit--but no\nmatter, let it stay, anyhow.  I think it is a graceful and attractive\nthing, and therefore have tried time and time again to work it in where\nit would fit, but could not succeed.  These efforts have kept my mind\ndistracted and ill at ease, and made my narrative seem broken and\ndisjointed, in places.  Under these circumstances it seems to me best to\nleave it in, as above, since this will afford at least a temporary\nrespite from the wear and tear of trying to \"lead up\" to this really apt\nand beautiful quotation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nOn the morning of the sixteenth day out from St. Joseph we arrived at the\nentrance of Rocky Canyon, two hundred and fifty miles from Salt Lake.\nIt was along in this wild country somewhere, and far from any habitation\nof white men, except the stage stations, that we came across the\nwretchedest type of mankind I have ever seen, up to this writing.  I\nrefer to the Goshoot Indians.  From what we could see and all we could\nlearn, they are very considerably inferior to even the despised Digger\nIndians of California; inferior to all races of savages on our continent;\ninferior to even the Terra del Fuegans; inferior to the Hottentots, and\nactually inferior in some respects to the Kytches of Africa.  Indeed, I\nhave been obliged to look the bulky volumes of Wood's \"Uncivilized Races\nof Men\" clear through in order to find a savage tribe degraded enough to\ntake rank with the Goshoots.  I find but one people fairly open to that\nshameful verdict.  It is the Bosjesmans (Bushmen) of South Africa.  Such\nof the Goshoots as we saw, along the road and hanging about the stations,\nwere small, lean, \"scrawny\" creatures; in complexion a dull black like\nthe ordinary American negro; their faces and hands bearing dirt which\nthey had been hoarding and accumulating for months, years, and even\ngenerations, according to the age of the proprietor; a silent, sneaking,\ntreacherous looking race; taking note of everything, covertly, like all\nthe other \"Noble Red Men\" that we (do not) read about, and betraying no\nsign in their countenances; indolent, everlastingly patient and tireless,\nlike all other Indians; prideless beggars--for if the beggar instinct\nwere left out of an Indian he would not \"go,\" any more than a clock\nwithout a pendulum; hungry, always hungry, and yet never refusing\nanything that a hog would eat, though often eating what a hog would\ndecline; hunters, but having no higher ambition than to kill and eat\njack-ass rabbits,  crickets and grasshoppers, and embezzle carrion from\nthe buzzards and cayotes; savages who, when asked if they have the common\nIndian belief in a Great Spirit show a something which almost amounts to\nemotion, thinking whiskey is referred to; a thin, scattering race of\nalmost naked black children, these Goshoots are, who produce nothing at\nall, and have no villages, and no gatherings together into strictly\ndefined tribal communities--a people whose only shelter is a rag cast on\na bush to keep off a portion of the snow, and yet who inhabit one of the\nmost rocky, wintry, repulsive wastes that our country or any other can\nexhibit.\n\nThe Bushmen and our Goshoots are manifestly descended from the self-same\ngorilla, or kangaroo, or Norway rat, which-ever animal--Adam the\nDarwinians trace them to.\n\nOne would as soon expect the rabbits to fight as the Goshoots, and yet\nthey used to live off the offal and refuse of the stations a few months\nand then come some dark night when no mischief was expected, and burn\ndown the buildings and kill the men from ambush as they rushed out.\nAnd once, in the night, they attacked the stage-coach when a District\nJudge, of Nevada Territory, was the only passenger, and with their first\nvolley of arrows (and a bullet or two) they riddled the stage curtains,\nwounded a horse or two and mortally wounded the driver.  The latter was\nfull of pluck, and so was his passenger.  At the driver's call Judge Mott\nswung himself out, clambered to the box and seized the reins of the team,\nand away they plunged, through the racing mob of skeletons and under a\nhurtling storm of missiles.  The stricken driver had sunk down on the\nboot as soon as he was wounded, but had held on to the reins and said he\nwould manage to keep hold of them until relieved.\n\nAnd after they were taken from his relaxing grasp, he lay with his head\nbetween Judge Mott's feet, and tranquilly gave directions about the road;\nhe said he believed he could live till the miscreants were outrun and\nleft behind, and that if he managed that, the main difficulty would be at\nan end, and then if the Judge drove so and so (giving directions about\nbad places in the road, and general course) he would reach the next\nstation without trouble.  The Judge distanced the enemy and at last\nrattled up to the station and knew that the night's perils were done; but\nthere was no comrade-in-arms for him to rejoice with, for the soldierly\ndriver was dead.\n\nLet us forget that we have been saying harsh things about the Overland\ndrivers, now.  The disgust which the Goshoots gave me, a disciple of\nCooper and a worshipper of the Red Man--even of the scholarly savages in\nthe \"Last of the Mohicans\" who are fittingly associated with backwoodsmen\nwho divide each sentence into two equal parts: one part critically\ngrammatical, refined and choice of language, and the other part just such\nan attempt to talk like a hunter or a mountaineer, as a Broadway clerk\nmight make after eating an edition of Emerson Bennett's works and\nstudying frontier life at the Bowery Theatre a couple of weeks--I say\nthat the nausea which the Goshoots gave me, an Indian worshipper, set me\nto examining authorities, to see if perchance I had been over-estimating\nthe Red Man while viewing him through the mellow moonshine of romance.\nThe revelations that came were disenchanting.  It was curious to see how\nquickly the paint and tinsel fell away from him and left him treacherous,\nfilthy and repulsive--and how quickly the evidences accumulated that\nwherever one finds an Indian tribe he has only found Goshoots more or\nless modified by circumstances and surroundings--but Goshoots, after all.\nThey deserve pity, poor creatures; and they can have mine--at this\ndistance.  Nearer by, they never get anybody's.\n\nThere is an impression abroad that the Baltimore and Washington Railroad\nCompany and many of its employees are Goshoots; but it is an error.\nThere is only a plausible resemblance, which, while it is apt enough to\nmislead the ignorant, cannot deceive parties who have contemplated both\ntribes.  But seriously, it was not only poor wit, but very wrong to start\nthe report referred to above; for however innocent the motive may have\nbeen, the necessary effect was to injure the reputation of a class who\nhave a hard enough time of it in the pitiless deserts of the Rocky\nMountains, Heaven knows!  If we cannot find it in our hearts to give\nthose poor naked creatures our Christian sympathy and compassion, in\nGod's name let us at least not throw mud at them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nOn the seventeenth day we passed the highest mountain peaks we had yet\nseen, and although the day was very warm the night that followed upon its\nheels was wintry cold and blankets were next to useless.\n\nOn the eighteenth day we encountered the eastward-bound\ntelegraph-constructors at Reese River station and sent a message to his\nExcellency Gov. Nye at Carson City (distant one hundred and fifty-six\nmiles).\n\nOn the nineteenth day we crossed the Great American Desert--forty\nmemorable miles of bottomless sand, into which the coach wheels sunk from\nsix inches to a foot.  We worked our passage most of the way across.\nThat is to say, we got out and walked.  It was a dreary pull and a long\nand thirsty one, for we had no water.  From one extremity of this desert\nto the other, the road was white with the bones of oxen and horses.\nIt would hardly be an exaggeration to say that we could have walked the\nforty miles and set our feet on a bone at every step!  The desert was one\nprodigious graveyard.  And the log-chains, wagon tyres, and rotting\nwrecks of vehicles were almost as thick as the bones.  I think we saw\nlog-chains enough rusting there in the desert, to reach across any State\nin the Union.  Do not these relics suggest something of an idea of the\nfearful suffering and privation the early emigrants to California\nendured?\n\nAt the border of the Desert lies Carson Lake, or The \"Sink\" of the\nCarson, a shallow, melancholy sheet of water some eighty or a hundred\nmiles in circumference.  Carson River empties into it and is lost--sinks\nmysteriously into the earth and never appears in the light of the sun\nagain--for the lake has no outlet whatever.\n\nThere are several rivers in Nevada, and they all have this mysterious\nfate.  They end in various lakes or \"sinks,\" and that is the last of\nthem.  Carson Lake, Humboldt Lake, Walker Lake, Mono Lake, are all great\nsheets of water without any visible outlet.  Water is always flowing into\nthem; none is ever seen to flow out of them, and yet they remain always\nlevel full, neither receding nor overflowing.  What they do with their\nsurplus is only known to the Creator.\n\nOn the western verge of the Desert we halted a moment at Ragtown.  It\nconsisted of one log house and is not set down on the map.\n\nThis reminds me of a circumstance.  Just after we left Julesburg, on the\nPlatte, I was sitting with the driver, and he said:\n\n\"I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if you would like to\nlisten to it.  Horace Greeley went over this road once.  When he was\nleaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an\nengagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through\nquick.  Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace.\nThe coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the\nbuttons all off of Horace's coat, and finally shot his head clean through\nthe roof of the stage, and then he yelled at Hank Monk and begged him to\ngo easier--said he warn't in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago.\nBut Hank Monk said, 'Keep your seat, Horace, and I'll get you there on\ntime'--and you bet you he did, too, what was left of him!\"\n\nA day or two after that we picked up a Denver man at the cross roads, and\nhe told us a good deal about the country and the Gregory Diggings.\nHe seemed a very entertaining person and a man well posted in the affairs\nof Colorado.  By and by he remarked:\n\n\"I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if you would like to\nlisten to it.  Horace Greeley went over this road once.  When he was\nleaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an\nengagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through\nquick.  Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace.

From no other man\nduring the whole journey, did we gather such a store of concise and\nwell-arranged military information.  It was surprising to find in the\ndesolate wilds of our country a man so thoroughly acquainted with\neverything useful to know in his line of life, and yet of such inferior\nrank and unpretentious bearing.  For as much as three hours we listened\nto him with unabated interest.  Finally he got upon the subject of\ntrans-continental travel, and presently said:\n\n\"I can tell you a very laughable thing indeed, if you would like to\nlisten to it.  Horace Greeley went over this road once.  When he was\nleaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an\nengagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through\nquick.

I can never forget the pathos\nthat was in his voice as he told, in simple language, the story of his\npeople's wanderings and unpitied sufferings.  No pulpit eloquence was\never so moving and so beautiful as this outcast's picture of the first\nMormon pilgrimage across the plains, struggling sorrowfully onward to the\nland of its banishment and marking its desolate way with graves and\nwatering it with tears.  His words so wrought upon us that it was a\nrelief to us all when the conversation drifted into a more cheerful\nchannel and the natural features of the curious country we were in came\nunder treatment.  One matter after another was pleasantly discussed, and\nat length the stranger said:\n\n\"I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if you would like to\nlisten to it.  Horace Greeley went over this road once.

He had walked as long as he could, but his limbs had failed him at\nlast.  Hunger and fatigue had conquered him.  It would have been inhuman\nto leave him there.  We paid his fare to Carson and lifted him into the\ncoach.  It was some little time before he showed any very decided signs\nof life; but by dint of chafing him and pouring brandy between his lips\nwe finally brought him to a languid consciousness.  Then we fed him a\nlittle, and by and by he seemed to comprehend the situation and a\ngrateful light softened his eye.  We made his mail-sack bed as\ncomfortable as possible, and constructed a pillow for him with our coats.\nHe seemed very thankful.  Then he looked up in our faces, and said in a\nfeeble voice that had a tremble of honest emotion in it:\n\n\"Gentlemen, I know not who you are, but you have saved my life; and\nalthough I can never be able to repay you for it, I feel that I can at\nleast make one hour of your long journey lighter.  I take it you are\nstrangers to this great thorough fare, but I am entirely familiar with\nit.  In this connection I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if\nyou would like to listen to it.  Horace Greeley----\"\n\nI said, impressively:\n\n\"Suffering stranger, proceed at your peril.  You see in me the melancholy\nwreck of a once stalwart and magnificent manhood.  What has brought me to\nthis?  That thing which you are about to tell.  Gradually but surely,\nthat tiresome old anecdote has sapped my strength, undermined my\nconstitution, withered my life.  Pity my helplessness.  Spare me only\njust this once, and tell me about young George Washington and his little\nhatchet for a change.\"\n\nWe were saved.  But not so the invalid.  In trying to retain the anecdote\nin his system he strained himself and died in our arms.\n\nI am aware, now, that I ought not to have asked of the sturdiest citizen\nof all that region, what I asked of that mere shadow of a man; for, after\nseven years' residence on the Pacific coast, I know that no passenger or\ndriver on the Overland ever corked that anecdote in, when a stranger was\nby, and survived.  Within a period of six years I crossed and recrossed\nthe Sierras between Nevada and California thirteen times by stage and\nlistened to that deathless incident four hundred and eighty-one or\neighty-two times.  I have the list somewhere.  Drivers always told it,\nconductors told it, landlords told it, chance passengers told it, the\nvery Chinamen and vagrant Indians recounted it.  I have had the same\ndriver tell it to me two or three times in the same afternoon.  It has\ncome to me in all the multitude of tongues that Babel bequeathed to\nearth, and flavored with whiskey, brandy, beer, cologne, sozodont,\ntobacco, garlic, onions, grasshoppers--everything that has a fragrance to\nit through all the long list of things that are gorged or guzzled by the\nsons of men.  I never have smelt any anecdote as often as I have smelt\nthat one; never have smelt any anecdote that smelt so variegated as that\none.  And you never could learn to know it by its smell, because every\ntime you thought you had learned the smell of it, it would turn up with a\ndifferent smell.  Bayard Taylor has written about this hoary anecdote,\nRichardson has published it; so have Jones, Smith, Johnson, Ross Browne,\nand every other correspondence-inditing being that ever set his foot upon\nthe great overland road anywhere between Julesburg and San Francisco; and\nI have heard that it is in the Talmud.  I have seen it in print in nine\ndifferent foreign languages; I have been told that it is employed in the\ninquisition in Rome; and I now learn with regret that it is going to be\nset to music.  I do not think that such things are right.\n\nStage-coaching on the Overland is no more, and stage drivers are a race\ndefunct.  I wonder if they bequeathed that bald-headed anecdote to their\nsuccessors, the railroad brakemen and conductors, and if these latter\nstill persecute the helpless passenger with it until he concludes, as did\nmany a tourist of other days, that the real grandeurs of the Pacific\ncoast are not Yo Semite and the Big Trees, but Hank Monk and his\nadventure with Horace Greeley.  [And what makes that worn anecdote the\nmore aggravating, is, that the adventure it celebrates never occurred.\nIf it were a good anecdote, that seeming demerit would be its chiefest\nvirtue, for creative power belongs to greatness; but what ought to be\ndone to a man who would wantonly contrive so flat a one as this?

We\nwere on foot most of the time. One cannot describe those noble woods,\nnor the feeling with which they inspire him. A feature of the feeling,\nhowever, is a deep sense of contentment; another feature of it is a\nbuoyant, boyish gladness; and a third and very conspicuous feature of\nit is one's sense of the remoteness of the work-day world and his entire\nemancipation from it and its affairs.\n\nThose woods stretch unbroken over a vast region; and everywhere they are\nsuch dense woods, and so still, and so piney and fragrant. The stems of\nthe trees are trim and straight, and in many places all the ground is\nhidden for miles under a thick cushion of moss of a vivid green color,\nwith not a decayed or ragged spot in its surface, and not a fallen leaf\nor twig to mar its immaculate tidiness. A rich cathedral gloom pervades\nthe pillared aisles; so the stray flecks of sunlight that strike a trunk\nhere and a bough yonder are strongly accented, and when they strike the\nmoss they fairly seem to burn. But the weirdest effect, and the most\nenchanting is that produced by the diffused light of the low afternoon\nsun; no single ray is able to pierce its way in, then, but the diffused\nlight takes color from moss and foliage, and pervades the place like\na faint, green-tinted mist, the theatrical fire of fairyland. The\nsuggestion of mystery and the supernatural which haunts the forest at\nall times is intensified by this unearthly glow.\n\nWe found the Black Forest farmhouses and villages all that the Black\nForest stories have pictured them. The first genuine specimen which\nwe came upon was the mansion of a rich farmer and member of the Common\nCouncil of the parish or district. He was an important personage in the\nland and so was his wife also, of course.\n\n\n\nHis daughter was the \"catch\" of the region, and she may be already\nentering into immortality as the heroine of one of Auerbach's novels,\nfor all I know. We shall see, for if he puts her in I shall recognize\nher by her Black Forest clothes, and her burned complexion, her plump\nfigure, her fat hands, her dull expression, her gentle spirit,\nher generous feet, her bonnetless head, and the plaited tails of\nhemp-colored hair hanging down her back.\n\n\n\nThe house was big enough for a hotel; it was a hundred feet long and\nfifty wide, and ten feet high, from ground to eaves; but from the eaves\nto the comb of the mighty roof was as much as forty feet, or maybe even\nmore. This roof was of ancient mud-colored straw thatch a foot thick,\nand was covered all over, except in a few trifling spots, with a\nthriving and luxurious growth of green vegetation, mainly moss. The\nmossless spots were places where repairs had been made by the insertion\nof bright new masses of yellow straw. The eaves projected far down, like\nsheltering, hospitable wings. Across the gable that fronted the road,\nand about ten feet above the ground, ran a narrow porch, with a wooden\nrailing; a row of small windows filled with very small panes looked upon\nthe porch. Above were two or three other little windows, one clear up\nunder the sharp apex of the roof. Before the ground-floor door was a\nhuge pile of manure. The door of the second-story room on the side of\nthe house was open, and occupied by the rear elevation of a cow. Was\nthis probably the drawing-room? All of the front half of the house from\nthe ground up seemed to be occupied by the people, the cows, and the\nchickens, and all the rear half by draught-animals and hay. But the\nchief feature, all around this house, was the big heaps of manure.\n\nWe became very familiar with the fertilizer in the Forest. We fell\nunconsciously into the habit of judging of a man's station in life\nby this outward and eloquent sign. Sometimes we said, \"Here is a poor\ndevil, this is manifest.\" When we saw a stately accumulation, we said,\n\"Here is a banker.\" When we encountered a country-seat surrounded by an\nAlpine pomp of manure, we said, \"Doubtless a duke lives here.\"\n\nThe importance of this feature has not been properly magnified in the\nBlack Forest stories. Manure is evidently the Black-Forester's main\ntreasure--his coin, his jewel, his pride, his Old Master, his ceramics,\nhis bric-a-brac, his darling, his title to public consideration, envy,\nveneration, and his first solicitude when he gets ready to make his\nwill. The true Black Forest novel, if it is ever written, will be\nskeletoned somewhat in this way:\n\nSKELETON FOR A BLACK FOREST NOVEL\n\nRich old farmer, named Huss.\n\n\n\nHas inherited great wealth of manure, and by diligence has added to it.\nIt is double-starred in Baedeker. [1] The Black forest artist paints\nit--his masterpiece. The king comes to see it. Gretchen Huss,\ndaughter and heiress. Paul Hoch, young neighbor, suitor for Gretchen's\nhand--ostensibly; he really wants the manure.\n\n\n\nHoch has a good many cart-loads of the Black Forest currency himself,\nand therefore is a good catch; but he is sordid, mean, and without\nsentiment, whereas Gretchen is all sentiment and poetry. Hans Schmidt,\nyoung neighbor, full of sentiment, full of poetry, loves Gretchen,\nGretchen loves him. But he has no manure. Old Huss forbids him in the\nhouse. His heart breaks, he goes away to die in the woods, far from the\ncruel world--for he says, bitterly, \"What is man, without manure?\"\n\n1. When Baedeker's guide-books mention a thing and put two stars (**)\nafter it, it means well worth visiting. M.T.\n\n[Interval of six months.]\n\n\n\nPaul Hoch comes to old Huss and says, \"I am at last as rich as you\nrequired--come and view the pile.\" Old Huss views it and says, \"It is\nsufficient--take her and be happy,\"--meaning Gretchen.\n\n[Interval of two weeks.]\n\nWedding party assembled in old Huss's drawing-room. Hoch placid and\ncontent, Gretchen weeping over her hard fate. Enter old Huss's head\nbookkeeper. Huss says fiercely, \"I gave you three weeks to find out why\nyour books don't balance, and to prove that you are not a defaulter;\nthe time is up--find me the missing property or you go to prison as\na thief.\" Bookkeeper: \"I have found it.\" \"Where?\" Bookkeeper\n(sternly--tragically): \"In the bridegroom's pile!--behold the thief--see\nhim blench and tremble!\" [Sensation.] Paul Hoch: \"Lost, lost!\"--falls\nover the cow in a swoon and is handcuffed. Gretchen: \"Saved!\" Falls over\nthe calf in a swoon of joy, but is caught in the arms of Hans Schmidt,\nwho springs in at that moment. Old Huss: \"What, you here, varlet? Unhand\nthe maid and quit the place.\" Hans (still supporting the insensible\ngirl): \"Never! Cruel old man, know that I come with claims which even\nyou cannot despise.\"\n\n\n\nHuss: \"What, YOU? name them.\"\n\nHans: \"Listen then. The world has forsaken me, I forsook the world, I\nwandered in the solitude of the forest, longing for death but finding\nnone. I fed upon roots, and in my bitterness I dug for the bitterest,\nloathing the sweeter kind. Digging, three days agone, I struck a manure\nmine!--a Golconda, a limitless Bonanza, of solid manure! I can buy you\nALL, and have mountain ranges of manure left! Ha-ha, NOW thou smilest a\nsmile!\" [Immense sensation.] Exhibition of specimens from the mine. Old\nHuss (enthusiastically): \"Wake her up, shake her up, noble young man,\nshe is yours!\" Wedding takes place on the spot; bookkeeper restored to\nhis office and emoluments; Paul Hoch led off to jail. The Bonanza king\nof the Black Forest lives to a good old age, blessed with the love of\nhis wife and of his twenty-seven children, and the still sweeter envy of\neverybody around.\n\nWe took our noon meal of fried trout one day at the Plow Inn, in a very\npretty village (Ottenhoefen), and then went into the public room to rest\nand smoke. There we found nine or ten Black Forest grandees assembled\naround a table. They were the Common Council of the parish. They had\ngathered there at eight o'clock that morning to elect a new member, and\nthey had now been drinking beer four hours at the new member's expense.\n\n\n\nThey were men of fifty or sixty years of age, with grave good-natured\nfaces, and were all dressed in the costume made familiar to us by the\nBlack Forest stories; broad, round-topped black felt hats with the brims\ncurled up all round; long red waistcoats with large metal buttons, black\nalpaca coats with the waists up between the shoulders. There were no\nspeeches, there was but little talk, there were no frivolities; the\nCouncil filled themselves gradually, steadily, but surely, with beer,\nand conducted themselves with sedate decorum, as became men of position,\nmen of influence, men of manure.\n\nWe had a hot afternoon tramp up the valley, along the grassy bank of a\nrushing stream of clear water, past farmhouses, water-mills, and no end\nof wayside crucifixes and saints and Virgins. These crucifixes, etc.,\nare set up in memory of departed friends, by survivors, and are almost\nas frequent as telegraph-poles are in other lands.\n\nWe followed the carriage-road, and had our usual luck; we traveled under\na beating sun, and always saw the shade leave the shady places before we\ncould get to them. In all our wanderings we seldom managed to strike\na piece of road at its time for being shady. We had a particularly hot\ntime of it on that particular afternoon, and with no comfort but what we\ncould get out of the fact that the peasants at work away up on the steep\nmountainsides above our heads were even worse off than we were. By and\nby it became impossible to endure the intolerable glare and heat\nany longer; so we struck across the ravine and entered the deep cool\ntwilight of the forest, to hunt for what the guide-book called the \"old\nroad.\"\n\nWe found an old road, and it proved eventually to be the right one,\nthough we followed it at the time with the conviction that it was the\nwrong one. If it was the wrong one there could be no use in hurrying;\ntherefore we did not hurry, but sat down frequently on the soft moss and\nenjoyed the restful quiet and shade of the forest solitudes. There\nhad been distractions in the carriage-road--school-children, peasants,\nwagons, troops of pedestrianizing students from all over Germany--but we\nhad the old road to ourselves.\n\nNow and then, while we rested, we watched the laborious ant at his work.\nI found nothing new in him--certainly nothing to change my opinion of\nhim. It seems to me that in the matter of intellect the ant must be a\nstrangely overrated bird. During many summers, now, I have watched him,\nwhen I ought to have been in better business, and I have not yet come\nacross a living ant that seemed to have any more sense than a dead one.\nI refer to the ordinary ant, of course; I have had no experience of\nthose wonderful Swiss and African ones which vote, keep drilled armies,\nhold slaves, and dispute about religion. Those particular ants may be\nall that the naturalist paints them, but I am persuaded that the\naverage ant is a sham. I admit his industry, of course; he is the\nhardest-working creature in the world--when anybody is looking--but\nhis leather-headedness is the point I make against him. He goes out\nforaging, he makes a capture, and then what does he do? Go home? No--he\ngoes anywhere but home. He doesn't know where home is. His home may be\nonly three feet away--no matter, he can't find it. He makes his capture,\nas I have said; it is generally something which can be of no sort of\nuse to himself or anybody else; it is usually seven times bigger than\nit ought to be; he hunts out the awkwardest place to take hold of it;\nhe lifts it bodily up in the air by main force, and starts; not toward\nhome, but in the opposite direction; not calmly and wisely, but with a\nfrantic haste which is wasteful of his strength; he fetches up against\na pebble, and instead of going around it, he climbs over it backward\ndragging his booty after him, tumbles down on the other side, jumps up\nin a passion, kicks the dust off his clothes, moistens his hands, grabs\nhis property viciously, yanks it this way, then that, shoves it ahead\nof him a moment, turns tail and lugs it after him another moment,\ngets madder and madder, then presently hoists it into the air and goes\ntearing away in an entirely new direction; comes to a weed; it never\noccurs to him to go around it; no, he must climb it; and he does climb\nit, dragging his worthless property to the top--which is as bright\na thing to do as it would be for me to carry a sack of flour from\nHeidelberg to Paris by way of Strasburg steeple; when he gets up there\nhe finds that that is not the place; takes a cursory glance at the\nscenery and either climbs down again or tumbles down, and starts off\nonce more--as usual, in a new direction. At the end of half an hour, he\nfetches up within six inches of the place he started from and lays his\nburden down; meantime he has been over all the ground for two yards\naround, and climbed all the weeds and pebbles he came across. Now he\nwipes the sweat from his brow, strokes his limbs, and then marches\naimlessly off, in as violently a hurry as ever. He does not remember to\nhave ever seen it before; he looks around to see which is not the way\nhome, grabs his bundle and starts; he goes through the same adventures\nhe had before; finally stops to rest, and a friend comes along.\nEvidently the friend remarks that a last year's grasshopper leg is a\nvery noble acquisition, and inquires where he got it.\n\n\n\nEvidently the proprietor does not remember exactly where he did get\nit, but thinks he got it \"around here somewhere.\" Evidently the friend\ncontracts to help him freight it home. Then, with a judgment peculiarly\nantic (pun not intended), they take hold of opposite ends of that\ngrasshopper leg and begin to tug with all their might in opposite\ndirections. Presently they take a rest and confer together. They decide\nthat something is wrong, they can't make out what. Then they go at\nit again, just as before. Same result. Mutual recriminations follow.\nEvidently each accuses the other of being an obstructionist. They lock\nthemselves together and chew each other's jaws for a while; then they\nroll and tumble on the ground till one loses a horn or a leg and has to\nhaul off for repairs. They make up and go to work again in the same old\ninsane way, but the crippled ant is at a disadvantage; tug as he may,\nthe other one drags off the booty and him at the end of it. Instead\nof giving up, he hangs on, and gets his shins bruised against every\nobstruction that comes in the way. By and by, when that grasshopper leg\nhas been dragged all over the same old ground once more, it is finally\ndumped at about the spot where it originally lay, the two perspiring\nants inspect it thoughtfully and decide that dried grasshopper legs\nare a poor sort of property after all, and then each starts off in a\ndifferent direction to see if he can't find an old nail or something\nelse that is heavy enough to afford entertainment and at the same time\nvalueless enough to make an ant want to own it.\n\nThere in the Black Forest, on the mountainside, I saw an ant go through\nwith such a performance as this with a dead spider of fully ten times\nhis own weight. The spider was not quite dead, but too far gone to\nresist. He had a round body the size of a pea. The little ant--observing\nthat I was noticing--turned him on his back, sunk his fangs into his\nthroat, lifted him into the air and started vigorously off with him,\nstumbling over little pebbles, stepping on the spider's legs and\ntripping himself up, dragging him backward, shoving him bodily ahead,\ndragging him up stones six inches high instead of going around them,\nclimbing weeds twenty times his own height and jumping from their\nsummits--and finally leaving him in the middle of the road to be\nconfiscated by any other fool of an ant that wanted him. I measured the\nground which this ass traversed, and arrived at the conclusion that what\nhe had accomplished inside of twenty minutes would constitute some\nsuch job as this--relatively speaking--for a man; to wit: to strap two\neight-hundred-pound horses together, carry them eighteen hundred feet,\nmainly over (not around) boulders averaging six feet high, and in the\ncourse of the journey climb up and jump from the top of one precipice\nlike Niagara, and three steeples, each a hundred and twenty feet high;\nand then put the horses down, in an exposed place, without anybody to\nwatch them, and go off to indulge in some other idiotic miracle for\nvanity's sake.\n\n\n\nScience has recently discovered that the ant does not lay up anything\nfor winter use. This will knock him out of literature, to some extent.\nHe does not work, except when people are looking, and only then when the\nobserver has a green, naturalistic look, and seems to be taking notes.\nThis amounts to deception, and will injure him for the Sunday-schools.\nHe has not judgment enough to know what is good to eat from what isn't.\nThis amounts to ignorance, and will impair the world's respect for\nhim. He cannot stroll around a stump and find his way home again. This\namounts to idiocy, and once the damaging fact is established, thoughtful\npeople will cease to look up to him, the sentimental will cease to\nfondle him. His vaunted industry is but a vanity and of no effect, since\nhe never gets home with anything he starts with. This disposes of the\nlast remnant of his reputation and wholly destroys his main usefulness\nas a moral agent, since it will make the sluggard hesitate to go to him\nany more. It is strange, beyond comprehension, that so manifest a humbug\nas the ant has been able to fool so many nations and keep it up so many\nages without being found out.\n\nThe ant is strong, but we saw another strong thing, where we had not\nsuspected the presence of much muscular power before. A toadstool--that\nvegetable which springs to full growth in a single night--had torn loose\nand lifted a matted mass of pine needles and dirt of twice its own bulk\ninto the air, and supported it there, like a column supporting a shed.\nTen thousand toadstools, with the right purchase, could lift a man, I\nsuppose. But what good would it do?\n\nAll our afternoon's progress had been uphill. About five or half past we\nreached the summit, and all of a sudden the dense curtain of the forest\nparted and we looked down into a deep and beautiful gorge and out over a\nwide panorama of wooded mountains with their summits shining in the sun\nand their glade-furrowed sides dimmed with purple shade. The gorge under\nour feet--called Allerheiligen--afforded room in the grassy level at its\nhead for a cozy and delightful human nest, shut away from the world and\nits botherations, and consequently the monks of the old times had not\nfailed to spy it out; and here were the brown and comely ruins of their\nchurch and convent to prove that priests had as fine an instinct seven\nhundred years ago in ferreting out the choicest nooks and corners in a\nland as priests have today.\n\nA big hotel crowds the ruins a little, now, and drives a brisk trade\nwith summer tourists. We descended into the gorge and had a supper which\nwould have been very satisfactory if the trout had not been boiled.\nThe Germans are pretty sure to boil a trout or anything else if left to\ntheir own devices. This is an argument of some value in support of the\ntheory that they were the original colonists of the wild islands of the\ncoast of Scotland. A schooner laden with oranges was wrecked upon one\nof those islands a few years ago, and the gentle savages rendered the\ncaptain such willing assistance that he gave them as many oranges as\nthey wanted. Next day he asked them how they liked them. They shook\ntheir heads and said:\n\n\"Baked, they were tough; and even boiled, they warn't things for a\nhungry man to hanker after.\"\n\nWe went down the glen after supper. It is beautiful--a mixture of sylvan\nloveliness and craggy wildness. A limpid torrent goes whistling down\nthe glen, and toward the foot of it winds through a narrow cleft between\nlofty precipices and hurls itself over a succession of falls. After one\npasses the last of these he has a backward glimpse at the falls which\nis very pleasing--they rise in a seven-stepped stairway of foamy and\nglittering cascades, and make a picture which is as charming as it is\nunusual.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n[Nicodemus Dodge and the Skeleton]\n\n\nWe were satisfied that we could walk to Oppenau in one day, now that\nwe were in practice; so we set out the next morning after breakfast\ndetermined to do it. It was all the way downhill, and we had the\nloveliest summer weather for it. So we set the pedometer and then\nstretched away on an easy, regular stride, down through the cloven\nforest, drawing in the fragrant breath of the morning in deep refreshing\ndraughts, and wishing we might never have anything to do forever but\nwalk to Oppenau and keep on doing it and then doing it over again.\n\nNow, the true charm of pedestrianism does not lie in the walking, or\nin the scenery, but in the talking. The walking is good to time the\nmovement of the tongue by, and to keep the blood and the brain stirred\nup and active; the scenery and the woodsy smells are good to bear in\nupon a man an unconscious and unobtrusive charm and solace to eye and\nsoul and sense; but the supreme pleasure comes from the talk. It is no\nmatter whether one talks wisdom or nonsense, the case is the same, the\nbulk of the enjoyment lies in the wagging of the gladsome jaw and the\nflapping of the sympathetic ear.\n\nAnd what motley variety of subjects a couple of people will casually\nrake over in the course of a day's tramp! There being no constraint,\na change of subject is always in order, and so a body is not likely to\nkeep pegging at a single topic until it grows tiresome. We discussed\neverything we knew, during the first fifteen or twenty minutes, that\nmorning, and then branched out into the glad, free, boundless realm of\nthe things we were not certain about.\n\nHarris said that if the best writer in the world once got the slovenly\nhabit of doubling up his \"haves\" he could never get rid of it while he\nlived. That is to say, if a man gets the habit of saying \"I should\nhave liked to have known more about it\" instead of saying simply and\nsensibly, \"I should have liked to know more about it,\" that man's\ndisease is incurable. Harris said that his sort of lapse is to be found\nin every copy of every newspaper that has ever been printed in English,\nand in almost all of our books. He said he had observed it in Kirkham's\ngrammar and in Macaulay. Harris believed that milk-teeth are commoner in\nmen's mouths than those \"doubled-up haves.\"\n\nI do not know that there have not been moments in the course of the\npresent session when I should have been very glad to have accepted the\nproposal of my noble friend, and to have exchanged parts in some of our\nevenings of work.--[From a Speech of the English Chancellor of the\nExchequer, August, 1879.]\n\nThat changed the subject to dentistry. I said I believed the average\nman dreaded tooth-pulling more than amputation, and that he would yell\nquicker under the former operation than he would under the latter. The\nphilosopher Harris said that the average man would not yell in either\ncase if he had an audience. Then he continued:\n\n\"When our brigade first went into camp on the Potomac, we used to be\nbrought up standing, occasionally, by an ear-splitting howl of anguish.\nThat meant that a soldier was getting a tooth pulled in a tent. But the\nsurgeons soon changed that; they instituted open-air dentistry. There\nnever was a howl afterward--that is, from the man who was having the\ntooth pulled. At the daily dental hour there would always be about five\nhundred soldiers gathered together in the neighborhood of that dental\nchair waiting to see the performance--and help; and the moment the\nsurgeon took a grip on the candidate's tooth and began to lift, every\none of those five hundred rascals would clap his hand to his jaw and\nbegin to hop around on one leg and howl with all the lungs he had!\nIt was enough to raise your hair to hear that variegated and enormous\nunanimous caterwaul burst out!\n\n\n\nWith so big and so derisive an audience as that, a sufferer wouldn't\nemit a sound though you pulled his head off. The surgeons said that\npretty often a patient was compelled to laugh, in the midst of his\npangs, but that they had never caught one crying out, after the open-air\nexhibition was instituted.\"\n\nDental surgeons suggested doctors, doctors suggested death, death\nsuggested skeletons--and so, by a logical process the conversation\nmelted out of one of these subjects and into the next, until the topic\nof skeletons raised up Nicodemus Dodge out of the deep grave in my\nmemory where he had lain buried and forgotten for twenty-five years.\nWhen I was a boy in a printing-office in Missouri, a loose-jointed,\nlong-legged, tow-headed, jeans-clad countrified cub of about sixteen\nlounged in one day, and without removing his hands from the depths of\nhis trousers pockets or taking off his faded ruin of a slouch hat, whose\nbroken rim hung limp and ragged about his eyes and ears like a bug-eaten\ncabbage leaf, stared indifferently around, then leaned his hip against\nthe editor's table, crossed his mighty brogans, aimed at a distant\nfly from a crevice in his upper teeth, laid him low, and said with\ncomposure:\n\n\"Whar's the boss?\"\n\n\"I am the boss,\" said the editor, following this curious bit of\narchitecture wonderingly along up to its clock-face with his eye.\n\n\"Don't want anybody fur to learn the business, 'tain't likely?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know. Would you like to learn it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Pap's so po' he cain't run me no mo', so I want to git a show somers if\nI kin, 'taint no diffunce what--I'm strong and hearty, and I don't turn\nmy back on no kind of work, hard nur soft.\"\n\n\"Do you think you would like to learn the printing business?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't re'ly k'yer a durn what I DO learn, so's I git a chance\nfur to make my way. I'd jist as soon learn print'n's anything.\"\n\n\"Can you read?\"\n\n\"Yes--middlin'.\"\n\n\"Write?\"\n\n\"Well, I've seed people could lay over me thar.\"\n\n\"Cipher?\"\n\n\"Not good enough to keep store, I don't reckon, but up as fur as\ntwelve-times-twelve I ain't no slouch. 'Tother side of that is what gits\nme.\"\n\n\"Where is your home?\"\n\n\"I'm f'm old Shelby.\"\n\n\"What's your father's religious denomination?\"\n\n\"Him? Oh, he's a blacksmith.\"\n\n\"No, no--I don't mean his trade. What's his RELIGIOUS DENOMINATION?\"\n\n\"OH--I didn't understand you befo'. He's a Freemason.\"\n\n\"No, no, you don't get my meaning yet. What I mean is, does he belong to\nany CHURCH?\"\n\n\"NOW you're talkin'! Couldn't make out what you was a-tryin' to git\nthrough yo' head no way. B'long to a CHURCH! Why, boss, he's ben the\npizenest kind of Free-will Babtis' for forty year. They ain't no pizener\nones 'n what HE is. Mighty good man, pap is. Everybody says that. If\nthey said any diffrunt they wouldn't say it whar I wuz--not MUCH they\nwouldn't.\"\n\n\"What is your own religion?\"\n\n\"Well, boss, you've kind o' got me, there--and yit you hain't got me so\nmighty much, nuther. I think 't if a feller he'ps another feller when\nhe's in trouble, and don't cuss, and don't do no mean things, nur\nnoth'n' he ain' no business to do, and don't spell the Saviour's name\nwith a little g, he ain't runnin' no resks--he's about as saift as he\nb'longed to a church.\"\n\n\"But suppose he did spell it with a little g--what then?\"\n\n\"Well, if he done it a-purpose, I reckon he wouldn't stand no chance--he\nOUGHTN'T to have no chance, anyway, I'm most rotten certain 'bout that.\"\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Nicodemus Dodge.\"\n\n\"I think maybe you'll do, Nicodemus. We'll give you a trial, anyway.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"When would you like to begin?\"\n\n\"Now.\"\n\nSo, within ten minutes after we had first glimpsed this nondescript he\nwas one of us, and with his coat off and hard at it.\n\nBeyond that end of our establishment which was furthest from the street,\nwas a deserted garden, pathless, and thickly grown with the bloomy and\nvillainous \"jimpson\" weed and its common friend the stately sunflower.\nIn the midst of this mournful spot was a decayed and aged little \"frame\"\nhouse with but one room, one window, and no ceiling--it had been a\nsmoke-house a generation before. Nicodemus was given this lonely and\nghostly den as a bedchamber.\n\nThe village smarties recognized a treasure in Nicodemus, right away--a\nbutt to play jokes on. It was easy to see that he was inconceivably\ngreen and confiding. George Jones had the glory of perpetrating the\nfirst joke on him; he gave him a cigar with a firecracker in it and\nwinked to the crowd to come; the thing exploded presently and swept away\nthe bulk of Nicodemus's eyebrows and eyelashes. He simply said:\n\n\"I consider them kind of seeg'yars dangersome,\"--and seemed to suspect\nnothing. The next evening Nicodemus waylaid George and poured a bucket\nof ice-water over him.\n\nOne day, while Nicodemus was in swimming, Tom McElroy \"tied\" his\nclothes. Nicodemus made a bonfire of Tom's by way of retaliation.\n\nA third joke was played upon Nicodemus a day or two later--he walked\nup the middle aisle of the village church, Sunday night, with a staring\nhandbill pinned between his shoulders. The joker spent the remainder\nof the night, after church, in the cellar of a deserted house, and\nNicodemus sat on the cellar door till toward breakfast-time to make\nsure that the prisoner remembered that if any noise was made, some rough\ntreatment would be the consequence. The cellar had two feet of stagnant\nwater in it, and was bottomed with six inches of soft mud.\n\n\n\nBut I wander from the point. It was the subject of skeletons that\nbrought this boy back to my recollection. Before a very long time\nhad elapsed, the village smarties began to feel an uncomfortable\nconsciousness of not having made a very shining success out of their\nattempts on the simpleton from \"old Shelby.\" Experimenters grew scarce\nand chary. Now the young doctor came to the rescue. There was delight\nand applause when he proposed to scare Nicodemus to death, and explained\nhow he was going to do it. He had a noble new skeleton--the skeleton of\nthe late and only local celebrity, Jimmy Finn, the village drunkard--a\ngrisly piece of property which he had bought of Jimmy Finn himself, at\nauction, for fifty dollars, under great competition, when Jimmy lay very\nsick in the tan-yard a fortnight before his death. The fifty dollars had\ngone promptly for whiskey and had considerably hurried up the change of\nownership in the skeleton. The doctor would put Jimmy Finn's skeleton in\nNicodemus's bed!\n\nThis was done--about half past ten in the evening. About Nicodemus's\nusual bedtime--midnight--the village jokers came creeping stealthily\nthrough the jimpson weeds and sunflowers toward the lonely frame den.\nThey reached the window and peeped in. There sat the long-legged pauper,\non his bed, in a very short shirt, and nothing more; he was dangling\nhis legs contentedly back and forth, and wheezing the music of \"Camptown\nRaces\" out of a paper-overlaid comb which he was pressing against his\nmouth; by him lay a new jewsharp, a new top, and solid india-rubber\nball, a handful of painted marbles, five pounds of \"store\" candy, and\na well-gnawed slab of gingerbread as big and as thick as a volume of\nsheet-music. He had sold the skeleton to a traveling quack for three\ndollars and was enjoying the result!\n\n\n\nJust as we had finished talking about skeletons and were drifting into\nthe subject of fossils, Harris and I heard a shout, and glanced up the\nsteep hillside. We saw men and women standing away up there looking\nfrightened, and there was a bulky object tumbling and floundering down\nthe steep slope toward us. We got out of the way, and when the object\nlanded in the road it proved to be a boy. He had tripped and fallen, and\nthere was nothing for him to do but trust to luck and take what might\ncome.\n\nWhen one starts to roll down a place like that, there is no stopping\ntill the bottom is reached. Think of people FARMING on a slant which is\nso steep that the best you can say of it--if you want to be fastidiously\naccurate--is, that it is a little steeper than a ladder and not quite\nso steep as a mansard roof. But that is what they do. Some of the little\nfarms on the hillside opposite Heidelberg were stood up \"edgeways.\"\nThe boy was wonderfully jolted up, and his head was bleeding, from cuts\nwhich it had got from small stones on the way.\n\n\n\nHarris and I gathered him up and set him on a stone, and by that time\nthe men and women had scampered down and brought his cap.\n\nMen, women, and children flocked out from neighboring cottages\nand joined the crowd; the pale boy was petted, and stared at, and\ncommiserated, and water was brought for him to drink and bathe his\nbruises in. And such another clatter of tongues! All who had seen the\ncatastrophe were describing it at once, and each trying to talk louder\nthan his neighbor; and one youth of a superior genius ran a little way\nup the hill, called attention, tripped, fell, rolled down among us, and\nthus triumphantly showed exactly how the thing had been done.\n\nHarris and I were included in all the descriptions; how we were coming\nalong; how Hans Gross shouted; how we looked up startled; how we saw\nPeter coming like a cannon-shot; how judiciously we got out of the way,\nand let him come; and with what presence of mind we picked him up and\nbrushed him off and set him on a rock when the performance was over.\nWe were as much heroes as anybody else, except Peter, and were so\nrecognized; we were taken with Peter and the populace to Peter's\nmother's cottage, and there we ate bread and cheese, and drank milk and\nbeer with everybody, and had a most sociable good time; and when we left\nwe had a handshake all around, and were receiving and shouting back LEB'\nWOHL's until a turn in the road separated us from our cordial and kindly\nnew friends forever.\n\nWe accomplished our undertaking. At half past eight in the evening\nwe stepped into Oppenau, just eleven hours and a half out of\nAllerheiligen--one hundred and forty-six miles. This is the distance by\npedometer; the guide-book and the Imperial Ordinance maps make it only\nten and a quarter--a surprising blunder, for these two authorities are\nusually singularly accurate in the matter of distances.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n[I Protect the Empress of Germany]\n\n\nThat was a thoroughly satisfactory walk--and the only one we were ever\nto have which was all the way downhill. We took the train next morning\nand returned to Baden-Baden through fearful fogs of dust. Every seat was\ncrowded, too; for it was Sunday, and consequently everybody was taking\na \"pleasure\" excursion. Hot! the sky was an oven--and a sound one,\ntoo, with no cracks in it to let in any air. An odd time for a pleasure\nexcursion, certainly!\n\nSunday is the great day on the continent--the free day, the happy day.\nOne can break the Sabbath in a hundred ways without committing any sin.\n\nWe do not work on Sunday, because the commandment forbids it; the\nGermans do not work on Sunday, because the commandment forbids it. We\nrest on Sunday, because the commandment requires it; the Germans rest on\nSunday because the commandment requires it. But in the definition of\nthe word \"rest\" lies all the difference. With us, its Sunday meaning\nis, stay in the house and keep still; with the Germans its Sunday and\nweek-day meanings seem to be the same--rest the TIRED PART, and never\nmind the other parts of the frame; rest the tired part, and use the\nmeans best calculated to rest that particular part. Thus: If one's\nduties have kept him in the house all the week, it will rest him to\nbe out on Sunday; if his duties have required him to read weighty and\nserious matter all the week, it will rest him to read light matter on\nSunday; if his occupation has busied him with death and funerals all the\nweek, it will rest him to go to the theater Sunday night and put in two\nor three hours laughing at a comedy; if he is tired with digging ditches\nor felling trees all the week, it will rest him to lie quiet in the\nhouse on Sunday; if the hand, the arm, the brain, the tongue, or any\nother member, is fatigued with inanition, it is not to be rested by\naddeding a day's inanition; but if a member is fatigued with exertion,\ninanition is the right rest for it. Such is the way in which the Germans\nseem to define the word \"rest\"; that is to say, they rest a member by\nrecreating, recuperating, restoring its forces. But our definition is\nless broad. We all rest alike on Sunday--by secluding ourselves and\nkeeping still, whether that is the surest way to rest the most of us or\nnot. The Germans make the actors, the preachers, etc., work on Sunday.\nWe encourage the preachers, the editors, the printers, etc., to work on\nSunday, and imagine that none of the sin of it falls upon us; but I do\nnot know how we are going to get around the fact that if it is wrong for\nthe printer to work at his trade on Sunday it must be equally wrong for\nthe preacher to work at his, since the commandment has made no exception\nin his favor. We buy Monday morning's paper and read it, and thus\nencourage Sunday printing. But I shall never do it again.\n\n\n\nThe Germans remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy, by abstaining\nfrom work, as commanded; we keep it holy by abstaining from work, as\ncommanded, and by also abstaining from play, which is not commanded.\nPerhaps we constructively BREAK the command to rest, because the resting\nwe do is in most cases only a name, and not a fact.\n\nThese reasonings have sufficed, in a measure, to mend the rent in my\nconscience which I made by traveling to Baden-Baden that Sunday. We\narrived in time to furbish up and get to the English church before\nservices began. We arrived in considerable style, too, for the landlord\nhad ordered the first carriage that could be found, since there was no\ntime to lose, and our coachman was so splendidly liveried that we were\nprobably mistaken for a brace of stray dukes; why else were we honored\nwith a pew all to ourselves, away up among the very elect at the left of\nthe chancel? That was my first thought. In the pew directly in front of\nus sat an elderly lady, plainly and cheaply dressed; at her side sat\na young lady with a very sweet face, and she also was quite simply\ndressed; but around us and about us were clothes and jewels which it\nwould do anybody's heart good to worship in.\n\nI thought it was pretty manifest that the elderly lady was embarrassed\nat finding herself in such a conspicuous place arrayed in such cheap\napparel; I began to feel sorry for her and troubled about her. She\ntried to seem very busy with her prayer-book and her responses, and\nunconscious that she was out of place, but I said to myself, \"She is\nnot succeeding--there is a distressed tremulousness in her voice which\nbetrays increasing embarrassment.\" Presently the Savior's name was\nmentioned, and in her flurry she lost her head completely, and rose and\ncourtesied, instead of making a slight nod as everybody else did. The\nsympathetic blood surged to my temples and I turned and gave those fine\nbirds what I intended to be a beseeching look, but my feelings got the\nbetter of me and changed it into a look which said, \"If any of you pets\nof fortune laugh at this poor soul, you will deserve to be flayed for\nit.\" Things went from bad to worse, and I shortly found myself mentally\ntaking the unfriended lady under my protection. My mind was wholly upon\nher. I forgot all about the sermon. Her embarrassment took stronger\nand stronger hold upon her; she got to snapping the lid of her\nsmelling-bottle--it made a loud, sharp sound, but in her trouble she\nsnapped and snapped away, unconscious of what she was doing. The last\nextremity was reached when the collection-plate began its rounds; the\nmoderate people threw in pennies, the nobles and the rich contributed\nsilver, but she laid a twenty-mark gold piece upon the book-rest before\nher with a sounding slap! I said to myself, \"She has parted with all her\nlittle hoard to buy the consideration of these unpitying people--it is a\nsorrowful spectacle.\" I did not venture to look around this time; but\nas the service closed, I said to myself, \"Let them laugh, it is their\nopportunity; but at the door of this church they shall see her step into\nour fine carriage with us, and our gaudy coachman shall drive her home.\"\n\n\n\nThen she rose--and all the congregation stood while she walked down the\naisle. She was the Empress of Germany!\n\nNo--she had not been so much embarrassed as I had supposed. My\nimagination had got started on the wrong scent, and that is always\nhopeless; one is sure, then, to go straight on misinterpreting\neverything, clear through to the end. The young lady with her imperial\nMajesty was a maid of honor--and I had been taking her for one of her\nboarders, all the time.\n\nThis is the only time I have ever had an Empress under my personal\nprotection; and considering my inexperience, I wonder I got through\nwith it so well. I should have been a little embarrassed myself if I had\nknown earlier what sort of a contract I had on my hands.\n\nWe found that the Empress had been in Baden-Baden several days. It is\nsaid that she never attends any but the English form of church service.\n\nI lay abed and read and rested from my journey's fatigues the remainder\nof that Sunday, but I sent my agent to represent me at the afternoon\nservice, for I never allow anything to interfere with my habit of\nattending church twice every Sunday.\n\nThere was a vast crowd in the public grounds that night to hear the band\nplay the \"Fremersberg.\" This piece tells one of the old legends of the\nregion; how a great noble of the Middle Ages got lost in the mountains,\nand wandered about with his dogs in a violent storm, until at last\nthe faint tones of a monastery bell, calling the monks to a midnight\nservice, caught his ear, and he followed the direction the sounds came\nfrom and was saved. A beautiful air ran through the music, without\nceasing, sometimes loud and strong, sometimes so soft that it could\nhardly be distinguished--but it was always there; it swung grandly along\nthrough the shrill whistling of the storm-wind, the rattling patter of\nthe rain, and the boom and crash of the thunder; it wound soft and low\nthrough the lesser sounds, the distant ones, such as the throbbing\nof the convent bell, the melodious winding of the hunter's horn, the\ndistressed bayings of his dogs, and the solemn chanting of the monks;\nit rose again, with a jubilant ring, and mingled itself with the country\nsongs and dances of the peasants assembled in the convent hall to\ncheer up the rescued huntsman while he ate his supper. The instruments\nimitated all these sounds with a marvelous exactness. More than one man\nstarted to raise his umbrella when the storm burst forth and the sheets\nof mimic rain came driving by; it was hardly possible to keep from\nputting your hand to your hat when the fierce wind began to rage and\nshriek; and it was NOT possible to refrain from starting when those\nsudden and charmingly real thunder-crashes were let loose.\n\n\n\nI suppose the \"Fremersberg\" is a very low-grade music; I know, indeed,\nthat it MUST be low-grade music, because it delighted me, warmed me,\nmoved me, stirred me, uplifted me, enraptured me, that I was full of\ncry all the time, and mad with enthusiasm. My soul had never had such a\nscouring out since I was born. The solemn and majestic chanting of the\nmonks was not done by instruments, but by men's voices; and it rose\nand fell, and rose again in that rich confusion of warring sounds, and\npulsing bells, and the stately swing of that ever-present enchanting\nair, and it seemed to me that nothing but the very lowest of low-grade\nmusic COULD be so divinely beautiful. The great crowd which the\n\"Fremersberg\" had called out was another evidence that it was low-grade\nmusic; for only the few are educated up to a point where high-grade\nmusic gives pleasure. I have never heard enough classic music to be able\nto enjoy it. I dislike the opera because I want to love it and can't.\n\nI suppose there are two kinds of music--one kind which one feels, just\nas an oyster might, and another sort which requires a higher faculty,\na faculty which must be assisted and developed by teaching. Yet if base\nmusic gives certain of us wings, why should we want any other? But we\ndo. We want it because the higher and better like it. We want it without\ngiving it the necessary time and trouble; so we climb into that upper\ntier, that dress-circle, by a lie; we PRETEND we like it. I know several\nof that sort of people--and I propose to be one of them myself when I\nget home with my fine European education.\n\nAnd then there is painting. What a red rag is to a bull, Turner's \"Slave\nShip\" was to me, before I studied art. Mr. Ruskin is educated in art\nup to a point where that picture throws him into as mad an ecstasy of\npleasure as it used to throw me into one of rage, last year, when I was\nignorant. His cultivation enables him--and me, now--to see water in that\nglaring yellow mud, and natural effects in those lurid explosions\nof mixed smoke and flame, and crimson sunset glories; it reconciles\nhim--and me, now--to the floating of iron cable-chains and other\nunfloatable things; it reconciles us to fishes swimming around on top\nof the mud--I mean the water. The most of the picture is a manifest\nimpossibility--that is to say, a lie; and only rigid cultivation can\nenable a man to find truth in a lie. But it enabled Mr. Ruskin to do\nit, and it has enabled me to do it, and I am thankful for it. A Boston\nnewspaper reporter went and took a look at the Slave Ship floundering\nabout in that fierce conflagration of reds and yellows, and said it\nreminded him of a tortoise-shell cat having a fit in a platter\nof tomatoes. In my then uneducated state, that went home to my\nnon-cultivation, and I thought here is a man with an unobstructed eye.\nMr. Ruskin would have said: This person is an ass. That is what I would\nsay, now.\n\nMonths after this was written, I happened into the National Gallery in\nLondon, and soon became so fascinated with the Turner pictures that I\ncould hardly get away from the place. I went there often, afterward,\nmeaning to see the rest of the gallery, but the Turner spell was too\nstrong; it could not be shaken off. However, the Turners which attracted\nme most did not remind me of the Slave Ship.\n\nHowever, our business in Baden-Baden this time, was to join our courier.\nI had thought it best to hire one, as we should be in Italy, by and by,\nand we did not know the language. Neither did he. We found him at the\nhotel, ready to take charge of us. I asked him if he was \"all fixed.\" He\nsaid he was. That was very true. He had a trunk, two small satchels,\nand an umbrella. I was to pay him fifty-five dollars a month and railway\nfares. On the continent the railway fare on a trunk is about the same\nit is on a man. Couriers do not have to pay any board and lodging. This\nseems a great saving to the tourist--at first. It does not occur to the\ntourist that SOMEBODY pays that man's board and lodging. It occurs to\nhim by and by, however, in one of his lucid moments.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n[Hunted by the Little Chamois]\n\n\n\nNext morning we left in the train for Switzerland, and reached Lucerne\nabout ten o'clock at night. The first discovery I made was that the\nbeauty of the lake had not been exaggerated. Within a day or two I made\nanother discovery. This was, that the lauded chamois is not a wild goat;\nthat it is not a horned animal; that it is not shy; that it does not\navoid human society; and that there is no peril in hunting it.\n\n\n\nThe chamois is a black or brown creature no bigger than a mustard seed;\nyou do not have to go after it, it comes after you; it arrives in vast\nherds and skips and scampers all over your body, inside your clothes;\nthus it is not shy, but extremely sociable; it is not afraid of man, on\nthe contrary, it will attack him; its bite is not dangerous, but neither\nis it pleasant; its activity has not been overstated --if you try to put\nyour finger on it, it will skip a thousand times its own length at one\njump, and no eye is sharp enough to see where it lights. A great deal\nof romantic nonsense has been written about the Swiss chamois and the\nperils of hunting it, whereas the truth is that even women and children\nhunt it, and fearlessly; indeed, everybody hunts it; the hunting is\ngoing on all the time, day and night, in bed and out of it. It is poetic\nfoolishness to hunt it with a gun; very few people do that; there is\nnot one man in a million who can hit it with a gun. It is much easier to\ncatch it than it is to shoot it, and only the experienced chamois-hunter\ncan do either. Another common piece of exaggeration is that about the\n\"scarcity\" of the chamois. It is the reverse of scarce. Droves of one\nhundred million chamois are not unusual in the Swiss hotels. Indeed,\nthey are so numerous as to be a great pest. The romancers always dress\nup the chamois-hunter in a fanciful and picturesque costume, whereas the\nbest way to hunt this game is to do it without any costume at all.\n\n\n\nThe article of commerce called chamois-skin is another fraud; nobody\ncould skin a chamois, it is too small. The creature is a humbug in\nevery way, and everything which has been written about it is sentimental\nexaggeration. It was no pleasure to me to find the chamois out, for he\nhad been one of my pet illusions; all my life it had been my dream to\nsee him in his native wilds some day, and engage in the adventurous\nsport of chasing him from cliff to cliff. It is no pleasure to me to\nexpose him, now, and destroy the reader's delight in him and respect for\nhim, but still it must be done, for when an honest writer discovers an\nimposition it is his simple duty to strip it bare and hurl it down from\nits place of honor, no matter who suffers by it; any other course would\nrender him unworthy of the public confidence.\n\nLucerne is a charming place. It begins at the water's edge, with a\nfringe of hotels, and scrambles up and spreads itself over two or three\nsharp hills in a crowded, disorderly, but picturesque way, offering\nto the eye a heaped-up confusion of red roofs, quaint gables, dormer\nwindows, toothpick steeples, with here and there a bit of ancient\nembattled wall bending itself over the ridges, worm-fashion, and here\nand there an old square tower of heavy masonry. And also here and there\na town clock with only one hand--a hand which stretches across the dial\nand has no joint in it; such a clock helps out the picture, but you\ncannot tell the time of day by it. Between the curving line of hotels\nand the lake is a broad avenue with lamps and a double rank of low shade\ntrees. The lake-front is walled with masonry like a pier, and has\na railing, to keep people from walking overboard. All day long the\nvehicles dash along the avenue, and nurses, children, and tourists sit\nin the shade of the trees, or lean on the railing and watch the schools\nof fishes darting about in the clear water, or gaze out over the lake\nat the stately border of snow-hooded mountain peaks. Little pleasure\nsteamers, black with people, are coming and going all the time; and\neverywhere one sees young girls and young men paddling about in fanciful\nrowboats, or skimming along by the help of sails when there is any wind.\nThe front rooms of the hotels have little railed balconies, where one\nmay take his private luncheon in calm, cool comfort and look down upon\nthis busy and pretty scene and enjoy it without having to do any of the\nwork connected with it.\n\nMost of the people, both male and female, are in walking costume, and\ncarry alpenstocks. Evidently, it is not considered safe to go about in\nSwitzerland, even in town, without an alpenstock. If the tourist forgets\nand comes down to breakfast without his alpenstock he goes back and gets\nit, and stands it up in the corner. When his touring in Switzerland is\nfinished, he does not throw that broomstick away, but lugs it home\nwith him, to the far corners of the earth, although this costs him\nmore trouble and bother than a baby or a courier could. You see, the\nalpenstock is his trophy; his name is burned upon it; and if he has\nclimbed a hill, or jumped a brook, or traversed a brickyard with it, he\nhas the names of those places burned upon it, too.\n\n\n\nThus it is his regimental flag, so to speak, and bears the record of his\nachievements. It is worth three francs when he buys it, but a bonanza\ncould not purchase it after his great deeds have been inscribed upon it.\nThere are artisans all about Switzerland whose trade it is to burn\nthese things upon the alpenstock of the tourist. And observe, a man is\nrespected in Switzerland according to his alpenstock. I found I could\nget no attention there, while I carried an unbranded one. However,\nbranding is not expected, so I soon remedied that. The effect upon\nthe next detachment of tourists was very marked. I felt repaid for my\ntrouble.\n\nHalf of the summer horde in Switzerland is made up of English people;\nthe other half is made up of many nationalities, the Germans leading and\nthe Americans coming next. The Americans were not as numerous as I had\nexpected they would be.\n\nThe seven-thirty table d'h\u00f4te at the great Schweitzerhof furnished\na mighty array and variety of nationalities, but it offered a better\nopportunity to observe costumes than people, for the multitude sat\nat immensely long tables, and therefore the faces were mainly seen in\nperspective; but the breakfasts were served at small round tables,\nand then if one had the fortune to get a table in the midst of the\nassemblage he could have as many faces to study as he could desire.\nWe used to try to guess out the nationalities, and generally succeeded\ntolerably well. Sometimes we tried to guess people's names; but that\nwas a failure; that is a thing which probably requires a good deal of\npractice. We presently dropped it and gave our efforts to less difficult\nparticulars. One morning I said:\n\n\"There is an American party.\"\n\nHarris said:\n\n\"Yes--but name the state.\"\n\nI named one state, Harris named another. We agreed upon one thing,\nhowever--that the young girl with the party was very beautiful, and\nvery tastefully dressed. But we disagreed as to her age. I said she was\neighteen, Harris said she was twenty. The dispute between us waxed warm,\nand I finally said, with a pretense of being in earnest:\n\n\"Well, there is one way to settle the matter--I will go and ask her.\"\n\n\n\nHarris said, sarcastically, \"Certainly, that is the thing to do. All you\nneed to do is to use the common formula over here: go and say, 'I'm an\nAmerican!' Of course she will be glad to see you.\"\n\nThen he hinted that perhaps there was no great danger of my venturing to\nspeak to her.\n\nI said, \"I was only talking--I didn't intend to approach her, but I see\nthat you do not know what an intrepid person I am. I am not afraid of\nany woman that walks. I will go and speak to this young girl.\"\n\nThe thing I had in my mind was not difficult. I meant to address her\nin the most respectful way and ask her to pardon me if her strong\nresemblance to a former acquaintance of mine was deceiving me; and when\nshe should reply that the name I mentioned was not the name she bore, I\nmeant to beg pardon again, most respectfully, and retire. There would be\nno harm done. I walked to her table, bowed to the gentleman, then turned\nto her and was about to begin my little speech when she exclaimed:\n\n\"I KNEW I wasn't mistaken--I told John it was you! John said it probably\nwasn't, but I knew I was right. I said you would recognize me presently\nand come over; and I'm glad you did, for I shouldn't have felt much\nflattered if you had gone out of this room without recognizing me.\nSit down, sit down--how odd it is--you are the last person I was ever\nexpecting to see again.\"\n\n\n\nThis was a stupefying surprise. It took my wits clear away, for an\ninstant. However, we shook hands cordially all around, and I sat down.\nBut truly this was the tightest place I ever was in. I seemed to vaguely\nremember the girl's face, now, but I had no idea where I had seen it\nbefore, or what name belonged with it. I immediately tried to get up a\ndiversion about Swiss scenery, to keep her from launching into topics\nthat might betray that I did not know her, but it was of no use, she\nwent right along upon matters which interested her more:\n\n\"Oh dear, what a night that was, when the sea washed the forward boats\naway--do you remember it?\"\n\n\"Oh, DON'T I!\" said I--but I didn't. I wished the sea had washed the\nrudder and the smoke-stack and the captain away--then I could have\nlocated this questioner.\n\n\"And don't you remember how frightened poor Mary was, and how she\ncried?\"\n\n\"Indeed I do!\" said I. \"Dear me, how it all comes back!\"\n\nI fervently wished it WOULD come back--but my memory was a blank. The\nwise way would have been to frankly own up; but I could not bring myself\nto do that, after the young girl had praised me so for recognizing her;\nso I went on, deeper and deeper into the mire, hoping for a chance clue\nbut never getting one. The Unrecognizable continued, with vivacity:\n\n\"Do you know, George married Mary, after all?\"\n\n\"Why, no! Did he?\"\n\n\"Indeed he did. He said he did not believe she was half as much to blame\nas her father was, and I thought he was right. Didn't you?\"\n\n\"Of course he was. It was a perfectly plain case. I always said so.\"\n\n\"Why, no you didn't!--at least that summer.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not that summer. No, you are perfectly right about that. It was\nthe following winter that I said it.\"\n\n\"Well, as it turned out, Mary was not in the least to blame --it was all\nher father's fault--at least his and old Darley's.\"\n\nIt was necessary to say something--so I said:\n\n\"I always regarded Darley as a troublesome old thing.\"\n\n\"So he was, but then they always had a great affection for him, although\nhe had so many eccentricities. You remember that when the weather was\nthe least cold, he would try to come into the house.\"\n\nI was rather afraid to proceed. Evidently Darley was not a man--he\nmust be some other kind of animal--possibly a dog, maybe an elephant.\nHowever, tails are common to all animals, so I ventured to say:\n\n\"And what a tail he had!\"\n\n\"ONE! He had a thousand!\"\n\nThis was bewildering. I did not quite know what to say, so I only said:\n\n\"Yes, he WAS rather well fixed in the matter of tails.\"\n\n\"For a negro, and a crazy one at that, I should say he was,\" said she.\n\nIt was getting pretty sultry for me. I said to myself, \"Is it possible\nshe is going to stop there, and wait for me to speak? If she does, the\nconversation is blocked. A negro with a thousand tails is a topic which\na person cannot talk upon fluently and instructively without more or\nless preparation. As to diving rashly into such a vast subject--\"\n\nBut here, to my gratitude, she interrupted my thoughts by saying:\n\n\"Yes, when it came to tales of his crazy woes, there was simply no\nend to them if anybody would listen. His own quarters were comfortable\nenough, but when the weather was cold, the family were sure to have his\ncompany--nothing could keep him out of the house. But they always bore\nit kindly because he had saved Tom's life, years before. You remember\nTom?\n\n\"Oh, perfectly. Fine fellow he was, too.\"\n\n\"Yes he was. And what a pretty little thing his child was!\"\n\n\"You may well say that. I never saw a prettier child.\"\n\n\"I used to delight to pet it and dandle it and play with it.\"\n\n\"So did I.\"\n\n\"You named it. What WAS that name? I can't call it to mind.\"\n\nIt appeared to me that the ice was getting pretty thin, here. I would\nhave given something to know what the child's was. However, I had the\ngood luck to think of a name that would fit either sex--so I brought it\nout:\n\n\"I named it Frances.\"\n\n\"From a relative, I suppose? But you named the one that died, too--one\nthat I never saw. What did you call that one?\"\n\nI was out of neutral names, but as the child was dead and she had\nnever seen it, I thought I might risk a name for it and trust to luck.\nTherefore I said:\n\n\"I called that one Thomas Henry.\"\n\nShe said, musingly:\n\n\"That is very singular ... very singular.\"\n\nI sat still and let the cold sweat run down. I was in a good deal of\ntrouble, but I believed I could worry through if she wouldn't ask me\nto name any more children. I wondered where the lightning was going to\nstrike next. She was still ruminating over that last child's title, but\npresently she said:\n\n\"I have always been sorry you were away at the time--I would have had\nyou name my child.\"\n\n\"YOUR child! Are you married?\"\n\n\"I have been married thirteen years.\"\n\n\"Christened, you mean.\"\n\n`\"No, married. The youth by your side is my son.\"\n\n\"It seems incredible--even impossible. I do not mean any harm by it, but\nwould you mind telling me if you are any over eighteen?--that is to say,\nwill you tell me how old you are?\"\n\n\"I was just nineteen the day of the storm we were talking about. That\nwas my birthday.\"\n\nThat did not help matters, much, as I did not know the date of the\nstorm. I tried to think of some non-committal thing to say, to keep up\nmy end of the talk, and render my poverty in the matter of reminiscences\nas little noticeable as possible, but I seemed to be about out of\nnon-committal things. I was about to say, \"You haven't changed a bit\nsince then\"--but that was risky. I thought of saying, \"You have improved\never so much since then\"--but that wouldn't answer, of course. I was\nabout to try a shy at the weather, for a saving change, when the girl\nslipped in ahead of me and said:\n\n\"How I have enjoyed this talk over those happy old times--haven't you?\"\n\n\"I never have spent such a half-hour in all my life before!\" said I,\nwith emotion; and I could have added, with a near approach to truth,\n\"and I would rather be scalped than spend another one like it.\" I was\nholily grateful to be through with the ordeal, and was about to make my\ngood-bys and get out, when the girl said:\n\n\"But there is one thing that is ever so puzzling to me.\"\n\n\"Why, what is that?\"\n\n\"That dead child's name. What did you say it was?\"\n\nHere was another balmy place to be in: I had forgotten the child's name;\nI hadn't imagined it would be needed again. However, I had to pretend to\nknow, anyway, so I said:\n\n\"Joseph William.\"\n\nThe youth at my side corrected me, and said:\n\n\"No, Thomas Henry.\"\n\nI thanked him--in words--and said, with trepidation:\n\n\"O yes--I was thinking of another child that I named--I have named\na great many, and I get them confused--this one was named Henry\nThompson--\"\n\n\"Thomas Henry,\" calmly interposed the boy.\n\nI thanked him again--strictly in words--and stammered out:\n\n\"Thomas Henry--yes, Thomas Henry was the poor child's name. I named\nhim for Thomas--er--Thomas Carlyle, the great author, you know--and\nHenry--er--er--Henry the Eighth. The parents were very grateful to have\na child named Thomas Henry.\"\n\n\"That makes it more singular than ever,\" murmured my beautiful friend.\n\n\"Does it? Why?\"\n\n\"Because when the parents speak of that child now, they always call it\nSusan Amelia.\"\n\nThat spiked my gun. I could not say anything. I was entirely out of\nverbal obliquities; to go further would be to lie, and that I would not\ndo; so I simply sat still and suffered--sat mutely and resignedly there,\nand sizzled--for I was being slowly fried to death in my own blushes.\nPresently the enemy laughed a happy laugh and said:\n\n\"I HAVE enjoyed this talk over old times, but you have not. I saw very\nsoon that you were only pretending to know me, and so as I had wasted a\ncompliment on you in the beginning, I made up my mind to punish you. And\nI have succeeded pretty well. I was glad to see that you knew George and\nTom and Darley, for I had never heard of them before and therefore could\nnot be sure that you had; and I was glad to learn the names of those\nimaginary children, too. One can get quite a fund of information out\nof you if one goes at it cleverly. Mary and the storm, and the sweeping\naway of the forward boats, were facts--all the rest was fiction. Mary\nwas my sister; her full name was Mary ------. NOW do you remember me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I do remember you now; and you are as hard-headed as you\nwere thirteen years ago in that ship, else you wouldn't have punished me\nso. You haven't changed your nature nor your person, in any way at all;\nyou look as young as you did then, you are just as beautiful as you were\nthen, and you have transmitted a deal of your comeliness to this fine\nboy. There--if that speech moves you any, let's fly the flag of truce,\nwith the understanding that I am conquered and confess it.\"\n\nAll of which was agreed to and accomplished, on the spot. When I went\nback to Harris, I said:\n\n\"Now you see what a person with talent and address can do.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, I see what a person of colossal ignorance and simplicity can\ndo. The idea of your going and intruding on a party of strangers, that\nway, and talking for half an hour; why I never heard of a man in his\nright mind doing such a thing before. What did you say to them?\"\n\n\n\n\"I never said any harm. I merely asked the girl what her name was.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt it. Upon my word I don't. I think you were capable of it.\nIt was stupid in me to let you go over there and make such an exhibition\nof yourself. But you know I couldn't really believe you would do such an\ninexcusable thing. What will those people think of us? But how did you\nsay it?--I mean the manner of it. I hope you were not abrupt.\"\n\n\"No, I was careful about that. I said, 'My friend and I would like to\nknow what your name is, if you don't mind.'\"\n\n\"No, that was not abrupt. There is a polish about it that does you\ninfinite credit. And I am glad you put me in; that was a delicate\nattention which I appreciate at its full value. What did she do?\"\n\n\"She didn't do anything in particular. She told me her name.\"\n\n\"Simply told you her name. Do you mean to say she did not show any\nsurprise?\"\n\n\"Well, now I come to think, she did show something; maybe it was\nsurprise; I hadn't thought of that--I took it for gratification.\"\n\n\"Oh, undoubtedly you were right; it must have been gratification; it\ncould not be otherwise than gratifying to be assaulted by a stranger\nwith such a question as that. Then what did you do?\"\n\n\"I offered my hand and the party gave me a shake.\"\n\n\"I saw it! I did not believe my own eyes, at the time. Did the gentleman\nsay anything about cutting your throat?\"\n\n\"No, they all seemed glad to see me, as far as I could judge.\"\n\n\"And do you know, I believe they were. I think they said to themselves,\n'Doubtless this curiosity has got away from his keeper--let us amuse\nourselves with him.' There is no other way of accounting for their\nfacile docility. You sat down. Did they ASK you to sit down?\"\n\n\"No, they did not ask me, but I suppose they did not think of it.\"\n\n\"You have an unerring instinct. What else did you do? What did you talk\nabout?\"\n\n\"Well, I asked the girl how old she was.\"\n\n\"UNdoubtedly. Your delicacy is beyond praise. Go on, go on--don't mind\nmy apparent misery--I always look so when I am steeped in a profound and\nreverent joy. Go on--she told you her age?\"\n\n\"Yes, she told me her age, and all about her mother, and her\ngrandmother, and her other relations, and all about herself.\"\n\n\"Did she volunteer these statistics?\"\n\n\"No, not exactly that. I asked the questions and she answered them.\"\n\n\"This is divine. Go on--it is not possible that you forgot to inquire\ninto her politics?\"\n\n\"No, I thought of that. She is a democrat, her husband is a republican,\nand both of them are Baptists.\"\n\n\"Her husband? Is that child married?\"\n\n\"She is not a child. She is married, and that is her husband who is\nthere with her.\"\n\n\"Has she any children.\"\n\n\"Yes--seven and a half.\"\n\n\"That is impossible.\"\n\n\"No, she has them. She told me herself.\"\n\n\"Well, but seven and a HALF? How do you make out the half? Where does\nthe half come in?\"\n\n\"There is a child which she had by another husband--not this one\nbut another one--so it is a stepchild, and they do not count in full\nmeasure.\"\n\n\"Another husband? Has she another husband?\"\n\n\"Yes, four. This one is number four.\"\n\n\"I don't believe a word of it. It is impossible, upon its face. Is that\nboy there her brother?\"\n\n\"No, that is her son. He is her youngest. He is not as old as he looked;\nhe is only eleven and a half.\"\n\n\"These things are all manifestly impossible. This is a wretched\nbusiness. It is a plain case: they simply took your measure, and\nconcluded to fill you up. They seem to have succeeded. I am glad I am\nnot in the mess; they may at least be charitable enough to think there\nain't a pair of us. Are they going to stay here long?\"\n\n\"No, they leave before noon.\"\n\n\"There is one man who is deeply grateful for that. How did you find out?\nYou asked, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, along at first I inquired into their plans, in a general way, and\nthey said they were going to be here a week, and make trips round about;\nbut toward the end of the interview, when I said you and I would tour\naround with them with pleasure, and offered to bring you over and\nintroduce you, they hesitated a little, and asked if you were from the\nsame establishment that I was. I said you were, and then they said they\nhad changed their mind and considered it necessary to start at once and\nvisit a sick relative in Siberia.\"\n\n\"Ah, me, you struck the summit! You struck the loftiest altitude of\nstupidity that human effort has ever reached. You shall have a monument\nof jackasses' skulls as high as the Strasburg spire if you die before\nI do. They wanted to know I was from the same 'establishment' that you\nhailed from, did they? What did they mean by 'establishment'?\"\n\n\"I don't know; it never occurred to me to ask.\"\n\n\"Well I know. They meant an asylum--an IDIOT asylum, do you understand?\nSo they DO think there's a pair of us, after all. Now what do you think\nof yourself?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know. I didn't know I was doing any harm; I didn't MEAN\nto do any harm. They were very nice people, and they seemed to like me.\"\n\nHarris made some rude remarks and left for his bedroom--to break some\nfurniture, he said. He was a singularly irascible man; any little thing\nwould disturb his temper.\n\nI had been well scorched by the young woman, but no matter, I took it\nout on Harris. One should always \"get even\" in some way, else the sore\nplace will go on hurting.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n[The Nest of the Cuckoo-clock]\n\n\nThe Hofkirche is celebrated for its organ concerts. All summer long the\ntourists flock to that church about six o'clock in the evening, and pay\ntheir franc, and listen to the noise. They don't stay to hear all of\nit, but get up and tramp out over the sounding stone floor, meeting late\ncomers who tramp in in a sounding and vigorous way. This tramping\nback and forth is kept up nearly all the time, and is accented by\nthe continuous slamming of the door, and the coughing and barking and\nsneezing of the crowd. Meantime, the big organ is booming and crashing\nand thundering away, doing its best to prove that it is the biggest and\nbest organ in Europe, and that a tight little box of a church is the\nmost favorable place to average and appreciate its powers in. It is\ntrue, there were some soft and merciful passages occasionally, but the\ntramp-tramp of the tourists only allowed one to get fitful glimpses of\nthem, so to speak. Then right away the organist would let go another\navalanche.\n\nThe commerce of Lucerne consists mainly in gimcrackery of the souvenir\nsort; the shops are packed with Alpine crystals, photographs of\nscenery, and wooden and ivory carvings. I will not conceal the fact that\nminiature figures of the Lion of Lucerne are to be had in them. Millions\nof them. But they are libels upon him, every one of them. There is a\nsubtle something about the majestic pathos of the original which the\ncopyist cannot get. Even the sun fails to get it; both the photographer\nand the carver give you a dying lion, and that is all. The shape is\nright, the attitude is right, the proportions are right, but that\nindescribable something which makes the Lion of Lucerne the most\nmournful and moving piece of stone in the world, is wanting.\n\nThe Lion lies in his lair in the perpendicular face of a low cliff--for\nhe is carved from the living rock of the cliff. His size is colossal,\nhis attitude is noble. His head is bowed, the broken spear is sticking\nin his shoulder, his protecting paw rests upon the lilies of France.\nVines hang down the cliff and wave in the wind, and a clear stream\ntrickles from above and empties into a pond at the base, and in the\nsmooth surface of the pond the lion is mirrored, among the water-lilies.\n\n\n\nAround about are green trees and grass. The place is a sheltered,\nreposeful woodland nook, remote from noise and stir and confusion--and\nall this is fitting, for lions do die in such places, and not on granite\npedestals in public squares fenced with fancy iron railings. The Lion of\nLucerne would be impressive anywhere, but nowhere so impressive as where\nhe is.\n\nMartyrdom is the luckiest fate that can befall some people. Louis XVI\ndid not die in his bed, consequently history is very gentle with him;\nshe is charitable toward his failings, and she finds in him high virtues\nwhich are not usually considered to be virtues when they are lodged in\nkings. She makes him out to be a person with a meek and modest spirit,\nthe heart of a female saint, and a wrong head. None of these qualities\nare kingly but the last. Taken together they make a character which\nwould have fared harshly at the hands of history if its owner had had\nthe ill luck to miss martyrdom. With the best intentions to do the right\nthing, he always managed to do the wrong one. Moreover, nothing could\nget the female saint out of him. He knew, well enough, that in national\nemergencies he must not consider how he ought to act, as a man, but how\nhe ought to act as a king; so he honestly tried to sink the man and be\nthe king--but it was a failure, he only succeeded in being the female\nsaint. He was not instant in season, but out of season. He could not be\npersuaded to do a thing while it could do any good--he was iron, he was\nadamant in his stubbornness then--but as soon as the thing had reached a\npoint where it would be positively harmful to do it, do it he would, and\nnothing could stop him. He did not do it because it would be harmful,\nbut because he hoped it was not yet too late to achieve by it the good\nwhich it would have done if applied earlier. His comprehension was\nalways a train or two behindhand. If a national toe required amputating,\nhe could not see that it needed anything more than poulticing; when\nothers saw that the mortification had reached the knee, he first\nperceived that the toe needed cutting off--so he cut it off; and he\nsevered the leg at the knee when others saw that the disease had reached\nthe thigh. He was good, and honest, and well meaning, in the matter of\nchasing national diseases, but he never could overtake one. As a private\nman, he would have been lovable; but viewed as a king, he was strictly\ncontemptible.\n\nHis was a most unroyal career, but the most pitiable spectacle in it was\nhis sentimental treachery to his Swiss guard on that memorable 10th of\nAugust, when he allowed those heroes to be massacred in his cause, and\nforbade them to shed the \"sacred French blood\" purporting to be flowing\nin the veins of the red-capped mob of miscreants that was raging around\nthe palace. He meant to be kingly, but he was only the female saint once\nmore. Some of his biographers think that upon this occasion the spirit\nof Saint Louis had descended upon him. It must have found pretty cramped\nquarters. If Napoleon the First had stood in the shoes of Louis XVI that\nday, instead of being merely a casual and unknown looker-on, there would\nbe no Lion of Lucerne, now, but there would be a well-stocked Communist\ngraveyard in Paris which would answer just as well to remember the 10th\nof August by.\n\nMartyrdom made a saint of Mary Queen of Scots three hundred years ago,\nand she has hardly lost all of her saintship yet. Martyrdom made a saint\nof the trivial and foolish Marie Antoinette, and her biographers\nstill keep her fragrant with the odor of sanctity to this day, while\nunconsciously proving upon almost every page they write that the only\ncalamitous instinct which her husband lacked, she supplied--the instinct\nto root out and get rid of an honest, able, and loyal official, wherever\nshe found him. The hideous but beneficent French Revolution would have\nbeen deferred, or would have fallen short of completeness, or even\nmight not have happened at all, if Marie Antoinette had made the unwise\nmistake of not being born. The world owes a great deal to the French\nRevolution, and consequently to its two chief promoters, Louis the Poor\nin Spirit and his queen.\n\nWe did not buy any wooden images of the Lion, nor any ivory or ebony\nor marble or chalk or sugar or chocolate ones, or even any photographic\nslanders of him. The truth is, these copies were so common, so\nuniversal, in the shops and everywhere, that they presently became as\nintolerable to the wearied eye as the latest popular melody usually\nbecomes to the harassed ear. In Lucerne, too, the wood carvings of\nother sorts, which had been so pleasant to look upon when one saw them\noccasionally at home, soon began to fatigue us. We grew very tired\nof seeing wooden quails and chickens picking and strutting around\nclock-faces, and still more tired of seeing wooden images of the alleged\nchamois skipping about wooden rocks, or lying upon them in family\ngroups, or peering alertly up from behind them. The first day, I would\nhave bought a hundred and fifty of these clocks if I had the money--and\nI did buy three--but on the third day the disease had run its course,\nI had convalesced, and was in the market once more--trying to sell.\nHowever, I had no luck; which was just as well, for the things will be\npretty enough, no doubt, when I get them home.\n\nFor years my pet aversion had been the cuckoo clock; now here I was, at\nlast, right in the creature's home; so wherever I went that distressing\n\"HOO'hoo! HOO'hoo! HOO'hoo!\" was always in my ears. For a nervous man,\nthis was a fine state of things. Some sounds are hatefuler than others,\nbut no sound is quite so inane, and silly, and aggravating as the\n\"HOO'hoo\" of a cuckoo clock, I think. I bought one, and am carrying it\nhome to a certain person; for I have always said that if the opportunity\never happened, I would do that man an ill turn.\n\n\n\nWhat I meant, was, that I would break one of his legs, or something of\nthat sort; but in Lucerne I instantly saw that I could impair his mind.\nThat would be more lasting, and more satisfactory every way. So I bought\nthe cuckoo clock; and if I ever get home with it, he is \"my meat,\" as\nthey say in the mines. I thought of another candidate--a book-reviewer\nwhom I could name if I wanted to--but after thinking it over, I didn't\nbuy him a clock. I couldn't injure his mind.\n\nWe visited the two long, covered wooden bridges which span the green and\nbrilliant Reuss just below where it goes plunging and hurrahing out\nof the lake. These rambling, sway-backed tunnels are very attractive\nthings, with their alcoved outlooks upon the lovely and inspiriting\nwater. They contain two or three hundred queer old pictures, by old\nSwiss masters--old boss sign-painters, who flourished before the\ndecadence of art.\n\nThe lake is alive with fishes, plainly visible to the eye, for the water\nis very clear. The parapets in front of the hotels were usually fringed\nwith fishers of all ages. One day I thought I would stop and see a\nfish caught. The result brought back to my mind, very forcibly, a\ncircumstance which I had not thought of before for twelve years. This\none:\n\nTHE MAN WHO PUT UP AT GADSBY'S\n\nWhen my odd friend Riley and I were newspaper correspondents in\nWashington, in the winter of '67, we were coming down Pennsylvania\nAvenue one night, near midnight, in a driving storm of snow, when the\nflash of a street-lamp fell upon a man who was eagerly tearing along in\nthe opposite direction. \"This is lucky! You are Mr. Riley, ain't you?\"\n\nRiley was the most self-possessed and solemnly deliberate person in the\nrepublic. He stopped, looked his man over from head to foot, and finally\nsaid:\n\n\"I am Mr. Riley. Did you happen to be looking for me?\"\n\n\"That's just what I was doing,\" said the man, joyously, \"and it's the\nbiggest luck in the world that I've found you. My name is Lykins. I'm\none of the teachers of the high school--San Francisco. As soon as I\nheard the San Francisco postmastership was vacant, I made up my mind to\nget it--and here I am.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Riley, slowly, \"as you have remarked ... Mr. Lykins ... here\nyou are. And have you got it?\"\n\n\"Well, not exactly GOT it, but the next thing to it. I've brought a\npetition, signed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and all\nthe teachers, and by more than two hundred other people. Now I want you,\nif you'll be so good, to go around with me to the Pacific delegation,\nfor I want to rush this thing through and get along home.\"\n\n\"If the matter is so pressing, you will prefer that we visit the\ndelegation tonight,\" said Riley, in a voice which had nothing mocking in\nit--to an unaccustomed ear.\n\n\"Oh, tonight, by all means! I haven't got any time to fool around. I\nwant their promise before I go to bed--I ain't the talking kind, I'm the\nDOING kind!\"\n\n\"Yes ... you've come to the right place for that. When did you arrive?\"\n\n\"Just an hour ago.\"\n\n\"When are you intending to leave?\"\n\n\"For New York tomorrow evening--for San Francisco next morning.\"\n\n\"Just so.... What are you going to do tomorrow?\"\n\n\"DO! Why, I've got to go to the President with the petition and the\ndelegation, and get the appointment, haven't I?\"\n\n\"Yes ... very true ... that is correct. And then what?\"\n\n\"Executive session of the Senate at 2 P.M.--got to get the appointment\nconfirmed--I reckon you'll grant that?\"\n\n\"Yes ... yes,\" said Riley, meditatively, \"you are right again. Then\nyou take the train for New York in the evening, and the steamer for San\nFrancisco next morning?\"\n\n\"That's it--that's the way I map it out!\"\n\nRiley considered a while, and then said:\n\n\"You couldn't stay ... a day ... well, say two days longer?\"\n\n\"Bless your soul, no! It's not my style. I ain't a man to go fooling\naround--I'm a man that DOES things, I tell you.\"\n\nThe storm was raging, the thick snow blowing in gusts. Riley stood\nsilent, apparently deep in a reverie, during a minute or more, then he\nlooked up and said:\n\n\"Have you ever heard about that man who put up at Gadsby's, once? ...\nBut I see you haven't.\"\n\nHe backed Mr. Lykins against an iron fence, buttonholed him, fastened\nhim with his eye, like the Ancient Mariner, and proceeded to unfold\nhis narrative as placidly and peacefully as if we were all stretched\ncomfortably in a blossomy summer meadow instead of being persecuted by a\nwintry midnight tempest:\n\n\n\n\"I will tell you about that man. It was in Jackson's time. Gadsby's was\nthe principal hotel, then. Well, this man arrived from Tennessee\nabout nine o'clock, one morning, with a black coachman and a splendid\nfour-horse carriage and an elegant dog, which he was evidently fond\nof and proud of; he drove up before Gadsby's, and the clerk and the\nlandlord and everybody rushed out to take charge of him, but he said,\n'Never mind,' and jumped out and told the coachman to wait--\n\n\n\nsaid he hadn't time to take anything to eat, he only had a little claim\nagainst the government to collect, would run across the way, to\nthe Treasury, and fetch the money, and then get right along back to\nTennessee, for he was in considerable of a hurry.\n\n\"Well, about eleven o'clock that night he came back and ordered a bed\nand told them to put the horses up--said he would collect the claim in\nthe morning. This was in January, you understand--January, 1834--the 3d\nof January--Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\"Well, on the 5th of February, he sold the fine carriage, and bought\na cheap second-hand one--said it would answer just as well to take the\nmoney home in, and he didn't care for style.\n\n\"On the 11th of August he sold a pair of the fine horses--said he'd\noften thought a pair was better than four, to go over the rough mountain\nroads with where a body had to be careful about his driving--and there\nwasn't so much of his claim but he could lug the money home with a pair\neasy enough.\n\n\n\n\"On the 13th of December he sold another horse--said two warn't\nnecessary to drag that old light vehicle with--in fact, one could snatch\nit along faster than was absolutely necessary, now that it was good\nsolid winter weather and the roads in splendid condition.\n\n\n\n\"On the 17th of February, 1835, he sold the old carriage and bought a\ncheap second-hand buggy--said a buggy was just the trick to skim along\nmushy, slushy early spring roads with, and he had always wanted to try a\nbuggy on those mountain roads, anyway.\n\n\n\n\"On the 1st August he sold the buggy and bought the remains of an old\nsulky--said he just wanted to see those green Tennesseans stare and gawk\nwhen they saw him come a-ripping along in a sulky--didn't believe they'd\never heard of a sulky in their lives.\n\n\n\n\"Well, on the 29th of August he sold his colored coachman--said he\ndidn't need a coachman for a sulky--wouldn't be room enough for two in\nit anyway--and, besides, it wasn't every day that Providence sent a man\na fool who was willing to pay nine hundred dollars for such a third-rate\nnegro as that--been wanting to get rid of the creature for years, but\ndidn't like to THROW him away.\n\n\n\n\"Eighteen months later--that is to say, on the 15th of February,\n1837--he sold the sulky and bought a saddle--said horseback-riding was\nwhat the doctor had always recommended HIM to take, and dog'd if he\nwanted to risk HIS neck going over those mountain roads on wheels in the\ndead of winter, not if he knew himself.\n\n\n\n\"On the 9th of April he sold the saddle--said he wasn't going to risk\nHIS life with any perishable saddle-girth that ever was made, over a\nrainy, miry April road, while he could ride bareback and know and feel\nhe was safe--always HAD despised to ride on a saddle, anyway.\n\n\n\n\"On the 24th of April he sold his horse--said 'I'm just fifty-seven\ntoday, hale and hearty--it would be a PRETTY howdy-do for me to be\nwasting such a trip as that and such weather as this, on a horse, when\nthere ain't anything in the world so splendid as a tramp on foot through\nthe fresh spring woods and over the cheery mountains, to a man that IS\na man--and I can make my dog carry my claim in a little bundle, anyway,\nwhen it's collected. So tomorrow I'll be up bright and early, make my\nlittle old collection, and mosey off to Tennessee, on my own hind legs,\nwith a rousing good-by to Gadsby's.'\n\n\n\n\"On the 22d of June he sold his dog--said 'Dern a dog, anyway, where\nyou're just starting off on a rattling bully pleasure tramp through the\nsummer woods and hills--perfect nuisance--chases the squirrels, barks\nat everything, goes a-capering and splattering around in the fords--man\ncan't get any chance to reflect and enjoy nature--and I'd a blamed sight\nruther carry the claim myself, it's a mighty sight safer; a dog's\nmighty uncertain in a financial way--always noticed it--well, GOOD-by,\nboys--last call--I'm off for Tennessee with a good leg and a gay heart,\nearly in the morning.'\"\n\n\n\nThere was a pause and a silence--except the noise of the wind and the\npelting snow. Mr. Lykins said, impatiently:\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nRiley said:\n\n\"Well,--that was thirty years ago.\"\n\n\"Very well, very well--what of it?\"\n\n\"I'm great friends with that old patriarch. He comes every evening to\ntell me good-by. I saw him an hour ago--he's off for Tennessee early\ntomorrow morning--as usual; said he calculated to get his claim through\nand be off before night-owls like me have turned out of bed. The tears\nwere in his eyes, he was so glad he was going to see his old Tennessee\nand his friends once more.\"\n\nAnother silent pause. The stranger broke it:\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"That is all.\"\n\n\"Well, for the TIME of night, and the KIND of night, it seems to me the\nstory was full long enough. But what's it all FOR?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing in particular.\"\n\n\"Well, where's the point of it?\"\n\n\"Oh, there isn't any particular point to it. Only, if you are not in\nTOO much of a hurry to rush off to San Francisco with that post-office\nappointment, Mr. Lykins, I'd advise you to 'PUT UP AT GADSBY'S' for a\nspell, and take it easy. Good-by. GOD bless you!\"\n\nSo saying, Riley blandly turned on his heel and left the astonished\nschool-teacher standing there, a musing and motionless snow image\nshining in the broad glow of the street-lamp.\n\nHe never got that post-office.\n\nTo go back to Lucerne and its fishers, I concluded, after about\nnine hours' waiting, that the man who proposes to tarry till he sees\nsomething hook one of those well-fed and experienced fishes will find\nit wisdom to \"put up at Gadsby's\" and take it easy. It is likely that\na fish has not been caught on that lake pier for forty years; but no\nmatter, the patient fisher watches his cork there all the day long, just\nthe same, and seems to enjoy it. One may see the fisher-loafers just as\nthick and contented and happy and patient all along the Seine at Paris,\nbut tradition says that the only thing ever caught there in modern times\nis a thing they don't fish for at all--the recent dog and the translated\ncat.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n[I Spare an Awful Bore]\n\n\nClose by the Lion of Lucerne is what they call the \"Glacier Garden\"--and\nit is the only one in the world. It is on high ground. Four or five\nyears ago, some workmen who were digging foundations for a house came\nupon this interesting relic of a long-departed age. Scientific men\nperceived in it a confirmation of their theories concerning the glacial\nperiod; so through their persuasions the little tract of ground was\nbought and permanently protected against being built upon. The soil was\nremoved, and there lay the rasped and guttered track which the ancient\nglacier had made as it moved along upon its slow and tedious journey.\nThis track was perforated by huge pot-shaped holes in the bed-rock,\nformed by the furious washing-around in them of boulders by the\nturbulent torrent which flows beneath all glaciers. These huge round\nboulders still remain in the holes; they and the walls of the holes are\nworn smooth by the long-continued chafing which they gave each other in\nthose old days.\n\n\n\nIt took a mighty force to churn these big lumps of stone around in that\nvigorous way. The neighboring country had a very different shape, at\nthat time--the valleys have risen up and become hills, since, and the\nhills have become valleys. The boulders discovered in the pots had\ntraveled a great distance, for there is no rock like them nearer than\nthe distant Rhone Glacier.\n\nFor some days we were content to enjoy looking at the blue lake\nLucerne and at the piled-up masses of snow-mountains that border it all\naround--an enticing spectacle, this last, for there is a strange and\nfascinating beauty and charm about a majestic snow-peak with the sun\nblazing upon it or the moonlight softly enriching it--but finally we\nconcluded to try a bit of excursioning around on a steamboat, and a dash\non foot at the Rigi. Very well, we had a delightful trip to Fluelen, on\na breezy, sunny day. Everybody sat on the upper deck, on benches, under\nan awning; everybody talked, laughed, and exclaimed at the wonderful\nscenery; in truth, a trip on that lake is almost the perfection of\npleasuring.\n\n\n\nThe mountains were a never-ceasing marvel. Sometimes they rose straight\nup out of the lake, and towered aloft and overshadowed our pygmy steamer\nwith their prodigious bulk in the most impressive way. Not snow-clad\nmountains, these, yet they climbed high enough toward the sky to meet\nthe clouds and veil their foreheads in them. They were not barren and\nrepulsive, but clothed in green, and restful and pleasant to the eye.\nAnd they were so almost straight-up-and-down, sometimes, that one could\nnot imagine a man being able to keep his footing upon such a surface,\nyet there are paths, and the Swiss people go up and down them every day.\n\n\n\nSometimes one of these monster precipices had the slight inclination of\nthe huge ship-houses in dockyards--then high aloft, toward the sky, it\ntook a little stronger inclination, like that of a mansard roof--and\nperched on this dizzy mansard one's eye detected little things like\nmartin boxes, and presently perceived that these were the dwellings of\npeasants--an airy place for a home, truly. And suppose a peasant should\nwalk in his sleep, or his child should fall out of the front\nyard?--the friends would have a tedious long journey down out of those\ncloud-heights before they found the remains. And yet those far-away\nhomes looked ever so seductive, they were so remote from the troubled\nworld, they dozed in such an atmosphere of peace and dreams--surely no\none who has learned to live up there would ever want to live on a meaner\nlevel.\n\nWe swept through the prettiest little curving arms of the lake, among\nthese colossal green walls, enjoying new delights, always, as the\nstately panorama unfolded itself before us and rerolled and hid itself\nbehind us; and now and then we had the thrilling surprise of bursting\nsuddenly upon a tremendous white mass like the distant and dominating\nJungfrau, or some kindred giant, looming head and shoulders above a\ntumbled waste of lesser Alps.\n\nOnce, while I was hungrily taking in one of these surprises, and doing\nmy best to get all I possibly could of it while it should last, I was\ninterrupted by a young and care-free voice:\n\n\"You're an American, I think--so'm I.\"\n\nHe was about eighteen, or possibly nineteen; slender and of medium\nheight; open, frank, happy face; a restless but independent eye; a snub\nnose, which had the air of drawing back with a decent reserve from\nthe silky new-born mustache below it until it should be introduced; a\nloosely hung jaw, calculated to work easily in the sockets. He wore a\nlow-crowned, narrow-brimmed straw hat, with a broad blue ribbon\naround it which had a white anchor embroidered on it in front; nobby\nshort-tailed coat, pantaloons, vest, all trim and neat and up with the\nfashion; red-striped stockings, very low-quarter patent-leather shoes,\ntied with black ribbon; blue ribbon around his neck, wide-open collar;\ntiny diamond studs; wrinkleless kids; projecting cuffs, fastened with\nlarge oxidized silver sleeve-buttons, bearing the device of a dog's\nface--English pug. He carried a slim cane, surmounted with an English\npug's head with red glass eyes. Under his arm he carried a German\ngrammar--Otto's. His hair was short, straight, and smooth, and presently\nwhen he turned his head a moment, I saw that it was nicely parted\nbehind. He took a cigarette out of a dainty box, stuck it into a\nmeerschaum holder which he carried in a morocco case, and reached for my\ncigar. While he was lighting, I said:\n\n\"Yes--I am an American.\"\n\n\n\n\"I knew it--I can always tell them. What ship did you come over in?\"\n\n\"HOLSATIA.\"\n\n\"We came in the BATAVIA--Cunard, you know. What kind of passage did you\nhave?\"\n\n\"Tolerably rough.\"\n\n\"So did we. Captain said he'd hardly ever seen it rougher. Where are you\nfrom?\"\n\n\"New England.\"\n\n\"So'm I. I'm from New Bloomfield. Anybody with you?\"\n\n\"Yes--a friend.\"\n\n\"Our whole family's along. It's awful slow, going around alone--don't\nyou think so?\"\n\n\"Rather slow.\"\n\n\"Ever been over here before?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I haven't. My first trip. But we've been all around--Paris and\neverywhere. I'm to enter Harvard next year. Studying German all the\ntime, now. Can't enter till I know German. I know considerable French--I\nget along pretty well in Paris, or anywhere where they speak French.\nWhat hotel are you stopping at?\"\n\n\"Schweitzerhof.\"\n\n\"No! is that so? I never see you in the reception-room. I go to\nthe reception-room a good deal of the time, because there's so many\nAmericans there. I make lots of acquaintances. I know an American as\nsoon as I see him--and so I speak to him and make his acquaintance. I\nlike to be always making acquaintances--don't you?\"\n\n\"Lord, yes!\"\n\n\"You see it breaks up a trip like this, first rate. I never got bored on\na trip like this, if I can make acquaintances and have somebody to\ntalk to. But I think a trip like this would be an awful bore, if a body\ncouldn't find anybody to get acquainted with and talk to on a trip like\nthis. I'm fond of talking, ain't you?\n\n\"Passionately.\"\n\n\"Have you felt bored, on this trip?\"\n\n\"Not all the time, part of it.\"\n\n\"That's it!--you see you ought to go around and get acquainted, and\ntalk. That's my way. That's the way I always do--I just go 'round,\n'round, 'round and talk, talk, talk--I never get bored. You been up the\nRigi yet?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Going?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"What hotel you going to stop at?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Is there more than one?\"\n\n\"Three. You stop at the Schreiber--you'll find it full of Americans.\nWhat ship did you say you came over in?\"\n\n\"CITY OF ANTWERP.\"\n\n\"German, I guess. You going to Geneva?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What hotel you going to stop at?\"\n\n\"H\u00f4tel de l'\u00c9cu de G\u00e9n\u00e8ve.\"\n\n\"Don't you do it! No Americans there! You stop at one of those big\nhotels over the bridge--they're packed full of Americans.\"\n\n\"But I want to practice my Arabic.\"\n\n\"Good gracious, do you speak Arabic?\"\n\n\"Yes--well enough to get along.\"\n\n\"Why, hang it, you won't get along in Geneva--THEY don't speak Arabic,\nthey speak French. What hotel are you stopping at here?\"\n\n\"Hotel Pension-Beaurivage.\"\n\n\"Sho, you ought to stop at the Schweitzerhof. Didn't you know the\nSchweitzerhof was the best hotel in Switzerland?-- look at your\nBaedeker.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know--but I had an idea there warn't any Americans there.\"\n\n\"No Americans! Why, bless your soul, it's just alive with them! I'm in\nthe great reception-room most all the time. I make lots of acquaintances\nthere. Not as many as I did at first, because now only the new ones stop\nin there--the others go right along through. Where are you from?\"\n\n\"Arkansaw.\"\n\n\"Is that so? I'm from New England--New Bloomfield's my town when I'm at\nhome. I'm having a mighty good time today, ain't you?\"\n\n\"Divine.\"\n\n\"That's what I call it. I like this knocking around, loose and easy, and\nmaking acquaintances and talking. I know an American, soon as I see him;\nso I go and speak to him and make his acquaintance. I ain't ever bored,\non a trip like this, if I can make new acquaintances and talk. I'm awful\nfond of talking when I can get hold of the right kind of a person, ain't\nyou?\"\n\n\"I prefer it to any other dissipation.\"\n\n\"That's my notion, too. Now some people like to take a book and sit\ndown and read, and read, and read, or moon around yawping at the lake or\nthese mountains and things, but that ain't my way; no, sir, if they like\nit, let 'em do it, I don't object; but as for me, talking's what I like.\nYou been up the Rigi?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What hotel did you stop at?\"\n\n\"Schreiber.\"\n\n\"That's the place!--I stopped there too. FULL of Americans, WASN'T it?\nIt always is--always is. That's what they say. Everybody says that. What\nship did you come over in?\"\n\n\"VILLE DE PARIS.\"\n\n\"French, I reckon. What kind of a passage did ... excuse me a minute,\nthere's some Americans I haven't seen before.\"\n\nAnd away he went. He went uninjured, too--I had the murderous impulse to\nharpoon him in the back with my alpenstock, but as I raised the weapon\nthe disposition left me; I found I hadn't the heart to kill him, he was\nsuch a joyous, innocent, good-natured numbskull.\n\nHalf an hour later I was sitting on a bench inspecting, with strong\ninterest, a noble monolith which we were skimming by--a monolith not\nshaped by man, but by Nature's free great hand--a massy pyramidal rock\neighty feet high, devised by Nature ten million years ago against the\nday when a man worthy of it should need it for his monument. The time\ncame at last, and now this grand remembrancer bears Schiller's name in\nhuge letters upon its face. Curiously enough, this rock was not degraded\nor defiled in any way. It is said that two years ago a stranger let\nhimself down from the top of it with ropes and pulleys, and painted all\nover it, in blue letters bigger than those in Schiller's name, these\nwords: \"Try Sozodont;\" \"Buy Sun Stove Polish;\" \"Helmbold's Buchu;\" \"Try\nBenzaline for the Blood.\" He was captured and it turned out that he was\nan American. Upon his trial the judge said to him:\n\n\"You are from a land where any insolent that wants to is privileged\nto profane and insult Nature, and, through her, Nature's God, if by\nso doing he can put a sordid penny in his pocket. But here the case is\ndifferent. Because you are a foreigner and ignorant, I will make your\nsentence light; if you were a native I would deal strenuously with\nyou. Hear and obey: --You will immediately remove every trace of\nyour offensive work from the Schiller monument; you pay a fine of ten\nthousand francs; you will suffer two years' imprisonment at hard labor;\nyou will then be horsewhipped, tarred and feathered, deprived of your\nears, ridden on a rail to the confines of the canton, and banished\nforever. The severest penalties are omitted in your case--not as a grace\nto you, but to that great republic which had the misfortune to give you\nbirth.\"\n\n\n\nThe steamer's benches were ranged back to back across the deck. My back\nhair was mingling innocently with the back hair of a couple of\nladies. Presently they were addressed by some one and I overheard this\nconversation:\n\n\"You are Americans, I think? So'm I.\"\n\n\"Yes--we are Americans.\"\n\n\"I knew it--I can always tell them. What ship did you come over in?\"\n\n\"CITY OF CHESTER.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--Inman line. We came in the BATAVIA--Cunard you know. What kind\nof a passage did you have?\"\n\n\"Pretty fair.\"\n\n\"That was luck. We had it awful rough. Captain said he'd hardly seen it\nrougher. Where are you from?\"\n\n\"New Jersey.\"\n\n\"So'm I. No--I didn't mean that; I'm from New England. New Bloomfield's\nmy place. These your children?--belong to both of you?\"\n\n\"Only to one of us; they are mine; my friend is not married.\"\n\n\"Single, I reckon? So'm I. Are you two ladies traveling alone?\"\n\n\"No--my husband is with us.\"\n\n\"Our whole family's along. It's awful slow, going around alone--don't\nyou think so?\"\n\n\"I suppose it must be.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hi, there's Mount Pilatus coming in sight again. Named after Pontius\nPilate, you know, that shot the apple off of William Tell's head.\nGuide-book tells all about it, they say. I didn't read it--an American\ntold me. I don't read when I'm knocking around like this, having a good\ntime. Did you ever see the chapel where William Tell used to preach?\"\n\n\"I did not know he ever preached there.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, he did. That American told me so. He don't ever shut up\nhis guide-book. He knows more about this lake than the fishes in it.\nBesides, they CALL it 'Tell's Chapel'--you know that yourself. You ever\nbeen over here before?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I haven't. It's my first trip. But we've been all around--Paris and\neverywhere. I'm to enter Harvard next year. Studying German all the time\nnow. Can't enter till I know German. This book's Otto's grammar. It's a\nmighty good book to get the ICH HABE GEHABT HABEN's out of. But I don't\nreally study when I'm knocking around this way. If the notion takes me,\nI just run over my little old ICH HABE GEHABT, DU HAST GEHABT, ER HAT\nGEHABT, WIR HABEN GEHABT, IHR HABEN GEHABT, SIE HABEN GEHABT--kind of\n'Now-I-lay-me-down-to-sleep' fashion, you know, and after that, maybe\nI don't buckle to it for three days. It's awful undermining to the\nintellect, German is; you want to take it in small doses, or first you\nknow your brains all run together, and you feel them sloshing around in\nyour head same as so much drawn butter. But French is different; FRENCH\nain't anything. I ain't any more afraid of French than a tramp's afraid\nof pie; I can rattle off my little J'AI, TU AS, IL A, and the rest of\nit, just as easy as a-b-c. I get along pretty well in Paris, or anywhere\nwhere they speak French. What hotel are you stopping at?\"\n\n\"The Schweitzerhof.\"\n\n\"No! is that so? I never see you in the big reception-room. I go in\nthere a good deal of the time, because there's so many Americans there.\nI make lots of acquaintances. You been up the Rigi yet?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Going?\"\n\n\"We think of it.\"\n\n\"What hotel you going to stop at?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Well, then you stop at the Schreiber--it's full of Americans. What ship\ndid you come over in?\"\n\n\"CITY OF CHESTER.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I remember I asked you that before. But I always ask everybody\nwhat ship they came over in, and so sometimes I forget and ask again.\nYou going to Geneva?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What hotel you going to stop at?\"\n\n\"We expect to stop in a pension.\"\n\n\"I don't hardly believe you'll like that; there's very few Americans in\nthe pensions. What hotel are you stopping at here?\"\n\n\"The Schweitzerhof.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. I asked you that before, too. But I always ask everybody what\nhotel they're stopping at, and so I've got my head all mixed up with\nhotels. But it makes talk, and I love to talk. It refreshes me up\nso--don't it you--on a trip like this?\"\n\n\"Yes--sometimes.\"\n\n\"Well, it does me, too. As long as I'm talking I never feel bored--ain't\nthat the way with you?\"\n\n\"Yes--generally. But there are exception to the rule.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course. I don't care to talk to everybody, MYSELF. If a person\nstarts in to jabber-jabber-jabber about scenery, and history, and\npictures, and all sorts of tiresome things, I get the fan-tods mighty\nsoon. I say 'Well, I must be going now--hope I'll see you again'--and\nthen I take a walk. Where you from?\"\n\n\"New Jersey.\"\n\n\"Why, bother it all, I asked you THAT before, too. Have you seen the\nLion of Lucerne?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"Nor I, either. But the man who told me about Mount Pilatus says it's\none of the things to see. It's twenty-eight feet long. It don't seem\nreasonable, but he said so, anyway. He saw it yesterday; said it was\ndying, then, so I reckon it's dead by this time. But that ain't any\nmatter, of course they'll stuff it. Did you say the children are\nyours--or HERS?\"\n\n\"Mine.\"\n\n\"Oh, so you did. Are you going up the ... no, I asked you that. What\nship ... no, I asked you that, too. What hotel are you ... no, you told\nme that. Let me see ... um .... Oh, what kind of voy ... no, we've\nbeen over that ground, too. Um ... um ... well, I believe that is all.\nBONJOUR--I am very glad to have made your acquaintance, ladies. GUTEN\nTAG.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n[The Jodel and Its Native Wilds]\n\n\nThe Rigi-Kulm is an imposing Alpine mass, six thousand feet high, which\nstands by itself, and commands a mighty prospect of blue lakes, green\nvalleys, and snowy mountains--a compact and magnificent picture\nthree hundred miles in circumference. The ascent is made by rail, or\nhorseback, or on foot, as one may prefer. I and my agent panoplied\nourselves in walking-costume, one bright morning, and started down\nthe lake on the steamboat; we got ashore at the village of Waeggis;\nthree-quarters of an hour distant from Lucerne. This village is at the\nfoot of the mountain.\n\nWe were soon tramping leisurely up the leafy mule-path, and then the\ntalk began to flow, as usual. It was twelve o'clock noon, and a breezy,\ncloudless day; the ascent was gradual, and the glimpses, from under\nthe curtaining boughs, of blue water, and tiny sailboats, and beetling\ncliffs, were as charming as glimpses of dreamland. All the circumstances\nwere perfect--and the anticipations, too, for we should soon be\nenjoying, for the first time, that wonderful spectacle, an Alpine\nsunrise--the object of our journey. There was (apparently) no real need\nfor hurry, for the guide-book made the walking-distance from Waeggis to\nthe summit only three hours and a quarter. I say \"apparently,\" because\nthe guide-book had already fooled us once--about the distance from\nAllerheiligen to Oppenau--and for aught I knew it might be getting\nready to fool us again. We were only certain as to the altitudes--we\ncalculated to find out for ourselves how many hours it is from the\nbottom to the top. The summit is six thousand feet above the sea, but\nonly forty-five hundred feet above the lake. When we had walked half an\nhour, we were fairly into the swing and humor of the undertaking, so we\ncleared for action; that is to say, we got a boy whom we met to carry\nour alpenstocks and satchels and overcoats and things for us; that left\nus free for business. I suppose we must have stopped oftener to stretch\nout on the grass in the shade and take a bit of a smoke than this boy\nwas used to, for presently he asked if it had been our idea to hire him\nby the job, or by the year? We told him he could move along if he was\nin a hurry. He said he wasn't in such a very particular hurry, but he\nwanted to get to the top while he was young.\n\n\n\nWe told him to clear out, then, and leave the things at the uppermost\nhotel and say we should be along presently. He said he would secure us a\nhotel if he could, but if they were all full he would ask them to build\nanother one and hurry up and get the paint and plaster dry against we\narrived. Still gently chaffing us, he pushed ahead, up the trail, and\nsoon disappeared. By six o'clock we were pretty high up in the air,\nand the view of lake and mountains had greatly grown in breadth and\ninterest. We halted awhile at a little public house, where we had bread\nand cheese and a quart or two of fresh milk, out on the porch, with the\nbig panorama all before us--and then moved on again.\n\n\n\nTen minutes afterward we met a hot, red-faced man plunging down the\nmountain, making mighty strides, swinging his alpenstock ahead of him,\nand taking a grip on the ground with its iron point to support these\nbig strides. He stopped, fanned himself with his hat, swabbed the\nperspiration from his face and neck with a red handkerchief, panted\na moment or two, and asked how far to Waeggis. I said three hours. He\nlooked surprised, and said:\n\n\"Why, it seems as if I could toss a biscuit into the lake from here,\nit's so close by. Is that an inn, there?\"\n\nI said it was.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I can't stand another three hours, I've had enough\ntoday; I'll take a bed there.\"\n\nI asked:\n\n\"Are we nearly to the top?\"\n\n\"Nearly to the TOP? Why, bless your soul, you haven't really started,\nyet.\"\n\nI said we would put up at the inn, too. So we turned back and ordered a\nhot supper, and had quite a jolly evening of it with this Englishman.\n\nThe German landlady gave us neat rooms and nice beds, and when I and my\nagent turned in, it was with the resolution to be up early and make the\nutmost of our first Alpine sunrise. But of course we were dead tired,\nand slept like policemen; so when we awoke in the morning and ran to the\nwindow it was already too late, because it was half past eleven. It\nwas a sharp disappointment. However, we ordered breakfast and told the\nlandlady to call the Englishman, but she said he was already up and off\nat daybreak--and swearing like mad about something or other. We could\nnot find out what the matter was. He had asked the landlady the altitude\nof her place above the level of the lake, and she told him fourteen\nhundred and ninety-five feet. That was all that was said; then he lost\nhis temper. He said that between ------fools and guide-books, a man\ncould acquire ignorance enough in twenty-four hours in a country like\nthis to last him a year. Harris believed our boy had been loading him\nup with misinformation; and this was probably the case, for his epithet\ndescribed that boy to a dot.\n\nWe got under way about the turn of noon, and pulled out for the summit\nagain, with a fresh and vigorous step. When we had gone about two\nhundred yards, and stopped to rest, I glanced to the left while I was\nlighting my pipe, and in the distance detected a long worm of black\nsmoke crawling lazily up the steep mountain. Of course that was the\nlocomotive. We propped ourselves on our elbows at once, to gaze, for we\nhad never seen a mountain railway yet. Presently we could make out the\ntrain. It seemed incredible that that thing should creep straight up a\nsharp slant like the roof of a house--but there it was, and it was doing\nthat very miracle.\n\nIn the course of a couple hours we reached a fine breezy altitude where\nthe little shepherd huts had big stones all over their roofs to hold\nthem down to the earth when the great storms rage. The country was wild\nand rocky about here, but there were plenty of trees, plenty of moss,\nand grass.\n\nAway off on the opposite shore of the lake we could see some villages,\nand now for the first time we could observe the real difference between\ntheir proportions and those of the giant mountains at whose feet they\nslept. When one is in one of those villages it seems spacious, and\nits houses seem high and not out of proportion to the mountain that\noverhangs them--but from our altitude, what a change! The mountains were\nbigger and grander than ever, as they stood there thinking their solemn\nthoughts with their heads in the drifting clouds, but the villages\nat their feet--when the painstaking eye could trace them up and find\nthem--were so reduced, almost invisible, and lay so flat against the\nground, that the exactest simile I can devise is to compare them to\nant-deposits of granulated dirt overshadowed by the huge bulk of a\ncathedral. The steamboats skimming along under the stupendous precipices\nwere diminished by distance to the daintiest little toys, the sailboats\nand rowboats to shallops proper for fairies that keep house in the cups\nof lilies and ride to court on the backs of bumblebees.\n\n\n\nPresently we came upon half a dozen sheep nibbling grass in the spray\nof a stream of clear water that sprang from a rock wall a hundred feet\nhigh, and all at once our ears were startled with a melodious \"Lul ...\nl ... l l l llul-lul-LAhee-o-o-o!\" pealing joyously from a near but\ninvisible source, and recognized that we were hearing for the first\ntime the famous Alpine JODEL in its own native wilds. And we recognized,\nalso, that it was that sort of quaint commingling of baritone and\nfalsetto which at home we call \"Tyrolese warbling.\"\n\n\n\nThe jodeling (pronounced yOdling--emphasis on the O) continued, and\nwas very pleasant and inspiriting to hear. Now the jodeler appeared--a\nshepherd boy of sixteen--and in our gladness and gratitude we gave him\na franc to jodel some more. So he jodeled and we listened. We moved\non, presently, and he generously jodeled us out of sight. After about\nfifteen minutes we came across another shepherd boy who was jodeling,\nand gave him half a franc to keep it up. He also jodeled us out of\nsight. After that, we found a jodeler every ten minutes; we gave the\nfirst one eight cents, the second one six cents, the third one four, the\nfourth one a penny, contributed nothing to Nos. 5, 6, and 7, and during\nthe remainder of the day hired the rest of the jodelers, at a franc\napiece, not to jodel any more. There is somewhat too much of the\njodeling in the Alps.\n\nAbout the middle of the afternoon we passed through a prodigious natural\ngateway called the Felsenthor, formed by two enormous upright rocks,\nwith a third lying across the top. There was a very attractive little\nhotel close by, but our energies were not conquered yet, so we went on.\n\n\n\nThree hours afterward we came to the railway-track. It was planted\nstraight up the mountain with the slant of a ladder that leans against a\nhouse, and it seemed to us that man would need good nerves who proposed\nto travel up it or down it either.\n\nDuring the latter part of the afternoon we cooled our roasting interiors\nwith ice-cold water from clear streams, the only really satisfying water\nwe had tasted since we left home, for at the hotels on the continent\nthey merely give you a tumbler of ice to soak your water in, and that\nonly modifies its hotness, doesn't make it cold. Water can only be made\ncold enough for summer comfort by being prepared in a refrigerator or\na closed ice-pitcher. Europeans say ice-water impairs digestion. How do\nthey know?--they never drink any.\n\nAt ten minutes past six we reached the Kaltbad station, where there is\na spacious hotel with great verandas which command a majestic expanse of\nlake and mountain scenery. We were pretty well fagged out, now, but as\nwe did not wish to miss the Alpine sunrise, we got through our dinner\nas quickly as possible and hurried off to bed. It was unspeakably\ncomfortable to stretch our weary limbs between the cool, damp sheets.\nAnd how we did sleep!--for there is no opiate like Alpine pedestrianism.\n\n\n\nIn the morning we both awoke and leaped out of bed at the same instant\nand ran and stripped aside the window-curtains; but we suffered a bitter\ndisappointment again: it was already half past three in the afternoon.\n\nWe dressed sullenly and in ill spirits, each accusing the other of\noversleeping. Harris said if we had brought the courier along, as we\nought to have done, we should not have missed these sunrises. I said he\nknew very well that one of us would have to sit up and wake the\ncourier; and I added that we were having trouble enough to take care\nof ourselves, on this climb, without having to take care of a courier\nbesides.\n\nDuring breakfast our spirits came up a little, since we found by this\nguide-book that in the hotels on the summit the tourist is not left to\ntrust to luck for his sunrise, but is roused betimes by a man who goes\nthrough the halls with a great Alpine horn, blowing blasts that would\nraise the dead. And there was another consoling thing: the guide-book\nsaid that up there on the summit the guests did not wait to dress much,\nbut seized a red bed blanket and sailed out arrayed like an Indian. This\nwas good; this would be romantic; two hundred and fifty people grouped\non the windy summit, with their hair flying and their red blankets\nflapping, in the solemn presence of the coming sun, would be a striking\nand memorable spectacle. So it was good luck, not ill luck, that we had\nmissed those other sunrises.\n\nWe were informed by the guide-book that we were now 3,228 feet above\nthe level of the lake--therefore full two-thirds of our journey had been\naccomplished. We got away at a quarter past four P.M.; a hundred yards\nabove the hotel the railway divided; one track went straight up the\nsteep hill, the other one turned square off to the right, with a very\nslight grade. We took the latter, and followed it more than a mile,\nturned a rocky corner, and came in sight of a handsome new hotel. If we\nhad gone on, we should have arrived at the summit, but Harris\npreferred to ask a lot of questions--as usual, of a man who didn't know\nanything--and he told us to go back and follow the other route. We did\nso. We could ill afford this loss of time.\n\nWe climbed and climbed; and we kept on climbing; we reached about forty\nsummits, but there was always another one just ahead. It came on to\nrain, and it rained in dead earnest. We were soaked through and it\nwas bitter cold. Next a smoky fog of clouds covered the whole region\ndensely, and we took to the railway-ties to keep from getting lost.\nSometimes we slopped along in a narrow path on the left-hand side of the\ntrack, but by and by when the fog blew aside a little and we saw that we\nwere treading the rampart of a precipice and that our left elbows were\nprojecting over a perfectly boundless and bottomless vacancy, we gasped,\nand jumped for the ties again.\n\n\n\nThe night shut down, dark and drizzly and cold. About eight in the\nevening the fog lifted and showed us a well-worn path which led up a\nvery steep rise to the left. We took it, and as soon as we had got far\nenough from the railway to render the finding it again an impossibility,\nthe fog shut down on us once more.\n\nWe were in a bleak, unsheltered place, now, and had to trudge right\nalong, in order to keep warm, though we rather expected to go over a\nprecipice, sooner or later. About nine o'clock we made an important\ndiscovery--that we were not in any path. We groped around a while on our\nhands and knees, but we could not find it; so we sat down in the mud and\nthe wet scant grass to wait.\n\nWe were terrified into this by being suddenly confronted with a vast\nbody which showed itself vaguely for an instant and in the next instant\nwas smothered in the fog again. It was really the hotel we were after,\nmonstrously magnified by the fog, but we took it for the face of a\nprecipice, and decided not to try to claw up it.\n\nWe sat there an hour, with chattering teeth and quivering bodies, and\nquarreled over all sorts of trifles, but gave most of our attention to\nabusing each other for the stupidity of deserting the railway-track. We\nsat with our backs to the precipice, because what little wind there was\ncame from that quarter. At some time or other the fog thinned a little;\nwe did not know when, for we were facing the empty universe and the\nthinness could not show; but at last Harris happened to look around, and\nthere stood a huge, dim, spectral hotel where the precipice had been.\nOne could faintly discern the windows and chimneys, and a dull blur of\nlights. Our first emotion was deep, unutterable gratitude, our next was\na foolish rage, born of the suspicion that possibly the hotel had been\nvisible three-quarters of an hour while we sat there in those cold\npuddles quarreling.\n\n\n\nYes, it was the Rigi-Kulm hotel--the one that occupies the extreme\nsummit, and whose remote little sparkle of lights we had often seen\nglinting high aloft among the stars from our balcony away down yonder\nin Lucerne. The crusty portier and the crusty clerks gave us the\nsurly reception which their kind deal out in prosperous times, but by\nmollifying them with an extra display of obsequiousness and servility\nwe finally got them to show us to the room which our boy had engaged for\nus.\n\nWe got into some dry clothing, and while our supper was preparing we\nloafed forsakenly through a couple of vast cavernous drawing-rooms,\none of which had a stove in it. This stove was in a corner, and densely\nwalled around with people. We could not get near the fire, so we moved\nat large in the artic spaces, among a multitude of people who sat\nsilent, smileless, forlorn, and shivering--thinking what fools they were\nto come, perhaps. There were some Americans and some Germans, but one\ncould see that the great majority were English.\n\nWe lounged into an apartment where there was a great crowd, to see\nwhat was going on. It was a memento-magazine. The tourists were eagerly\nbuying all sorts and styles of paper-cutters, marked \"Souvenir of the\nRigi,\" with handles made of the little curved horn of the ostensible\nchamois; there were all manner of wooden goblets and such things,\nsimilarly marked. I was going to buy a paper-cutter, but I believed\nI could remember the cold comfort of the Rigi-Kulm without it, so I\nsmothered the impulse.\n\nSupper warmed us, and we went immediately to bed--but first, as Mr.\nBaedeker requests all tourists to call his attention to any errors which\nthey may find in his guide-books, I dropped him a line to inform him he\nmissed it by just about three days. I had previously informed him of his\nmistake about the distance from Allerheiligen to Oppenau, and had also\ninformed the Ordnance Depart of the German government of the same error\nin the imperial maps. I will add, here, that I never got any answer to\nthose letters, or any thanks from either of those sources; and, what is\nstill more discourteous, these corrections have not been made, either in\nthe maps or the guide-books. But I will write again when I get time, for\nmy letters may have miscarried.\n\nWe curled up in the clammy beds, and went to sleep without rocking. We\nwere so sodden with fatigue that we never stirred nor turned over till\nthe blooming blasts of the Alpine horn aroused us.\n\n\n\nIt may well be imagined that we did not lose any time. We snatched on\na few odds and ends of clothing, cocooned ourselves in the proper red\nblankets, and plunged along the halls and out into the whistling wind\nbareheaded. We saw a tall wooden scaffolding on the very peak of the\nsummit, a hundred yards away, and made for it. We rushed up the stairs\nto the top of this scaffolding, and stood there, above the vast outlying\nworld, with hair flying and ruddy blankets waving and cracking in the\nfierce breeze.\n\n\n\n\"Fifteen minutes too late, at last!\" said Harris, in a vexed voice. \"The\nsun is clear above the horizon.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" I said, \"it is a most magnificent spectacle, and we will\nsee it do the rest of its rising anyway.\"\n\nIn a moment we were deeply absorbed in the marvel before us, and dead to\neverything else. The great cloud-barred disk of the sun stood just above\na limitless expanse of tossing white-caps--so to speak--a billowy chaos\nof massy mountain domes and peaks draped in imperishable snow, and\nflooded with an opaline glory of changing and dissolving splendors,\nwhile through rifts in a black cloud-bank above the sun, radiating\nlances of diamond dust shot to the zenith. The cloven valleys of the\nlower world swam in a tinted mist which veiled the ruggedness of their\ncrags and ribs and ragged forests, and turned all the forbidding region\ninto a soft and rich and sensuous paradise.\n\nWe could not speak. We could hardly breathe. We could only gaze in\ndrunken ecstasy and drink in it. Presently Harris exclaimed:\n\n\"Why--nation, it's going DOWN!\"\n\nPerfectly true. We had missed the MORNING hornblow, and slept all day.\nThis was stupefying.\n\nHarris said:\n\n\"Look here, the sun isn't the spectacle--it's US--stacked up here on top\nof this gallows, in these idiotic blankets, and two hundred and fifty\nwell-dressed men and women down here gawking up at us and not caring\na straw whether the sun rises or sets, as long as they've got such a\nridiculous spectacle as this to set down in their memorandum-books. They\nseem to be laughing their ribs loose, and there's one girl there that\nappears to be going all to pieces. I never saw such a man as you before.\nI think you are the very last possibility in the way of an ass.\"\n\n\"What have I done?\" I answered, with heat.\n\n\"What have you done? You've got up at half past seven o'clock in the\nevening to see the sun rise, that's what you've done.\"\n\n\"And have you done any better, I'd like to know? I've always used to\nget up with the lark, till I came under the petrifying influence of your\nturgid intellect.\"\n\n\"YOU used to get up with the lark--Oh, no doubt--you'll get up with the\nhangman one of these days. But you ought to be ashamed to be jawing\nhere like this, in a red blanket, on a forty-foot scaffold on top of the\nAlps. And no end of people down here to boot; this isn't any place for\nan exhibition of temper.\"\n\nAnd so the customary quarrel went on. When the sun was fairly down, we\nslipped back to the hotel in the charitable gloaming, and went to bed\nagain. We had encountered the horn-blower on the way, and he had tried\nto collect compensation, not only for announcing the sunset, which we\ndid see, but for the sunrise, which we had totally missed; but we said\nno, we only took our solar rations on the \"European plan\"--pay for what\nyou get. He promised to make us hear his horn in the morning, if we were\nalive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's A Tramp Abroad, by Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)\n\n\n\n"}

It was his\n     original intention to permit no publication of his memoirs until\n     after his death; but, after leaving \"Pier No. 70,\" he concluded\n     that a considerable portion might now suitably be given to the\n     public. It is that portion, garnered from the quarter-million of\n     words already written, which will appear in this REVIEW during the\n     coming year. No part of the autobiography will be published in book\n     form during the lifetime of the author.--EDITOR N. A. R.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nI intend that this autobiography shall become a model for all future\nautobiographies when it is published, after my death, and I also intend\nthat it shall be read and admired a good many centuries because of its\nform and method--a form and method whereby the past and the present are\nconstantly brought face to face, resulting in contrasts which newly fire\nup the interest all along, like contact of flint with steel. Moreover,\nthis autobiography of mine does not select from my life its showy\nepisodes, but deals mainly in the common experiences which go to make up\nthe life of the average human being, because these episodes are of a\nsort which he is familiar with in his own life, and in which he sees his\nown life reflected and set down in print. The usual, conventional\nautobiographer seems to particularly hunt out those occasions in his\ncareer when he came into contact with celebrated persons, whereas his\ncontacts with the uncelebrated were just as interesting to him, and\nwould be to his reader, and were vastly more numerous than his\ncollisions with the famous.\n\nHowells was here yesterday afternoon, and I told him the whole scheme of\nthis autobiography and its apparently systemless system--only apparently\nsystemless, for it is not really that. It is a deliberate system, and\nthe law of the system is that I shall talk about the matter which for\nthe moment interests me, and cast it aside and talk about something else\nthe moment its interest for me is exhausted. It is a system which\nfollows no charted course and is not going to follow any such course. It\nis a system which is a complete and purposed jumble--a course which\nbegins nowhere, follows no specified route, and can never reach an end\nwhile I am alive, for the reason that, if I should talk to the\nstenographer two hours a day for a hundred years, I should still never\nbe able to set down a tenth part of the things which have interested me\nin my lifetime. I told Howells that this autobiography of mine would\nlive a couple of thousand years, without any effort, and would then take\na fresh start and live the rest of the time.\n\nHe said he believed it would, and asked me if I meant to make a library\nof it.\n\nI said that that was my design; but that, if I should live long enough,\nthe set of volumes could not be contained merely in a city, it would\nrequire a State, and that there would not be any multi-billionaire\nalive, perhaps, at any time during its existence who would be able to\nbuy a full set, except on the instalment plan.\n\nHowells applauded, and was full of praises and endorsement, which was\nwise in him and judicious. If he had manifested a different spirit, I\nwould have thrown him out of the window. I like criticism, but it must\nbe my way.\n\n\nI.\n\nBack of the Virginia Clemenses is a dim procession of ancestors\nstretching back to Noah's time. According to tradition, some of them\nwere pirates and slavers in Elizabeth's time. But this is no discredit\nto them, for so were Drake and Hawkins and the others. It was a\nrespectable trade, then, and monarchs were partners in it. In my time I\nhave had desires to be a pirate myself. The reader--if he will look deep\ndown in his secret heart, will find--but never mind what he will find\nthere; I am not writing his Autobiography, but mine. Later, according to\ntradition, one of the procession was Ambassador to Spain in the time of\nJames I, or of Charles I, and married there and sent down a strain of\nSpanish blood to warm us up. Also, according to tradition, this one or\nanother--Geoffrey Clement, by name--helped to sentence Charles to death.\n\nI have not examined into these traditions myself, partly because I was\nindolent, and partly because I was so busy polishing up this end of the\nline and trying to make it showy; but the other Clemenses claim that\nthey have made the examination and that it stood the test. Therefore I\nhave always taken for granted that I did help Charles out of his\ntroubles, by ancestral proxy. My instincts have persuaded me, too.\nWhenever we have a strong and persistent and ineradicable instinct, we\nmay be sure that it is not original with us, but inherited--inherited\nfrom away back, and hardened and perfected by the petrifying influence\nof time. Now I have been always and unchangingly bitter against Charles,\nand I am quite certain that this feeling trickled down to me through the\nveins of my forebears from the heart of that judge; for it is not my\ndisposition to be bitter against people on my own personal account I am\nnot bitter against Jeffreys. I ought to be, but I am not. It indicates\nthat my ancestors of James II's time were indifferent to him; I do not\nknow why; I never could make it out; but that is what it indicates. And\nI have always felt friendly toward Satan. Of course that is ancestral;\nit must be in the blood, for I could not have originated it.\n\n... And so, by the testimony of instinct, backed by the assertions of\nClemenses who said they had examined the records, I have always been\nobliged to believe that Geoffrey Clement the martyr-maker was an\nancestor of mine, and to regard him with favor, and in fact pride. This\nhas not had a good effect upon me, for it has made me vain, and that is\na fault. It has made me set myself above people who were less fortunate\nin their ancestry than I, and has moved me to take them down a peg, upon\noccasion, and say things to them which hurt them before company.\n\nA case of the kind happened in Berlin several years ago. William Walter\nPhelps was our Minister at the Emperor's Court, then, and one evening he\nhad me to dinner to meet Count S., a cabinet minister. This nobleman was\nof long and illustrious descent. Of course I wanted to let out the fact\nthat I had some ancestors, too; but I did not want to pull them out of\ntheir graves by the ears, and I never could seem to get the chance to\nwork them in in a way that would look sufficiently casual. I suppose\nPhelps was in the same difficulty. In fact he looked distraught, now and\nthen--just as a person looks who wants to uncover an ancestor purely by\naccident, and cannot think of a way that will seem accidental enough.\nBut at last, after dinner, he made a try. He took us about his\ndrawing-room, showing us the pictures, and finally stopped before a rude\nand ancient engraving. It was a picture of the court that tried Charles\nI. There was a pyramid of judges in Puritan slouch hats, and below them\nthree bare-headed secretaries seated at a table. Mr. Phelps put his\nfinger upon one of the three, and said with exulting indifference--\n\n\"An ancestor of mine.\"\n\nI put my finger on a judge, and retorted with scathing languidness--\n\n\"Ancestor of mine. But it is a small matter. I have others.\"\n\nIt was not noble in me to do it. I have always regretted it since. But\nit landed him. I wonder how he felt? However, it made no difference in\nour friendship, which shows that he was fine and high, notwithstanding\nthe humbleness of his origin. And it was also creditable in me, too,\nthat I could overlook it. I made no change in my bearing toward him, but\nalways treated him as an equal.\n\nBut it was a hard night for me in one way. Mr. Phelps thought I was the\nguest of honor, and so did Count S.; but I didn't, for there was nothing\nin my invitation to indicate it. It was just a friendly offhand note, on\na card. By the time dinner was announced Phelps was himself in a state\nof doubt. Something had to be done; and it was not a handy time for\nexplanations. He tried to get me to go out with him, but I held back;\nthen he tried S., and he also declined. There was another guest, but\nthere was no trouble about him. We finally went out in a pile. There was\na decorous plunge for seats, and I got the one at Mr. Phelps's left, the\nCount captured the one facing Phelps, and the other guest had to take\nthe place of honor, since he could not help himself. We returned to the\ndrawing-room in the original disorder. I had new shoes on, and they were\ntight. At eleven I was privately crying; I couldn't help it, the pain\nwas so cruel. Conversation had been dead for an hour. S. had been due at\nthe bedside of a dying official ever since half past nine. At last we\nall rose by one blessed impulse and went down to the street door without\nexplanations--in a pile, and no precedence; and so, parted.\n\nThe evening had its defects; still, I got my ancestor in, and was\nsatisfied.\n\nAmong the Virginian Clemenses were Jere. (already mentioned), and\nSherrard. Jere. Clemens had a wide reputation as a good pistol-shot, and\nonce it enabled him to get on the friendly side of some drummers when\nthey wouldn't have paid any attention to mere smooth words and\narguments. He was out stumping the State at the time. The drummers were\ngrouped in front of the stand, and had been hired by the opposition to\ndrum while he made his speech. When he was ready to begin, he got out\nhis revolver and laid it before him, and said in his soft, silky way--\n\n\"I do not wish to hurt anybody, and shall try not to; but I have got\njust a bullet apiece for those six drums, and if you should want to play\non them, don't stand behind them.\"\n\nSherrard Clemens was a Republican Congressman from West Virginia in the\nwar days, and then went out to St. Louis, where the James Clemens branch\nlived, and still lives, and there he became a warm rebel. This was after\nthe war. At the time that he was a Republican I was a rebel; but by the\ntime he had become a rebel I was become (temporarily) a Republican. The\nClemenses have always done the best they could to keep the political\nbalances level, no matter how much it might inconvenience them. I did\nnot know what had become of Sherrard Clemens; but once I introduced\nSenator Hawley to a Republican mass meeting in New England, and then I\ngot a bitter letter from Sherrard from St. Louis. He said that the\nRepublicans of the North--no, the \"mudsills of the North\"--had swept\naway the old aristocracy of the South with fire and sword, and it ill\nbecame me, an aristocrat by blood, to train with that kind of swine. Did\nI forget that I was a Lambton?\n\nThat was a reference to my mother's side of the house. As I have already\nsaid, she was a Lambton--Lambton with a p, for some of the American\nLamptons could not spell very well in early times, and so the name\nsuffered at their hands. She was a native of Kentucky, and married my\nfather in Lexington in 1823, when she was twenty years old and he\ntwenty-four. Neither of them had an overplus of property. She brought\nhim two or three negroes, but nothing else, I think. They removed to the\nremote and secluded village of Jamestown, in the mountain solitudes of\neast Tennessee. There their first crop of children was born, but as I\nwas of a later vintage I do not remember anything about it. I was\npostponed--postponed to Missouri. Missouri was an unknown new State and\nneeded attractions.\n\nI think that my eldest brother, Orion, my sisters Pamela and Margaret,\nand my brother Benjamin were born in Jamestown. There may have been\nothers, but as to that I am not sure. It was a great lift for that\nlittle village to have my parents come there. It was hoped that they\nwould stay, so that it would become a city. It was supposed that they\nwould stay. And so there was a boom; but by and by they went away, and\nprices went down, and it was many years before Jamestown got another\nstart. I have written about Jamestown in the \"Gilded Age,\" a book of\nmine, but it was from hearsay, not from personal knowledge. My father\nleft a fine estate behind him in the region round about\nJamestown--75,000 acres.[2] When he died in 1847 he had owned it about\ntwenty years. The taxes were almost nothing (five dollars a year for the\nwhole), and he had always paid them regularly and kept his title\nperfect. He had always said that the land would not become valuable in\nhis time, but that it would be a commodious provision for his children\nsome day. It contained coal, copper, iron and timber, and he said that\nin the course of time railways would pierce to that region, and then the\nproperty would be property in fact as well as in name. It also produced\na wild grape of a promising sort. He had sent some samples to Nicholas\nLongworth, of Cincinnati, to get his judgment upon them, and Mr.\nLongworth had said that they would make as good wine as his Catawbas.\nThe land contained all these riches; and also oil, but my father did not\nknow that, and of course in those early days he would have cared nothing\nabout it if he had known it. The oil was not discovered until about\n1895. I wish I owned a couple of acres of the land now. In which case I\nwould not be writing Autobiographies for a living. My father's dying\ncharge was, \"Cling to the land and wait; let nothing beguile it away\nfrom you.\" My mother's favorite cousin, James Lampton, who figures in\nthe \"Gilded Age\" as \"Colonel Sellers,\" always said of that land--and\nsaid it with blazing enthusiasm, too,--\"There's millions in\nit--millions!\" It is true that he always said that about everything--and\nwas always mistaken, too; but this time he was right; which shows that a\nman who goes around with a prophecy-gun ought never to get discouraged;\nif he will keep up his heart and fire at everything he sees, he is bound\nto hit something by and by.\n\nMany persons regarded \"Colonel Sellers\" as a fiction, an invention, an\nextravagant impossibility, and did me the honor to call him a\n\"creation\"; but they were mistaken. I merely put him on paper as he was;\nhe was not a person who could be exaggerated. The incidents which looked\nmost extravagant, both in the book and on the stage, were not inventions\nof mine but were facts of his life; and I was present when they were\ndeveloped. John T. Raymond's audiences used to come near to dying with\nlaughter over the turnip-eating scene; but, extravagant as the scene\nwas, it was faithful to the facts, in all its absurd details. The thing\nhappened in Lampton's own house, and I was present. In fact I was myself\nthe guest who ate the turnips. In the hands of a great actor that\npiteous scene would have dimmed any manly spectator's eyes with tears,\nand racked his ribs apart with laughter at the same time. But Raymond\nwas great in humorous portrayal only. In that he was superb, he was\nwonderful--in a word, great; in all things else he was a pigmy of the\npigmies.\n\nThe real Colonel Sellers, as I knew him in James Lampton, was a pathetic\nand beautiful spirit, a manly man, a straight and honorable man, a man\nwith a big, foolish, unselfish heart in his bosom, a man born to be\nloved; and he was loved by all his friends, and by his family\nworshipped. It is the right word. To them he was but little less than a\ngod. The real Colonel Sellers was never on the stage. Only half of him\nwas there. Raymond could not play the other half of him; it was above\nhis level. That half was made up of qualities of which Raymond was\nwholly destitute. For Raymond was not a manly man, he was not an\nhonorable man nor an honest one, he was empty and selfish and vulgar and\nignorant and silly, and there was a vacancy in him where his heart\nshould have been. There was only one man who could have played the whole\nof Colonel Sellers, and that was Frank Mayo.[3]\n\nIt is a world of surprises. They fall, too, where one is least expecting\nthem. When I introduced Sellers into the book, Charles Dudley Warner,\nwho was writing the story with me, proposed a change of Seller's\nChristian name. Ten years before, in a remote corner of the West, he had\ncome across a man named Eschol Sellers, and he thought that Eschol was\njust the right and fitting name for our Sellers, since it was odd and\nquaint and all that. I liked the idea, but I said that that man might\nturn up and object. But Warner said it couldn't happen; that he was\ndoubtless dead by this time, a man with a name like that couldn't live\nlong; and be he dead or alive we must have the name, it was exactly the\nright one and we couldn't do without it. So the change was made.\nWarner's man was a farmer in a cheap and humble way. When the book had\nbeen out a week, a college-bred gentleman of courtly manners and ducal\nupholstery arrived in Hartford in a sultry state of mind and with a\nlibel suit in his eye, and _his_ name was Eschol Sellers! He had never\nheard of the other one, and had never been within a thousand miles of\nhim. This damaged aristocrat's programme was quite definite and\nbusinesslike: the American Publishing Company must suppress the edition\nas far as printed, and change the name in the plates, or stand a suit\nfor $10,000. He carried away the Company's promise and many apologies,\nand we changed the name back to Colonel Mulberry Sellers, in the plates.\nApparently there is nothing that cannot happen. Even the existence of\ntwo unrelated men wearing the impossible name of Eschol Sellers is a\npossible thing.\n\nJames Lampton floated, all his days, in a tinted mist of magnificent\ndreams, and died at last without seeing one of them realized. I saw him\nlast in 1884, when it had been twenty-six years since I ate the basin of\nraw turnips and washed them down with a bucket of water in his house. He\nwas become old and white-headed, but he entered to me in the same old\nbreezy way of his earlier life, and he was all there, yet--not a detail\nwanting: the happy light in his eye, the abounding hope in his heart,\nthe persuasive tongue, the miracle-breeding imagination--they were all\nthere; and before I could turn around he was polishing up his Aladdin's\nlamp and flashing the secret riches of the world before me. I said to\nmyself, \"I did not overdraw him by a shade, I set him down as he was;\nand he is the same man to-day. Cable will recognize him.\" I asked him to\nexcuse me a moment, and ran into the next room, which was Cable's; Cable\nand I were stumping the Union on a reading tour. I said--\n\n\"I am going to leave your door open, so that you can listen. There is a\nman in there who is interesting.\"\n\nI went back and asked Lampton what he was doing now. He began to tell me\nof a \"small venture\" he had begun in New Mexico through his son; \"only a\nlittle thing--a mere trifle--partly to amuse my leisure, partly to keep\nmy capital from lying idle, but mainly to develop the boy--develop the\nboy; fortune's wheel is ever revolving, he may have to work for his\nliving some day--as strange things have happened in this world. But it's\nonly a little thing--a mere trifle, as I said.\"\n\nAnd so it was--as he began it. But under his deft hands it grew, and\nblossomed, and spread--oh, beyond imagination. At the end of half an\nhour he finished; finished with the remark, uttered in an adorably\nlanguid manner:\n\n\"Yes, it is but a trifle, as things go nowadays--a bagatelle--but\namusing. It passes the time. The boy thinks great things of it, but he\nis young, you know, and imaginative; lacks the experience which comes of\nhandling large affairs, and which tempers the fancy and perfects the\njudgment. I suppose there's a couple of millions in it, possibly three,\nbut not more, I think; still, for a boy, you know, just starting in\nlife, it is not bad. I should not want him to make a fortune--let that\ncome later. It could turn his head, at his time of life, and in many\nways be a damage to him.\"\n\nThen he said something about his having left his pocketbook lying on the\ntable in the main drawing-room at home, and about its being after\nbanking hours, now, and--\n\nI stopped him, there, and begged him to honor Cable and me by being our\nguest at the lecture--with as many friends as might be willing to do us\nthe like honor. He accepted. And he thanked me as a prince might who\nhad granted us a grace. The reason I stopped his speech about the\ntickets was because I saw that he was going to ask me to furnish them to\nhim and let him pay next day; and I knew that if he made the debt he\nwould pay it if he had to pawn his clothes. After a little further chat\nhe shook hands heartily and affectionately, and took his leave. Cable\nput his head in at the door, and said--\n\n\"That was Colonel Sellers.\"\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[1] Copyright, 1906, by Harper & Brothers.

I came to New York from\nSan Francisco in the first month of that year and presently Charles H.\nWebb, whom I had known in San Francisco as a reporter on _The Bulletin_,\nand afterward editor of _The Californian_, suggested that I publish a\nvolume of sketches. I had but a slender reputation to publish it on, but\nI was charmed and excited by the suggestion and quite willing to venture\nit if some industrious person would save me the trouble of gathering the\nsketches together. I was loath to do it myself, for from the beginning\nof my sojourn in this world there was a persistent vacancy in me where\nthe industry ought to be. (\"Ought to was\" is better, perhaps, though\nthe most of the authorities differ as to this.)\n\nWebb said I had some reputation in the Atlantic States, but I knew quite\nwell that it must be of a very attenuated sort. What there was of it\nrested upon the story of \"The Jumping Frog.\" When Artemus Ward passed\nthrough California on a lecturing tour, in 1865 or '66, I told him the\n\"Jumping Frog\" story, in San Francisco, and he asked me to write it out\nand send it to his publisher, Carleton, in New York, to be used in\npadding out a small book which Artemus had prepared for the press and\nwhich needed some more stuffing to make it big enough for the price\nwhich was to be charged for it.\n\nIt reached Carleton in time, but he didn't think much of it, and was not\nwilling to go to the typesetting expense of adding it to the book. He\ndid not put it in the waste-basket, but made Henry Clapp a present of\nit, and Clapp used it to help out the funeral of his dying literary\njournal, _The Saturday Press_. \"The Jumping Frog\" appeared in the last\nnumber of that paper, was the most joyous feature of the obsequies, and\nwas at once copied in the newspapers of America and England. It\ncertainly had a wide celebrity, and it still had it at the time that I\nam speaking of--but I was aware that it was only the frog that was\ncelebrated. It wasn't I. I was still an obscurity.\n\nWebb undertook to collate the sketches. He performed this office, then\nhanded the result to me, and I went to Carleton's establishment with it.\nI approached a clerk and he bent eagerly over the counter to inquire\ninto my needs; but when he found that I had come to sell a book and not\nto buy one, his temperature fell sixty degrees, and the old-gold\nintrenchments in the roof of my mouth contracted three-quarters of an\ninch and my teeth fell out. I meekly asked the privilege of a word with\nMr. Carleton, and was coldly informed that he was in his private office.\nDiscouragements and difficulties followed, but after a while I got by\nthe frontier and entered the holy of holies. Ah, now I remember how I\nmanaged it! Webb had made an appointment for me with Carleton; otherwise\nI never should have gotten over that frontier. Carleton rose and said\nbrusquely and aggressively,\n\n\"Well, what can I do for you?\"\n\nI reminded him that I was there by appointment to offer him my book for\npublication. He began to swell, and went on swelling and swelling and\nswelling until he had reached the dimensions of a god of about the\nsecond or third degree. Then the fountains of his great deep were broken\nup, and for two or three minutes I couldn't see him for the rain. It was\nwords, only words, but they fell so densely that they darkened the\natmosphere. Finally he made an imposing sweep with his right hand, which\ncomprehended the whole room and said,\n\n\"Books--look at those shelves! Every one of them is loaded with books\nthat are waiting for publication. Do I want any more? Excuse me, I\ndon't. Good morning.\"\n\nTwenty-one years elapsed before I saw Carleton again. I was then\nsojourning with my family at the Schweitzerhof, in Luzerne. He called on\nme, shook hands cordially, and said at once, without any preliminaries,\n\n\"I am substantially an obscure person, but I have at least one\ndistinction to my credit of such colossal dimensions that it entitles me\nto immortality--to wit: I refused a book of yours, and for this I stand\nwithout competitor as the prize ass of the nineteenth century.\"\n\nIt was a most handsome apology, and I told him so, and said it was a\nlong-delayed revenge but was sweeter to me than any other that could be\ndevised; that during the lapsed twenty-one years I had in fancy taken\nhis life several times every year, and always in new and increasingly\ncruel and inhuman ways, but that now I was pacified, appeased, happy,\neven jubilant; and that thenceforth I should hold him my true and valued\nfriend and never kill him again.\n\nI reported my adventure to Webb, and he bravely said that not all the\nCarletons in the universe should defeat that book; he would publish it\nhimself on a ten per cent. royalty. And so he did. He brought it out in\nblue and gold, and made a very pretty little book of it, I think he\nnamed it \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and Other\nSketches,\" price $1.25. He made the plates and printed and bound the\nbook through a job-printing house, and published it through the American\nNews Company.\n\nIn June I sailed in the _Quaker City_ Excursion. I returned in November,\nand in Washington found a letter from Elisha Bliss, of the American\nPublishing Company of Hartford, offering me five per cent. royalty on a\nbook which should recount the adventures of the Excursion. In lieu of\nthe royalty, I was offered the alternative of ten thousand dollars cash\nupon delivery of the manuscript. I consulted A. D. Richardson and he\nsaid \"take the royalty.\" I followed his advice and closed with Bliss. By\nmy contract I was to deliver the manuscript in July of 1868. I wrote the\nbook in San Francisco and delivered the manuscript within contract time.\nBliss provided a multitude of illustrations for the book, and then\nstopped work on it. The contract date for the issue went by, and there\nwas no explanation of this. Time drifted along and still there was no\nexplanation. I was lecturing all over the country; and about thirty\ntimes a day, on an average, I was trying to answer this conundrum:\n\n\"When is your book coming out?\"\n\nI got tired of inventing new answers to that question, and by and by I\ngot horribly tired of the question itself. Whoever asked it became my\nenemy at once, and I was usually almost eager to make that appear.\n\nAs soon as I was free of the lecture-field I hastened to Hartford to\nmake inquiries. Bliss said that the fault was not his; that he wanted to\npublish the book but the directors of his Company were staid old fossils\nand were afraid of it. They had examined the book, and the majority of\nthem were of the opinion that there were places in it of a humorous\ncharacter. Bliss said the house had never published a book that had a\nsuspicion like that attaching to it, and that the directors were afraid\nthat a departure of this kind would seriously injure the house's\nreputation; that he was tied hand and foot, and was not permitted to\ncarry out his contract. One of the directors, a Mr. Drake--at least he\nwas the remains of what had once been a Mr. Drake--invited me to take a\nride with him in his buggy, and I went along. He was a pathetic old\nrelic, and his ways and his talk were also pathetic. He had a delicate\npurpose in view and it took him some time to hearten himself\nsufficiently to carry it out, but at last he accomplished it. He\nexplained the house's difficulty and distress, as Bliss had already\nexplained it. Then he frankly threw himself and the house upon my mercy\nand begged me to take away \"The Innocents Abroad\" and release the\nconcern from the contract. I said I wouldn't--and so ended the interview\nand the buggy excursion. Then I warned Bliss that he must get to work or\nI should make trouble. He acted upon the warning, and set up the book\nand I read the proofs. Then there was another long wait and no\nexplanation. At last toward the end of July (1869, I think), I lost\npatience and telegraphed Bliss that if the book was not on sale in\ntwenty-four hours I should bring suit for damages.\n\nThat ended the trouble. Half a dozen copies were bound and placed on\nsale within the required time. Then the canvassing began, and went\nbriskly forward. In nine months the book took the publishing house out\nof debt, advanced its stock from twenty-five to two hundred, and left\nseventy thousand dollars profit to the good. It was Bliss that told me\nthis--but if it was true, it was the first time that he had told the\ntruth in sixty-five years. He was born in 1804.\n\n\nIII.\n\n... This was in 1849. I was fourteen years old, then. We were still\nliving in Hannibal, Missouri, on the banks of the Mississippi, in the\nnew \"frame\" house built by my father five years before. That is, some of\nus lived in the new part, the rest in the old part back of it--the \"L.\"\nIn the autumn my sister gave a party, and invited all the marriageable\nyoung people of the village. I was too young for this society, and was\ntoo bashful to mingle with young ladies, anyway, therefore I was not\ninvited--at least not for the whole evening. Ten minutes of it was to be\nmy whole share. I was to do the part of a bear in a small fairy play. I\nwas to be disguised all over in a close-fitting brown hairy stuff proper\nfor a bear. About half past ten I was told to go to my room and put on\nthis disguise, and be ready in half an hour. I started, but changed my\nmind; for I wanted to practise a little, and that room was very small. I\ncrossed over to the large unoccupied house on the corner of Main and\nHill streets,[4] unaware that a dozen of the young people were also\ngoing there to dress for their parts. I took the little black slave boy,\nSandy, with me, and we selected a roomy and empty chamber on the second\nfloor. We entered it talking, and this gave a couple of half-dressed\nyoung ladies an opportunity to take refuge behind a screen undiscovered.\nTheir gowns and things were hanging on hooks behind the door, but I did\nnot see them; it was Sandy that shut the door, but all his heart was in\nthe theatricals, and he was as unlikely to notice them as I was myself.\n\nThat was a rickety screen, with many holes in it, but as I did not know\nthere were girls behind it, I was not disturbed by that detail. If I had\nknown, I could not have undressed in the flood of cruel moonlight that\nwas pouring in at the curtainless windows; I should have died of shame.\nUntroubled by apprehensions, I stripped to the skin and began my\npractice. I was full of ambition; I was determined to make a hit; I was\nburning to establish a reputation as a bear and get further engagements;\nso I threw myself into my work with an abandon that promised great\nthings. I capered back and forth from one end of the room to the other\non all fours, Sandy applauding with enthusiasm; I walked upright and\ngrowled and snapped and snarled; I stood on my head, I flung\nhandsprings, I danced a lubberly dance with my paws bent and my\nimaginary snout sniffing from side to side; I did everything a bear\ncould do, and many things which no bear could ever do and no bear with\nany dignity would want to do, anyway; and of course I never suspected\nthat I was making a spectacle of myself to any one but Sandy. At last,\nstanding on my head, I paused in that attitude to take a minute's rest.\nThere was a moment's silence, then Sandy spoke up with excited interest\nand said--\n\n\"Marse Sam, has you ever seen a smoked herring?\"\n\n\"No. What is that?\"\n\n\"It's a fish.\"\n\n\"Well, what of it? Anything peculiar about it?\"\n\n\"Yes, suh, you bet you dey is. _Dey eats 'em guts and all!_\"\n\nThere was a smothered burst of feminine snickers from behind the screen!\nAll the strength went out of me and I toppled forward like an undermined\ntower and brought the screen down with my weight, burying the young\nladies under it. In their fright they discharged a couple of piercing\nscreams--and possibly others, but I did not wait to count. I snatched my\nclothes and fled to the dark hall below, Sandy following. I was dressed\nin half a minute, and out the back way. I swore Sandy to eternal\nsilence, then we went away and hid until the party was over. The\nambition was all out of me. I could not have faced that giddy company\nafter my adventure, for there would be two performers there who knew my\nsecret, and would be privately laughing at me all the time. I was\nsearched for but not found, and the bear had to be played by a young\ngentleman in his civilized clothes. The house was still and everybody\nasleep when I finally ventured home. I was very heavy-hearted, and full\nof a sense of disgrace. Pinned to my pillow I found a slip of paper\nwhich bore a line that did not lighten my heart, but only made my face\nburn. It was written in a laboriously disguised hand, and these were its\nmocking terms:\n\n\"You probably couldn't have played _bear_, but you played _bare_ very\nwell--oh, very very well!\"\n\nWe think boys are rude, unsensitive animals, but it is not so in all\ncases. Each boy has one or two sensitive spots, and if you can find out\nwhere they are located you have only to touch them and you can scorch\nhim as with fire. I suffered miserably over that episode. I expected\nthat the facts would be all over the village in the morning, but it was\nnot so. The secret remained confined to the two girls and Sandy and me.\nThat was some appeasement of my pain, but it was far from\nsufficient--the main trouble remained: I was under four mocking eyes,\nand it might as well have been a thousand, for I suspected all girls'\neyes of being the ones I so dreaded. During several weeks I could not\nlook any young lady in the face; I dropped my eyes in confusion when any\none of them smiled upon me and gave me greeting; and I said to myself,\n\"_That is one of them_,\" and got quickly away. Of course I was meeting\nthe right girls everywhere, but if they ever let slip any betraying sign\nI was not bright enough to catch it. When I left Hannibal four years\nlater, the secret was still a secret; I had never guessed those girls\nout, and was no longer expecting to do it. Nor wanting to, either.\n\nOne of the dearest and prettiest girls in the village at the time of my\nmishap was one whom I will call Mary Wilson, because that was not her\nname. She was twenty years old; she was dainty and sweet, peach-bloomy\nand exquisite, gracious and lovely in character, and I stood in awe of\nher, for she seemed to me to be made out of angel-clay and rightfully\nunapproachable by an unholy ordinary kind of a boy like me. I probably\nnever suspected her. But--\n\nThe scene changes. To Calcutta--forty-seven years later. It was in 1896.\nI arrived there on my lecturing trip. As I entered the hotel a divine\nvision passed out of it, clothed in the glory of the Indian\nsunshine--the Mary Wilson of my long-vanished boyhood! It was a\nstartling thing. Before I could recover from the bewildering shock and\nspeak to her she was gone. I thought maybe I had seen an apparition, but\nit was not so, she was flesh. She was the granddaughter of the other\nMary, the original Mary. That Mary, now a widow, was up-stairs, and\npresently sent for me. She was old and gray-haired, but she looked young\nand was very handsome. We sat down and talked. We steeped our thirsty\nsouls in the reviving wine of the past, the beautiful past, the dear and\nlamented past; we uttered the names that had been silent upon our lips\nfor fifty years, and it was as if they were made of music; with reverent\nhands we unburied our dead, the mates of our youth, and caressed them\nwith our speech; we searched the dusty chambers of our memories and\ndragged forth incident after incident, episode after episode, folly\nafter folly, and laughed such good laughs over them, with the tears\nrunning down; and finally Mary said suddenly, and without any leading\nup--\n\n\"Tell me! What is the special peculiarity of smoked herrings?\"\n\nIt seemed a strange question at such a hallowed time as this. And so\ninconsequential, too. I was a little shocked. And yet I was aware of a\nstir of some kind away back in the deeps of my memory somewhere. It set\nme to musing--thinking--searching. Smoked herrings. Smoked herrings. The\npeculiarity of smo.... I glanced up. Her face was grave, but there was a\ndim and shadowy twinkle in her eye which--All of a sudden I knew! and\nfar away down in the hoary past I heard a remembered voice murmur, \"Dey\neats 'em guts and all!\"\n\n\"At--last! I've found one of you, anyway! Who was the other girl?\"\n\nBut she drew the line there. She wouldn't tell me.\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[4] That house still stands.\n\n\nIV.\n\n... But it was on a bench in Washington Square that I saw the most of\nLouis Stevenson. It was an outing that lasted an hour or more, and was\nvery pleasant and sociable. I had come with him from his house, where I\nhad been paying my respects to his family. His business in the Square\nwas to absorb the sunshine. He was most scantily furnished with flesh,\nhis clothes seemed to fall into hollows as if there might be nothing\ninside but the frame for a sculptor's statue. His long face and lank\nhair and dark complexion and musing and melancholy expression seemed to\nfit these details justly and harmoniously, and the altogether of it\nseemed especially planned to gather the rays of your observation and\nfocalize them upon Stevenson's special distinction and commanding\nfeature, his splendid eyes. They burned with a smouldering rich fire\nunder the penthouse of his brows, and they made him beautiful.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI said I thought he was right about the others, but mistaken as to Bret\nHarte; in substance I said that Harte was good company and a thin but\npleasant talker; that he was always bright, but never brilliant; that in\nthis matter he must not be classed with Thomas Bailey Aldrich, nor must\nany other man, ancient or modern; that Aldrich was always witty, always\nbrilliant, if there was anybody present capable of striking his flint at\nthe right angle; that Aldrich was as sure and prompt and unfailing as\nthe red-hot iron on the blacksmith's anvil--you had only to hit it\ncompetently to make it deliver an explosion of sparks. I added--\n\n\"Aldrich has never had his peer for prompt and pithy and witty and\nhumorous sayings. None has equalled him, certainly none has surpassed\nhim, in the felicity of phrasing with which he clothed these children of\nhis fancy. Aldrich was always brilliant, he couldn't help it, he is a\nfire-opal set round with rose diamonds; when he is not speaking, you\nknow that his dainty fancies are twinkling and glimmering around in him;\nwhen he speaks the diamonds flash. Yes, he was always brilliant, he will\nalways be brilliant; he will be brilliant in hell--you will see.\"\n\nStevenson, smiling a chuckly smile, \"I hope not.\"\n\n\"Well, you will, and he will dim even those ruddy fires and look like a\ntransfigured Adonis backed against a pink sunset.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere on that bench we struck out a new phrase--one or the other of us,\nI don't remember which--\"submerged renown.\" Variations were discussed:\n\"submerged fame,\" \"submerged reputation,\" and so on, and a choice was\nmade; \"submerged renown\" was elected, I believe. This important matter\nrose out of an incident which had been happening to Stevenson in Albany.\nWhile in a book-shop or book-stall there he had noticed a long rank of\nsmall books, cheaply but neatly gotten up, and bearing such titles as\n\"Davis's Selected Speeches,\" \"Davis's Selected Poetry,\" Davis's this and\nDavis's that and Davis's the other thing; compilations, every one of\nthem, each with a brief, compact, intelligent and useful introductory\nchapter by this same Davis, whose first name I have forgotten. Stevenson\nhad begun the matter with this question:\n\n\"Can you name the American author whose fame and acceptance stretch\nwidest in the States?\"\n\nI thought I could, but it did not seem to me that it would be modest to\nspeak out, in the circumstances. So I diffidently said nothing.\nStevenson noticed, and said--\n\n\"Save your delicacy for another time--you are not the one. For a\nshilling you can't name the American author of widest note and\npopularity in the States. But I can.\"\n\nThen he went on and told about that Albany incident. He had inquired of\nthe shopman--\n\n\"Who is this Davis?\"\n\nThe answer was--\n\n\"An author whose books have to have freight-trains to carry them, not\nbaskets. Apparently you have not heard of him?\"\n\nStevenson said no, this was the first time. The man said--\n\n\"Nobody has heard of Davis: you may ask all around and you will see. You\nnever see his name mentioned in print, not even in advertisement; these\nthings are of no use to Davis, not any more than they are to the wind\nand the sea. You never see one of Davis's books floating on top of the\nUnited States, but put on your diving armor and get yourself lowered\naway down and down and down till you strike the dense region, the\nsunless region of eternal drudgery and starvation wages--there you'll\nfind them by the million. The man that gets that market, his fortune is\nmade, his bread and butter are safe, for those people will never go back\non him. An author may have a reputation which is confined to the\nsurface, and lose it and become pitied, then despised, then forgotten,\nentirely forgotten--the frequent steps in a surface reputation. At\nsurface reputation, however great, is always mortal, and always killable\nif you go at it right--with pins and needles, and quiet slow poison, not\nwith the club and tomahawk. But it is a different matter with the\nsubmerged reputation--down in the deep water; once a favorite there,\nalways a favorite; once beloved, always beloved; once respected, always\nrespected, honored, and believed in. For, what the reviewer says never\nfinds its way down into those placid deeps; nor the newspaper sneers,\nnor any breath of the winds of slander blowing above. Down there they\nnever hear of these things. Their idol may be painted clay, up then at\nthe surface, and fade and waste and crumble and blow away, there being\nmuch weather there; but down below he is gold and adamant and\nindestructible.\"\n\n\nV.\n\nThis is from this morning's paper:\n\n\n                        MARK TWAIN LETTER SOLD.\n\n            _Written to Thomas Nast, it Proposed a Joint Tour._\n\n     A Mark Twain autograph letter brought $43 yesterday at the auction\n     by the Merwin-Clayton Company of the library and correspondence of\n     the late Thomas Nast, cartoonist. The letter is nine pages\n     note-paper, is dated Hartford, Nov. 12, 1877, and it addressed to\n     Nast. It reads in part as follows:\n\n\n                                                 Hartford, _Nov. 12_.\n\n     MY DEAR NAST: I did not think I should ever stand on a platform\n     again until the time was come for me to say I die innocent. But the\n     same old offers keep arriving that have arriven every year, and\n     been every year declined--$500 for Louisville, $500 for St. Louis,\n     $1,000 gold for two nights in Toronto, half gross proceeds for New\n     York, Boston, Brooklyn, &c. I have declined them all just as usual,\n     though sorely tempted as usual.\n\n     Now, I do not decline because I mind talking to an audience, but\n     because (1) travelling alone is so heart-breakingly dreary, and (2)\n     shouldering the whole show is such cheer-killing responsibility.\n\n     Therefore I now propose to you what you proposed to me in November,\n     1867--ten years ago, (when I was unknown,) viz.; That you should\n     stand on the platform and make pictures, and I stand by you and\n     blackguard the audience. I should enormously enjoy meandering\n     around (to big towns--don't want to go to little ones) with you for\n     company.\n\n     The letter includes a schedule of cities and the number of\n     appearances planned for each.\n\n\nThis is as it should be. This is worthy of all praise. I say it myself\nlest other competent persons should forget to do it. It appears that\nfour of my ancient letters were sold at auction, three of them at\ntwenty-seven dollars, twenty-eight dollars, and twenty-nine dollars\nrespectively, and the one above mentioned at forty-three dollars. There\nis one very gratifying circumstance about this, to wit: that my\nliterature has more than held its own as regards money value through\nthis stretch of thirty-six years. I judge that the forty-three-dollar\nletter must have gone at about ten cents a word, whereas if I had\nwritten it to-day its market rate would be thirty cents--so I have\nincreased in value two or three hundred per cent. I note another\ngratifying circumstance--that a letter of General Grant's sold at\nsomething short of eighteen dollars. I can't rise to General Grant's\nlofty place in the estimation of this nation, but it is a deep happiness\nto me to know that when it comes to epistolary literature he can't sit\nin the front seat along with me.\n\nThis reminds me--nine years ago, when we were living in Tedworth Square,\nLondon, a report was cabled to the American journals that I was dying. I\nwas not the one. It was another Clemens, a cousin of mine,--Dr. J. Ross\nClemens, now of St. Louis--who was due to die but presently escaped, by\nsome chicanery or other characteristic of the tribe of Clemens. The\nLondon representatives of the American papers began to flock in, with\nAmerican cables in their hands, to inquire into my condition. There was\nnothing the matter with me, and each in his turn was astonished, and\ndisappointed, to find me reading and smoking in my study and worth next\nto nothing as a text for transatlantic news. One of these men was a\ngentle and kindly and grave and sympathetic Irishman, who hid his sorrow\nthe best he could, and tried to look glad, and told me that his paper,\nthe _Evening Sun_, had cabled him that it was reported in New York that\nI was dead. What should he cable in reply? I said--\n\n\"Say the report is greatly exaggerated.\"\n\nHe never smiled, but went solemnly away and sent the cable in those\nwords. The remark hit the world pleasantly, and to this day it keeps\nturning up, now and then, in the newspapers when people have occasion to\ndiscount exaggerations.\n\nThe next man was also an Irishman. He had his New York cablegram in his\nhand--from the New York _World_--and he was so evidently trying to get\naround that cable with invented softnesses and palliations that my\ncuriosity was aroused and I wanted to see what it did really say. So\nwhen occasion offered I slipped it out of his hand. It said,\n\n\"If Mark Twain dying send five hundred words. If dead send a thousand.\"\n\nNow that old letter of mine sold yesterday for forty-three dollars. When\nI am dead it will be worth eighty-six.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DC.\n\nOCTOBER 5, 1906.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--III.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\nVI.\n\nTo-morrow will be the thirty-sixth anniversary of our marriage. My wife\npassed from this life one year and eight months ago, in Florence, Italy,\nafter an unbroken illness of twenty-two months' duration.\n\nI saw her first in the form of an ivory miniature in her brother\nCharley's stateroom in the steamer \"Quaker City,\" in the Bay of Smyrna,\nin the summer of 1867, when she was in her twenty-second year. I saw her\nin the flesh for the first time in New York in the following December.\nShe was slender and beautiful and girlish--and she was both girl and\nwoman. She remained both girl and woman to the last day of her life.\nUnder a grave and gentle exterior burned inextinguishable fires of\nsympathy, energy, devotion, enthusiasm, and absolutely limitless\naffection. She was _always_ frail in body, and she lived upon her\nspirit, whose hopefulness and courage were indestructible. Perfect\ntruth, perfect honesty, perfect candor, were qualities of her character\nwhich were born with her. Her judgments of people and things were sure\nand accurate. Her intuitions almost never deceived her. In her judgments\nof the characters and acts of both friends and strangers, there was\nalways room for charity, and this charity never failed. I have compared\nand contrasted her with hundreds of persons, and my conviction remains\nthat hers was the most perfect character I have ever met. And I may add\nthat she was the most winningly dignified person I have ever known. Her\ncharacter and disposition were of the sort that not only invites\nworship, but commands it. No servant ever left her service who deserved\nto remain in it. And, as she could choose with a glance of her eye, the\nservants she selected did in almost all cases deserve to remain, and\nthey _did_ remain. She was always cheerful; and she was always able to\ncommunicate her cheerfulness to others. During the nine years that we\nspent in poverty and debt, she was always able to reason me out of my\ndespairs, and find a bright side to the clouds, and make me see it. In\nall that time, I never knew her to utter a word of regret concerning our\naltered circumstances, nor did I ever know her children to do the like.\nFor she had taught them, and they drew their fortitude from her. The\nlove which she bestowed upon those whom she loved took the form of\nworship, and in that form it was returned--returned by relatives,\nfriends and the servants of her household. It was a strange combination\nwhich wrought into one individual, so to speak, by marriage--her\ndisposition and character and mine. She poured out her prodigal\naffections in kisses and caresses, and in a vocabulary of endearments\nwhose profusion was always an astonishment to me. I was born _reserved_\nas to endearments of speech and caresses, and hers broke upon me as the\nsummer waves break upon Gibraltar. I was reared in that atmosphere of\nreserve. As I have already said, in another chapter, I never knew a\nmember of my father's family to kiss another member of it except once,\nand that at a death-bed. And our village was not a kissing community.\nThe kissing and caressing ended with courtship--along with the deadly\npiano-playing of that day.\n\nShe had the heart-free laugh of a girl. It came seldom, but when it\nbroke upon the ear it was as inspiring as music. I heard it for the last\ntime when she had been occupying her sickbed for more than a year, and I\nmade a written note of it at the time--a note not to be repeated.\n\nTo-morrow will be the thirty-sixth anniversary. We were married in her\nfather's house in Elmira, New York, and went next day, by special train,\nto Buffalo, along with the whole Langdon family, and with the Beechers\nand the Twichells, who had solemnized the marriage. We were to live in\nBuffalo, where I was to be one of the editors of the Buffalo \"Express,\"\nand a part owner of the paper. I knew nothing about Buffalo, but I had\nmade my household arrangements there through a friend, by letter. I had\ninstructed him to find a boarding-house of as respectable a character as\nmy light salary as editor would command. We were received at about nine\no'clock at the station in Buffalo, and were put into several sleighs and\ndriven all over America, as it seemed to me--for, apparently, we turned\nall the corners in the town and followed all the streets there were--I\nscolding freely, and characterizing that friend of mine in very\nuncomplimentary words for securing a boarding-house that apparently had\nno definite locality. But there was a conspiracy--and my bride knew of\nit, but I was in ignorance. Her father, Jervis Langdon, had bought and\nfurnished a new house for us in the fashionable street, Delaware Avenue,\nand had laid in a cook and housemaids, and a brisk and electric young\ncoachman, an Irishman, Patrick McAleer--and we were being driven all\nover that city in order that one sleighful of those people could have\ntime to go to the house, and see that the gas was lighted all over it,\nand a hot supper prepared for the crowd. We arrived at last, and when I\nentered that fairy place my indignation reached high-water mark, and\nwithout any reserve I delivered my opinion to that friend of mine for\nbeing so stupid as to put us into a boarding-house whose terms would be\nfar out of my reach. Then Mr. Langdon brought forward a very pretty box\nand opened it, and took from it a deed of the house. So the comedy ended\nvery pleasantly, and we sat down to supper.\n\nThe company departed about midnight, and left us alone in our new\nquarters. Then Ellen, the cook, came in to get orders for the morning's\nmarketing--and neither of us knew whether beefsteak was sold by the\nbarrel or by the yard. We exposed our ignorance, and Ellen was fall of\nIrish delight over it. Patrick McAleer, that brisk young Irishman, came\nin to get his orders for next day--and that was our first glimpse of\nhim....\n\nOur first child, Langdon Clemens, was born the 7th of November, 1870,\nand lived twenty-two months. Susy was born the 19th of March, 1872, and\npassed from life in the Hartford home, the 18th of August, 1896. With\nher, when the end came, were Jean and Katy Leary, and John and Ellen\n(the gardener and his wife). Clara and her mother and I arrived in\nEngland from around the world on the 31st of July, and took a house in\nGuildford. A week later, when Susy, Katy and Jean should have been\narriving from America, we got a letter instead.\n\nIt explained that Susy was slightly ill--nothing of consequence. But we\nwere disquieted, and began to cable for later news. This was Friday. All\nday no answer--and the ship to leave Southampton next day, at noon.\nClara and her mother began packing, to be ready in case the news should\nbe bad. Finally came a cablegram saying, \"Wait for cablegram in the\nmorning.\" This was not satisfactory--not reassuring. I cabled again,\nasking that the answer be sent to Southampton, for the day was now\nclosing. I waited in the post-office that night till the doors were\nclosed, toward midnight, in the hope that good news might still come,\nbut there was no message. We sat silent at home till one in the morning,\nwaiting--waiting for we knew not what. Then we took the earliest morning\ntrain, and when we reached Southampton the message was there. It said\nthe recovery would be long, but certain. This was a great relief to me,\nbut not to my wife. She was frightened. She and Clara went aboard the\nsteamer at once and sailed for America, to nurse Susy. I remained behind\nto search for a larger house in Guildford.\n\nThat was the 15th of August, 1896. Three days later, when my wife and\nClara were about half-way across the ocean, I was standing in our\ndining-room thinking of nothing in particular, when a cablegram was put\ninto my hand. It said, \"Susy was peacefully released to-day.\"\n\nIt is one of the mysteries of our nature that a man, all unprepared, can\nreceive a thunder-stroke like that and live. There is but one reasonable\nexplanation of it. The intellect is stunned by the shock, and but\ngropingly gathers the meaning of the words. The power to realize their\nfall import is mercifully wanting. The mind has a dumb sense of vast\nloss--that is all. It will take mind and memory months, and possibly\nyears, to gather together the details, and thus learn and know the whole\nextent of the loss. A man's house burns down. The smoking wreckage\nrepresents only a ruined home that was dear through years of use and\npleasant associations. By and by, as the days and weeks go on, first he\nmisses this, then that, then the other thing. And, when he casts about\nfor it, he finds that it was in that house. Always it is an\n_essential_--there was but one of its kind. It cannot be replaced. It\nwas in that house. It is irrevocably lost. He did not realize that it\nwas an essential when he had it; he only discovers it now when he finds\nhimself balked, hampered, by its absence. It will be years before the\ntale of lost essentials is complete, and not till then can he truly know\nthe magnitude of his disaster.\n\nThe 18th of August brought me the awful tidings. The mother and the\nsister were out there in mid-Atlantic, ignorant of what was happening;\nflying to meet this incredible calamity. All that could be done to\nprotect them from the full force of the shock was done by relatives and\ngood friends. They went down the Bay and met the ship at night, but did\nnot show themselves until morning, and then only to Clara. When she\nreturned to the stateroom she did not speak, and did not need to. Her\nmother looked at her and said:\n\n\"Susy is dead.\"\n\nAt half past ten o'clock that night, Clara and her mother completed\ntheir circuit of the globe, and drew up at Elmira by the same train and\nin the same car which had borne them and me Westward from it one year,\none month, and one week before. And again Susy was there--not waving her\nwelcome in the glare of the lights, as she had waved her farewell to us\nthirteen months before, but lying white and fair in her coffin, in the\nhouse where she was born.\n\nThe last thirteen days of Susy's life were spent in our own house in\nHartford, the home of her childhood, and always the dearest place in the\nearth to her. About her she had faithful old friends--her pastor, Mr.\nTwichell, who had known her from the cradle, and who had come a long\njourney to be with her; her uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Crane;\nPatrick, the coachman; Katy, who had begun to serve us when Susy was a\nchild of eight years; John and Ellen, who had been with us many years.\nAlso Jean was there.\n\nAt the hour when my wife and Clara set sail for America, Susy was in no\ndanger. Three hours later there came a sudden change for the worse.\nMeningitis set in, and it was immediately apparent that she was\ndeath-struck. That was Saturday, the 15th of August.\n\n\"That evening she took food for the last time,\" (Jean's letter to me).\nThe next morning the brain-fever was raging. She walked the floor a\nlittle in her pain and delirium, then succumbed to weakness and returned\nto her bed. Previously she had found hanging in a closet a gown which\nshe had seen her mother wear. She thought it was her mother, dead, and\nshe kissed it, and cried. About noon she became blind (an effect of the\ndisease) and bewailed it to her uncle.\n\nFrom Jean's letter I take this sentence, which needs no comment:\n\n\"About one in the afternoon Susy spoke for the last time.\"\n\nIt was only one word that she said when she spoke that last time, and it\ntold of her longing. She groped with her hands and found Katy, and\ncaressed her face, and said \"Mamma.\"\n\nHow gracious it was that, in that forlorn hour of wreck and ruin, with\nthe night of death closing around her, she should have been granted that\nbeautiful illusion--that the latest vision which rested upon the clouded\nmirror of her mind should have been the vision of her mother, and the\nlatest emotion she should know in life the joy and peace of that dear\nimagined presence.\n\nAbout two o'clock she composed herself as if for sleep, and never moved\nagain. She fell into unconsciousness and so remained two days and five\nhours, until Tuesday evening at seven minutes past seven, when the\nrelease came. She was twenty-four years and five months old.\n\nOn the 23d, her mother and her sisters saw her laid to rest--she that\nhad been our wonder and our worship.\n\nIn one of her own books I find some verses which I will copy here.\nApparently, she always put borrowed matter in quotation marks. These\nverses lack those marks, and therefore I take them to be her own:\n\n\n     Love came at dawn, when all the world was fair,\n       When crimson glories' bloom and sun were rife;\n     Love came at dawn, when hope's wings fanned the air,\n       And murmured, \"I am life.\"\n\n     Love came at eve, and when the day was done,\n       When heart and brain were tired, and slumber pressed;\n     Love came at eve, shut out the sinking sun,\n       And whispered, \"I am rest.\"\n\n\nThe summer seasons of Susy's childhood were spent at Quarry Farm, on the\nhills east of Elmira, New York; the other seasons of the year at the\nhome in Hartford. Like other children, she was blithe and happy, fond of\nplay; unlike the average of children, she was at times much given to\nretiring within herself, and trying to search out the hidden meanings of\nthe deep things that make the puzzle and pathos of human existence, and\nin all the ages have baffled the inquirer and mocked him. As a little\nchild aged seven, she was oppressed and perplexed by the maddening\nrepetition of the stock incidents of our race's fleeting sojourn here,\njust as the same thing has oppressed and perplexed maturer minds from\nthe beginning of time. A myriad of men are born; they labor and sweat\nand struggle for bread; they squabble and scold and fight; they scramble\nfor little mean advantages over each other; age creeps upon them;\ninfirmities follow; shames and humiliations bring down their prides and\ntheir vanities; those they love are taken from them, and the joy of life\nis turned to aching grief. The burden of pain, care, misery, grows\nheavier year by year; at length, ambition is dead, pride is dead; vanity\nis dead; longing for release is in their place. It comes at last--the\nonly unpoisoned gift earth ever had for them--and they vanish from a\nworld where they were of no consequence; where they achieved nothing;\nwhere they were a mistake and a failure and a foolishness; there they\nhave left no sign that they have existed--a world which will lament them\na day and forget them forever. Then another myriad takes their place,\nand copies all they did, and goes along the same profitless road, and\nvanishes as they vanished--to make room for another, and another, and a\nmillion other myriads, to follow the same arid path through the same\ndesert, and accomplish what the first myriad, and all the myriads that\ncame after it, accomplished--nothing!\n\n\"Mamma, what is it all for?\" asked Susy, preliminarily stating the\nabove details in her own halting language, after long brooding over them\nalone in the privacy of the nursery.\n\nA year later, she was groping her way alone through another sunless bog,\nbut this time she reached a rest for her feet. For a week, her mother\nhad not been able to go to the nursery, evenings, at the child's prayer\nhour. She spoke of it--was sorry for it, and said she would come\nto-night, and hoped she could continue to come every night and hear Susy\npray, as before. Noticing that the child wished to respond, but was\nevidently troubled as to how to word her answer, she asked what the\ndifficulty was. Susy explained that Miss Foote (the governess) had been\nteaching her about the Indians and their religious beliefs, whereby it\nappeared that they had not only a God, but several. This had set Susy to\nthinking. As a result of this thinking, she had stopped praying. She\nqualified this statement--that is, she modified it--saying she did not\nnow pray \"in the same way\" as she had formerly done. Her mother said:\n\n\"Tell me about it, dear.\"\n\n\"Well, mamma, the Indians believed they knew, but now we know they were\nwrong. By and by, it can turn out that we are wrong. So now I only pray\nthat there may be a God and a Heaven--or something better.\"\n\nI wrote down this pathetic prayer in its precise wording, at the time,\nin a record which we kept of the children's sayings, and my reverence\nfor it has grown with the years that have passed over my head since\nthen. Its untaught grace and simplicity are a child's, but the wisdom\nand the pathos of it are of all the ages that have come and gone since\nthe race of man has lived, and longed, and hoped, and feared, and\ndoubted.\n\nTo go back a year--Susy aged seven. Several times her mother said to\nher:\n\n\"There, there, Susy, you mustn't cry over little things.\"\n\nThis furnished Susy a text for thought She had been breaking her heart\nover what had seemed vast disasters--a broken toy; a picnic cancelled by\nthunder and lightning and rain; the mouse that was growing tame and\nfriendly in the nursery caught and killed by the cat--and now came this\nstrange revelation. For some unaccountable reason, these were not vast\ncalamities. Why? How is the size of calamities measured? What is the\nrule? There must be some way to tell the great ones from the small\nones; what is the law of these proportions? She examined the problem\nearnestly and long. She gave it her best thought from time to time, for\ntwo or three days--but it baffled her--defeated her. And at last she\ngave up and went to her mother for help.\n\n\"Mamma, what is '_little_ things'?\"\n\nIt seemed a simple question--at first. And yet, before the answer could\nbe put into words, unsuspected and unforeseen difficulties began to\nappear. They increased; they multiplied; they brought about another\ndefeat. The effort to explain came to a standstill. Then Susy tried to\nhelp her mother out--with an instance, an example, an illustration. The\nmother was getting ready to go down-town, and one of her errands was to\nbuy a long-promised toy-watch for Susy.\n\n\"If you forgot the watch, mamma, would that be a little thing?\"\n\nShe was not concerned about the watch, for she knew it would not be\nforgotten. What she was hoping for was that the answer would unriddle\nthe riddle, and bring rest and peace to her perplexed little mind.\n\nThe hope was disappointed, of course--for the reason that the size of a\nmisfortune is not determinate by an outsider's measurement of it, but\nonly by the measurements applied to it by the person specially affected\nby it. The king's lost crown is a vast matter to the king, but of no\nconsequence to the child. The lost toy is a great matter to the child,\nbut in the king's eyes it is not a thing to break the heart about. A\nverdict was reached, but it was based upon the above model, and Susy was\ngranted leave to measure her disasters thereafter with her own\ntape-line.\n\nAs a child, Susy had a passionate temper; and it cost her much remorse\nand many tears before she learned to govern it, but after that it was a\nwholesome salt, and her character was the stronger and healthier for its\npresence. It enabled her to be good with dignity; it preserved her not\nonly from being good for vanity's sake, but from even the appearance of\nit. In looking back over the long vanished years, it seems but natural\nand excusable that I should dwell with longing affection and preference\nupon incidents of her young life which made it beautiful to us, and that\nI should let its few small offences go unsummoned and unreproached.\n\nIn the summer of 1880, when Susy was just eight years of age, the\nfamily were at Quarry Farm, as usual at that season of the year.\nHay-cutting time was approaching, and Susy and Clara were counting the\nhours, for the time was big with a great event for them; they had been\npromised that they might mount the wagon and ride home from the fields\non the summit of the hay mountain. This perilous privilege, so dear to\ntheir age and species, had never been granted them before. Their\nexcitement had no bounds. They could talk of nothing but this\nepoch-making adventure, now. But misfortune overtook Susy on the very\nmorning of the important day. In a sudden outbreak of passion, she\ncorrected Clara--with a shovel, or stick, or something of the sort. At\nany rate, the offence committed was of a gravity clearly beyond the\nlimit allowed in the nursery. In accordance with the rule and custom of\nthe house, Susy went to her mother to confess, and to help decide upon\nthe size and character of the punishment due. It was quite understood\nthat, as a punishment could have but one rational object and\nfunction--to act as a reminder, and warn the transgressor against\ntransgressing in the same way again--the children would know about as\nwell as any how to choose a penalty which would be rememberable and\neffective. Susy and her mother discussed various punishments, but none\nof them seemed adequate. This fault was an unusually serious one, and\nrequired the setting up of a danger-signal in the memory that would not\nblow out nor burn out, but remain a fixture there and furnish its saving\nwarning indefinitely. Among the punishments mentioned was deprivation of\nthe hay-wagon ride. It was noticeable that this one hit Susy hard.\nFinally, in the summing up, the mother named over the list and asked:\n\n\"Which one do you think it ought to be, Susy?\"\n\nSusy studied, shrank from her duty, and asked:\n\n\"Which do you think, mamma?\"\n\n\"Well, Susy, I would rather leave it to you. _You_ make the choice\nyourself.\"\n\nIt cost Susy a struggle, and much and deep thinking and weighing--but\nshe came out where any one who knew her could have foretold she would.\n\n\"Well, mamma, I'll make it the hay-wagon, because you know the other\nthings might not make me remember not to do it again, but if I don't get\nto ride on the hay-wagon I can remember it easily.\"\n\nIn this world the real penalty, the sharp one, the lasting one, never\nfalls otherwise than on the wrong person. It was not _I_ that corrected\nClara, but the remembrance of poor Susy's lost hay-ride still brings\n_me_ a pang--after twenty-six years.\n\nApparently, Susy was born with humane feelings for the animals, and\ncompassion for their troubles. This enabled her to see a new point in an\nold story, once, when she was only six years old--a point which had been\noverlooked by older, and perhaps duller, people for many ages. Her\nmother told her the moving story of the sale of Joseph by his brethren,\nthe staining of his coat with the blood of the slaughtered kid, and the\nrest of it. She dwelt upon the inhumanity of the brothers; their cruelty\ntoward their helpless young brother; and the unbrotherly treachery which\nthey practised upon him; for she hoped to teach the child a lesson in\ngentle pity and mercifulness which she would remember. Apparently, her\ndesire was accomplished, for the tears came into Susy's eyes and she was\ndeeply moved. Then she said:\n\n\"Poor little kid!\"\n\nA child's frank envy of the privileges and distinctions of its elders is\noften a delicately flattering attention and the reverse of unwelcome,\nbut sometimes the envy is not placed where the beneficiary is expecting\nit to be placed. Once, when Susy was seven, she sat breathlessly\nabsorbed in watching a guest of ours adorn herself for a ball. The lady\nwas charmed by this homage; this mute and gentle admiration; and was\nhappy in it. And when her pretty labors were finished, and she stood at\nlast perfect, unimprovable, clothed like Solomon in all his glory, she\npaused, confident and expectant, to receive from Susy's tongue the\ntribute that was burning in her eyes. Susy drew an envious little sigh\nand said:\n\n\"I wish _I_ could have crooked teeth and spectacles!\"\n\nOnce, when Susy was six months along in her eighth year, she did\nsomething one day in the presence of company, which subjected her to\ncriticism and reproof. Afterward, when she was alone with her mother, as\nwas her custom she reflected a little while over the matter. Then she\nset up what I think--and what the shade of Burns would think--was a\nquite good philosophical defence.\n\n\"Well, mamma, you know I didn't see myself, and so I couldn't know how\nit looked.\"\n\nIn homes where the near friends and visitors are mainly literary\npeople--lawyers, judges, professors and clergymen--the children's ears\nbecome early familiarized with wide vocabularies. It is natural for them\nto pick up any words that fall in their way; it is natural for them to\npick up big and little ones indiscriminately; it is natural for them to\nuse without fear any word that comes to their net, no matter how\nformidable it may be as to size. As a result, their talk is a curious\nand funny musketry clatter of little words, interrupted at intervals by\nthe heavy artillery crash of a word of such imposing sound and size that\nit seems to shake the ground and rattle the windows. Sometimes the child\ngets a wrong idea of a word which it has picked up by chance, and\nattaches to it a meaning which impairs its usefulness--but this does not\nhappen as often as one might expect it would. Indeed, it happens with an\ninfrequency which may be regarded as remarkable. As a child, Susy had\ngood fortune with her large words, and she employed many of them. She\nmade no more than her fair share of mistakes. Once when she thought\nsomething very funny was going to happen (but it didn't), she was racked\nand torn with laughter, by anticipation. But, apparently, she still felt\nsure of her position, for she said, \"If it had happened, I should have\nbeen transformed [transported] with glee.\"\n\nAnd earlier, when she was a little maid of five years, she informed a\nvisitor that she had been in a church only once, and that was the time\nwhen Clara was \"crucified\" [christened]....\n\nIn Heidelberg, when Susy was six, she noticed that the Schloss gardens\nwere populous with snails creeping all about everywhere. One day she\nfound a new dish on her table and inquired concerning it, and learned\nthat it was made of snails. She was awed and impressed, and said:\n\n\"Wild ones, mamma?\"\n\nShe was thoughtful and considerate of others--an acquired quality, no\ndoubt. No one seems to be born with it. One hot day, at home in\nHartford, when she was a little child, her mother borrowed her fan\nseveral times (a Japanese one, value five cents), refreshed herself with\nit a moment or two, then handed it back with a word of thanks. Susy knew\nher mother would use the fan all the time if she could do it without\nputting a deprivation upon its owner. She also knew that her mother\ncould not be persuaded to do that. A relief most be devised somehow;\nSusy devised it. She got five cents out of her money-box and carried it\nto Patrick, and asked him to take it down-town (a mile and a half) and\nbuy a Japanese fan and bring it home. He did it--and thus thoughtfully\nand delicately was the exigency met and the mother's comfort secured. It\nis to the child's credit that she did not save herself expense by\nbringing down another and more costly kind of fan from up-stairs, but\nwas content to act upon the impression that her mother desired the\nJapanese kind--content to accomplish the desire and stop with that,\nwithout troubling about the wisdom or unwisdom of it.\n\nSometimes, while she was still a child, her speech fell into quaint and\nstrikingly expressive forms. Once--aged nine or ten--she came to her\nmother's room, when her sister Jean was a baby, and said Jean was crying\nin the nursery, and asked if she might ring for the nurse. Her mother\nasked:\n\n\"Is she crying hard?\"--meaning cross, ugly.\n\n\"Well, no, mamma. It is a weary, lonesome cry.\"\n\nIt is a pleasure to me to recall various incidents which reveal the\ndelicacies of feeling that were so considerable a part of her budding\ncharacter. Such a revelation came once in a way which, while creditable\nto her heart, was defective in another direction. She was in her\neleventh year then. Her mother had been making the Christmas purchases,\nand she allowed Susy to see the presents which were for Patrick's\nchildren. Among these was a handsome sled for Jimmy, on which a stag was\npainted; also, in gilt capitals, the word \"Deer.\" Susy was excited and\njoyous over everything, until she came to this sled. Then she became\nsober and silent--yet the sled was the choicest of all the gifts. Her\nmother was surprised, and also disappointed, and said:\n\n\"Why, Susy, doesn't it please you? Isn't it fine?\"\n\nSusy hesitated, and it was plain that she did not want to say the thing\nthat was in her mind. However, being urged, she brought it haltingly\nout:\n\n\"Well, mamma, it _is_ fine, and of course it _did_ cost a good\ndeal--but--but--why should that be mentioned?\"\n\nSeeing that she was not understood, she reluctantly pointed to that word\n\"Deer.\" It was her orthography that was at fault, not her heart. She had\ninherited both from her mother.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCI.\n\nOCTOBER 19, 1906.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--IV.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\nWhen Susy was thirteen, and was a slender little maid with plaited tails\nof copper-tinged brown hair down her back, and was perhaps the busiest\nbee in the household hive, by reason of the manifold studies, health\nexercises and recreations she had to attend to, she secretly, and of her\nown motion, and out of love, added another task to her labors--the\nwriting of a biography of me. She did this work in her bedroom at night,\nand kept her record hidden. After a little, the mother discovered it and\nfilched it, and let me see it; then told Susy what she had done, and how\npleased I was, and how proud. I remember that time with a deep\npleasure. I had had compliments before, but none that touched me like\nthis; none that could approach it for value in my eyes. It has kept that\nplace always since. I have had no compliment, no praise, no tribute from\nany source, that was so precious to me as this one was and still is. As\nI read it _now_, after all these many years, it is still a king's\nmessage to me, and brings me the same dear surprise it brought me\nthen--with the pathos added, of the thought that the eager and hasty\nhand that sketched it and scrawled it will not touch mine again--and I\nfeel as the humble and unexpectant must feel when their eyes fall upon\nthe edict that raises them to the ranks of the noble.\n\nYesterday while I was rummaging in a pile of ancient note-books of mine\nwhich I had not seen for years, I came across a reference to that\nbiography. It is quite evident that several times, at breakfast and\ndinner, in those long-past days, I was posing for the biography. In\nfact, I clearly remember that I _was_ doing that--and I also remember\nthat Susy detected it. I remember saying a very smart thing, with a good\ndeal of an air, at the breakfast-table one morning, and that Susy\nobserved to her mother privately, a little later, that papa was doing\nthat for the biography.\n\nI cannot bring myself to change any line or word in Susy's sketch of me,\nbut will introduce passages from it now and then just as they came in\ntheir quaint simplicity out of her honest heart, which was the beautiful\nheart of a child. What comes from that source has a charm and grace of\nits own which may transgress all the recognized laws of literature, if\nit choose, and yet be literature still, and worthy of hospitality. I\nshall print the whole of this little biography, before I have done with\nit--every word, every sentence.\n\nThe spelling is frequently desperate, but it was Susy's, and it shall\nstand. I love it, and cannot profane it. To me, it is gold. To correct\nit would alloy it, not refine it. It would spoil it. It would take from\nit its freedom and flexibility and make it stiff and formal. Even when\nit is most extravagant I am not shocked. It is Susy's spelling, and she\nwas doing the best she could--and nothing could better it for me....\n\nSusy began the biography in 1885, when I was in the fiftieth year of my\nage, and she just entering the fourteenth of hers. She begins in this\nway:\n\n\n     We are a very happy family. We consist of Papa, Mamma, Jean, Clara\n     and me. It is papa I am writing about, and I shall have no trouble\n     in not knowing what to say about him, as he is a _very_ striking\n     character.\n\n\nBut wait a minute--I will return to Susy presently.\n\nIn the matter of slavish imitation, man is the monkey's superior all the\ntime. The average man is destitute of independence of opinion. He is not\ninterested in contriving an opinion of his own, by study and reflection,\nbut is only anxious to find out what his neighbor's opinion is and\nslavishly adopt it. A generation ago, I found out that the latest review\nof a book was pretty sure to be just a reflection of the _earliest_\nreview of it; that whatever the first reviewer found to praise or\ncensure in the book would be repeated in the latest reviewer's report,\nwith nothing fresh added. Therefore more than once I took the precaution\nof sending my book, in manuscript, to Mr. Howells, when he was editor of\nthe \"Atlantic Monthly,\" so that he could prepare a review of it at\nleisure. I knew he would say the truth about the book--I also knew that\nhe would find more merit than demerit in it, because I already knew that\nthat was the condition of the book. I allowed no copy of it to go out to\nthe press until after Mr. Howells's notice of it had appeared. That book\nwas always safe. There wasn't a man behind a pen in all America that had\nthe courage to find anything in the book which Mr. Howells had not\nfound--there wasn't a man behind a pen in America that had spirit enough\nto say a brave and original thing about the book on his own\nresponsibility.\n\nI believe that the trade of critic, in literature, music, and the drama,\nis the most degraded of all trades, and that it has no real\nvalue--certainly no large value. When Charles Dudley Warner and I were\nabout to bring out \"The Gilded Age,\" the editor of the \"Daily Graphic\"\npersuaded me to let him have an advance copy, he giving me his word of\nhonor that no notice of it would appear in his paper until after the\n\"Atlantic Monthly\" notice should have appeared. This reptile published a\nreview of the book within three days afterward. I could not really\ncomplain, because he had only given me his word of honor as security; I\nought to have required of him something substantial. I believe his\nnotice did not deal mainly with the merit of the book, or the lack of\nit, but with my moral attitude toward the public. It was charged that I\nhad used my reputation to play a swindle upon the public; that Mr.\nWarner had written as much as half of the book, and that I had used my\nname to float it and give it currency; a currency--so the critic\naverred--which it could not have acquired without my name, and that this\nconduct of mine was a grave fraud upon the people. The \"Graphic\" was not\nan authority upon any subject whatever. It had a sort of distinction, in\nthat it was the first and only illustrated daily newspaper that the\nworld had seen; but it was without character; it was poorly and cheaply\nedited; its opinion of a book or of any other work of art was of no\nconsequence. Everybody knew this, yet all the critics in America, one\nafter the other, copied the \"Graphic's\" criticism, merely changing the\nphraseology, and left me under that charge of dishonest conduct. Even\nthe great Chicago \"Tribune,\" the most important journal in the Middle\nWest, was not able to invent anything fresh, but adopted the view of the\nhumble \"Daily Graphic,\" dishonesty-charge and all.\n\nHowever, let it go. It is the will of God that we must have critics, and\nmissionaries, and Congressmen, and humorists, and we must bear the\nburden. Meantime, I seem to have been drifting into criticism myself.\nBut that is nothing. At the worst, criticism is nothing more than a\ncrime, and I am not unused to that.\n\nWhat I have been travelling toward all this time is this: the first\ncritic that ever had occasion to describe my personal appearance\nlittered his description with foolish and inexcusable errors whose\naggregate furnished the result that I was distinctly and distressingly\nunhandsome. That description floated around the country in the papers,\nand was in constant use and wear for a quarter of a century. It seems\nstrange to me that apparently no critic in the country could be found\nwho could look at me and have the courage to take up his pen and destroy\nthat lie. That lie began its course on the Pacific coast, in 1864, and\nit likened me in personal appearance to Petroleum V. Nasby, who had been\nout there lecturing. For twenty-five years afterward, no critic could\nfurnish a description of me without fetching in Nasby to help out my\nportrait. I knew Nasby well, and he was a good fellow, but in my life I\nhave not felt malignant enough about any more than three persons to\ncharge those persons with resembling Nasby. It hurts me to the heart. I\nwas always handsome. Anybody but a critic could have seen it. And it\nhad long been a distress to my family--including Susy--that the critics\nshould go on making this wearisome mistake, year after year, when there\nwas no foundation for it. Even when a critic wanted to be particularly\nfriendly and complimentary to me, he didn't dare to go beyond my\nclothes. He never ventured beyond that old safe frontier. When he had\nfinished with my clothes he had said all the kind things, the pleasant\nthings, the complimentary things he could risk. Then he dropped back on\nNasby.\n\nYesterday I found this clipping in the pocket of one of those ancient\nmemorandum-books of mine. It is of the date of thirty-nine years ago,\nand both the paper and the ink are yellow with the bitterness that I\nfelt in that old day when I clipped it out to preserve it and brood over\nit, and grieve about it. I will copy it here, to wit:\n\n\n     A correspondent of the Philadelphia \"Press,\" writing of one of\n     Schuyler Colfax's receptions, says of our Washington correspondent:\n     \"Mark Twain, the delicate humorist, was present: quite a lion, as\n     he deserves to be. Mark is a bachelor, faultless in taste, whose\n     snowy vest is suggestive of endless quarrels with Washington\n     washerwomen; but the heroism of Mark is settled for all time, for\n     such purity and smoothness were never seen before. His lavender\n     gloves might have been stolen from some Turkish harem, so delicate\n     were they in size; but more likely--anything else were more likely\n     than that. In form and feature he bears some resemblance to the\n     immortal Nasby; but whilst Petroleum is brunette to the core, Twain\n     is golden, amber-hued, melting, blonde.\"\n\n\nLet us return to Susy's biography now, and get the opinion of one who is\nunbiassed:\n\n_From Susy's Biography._\n\n\n     Papa's appearance has been described many times, but very\n     incorrectly. He has beautiful gray hair, not any too thick or any\n     too long, but just right; a Roman nose, which greatly improves the\n     beauty of his features; kind blue eyes and a small mustache. He has\n     a wonderfully shaped head and profile. He has a very good\n     figure--in short, he is an extrodinarily fine looking man. All his\n     features are perfect, except that he hasn't extrodinary teeth. His\n     complexion is very fair, and he doesn't ware a beard. He is a very\n     good man and a very funny one. He _has_ got a temper, but we all of\n     us have in this family. He is the loveliest man I ever saw or ever\n     hope to see--and oh, so absent-minded. He does tell perfectly\n     delightful stories. Clara and I used to sit on each arm of his\n     chair and listen while he told us stories about the pictures on the\n     wall.\n\n\nI remember the story-telling days vividly. They were a difficult and\nexacting audience--those little creatures.\n\nAlong one side of the library, in the Hartford home, the bookshelves\njoined the mantelpiece--in fact there were shelves on both sides of the\nmantelpiece. On these shelves, and on the mantelpiece, stood various\nornaments. At one end of the procession was a framed oil-painting of a\ncat's head, at the other end was a head of a beautiful young girl,\nlife-size--called Emmeline, because she looked just about like that--an\nimpressionist water-color. Between the one picture and the other there\nwere twelve or fifteen of the bric-\u00e0-brac things already mentioned; also\nan oil-painting by Elihu Vedder, \"The Young Medusa.\" Every now and then\nthe children required me to construct a romance--always impromptu--not a\nmoment's preparation permitted--and into that romance I had to get all\nthat bric-\u00e0-brac and the three pictures. I had to start always with the\ncat and finish with Emmeline. I was never allowed the refreshment of a\nchange, end-for-end. It was not permissible to introduce a bric-\u00e0-brac\nornament into the story out of its place in the procession.\n\nThese bric-\u00e0-bracs were never allowed a peaceful day, a reposeful day, a\nrestful Sabbath. In their lives there was no Sabbath, in their lives\nthere was no peace; they knew no existence but a monotonous career of\nviolence and bloodshed. In the course of time, the bric-\u00e0-brac and the\npictures showed wear. It was because they had had so many and such\ntumultuous adventures in their romantic careers.\n\nAs romancer to the children I had a hard time, even from the beginning.\nIf they brought me a picture, in a magazine, and required me to build a\nstory to it, they would cover the rest of the page with their pudgy\nhands to keep me from stealing an idea from it. The stories had to come\nhot from the bat, always. They had to be absolutely original and fresh.\nSometimes the children furnished me simply a character or two, or a\ndozen, and required me to start out at once on that slim basis and\ndeliver those characters up to a vigorous and entertaining life of\ncrime. If they heard of a new trade, or an unfamiliar animal, or\nanything like that, I was pretty sure to have to deal with those things\nin the next romance. Once Clara required me to build a sudden tale out\nof a plumber and a \"bawgunstrictor,\" and I had to do it. She didn't\nknow what a boa-constrictor was, until he developed in the tale--then\nshe was better satisfied with it than ever.\n\n_From Susy's Biography._\n\n\n     Papa's favorite game is billiards, and when he is tired and wishes\n     to rest himself he stays up all night and plays billiards, it seems\n     to rest his head. He smokes a great deal almost incessantly. He has\n     the mind of an author exactly, some of the simplest things he cant\n     understand. Our burglar-alarm is often out of order, and papa had\n     been obliged to take the mahogany-room off from the alarm\n     altogether for a time, because the burglar-alarm had been in the\n     habit of ringing even when the mahogany-room was closed. At length\n     he thought that perhaps the burglar-alarm might be in order, and he\n     decided to try and see; accordingly he put it on and then went down\n     and opened the window; consequently the alarm bell rang, it would\n     even if the alarm had been in order. Papa went despairingly\n     upstairs and said to mamma, \"Livy the mahogany-room won't go on. I\n     have just opened the window to see.\"\n\n     \"Why, Youth,\" mamma replied \"if you've opened the window, why of\n     coarse the alarm will ring!\"\n\n     \"That's what I've opened it for, why I just went down to see if it\n     would ring!\"\n\n     Mamma tried to explain to papa that when he wanted to go and see\n     whether the alarm would ring while the window was closed he\n     _mustn't_ go and open the window--but in vain, papa couldn't\n     understand, and got very impatient with mamma for trying to make\n     him believe an impossible thing true.\n\n\nThis is a frank biographer, and an honest one; she uses no sand-paper on\nme. I have, to this day, the same dull head in the matter of conundrums\nand perplexities which Susy had discovered in those long-gone days.\nComplexities annoy me; they irritate me; then this progressive feeling\npresently warms into anger. I cannot get far in the reading of the\ncommonest and simplest contract--with its \"parties of the first part,\"\nand \"parties of the second part,\" and \"parties of the third\npart,\"--before my temper is all gone. Ashcroft comes up here every day\nand pathetically tries to make me understand the points of the lawsuit\nwhich we are conducting against Henry Butters, Harold Wheeler, and the\nrest of those Plasmon buccaneers, but daily he has to give it up. It is\npitiful to see, when he bends his earnest and appealing eyes upon me and\nsays, after one of his efforts, \"Now you _do_ understand _that_, don't\nyou?\"\n\nI am always obliged to say, \"I _don't_, Ashcroft. I wish I could\nunderstand it, but I don't. Send for the cat.\"\n\nIn the days which Susy is talking about, a perplexity fell to my lot one\nday. F. G. Whitmore was my business agent, and he brought me out from\ntown in his buggy. We drove by the _porte-coch\u00e8re_ and toward the\nstable. Now this was a _single_ road, and was like a spoon whose handle\nstretched from the gate to a great round flower-bed in the neighborhood\nof the stable. At the approach to the flower-bed the road divided and\ncircumnavigated it, making a loop, which I have likened to the bowl of\nthe spoon. As we neared the loop, I saw that Whitmore was laying his\ncourse to port, (I was sitting on the starboard side--the side the house\nwas on), and was going to start around that spoon-bowl on that left-hand\nside. I said,\n\n\"Don't do that, Whitmore; take the right-hand side. Then I shall be next\nto the house when we get to the door.\"\n\nHe said, \"_That_ will not happen in _any case_, it doesn't make any\ndifference which way I go around this flower-bed.\"\n\nI explained to him that he was an ass, but he stuck to his proposition,\nand I said,\n\n\"Go on and try it, and see.\"\n\nHe went on and tried it, and sure enough he fetched me up at the door on\nthe very side that he had said I would be. I was not able to believe it\nthen, and I don't believe it yet.\n\nI said, \"Whitmore, that is merely an accident. You can't do it again.\"\n\nHe said he could--and he drove down into the street, fetched around,\ncame back, and actually did it again. I was stupefied, paralyzed,\npetrified, with these strange results, but they did not convince me. I\ndidn't believe he could do it another time, but he did. He said he could\ndo it all day, and fetch up the same way every time. By that time my\ntemper was gone, and I asked him to go home and apply to the Asylum and\nI would pay the expenses; I didn't want to see him any more for a week.\n\nI went up-stairs in a rage and started to tell Livy about it, expecting\nto get her sympathy for me and to breed aversion in her for Whitmore;\nbut she merely burst into peal after peal of laughter, as the tale of my\nadventure went on, for her head was like Susy's: riddles and\ncomplexities had no terrors for it. Her mind and Susy's were analytical;\nI have tried to make it appear that mine was different. Many and many a\ntime I have told that buggy experiment, hoping against hope that I would\nsome time or other find somebody who would be on my side, but it has\nnever happened. And I am never able to go glibly forward and state the\ncircumstances of that buggy's progress without having to halt and\nconsider, and call up in my mind the spoon-handle, the bowl of the\nspoon, the buggy and the horse, and my position in the buggy: and the\nminute I have got that far and try to turn it to the left it goes to\nruin; I can't see how it is ever going to fetch me out right when we get\nto the door. Susy is right in her estimate. I can't understand things.\n\nThat burglar-alarm which Susy mentions led a gay and careless life, and\nhad no principles. It was generally out of order at one point or\nanother; and there was plenty of opportunity, because all the windows\nand doors in the house, from the cellar up to the top floor, were\nconnected with it. However, in its seasons of being out of order it\ncould trouble us for only a very little while: we quickly found out that\nit was fooling us, and that it was buzzing its blood-curdling alarm\nmerely for its own amusement. Then we would shut it off, and send to New\nYork for the electrician--there not being one in all Hartford in those\ndays. When the repairs were finished we would set the alarm again and\nreestablish our confidence in it. It never did any real business except\nupon one single occasion. All the rest of its expensive career was\nfrivolous and without purpose. Just that one time it performed its duty,\nand its whole duty--gravely, seriously, admirably. It let fly about two\no'clock one black and dreary March morning, and I turned out promptly,\nbecause I knew that it was not fooling, this time. The bath-room door\nwas on my side of the bed. I stepped in there, turned up the gas, looked\nat the annunciator, and turned off the alarm--so far as the door\nindicated was concerned--thus stopping the racket. Then I came back to\nbed. Mrs. Clemens opened the debate:\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"It was the cellar door.\"\n\n\"Was it a burglar, do you think?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"of course it was. Did you suppose it was a Sunday-school\nsuperintendent?\"\n\n\"No. What do you suppose he wants?\"\n\n\"I suppose he wants jewelry, but he is not acquainted with the house and\nhe thinks it is in the cellar. I don't like to disappoint a burglar whom\nI am not acquainted with, and who has done me no harm, but if he had\nhad common sagacity enough to inquire, I could have told him we kept\nnothing down there but coal and vegetables. Still it may be that he is\nacquainted with the place, and that what he really wants is coal and\nvegetables. On the whole, I think it is vegetables he is after.\"\n\n\"Are you going down to see?\"\n\n\"No; I could not be of any assistance. Let him select for himself; I\ndon't know where the things are.\"\n\nThen she said, \"But suppose he comes up to the ground floor!\"\n\n\"That's all right. We shall know it the minute he opens a door on that\nfloor. It will set off the alarm.\"\n\nJust then the terrific buzzing broke out again. I said,\n\n\"He has arrived. I told you he would. I know all about burglars and\ntheir ways. They are systematic people.\"\n\nI went into the bath-room to see if I was right, and I was. I shut off\nthe dining-room and stopped the buzzing, and came back to bed. My wife\nsaid,\n\n\"What do you suppose he is after now?\"\n\nI said, \"I think he has got all the vegetables he wants and is coming up\nfor napkin-rings and odds and ends for the wife and children. They all\nhave families--burglars have--and they are always thoughtful of them,\nalways take a few necessaries of life for themselves, and fill out with\ntokens of remembrance for the family. In taking them they do not forget\nus: those very things represent tokens of his remembrance of us, and\nalso of our remembrance of him. We never get them again; the memory of\nthe attention remains embalmed in our hearts.\"\n\n\"Are you going down to see what it is he wants now?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"I am no more interested than I was before. They are\nexperienced people,--burglars; _they_ know what they want; I should be\nno help to him. I _think_ he is after ceramics and bric-\u00e0-brac and such\nthings. If he knows the house he knows that that is all that he can find\non the dining-room floor.\"\n\nShe said, with a strong interest perceptible in her tone, \"Suppose he\ncomes up here!\"\n\nI said, \"It is all right. He will give us notice.\"\n\n\"What shall we do then then?\"\n\n\"Climb out of the window.\"\n\nShe said, a little restively, \"Well, what is the use of a burglar-alarm\nfor us?\"\n\n\"You have seen, dear heart, that it has been useful up to the present\nmoment, and I have explained to you how it will be continuously useful\nafter he gets up here.\"\n\nThat was the end of it. He didn't ring any more alarms. Presently I\nsaid,\n\n\"He is disappointed, I think. He has gone off with the vegetables and\nthe bric-\u00e0-brac, and I think he is dissatisfied.\"\n\nWe went to sleep, and at a quarter before eight in the morning I was\nout, and hurrying, for I was to take the 8.29 train for New York. I\nfound the gas burning brightly--full head--all over the first floor. My\nnew overcoat was gone; my old umbrella was gone; my new patent-leather\nshoes, which I had never worn, were gone. The large window which opened\ninto the _ombra_ at the rear of the house was standing wide. I passed\nout through it and tracked the burglar down the hill through the trees;\ntracked him without difficulty, because he had blazed his progress with\nimitation silver napkin-rings, and my umbrella, and various other things\nwhich he had disapproved of; and I went back in triumph and proved to my\nwife that he _was_ a disappointed burglar. I had suspected he would be,\nfrom the start, and from his not coming up to our floor to get human\nbeings.\n\nThings happened to me that day in New York. I will tell about them\nanother time.\n\n_From Susy's Biography._\n\n\n     Papa has a peculiar gait we like, it seems just to sute him, but\n     most people do not; he always walks up and down the room while\n     thinking and between each coarse at meals.\n\n\nA lady distantly related to us came to visit us once in those days. She\ncame to stay a week, but all our efforts to make her happy failed, we\ncould not imagine why, and she got up her anchor and sailed the next\nmorning. We did much guessing, but could not solve the mystery. Later we\nfound out what the trouble was. It was my tramping up and down between\nthe courses. She conceived the idea that I could not stand her society.\n\nThat word \"Youth,\" as the reader has perhaps already guessed, was my\nwife's pet name for me. It was gently satirical, but also affectionate.\nI had certain mental and material peculiarities and customs proper to a\nmuch younger person than I was.\n\n_From Susy's Biography._\n\n\n     Papa is very fond of animals particularly of cats, we had a dear\n     little gray kitten once that he named \"Lazy\" (papa always wears\n     gray to match his hair and eyes) and he would carry him around on\n     his shoulder, it was a mighty pretty sight! the gray cat sound\n     asleep against papa's gray coat and hair. The names that he has\n     given our different cats, are realy remarkably funny, they are\n     namely Stray Kit, Abner, Motley, Fraeulein, Lazy, Bufalo Bill,\n     Cleveland, Sour Mash, and Pestilence and Famine.\n\n\nAt one time when the children were small, we had a very black mother-cat\nnamed Satan, and Satan had a small black offspring named Sin. Pronouns\nwere a difficulty for the children. Little Clara came in one day, her\nblack eyes snapping with indignation, and said,\n\n\"Papa, Satan ought to be punished. She is out there at the greenhouse\nand there she stays and stays, and his kitten is down-stairs crying.\"\n\n_From Susy's Biography._\n\n\n     Papa uses very strong language, but I have an idea not nearly so\n     strong as when he first maried mamma. A lady acquaintance of his is\n     rather apt to interupt what one is saying, and papa told mamma that\n     he thought he should say to the lady's husband \"I am glad your wife\n     wasn't present when the Deity said 'Let there be light.'\"\n\n\nIt is as I have said before. This is a frank historian. She doesn't\ncover up one's deficiencies, but gives them an equal showing with one's\nhandsomer qualities. Of course I made the remark which she has\nquoted--and even at this distant day I am still as much as half\npersuaded that if that lady had been present when the Creator said, \"Let\nthere be light,\" she would have interrupted Him and we shouldn't ever\nhave got it.\n\n_From Susy's Biography._\n\n\n     Papa said the other day, \"I am a mugwump and a mugwump is pure from\n     the marrow out.\" (Papa knows that I am writing this biography of\n     him, and he said this for it.) He doesn't like to go to church at\n     all, why I never understood, until just now, he told us the other\n     day that he couldn't bear to hear any one talk but himself, but\n     that he could listen to himself talk for hours without getting\n     tired, of course he said this in joke, but I've no dought it was\n     founded on truth.\n\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCII.\n\nNOVEMBER 2, 1906.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--V.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\nSusy's remark about my strong language troubles me, and I must go back\nto it. All through the first ten years of my married life I kept a\nconstant and discreet watch upon my tongue while in the house, and went\noutside and to a distance when circumstances were too much for me and I\nwas obliged to seek relief. I prized my wife's respect and approval\nabove all the rest of the human race's respect and approval. I dreaded\nthe day when she should discover that I was but a whited sepulchre\npartly freighted with suppressed language. I was so careful, during ten\nyears, that I had not a doubt that my suppressions had been successful.\nTherefore I was quite as happy in my guilt as I could have been if I had\nbeen innocent.\n\nBut at last an accident exposed me. I went into the bath-room one\nmorning to make my toilet, and carelessly left the door two or three\ninches ajar. It was the first time that I had ever failed to take the\nprecaution of closing it tightly. I knew the necessity of being\nparticular about this, because shaving was always a trying ordeal for\nme, and I could seldom carry it through to a finish without verbal\nhelps. Now this time I was unprotected, but did not suspect it. I had no\nextraordinary trouble with my razor on this occasion, and was able to\nworry through with mere mutterings and growlings of an improper sort,\nbut with nothing noisy or emphatic about them--no snapping and barking.\nThen I put on a shirt. My shirts are an invention of my own. They open\nin the back, and are buttoned there--when there are buttons. This time\nthe button was missing. My temper jumped up several degrees in a moment,\nand my remarks rose accordingly, both in loudness and vigor of\nexpression. But I was not troubled, for the bath-room door was a solid\none and I supposed it was firmly closed. I flung up the window and threw\nthe shirt out. It fell upon the shrubbery where the people on their way\nto church could admire it if they wanted to; there was merely fifty feet\nof grass between the shirt and the passer-by. Still rumbling and\nthundering distantly, I put on another shirt. Again the button was\nabsent. I augmented my language to meet the emergency, and threw that\nshirt out of the window. I was too angry--too insane--to examine the\nthird shirt, but put it furiously on. Again the button was absent, and\nthat shirt followed its comrades out of the window. Then I straightened\nup, gathered my reserves, and let myself go like a cavalry charge. In\nthe midst of that great assault, my eye fell upon that gaping door, and\nI was paralyzed.\n\nIt took me a good while to finish my toilet. I extended the time\nunnecessarily in trying to make up my mind as to what I would best do in\nthe circumstances. I tried to hope that Mrs. Clemens was asleep, but I\nknew better. I could not escape by the window. It was narrow, and suited\nonly to shirts. At last I made up my mind to boldly loaf through the\nbedroom with the air of a person who had not been doing anything. I made\nhalf the journey successfully. I did not turn my eyes in her direction,\nbecause that would not be safe. It is very difficult to look as if you\nhave not been doing anything when the facts are the other way, and my\nconfidence in my performance oozed steadily out of me as I went along. I\nwas aiming for the left-hand door because it was furthest from my wife.\nIt had never been opened from the day that the house was built, but it\nseemed a blessed refuge for me now. The bed was this one, wherein I am\nlying now, and dictating these histories morning after morning with so\nmuch serenity. It was this same old elaborately carved black Venetian\nbedstead--the most comfortable bedstead that ever was, with space enough\nin it for a family, and carved angels enough surmounting its twisted\ncolumns and its headboard and footboard to bring peace to the sleepers,\nand pleasant dreams. I had to stop in the middle of the room. I hadn't\nthe strength to go on. I believed that I was under accusing eyes--that\neven the carved angels were inspecting me with an unfriendly gaze. You\nknow how it is when you are convinced that somebody behind you is\nlooking steadily at you. You _have_ to turn your face--you can't help\nit. I turned mine. The bed was placed as it is now, with the foot where\nthe head ought to be. If it had been placed as it should have been, the\nhigh headboard would have sheltered me. But the footboard was no\nsufficient protection, for I could be seen over it. I was exposed. I was\nwholly without protection. I turned, because I couldn't help it--and my\nmemory of what I saw is still vivid, after all these years.\n\nAgainst the white pillows I saw the black head--I saw that young and\nbeautiful face; and I saw the gracious eyes with a something in them\nwhich I had never seen there before. They were snapping and flashing\nwith indignation. I felt myself crumbling; I felt myself shrinking away\nto nothing under that accusing gaze. I stood silent under that\ndesolating fire for as much as a minute, I should say--it seemed a very,\nvery long time. Then my wife's lips parted, and from them issued--_my\nlatest bath-room remark_. The language perfect, but the expression\nvelvety, unpractical, apprenticelike, ignorant, inexperienced, comically\ninadequate, absurdly weak and unsuited to the great language. In my\nlifetime I had never heard anything so out of tune, so inharmonious, so\nincongruous, so ill-suited to each other as were those mighty words set\nto that feeble music. I tried to keep from laughing, for I was a guilty\nperson in deep need of charity and mercy. I tried to keep from\nbursting, and I succeeded--until she gravely said, \"There, now you know\nhow it sounds.\"\n\nThen I exploded; the air was filled with my fragments, and you could\nhear them whiz. I said, \"Oh Livy, if it sounds like _that_ I will never\ndo it again!\"\n\nThen she had to laugh herself. Both of us broke into convulsions, and\nwent on laughing until we were physically exhausted and spiritually\nreconciled.\n\nThe children were present at breakfast--Clara aged six and Susy\neight--and the mother made a guarded remark about strong language;\nguarded because she did not wish the children to suspect anything--a\nguarded remark which censured strong language. Both children broke out\nin one voice with this comment, \"Why, mamma, papa uses it!\"\n\nI was astonished. I had supposed that that secret was safe in my own\nbreast, and that its presence had never been suspected. I asked,\n\n\"How did you know, you little rascals?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" they said, \"we often listen over the balusters when you are in the\nhall explaining things to George.\"\n\n_From Susy's Biography._\n\n\n     One of papa's latest books is \"The Prince and the Pauper\" and it is\n     unquestionably the best book he has ever written, some people want\n     him to keep to his old style, some gentleman wrote him, \"I enjoyed\n     Huckleberry Finn immensely and am glad to see that you have\n     returned to your old style.\" That enoyed me that enoyed me greatly,\n     because it trobles me [Susy was troubled by that word, and\n     uncertain; she wrote a u above it in the proper place, but\n     reconsidered the matter and struck it out] to have so few people\n     know papa, I mean realy know him, they think of Mark Twain as a\n     humorist joking at everything; \"And with a mop of reddish brown\n     hair which sorely needs the barbars brush a roman nose, short\n     stubby mustache, a sad care-worn face, with maney crow's feet\" etc.\n     That is the way people picture papa, I have wanted papa to write a\n     book that would reveal something of his kind sympathetic nature,\n     and \"The Prince and the Pauper\" partly does it. The book is full of\n     lovely charming ideas, and oh the language! It is _perfect_. I\n     think that one of the most touching scenes in it, is where the\n     pauper is riding on horseback with his nobles in the \"recognition\n     procession\" and he sees his mother oh and then what followed! How\n     she runs to his side, when she sees him throw up his hand palm\n     outward, and is rudely pushed off by one of the King's officers,\n     and then how the little pauper's consceince troubles him when he\n     remembers the shameful words that were falling from his lips, when\n     she was turned from his side \"I know you not woman\" and how his\n     grandeurs were stricken valueless, and his pride consumed to ashes.\n     It is a wonderfully beautiful and touching little scene, and papa\n     has described it so wonderfully. I never saw a man with so much\n     variety of feeling as papa has; now the \"Prince and the Pauper\" is\n     full of touching places; but there is most always a streak of humor\n     in them somewhere. Now in the coronation--in the stirring\n     coronation, just after the little king has got his crown back again\n     papa brings that in about the Seal, where the pauper says he used\n     the Seal \"to crack nuts with.\" Oh it is so funny and nice! Papa\n     very seldom writes a passage without some humor in it somewhere,\n     and I dont think he ever will.\n\n\nThe children always helped their mother to edit my books in manuscript.\nShe would sit on the porch at the farm and read aloud, with her pencil\nin her hand, and the children would keep an alert and suspicious eye\nupon her right along, for the belief was well grounded in them that\nwhenever she came across a particularly satisfactory passage she would\nstrike it out. Their suspicions were well founded. The passages which\nwere so satisfactory to them always had an element of strength in them\nwhich sorely needed modification or expurgation, and were always sure to\nget it at their mother's hand. For my own entertainment, and to enjoy\nthe protests of the children, I often abused my editor's innocent\nconfidence. I often interlarded remarks of a studied and felicitously\natrocious character purposely to achieve the children's brief delight,\nand then see the remorseless pencil do its fatal work. I often joined my\nsupplications to the children's for mercy, and strung the argument out\nand pretended to be in earnest. They were deceived, and so was their\nmother. It was three against one, and most unfair. But it was very\ndelightful, and I could not resist the temptation. Now and then we\ngained the victory and there was much rejoicing. Then I privately struck\nthe passage out myself. It had served its purpose. It had furnished\nthree of us with good entertainment, and in being removed from the book\nby me it was only suffering the fate originally intended for it.\n\n_From Susy's Biography._\n\n\n     Papa was born in Missouri. His mother is Grandma Clemens (Jane\n     Lampton Clemens) of Kentucky. Grandpa Clemens was of the F.F.V's of\n     Virginia.\n\n\nWithout doubt it was I that gave Susy that impression. I cannot imagine\nwhy, because I was never in my life much impressed by grandeurs which\nproceed from the accident of birth. I did not get this indifference from\nmy mother. She was always strongly interested in the ancestry of the\nhouse. She traced her own line back to the Lambtons of Durham,\nEngland--a family which had been occupying broad lands there since Saxon\ntimes. I am not sure, but I think that those Lambtons got along without\ntitles of nobility for eight or nine hundred years, then produced a\ngreat man, three-quarters of a century ago, and broke into the peerage.\nMy mother knew all about the Clemenses of Virginia, and loved to\naggrandize them to me, but she has long been dead. There has been no one\nto keep those details fresh in my memory, and they have grown dim.\n\nThere was a Jere. Clemens who was a United States Senator, and in his\nday enjoyed the usual Senatorial fame--a fame which perishes whether it\nspring from four years' service or forty. After Jere. Clemens's fame as\na Senator passed away, he was still remembered for many years on account\nof another service which he performed. He shot old John Brown's Governor\nWise in the hind leg in a duel. However, I am not very clear about this.\nIt may be that Governor Wise shot _him_ in the hind leg. However, I\ndon't think it is important. I think that the only thing that is really\nimportant is that one of them got shot in the hind leg. It would have\nbeen better and nobler and more historical and satisfactory if both of\nthem had got shot in the hind leg--but it is of no use for me to try to\nrecollect history. I never had a historical mind. Let it go. Whichever\nway it happened I am glad of it, and that is as much enthusiasm as I can\nget up for a person bearing my name. But I am forgetting the first\nClemens--the one that stands furthest back toward the really original\n_first_ Clemens, which was Adam.\n\n_From Susy's Biography._\n\n\n     Clara and I are sure that papa played the trick on Grandma, about\n     the whipping, that is related in \"The Adventures of Tom Sayer\":\n     \"Hand me that switch.\" The switch hovered in the air, the peril was\n     desperate--\"My, look behind you Aunt!\" The old lady whirled around\n     and snatched her skirts out of danger. The lad fled on the instant,\n     scrambling up the high board fence and dissapeared over it.\n\n\nSusy and Clara were quite right about that.\n\nThen Susy says:\n\n\n     And we know papa played \"Hookey\" all the time. And how readily\n     would papa pretend to be dying so as not to have to go to school!\n\n\nThese revelations and exposures are searching, but they are just If I am\nas transparent to other people as I was to Susy, I have wasted much\neffort in this life.\n\n\n     Grandma couldn't make papa go to school, no she let him go into a\n     printing-office to learn the trade. He did so, and gradually picked\n     up enough education to enable him to do about as well as those who\n     were more studious in early life.\n\n\nIt is noticeable that Susy does not get overheated when she is\ncomplimenting me, but maintains a proper judicial and biographical calm.\nIt is noticeable, also, and it is to her credit as a biographer, that\nshe distributes compliment and criticism with a fair and even hand.\n\nMy mother had a good deal of trouble with me, but I think she enjoyed\nit. She had none at all with my brother Henry, who was two years younger\nthan I, and I think that the unbroken monotony of his goodness and\ntruthfulness and obedience would have been a burden to her but for the\nrelief and variety which I furnished in the other direction. I was a\ntonic. I was valuable to her. I never thought of it before, but now I\nsee it. I never knew Henry to do a vicious thing toward me, or toward\nany one else--but he frequently did righteous ones that cost me as\nheavily. It was his duty to report me, when I needed reporting and\nneglected to do it myself, and he was very faithful in discharging that\nduty. He is \"Sid\" in \"Tom Sawyer.\" But Sid was not Henry. Henry was a\nvery much finer and better boy than ever Sid was.\n\nIt was Henry who called my mother's attention to the fact that the\nthread with which she had sewed my collar together to keep me from going\nin swimming, had changed color. My mother would not have discovered it\nbut for that, and she was manifestly piqued when she recognized that\nthat prominent bit of circumstantial evidence had escaped her sharp eye.\nThat detail probably added a detail to my punishment. It is human. We\ngenerally visit our shortcomings on somebody else when there is a\npossible excuse for it--but no matter, I took it out of Henry. There is\nalways compensation for such as are unjustly used. I often took it out\nof him--sometimes as an advance payment for something which I hadn't yet\ndone. These were occasions when the opportunity was too strong a\ntemptation, and I had to draw on the future. I did not need to copy this\nidea from my mother, and probably didn't. Still she wrought upon that\nprinciple upon occasion.\n\nIf the incident of the broken sugar-bowl is in \"Tom Sawyer\"--I don't\nremember whether it is or not--that is an example of it. Henry never\nstole sugar. He took it openly from the bowl. His mother knew he\nwouldn't take sugar when she wasn't looking, but she had her doubts\nabout me. Not exactly doubts, either. She knew very well I _would._ One\nday when she was not present, Henry took sugar from her prized and\nprecious old English sugar-bowl, which was an heirloom in the\nfamily--and he managed to break the bowl. It was the first time I had\never had a chance to tell anything on him, and I was inexpressibly glad.\nI told him I was going to tell on him, but he was not disturbed. When my\nmother came in and saw the bowl lying on the floor in fragments, she was\nspeechless for a minute. I allowed that silence to work; I judged it\nwould increase the effect. I was waiting for her to ask \"Who did\nthat?\"--so that I could fetch out my news. But it was an error of\ncalculation. When she got through with her silence she didn't ask\nanything about it--she merely gave me a crack on the skull with her\nthimble that I felt all the way down to my heels. Then I broke out with\nmy injured innocence, expecting to make her very sorry that she had\npunished the wrong one. I expected her to do something remorseful and\npathetic. I told her that I was not the one--it was Henry. But there was\nno upheaval. She said, without emotion, \"It's all right. It isn't any\nmatter. You deserve it for something you've done that I didn't know\nabout; and if you haven't done it, why then you deserve it for something\nthat you are going to do, that I sha'n't hear about.\"\n\nThere was a stairway outside the house, which led up to the rear part of\nthe second story. One day Henry was sent on an errand, and he took a tin\nbucket along. I knew he would have to ascend those stairs, so I went up\nand locked the door on the inside, and came down into the garden, which\nhad been newly ploughed and was rich in choice firm clods of black mold.\nI gathered a generous equipment of these, and ambushed him. I waited\ntill he had climbed the stairs and was near the landing and couldn't\nescape. Then I bombarded him with clods, which he warded off with his\ntin bucket the best he could, but without much success, for I was a good\nmarksman. The clods smashing against the weather-boarding fetched my\nmother out to see what was the matter, and I tried to explain that I was\namusing Henry. Both of them were after me in a minute, but I knew the\nway over that high board fence and escaped for that time. After an hour\nor two, when I ventured back, there was no one around and I thought the\nincident was closed. But it was not. Henry was ambushing me. With an\nunusually competent aim for him, he landed a stone on the side of my\nhead which raised a bump there that felt like the Matterhorn. I carried\nit to my mother straightway for sympathy, but she was not strongly\nmoved. It seemed to be her idea that incidents like this would\neventually reform me if I harvested enough of them. So the matter was\nonly educational. I had had a sterner view of it than that, before.\n\nIt was not right to give the cat the \"Pain-Killer\"; I realize it now. I\nwould not repeat it in these days. But in those \"Tom Sawyer\" days it was\na great and sincere satisfaction to me to see Peter perform under its\ninfluence--and if actions _do_ speak as loud as words, he took as much\ninterest in it as I did. It was a most detestable medicine, Perry\nDavis's Pain-Killer. Mr. Pavey's negro man, who was a person of good\njudgment and considerable curiosity, wanted to sample it, and I let him.\nIt was his opinion that it was made of hell-fire.\n\nThose were the cholera days of '49. The people along the Mississippi\nwere paralyzed with fright. Those who could run away, did it. And many\ndied of fright in the flight. Fright killed three persons where the\ncholera killed one. Those who couldn't flee kept themselves drenched\nwith cholera preventives, and my mother chose Perry Davis's Pain-Killer\nfor me. She was not distressed about herself. She avoided that kind of\npreventive. But she made me promise to take a teaspoonful of Pain-Killer\nevery day. Originally it was my intention to keep the promise, but at\nthat time I didn't know as much about Pain-Killer as I knew after my\nfirst experiment with it. She didn't watch Henry's bottle--she could\ntrust Henry. But she marked my bottle with a pencil, on the label, every\nday, and examined it to see if the teaspoonful had been removed. The\nfloor was not carpeted. It had cracks in it, and I fed the Pain-Killer\nto the cracks with very good results--no cholera occurred down below.\n\nIt was upon one of these occasions that that friendly cat came waving\nhis tail and supplicating for Pain-Killer--which he got--and then went\ninto those hysterics which ended with his colliding with all the\nfurniture in the room and finally going out of the open window and\ncarrying the flower-pots with him, just in time for my mother to arrive\nand look over her glasses in petrified astonishment and say, \"What in\nthe world is the matter with Peter?\"\n\nI don't remember what my explanation was, but if it is recorded in that\nbook it may not be the right one.\n\nWhenever my conduct was of such exaggerated impropriety that my mother's\nextemporary punishments were inadequate, she saved the matter up for\nSunday, and made me go to church Sunday night--which was a penalty\nsometimes bearable, perhaps, but as a rule it was not, and I avoided it\nfor the sake of my constitution. She would never believe that I had been\nto church until she had applied her test: she made me tell her what the\ntext was. That was a simple matter, and caused me no trouble. I didn't\nhave to go to church to get a text. I selected one for myself. This\nworked very well until one time when my text and the one furnished by a\nneighbor, who had been to church, didn't tally. After that my mother\ntook other methods. I don't know what they were now.\n\nIn those days men and boys wore rather long cloaks in the winter-time.\nThey were black, and were lined with very bright and showy Scotch\nplaids. One winter's night when I was starting to church to square a\ncrime of some kind committed during the week, I hid my cloak near the\ngate and went off and played with the other boys until church was over.\nThen I returned home. But in the dark I put the cloak on wrong side out,\nentered the room, threw the cloak aside, and then stood the usual\nexamination. I got along very well until the temperature of the church\nwas mentioned. My mother said,\n\n\"It must have been impossible to keep warm there on such a night.\"\n\nI didn't see the art of that remark, and was foolish enough to explain\nthat I wore my cloak all the time that I was in church. She asked if I\nkept it on from church home, too. I didn't see the bearing of that\nremark. I said that that was what I had done. She said,\n\n\"You wore it in church with that red Scotch plaid outside and glaring?\nDidn't that attract any attention?\"\n\nOf course to continue such a dialogue would have been tedious and\nunprofitable, and I let it go, and took the consequences.\n\nThat was about 1849. Tom Nash was a boy of my own age--the postmaster's\nson. The Mississippi was frozen across, and he and I went skating one\nnight, probably without permission. I cannot see why we should go\nskating in the night unless without permission, for there could be no\nconsiderable amusement to be gotten out of skating at night if nobody\nwas going to object to it. About midnight, when we were more than half a\nmile out toward the Illinois shore, we heard some ominous rumbling and\ngrinding and crashing going on between us and the home side of the\nriver, and we knew what it meant--the ice was breaking up. We started\nfor home, pretty badly scared. We flew along at full speed whenever the\nmoonlight sifting down between the clouds enabled us to tell which was\nice and which was water. In the pauses we waited; started again whenever\nthere was a good bridge of ice; paused again when we came to naked water\nand waited in distress until a floating vast cake should bridge that\nplace. It took us an hour to make the trip--a trip which we made in a\nmisery of apprehension all the time. But at last we arrived within a\nvery brief distance of the shore. We waited again; there was another\nplace that needed bridging. All about us the ice was plunging and\ngrinding along and piling itself up in mountains on the shore, and the\ndangers were increasing, not diminishing. We grew very impatient to get\nto solid ground, so we started too early and went springing from cake to\ncake. Tom made a miscalculation, and fell short. He got a bitter bath,\nbut he was so close to shore that he only had to swim a stroke or\ntwo--then his feet struck hard bottom and he crawled out. I arrived a\nlittle later, without accident. We had been in a drenching perspiration,\nand Tom's bath was a disaster for him. He took to his bed sick, and had\na procession of diseases. The closing one was scarlet-fever, and he came\nout of it stone deaf. Within a year or two speech departed, of course.\nBut some years later he was taught to talk, after a fashion--one\ncouldn't always make out what it was he was trying to say. Of course he\ncould not modulate his voice, since he couldn't hear himself talk. When\nhe supposed he was talking low and confidentially, you could hear him in\nIllinois.\n\nFour years ago (1902) I was invited by the University of Missouri to\ncome out there and receive the honorary degree of LL.D. I took that\nopportunity to spend a week in Hannibal--a city now, a village in my\nday. It had been fifty-three years since Tom Nash and I had had that\nadventure. When I was at the railway station ready to leave Hannibal,\nthere was a crowd of citizens there. I saw Tom Nash approaching me\nacross a vacant space, and I walked toward him, for I recognized him at\nonce. He was old and white-headed, but the boy of fifteen was still\nvisible in him. He came up to me, made a trumpet of his hands at my ear,\nnodded his head toward the citizens and said confidentially--in a yell\nlike a fog-horn--\n\n\"Same damned fools, Sam!\"\n\n_From Susy's Biography._\n\n\n     Papa was about twenty years old when he went on the Mississippi as\n     a pilot. Just before he started on his tripp Grandma Clemens asked\n     him to promise her on the Bible not to touch intoxicating liquors\n     or swear, and he said \"Yes, mother, I will,\" and he kept that\n     promise seven years when Grandma released him from it.\n\n\nUnder the inspiring influence of that remark, what a garden of forgotten\nreforms rises upon my sight!\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCIII.\n\nNOVEMBER 16, 1906.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--VI.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n_From Susy's Biography_.\n\n\n     Papa made arrangements to read at Vassar College the 1st of May,\n     and I went with him. We went by way of New York City. Mamma went\n     with us to New York and stayed two days to do some shopping. We\n     started Tuesday, at 1/2 past two o'clock in the afternoon, and\n     reached New York about 1/4 past six. Papa went right up to General\n     Grants from the station and mamma and I went to the Everett House.\n     Aunt Clara came to supper with us up in our room....\n\n     We and Aunt Clara were going were going to the theatre right after\n     supper, and we expected papa to take us there and to come home as\n     early as he could. But we got through dinner and he didn't come,\n     and didn't come, and mamma got more perplexed and worried, but at\n     last we thought we would have to go without him. So we put on our\n     things and started down stairs but before we'd goten half down we\n     met papa coming up with a great bunch of roses in his hand. He\n     explained that the reason he was so late was that his watch stopped\n     and he didn't notice and kept thinking it an hour earlier than it\n     really was. The roses he carried were some Col. Fred Grant sent to\n     mamma. We went to the theatre and enjoyed \"Adonis\" [word illegible]\n     acted very much. We reached home about 1/2 past eleven o'clock and\n     went right to bed. Wednesday morning we got up rather late and had\n     breakfast about 1/2 past nine o'clock. After breakfast mamma went\n     out shopping and papa and I went to see papa's agent about some\n     business matters. After papa had gotten through talking to Cousin\n     Charlie, [Webster] papa's agent, we went to get a friend of papa's,\n     Major Pond, to go and see a Dog Show with us. Then we went to see\n     the dogs with Major Pond and we had a delightful time seeing so\n     many dogs together; when we got through seeing the dogs papa\n     thought he would go and see General Grant and I went with him--this\n     was April 29, 1885. Papa went up into General Grant's room and he\n     took me with him, I felt greatly honored and delighted when papa\n     took me into General Grant's room and let me see the General and\n     Col. Grant, for General Grant is a man I shall be glad all my life\n     that I have seen. Papa and General Grant had a long talk together\n     and papa has written an account of his talk and visit with General\n     Grant for me to put into this biography.\n\n\nSusy has inserted in this place that account of mine--as follows:\n\n\n                                                    April 29, 1885.\n\n     I called on General Grant and took Susy with me. The General was\n     looking and feeling far better than he had looked or felt for some\n     months. He had ventured to work again on his book that morning--the\n     first time he had done any work for perhaps a month. This morning's\n     work was his first attempt at dictating, and it was a thorough\n     success, to his great delight. He had always said that it would be\n     impossible for him to dictate anything, but I had said that he was\n     noted for clearness of statement, and as a narrative was simply a\n     statement of consecutive facts, he was consequently peculiarly\n     qualified and equipped for dictation. This turned out to be true.\n     For he had dictated two hours that morning to a shorthand writer,\n     had never hesitated for words, had not repeated himself, and the\n     manuscript when finished needed no revision. The two hours' work\n     was an account of Appomattox--and this was such an extremely\n     important feature that his book would necessarily have been\n     severely lame without it. Therefore I had taken a shorthand writer\n     there before, to see if I could not get him to write at least a few\n     lines about Appomattox.[5] But he was at that time not well enough\n     to undertake it. I was aware that of all the hundred versions of\n     Appomattox, not one was really correct. Therefore I was extremely\n     anxious that he should leave behind him the truth. His throat was\n     not distressing him, and his voice was much better and stronger\n     than usual. He was so delighted to have gotten Appomattox\n     accomplished once more in his life--to have gotten the matter off\n     his mind--that he was as talkative as his old self. He received\n     Susy very pleasantly, and then fell to talking about certain\n     matters which he hoped to be able to dictate next day; and he said\n     in substance that, among other things, he wanted to settle once for\n     all a question that had been bandied about from mouth to mouth and\n     from newspaper to newspaper. That question was, \"With whom\n     originated the idea of the march to the sea? Was it Grant's, or was\n     it Sherman's idea?\" Whether I, or some one else (being anxious to\n     get the important fact settled) asked him with whom the idea\n     originated, I don't remember. But I remember his answer. I shall\n     always remember his answer. General Grant said:\n\n     \"Neither of us originated the idea of Sherman's march to the sea.\n     The enemy did it.\"\n\n     He went on to say that the enemy, however, necessarily originated a\n     great many of the plans that the general on the opposite side gets\n     the credit for; at the same time that the enemy is doing that, he\n     is laying open other moves which the opposing general sees and\n     takes advantage of. In this case, Sherman had a plan all thought\n     out, of course. He meant to destroy the two remaining railroads in\n     that part of the country, and that would finish up that region. But\n     General Hood did not play the military part that he was expected to\n     play. On the contrary, General Hood made a dive at Chattanooga.\n     This left the march to the sea open to Sherman, and so after\n     sending part of his army to defend and hold what he had acquired in\n     the Chattanooga region, he was perfectly free to proceed, with the\n     rest of it, through Georgia. He saw the opportunity, and he would\n     not have been fit for his place if he had not seized it.\n\n     \"He wrote me\" (the General is speaking) \"what his plan was, and I\n     sent him word to go ahead. My staff were opposed to the movement.\"\n     (I think the General said they tried to persuade him to stop\n     Sherman. The chief of his staff, the General said, even went so far\n     as to go to Washington without the General's knowledge and get the\n     ear of the authorities, and he succeeded in arousing their fears to\n     such an extent that they telegraphed General Grant to stop\n     Sherman.)\n\n     Then General Grant said, \"Out of deference to the Government, I\n     telegraphed Sherman and stopped him twenty-four hours; and then\n     considering that that was deference enough to the Government, I\n     telegraphed him to go ahead again.\"\n\n     I have not tried to give the General's language, but only the\n     general idea of what he said. The thing that mainly struck me was\n     his terse remark that the enemy originated the idea of the march to\n     the sea. It struck me because it was so suggestive of the General's\n     epigrammatic fashion--saying a great deal in a single crisp\n     sentence. (This is my account, and signed \"Mark Twain.\")\n\n\n_Susy Resumes._\n\n\n     After papa and General Grant had had their talk, we went back to\n     the hotel where mamma was, and papa told mamma all about his\n     interview with General Grant. Mamma and I had a nice quiet\n     afternoon together.\n\n\nThat pair of devoted comrades were always shutting themselves up\ntogether when there was opportunity to have what Susy called \"a cozy\ntime.\" From Susy's nursery days to the end of her life, she and her\nmother were close friends; intimate friends, passionate adorers of each\nother. Susy's was a beautiful mind, and it made her an interesting\ncomrade. And with the fine mind she had a heart like her mother's. Susy\nnever had an interest or an occupation which she was not glad to put\naside for that something which was in all cases more precious to her--a\nvisit with her mother. Susy died at the right time, the fortunate time\nof life; the happy age--twenty-four years. At twenty-four, such a girl\nhas seen the best of life--life as a happy dream. After that age the\nrisks begin; responsibility comes, and with it the cares, the sorrows,\nand the inevitable tragedy. For her mother's sake I would have brought\nher back from the grave if I could, but I would not have done it for my\nown.\n\n_From Susy's Biography_.\n\n\n     Then papa went to read in public; there were a great many authors\n     that read, that Thursday afternoon, beside papa; I would have liked\n     to have gone and heard papa read, but papa said he was going to\n     read in Vassar just what he was planning to read in New York, so I\n     stayed at home with mamma.\n\n     The next day mamma planned to take the four o'clock car back to\n     Hartford. We rose quite early that morning and went to the Vienna\n     Bakery and took breakfast there. From there we went to a German\n     bookstore and bought some German books for Clara's birthday.\n\n\nDear me, the power of association to snatch mouldy dead memories out of\ntheir graves and make them walk! That remark about buying foreign books\nthrows a sudden white glare upon the distant past; and I see the long\nstretch of a New York street with an unearthly vividness, and John Hay\nwalking down it, grave and remorseful. I was walking down it too, that\nmorning, and I overtook Hay and asked him what the trouble was. He\nturned a lustreless eye upon me and said:\n\n\"My case is beyond cure. In the most innocent way in the world I have\ncommitted a crime which will never be forgiven by the sufferers, for\nthey will never believe--oh, well, no, I was going to say they would\nnever believe that I did the thing innocently. The truth is they will\nknow that I acted innocently, because they are rational people; but what\nof that? I never can look them in the face again--nor they me, perhaps.\"\n\nHay was a young bachelor, and at that time was on the \"Tribune\" staff.\nHe explained his trouble in these words, substantially:\n\n\"When I was passing along here yesterday morning on my way down-town to\nthe office, I stepped into a bookstore where I am acquainted, and asked\nif they had anything new from the other side. They handed me a French\nnovel, in the usual yellow paper cover, and I carried it away. I didn't\neven look at the title of it. It was for recreation reading, and I was\non my way to my work. I went mooning and dreaming along, and I think I\nhadn't gone more than fifty yards when I heard my name called. I\nstopped, and a private carriage drew up at the sidewalk and I shook\nhands with the inmates--mother and young daughter, excellent people.\nThey were on their way to the steamer to sail for Paris. The mother\nsaid,\n\n\"'I saw that book in your hand and I judged by the look of it that it\nwas a French novel. Is it?'\n\n\"I said it was.\n\n\"She said, 'Do let me have it, so that my daughter can practise her\nFrench on it on the way over.'\n\n\"Of course I handed her the book, and we parted. Ten minutes ago I was\npassing that bookstore again, and I stepped in and fetched away another\ncopy of that book. Here it is. Read the first page of it. That is\nenough. You will know what the rest is like. I think it must be the\nfoulest book in the French language--one of the foulest, anyway. I would\nbe ashamed to offer it to a harlot--but, oh dear, I gave it to that\nsweet young girl without shame. Take my advice; don't give away a book\nuntil you have examined it.\"\n\n_From Susy's Biography._\n\n\n     Then mamma and I went to do some shopping and papa went to see\n     General Grant. After we had finnished doing our shopping we went\n     home to the hotel together. When we entered our rooms in the hotel\n     we saw on the table a vase full of exquisett red roses. Mamma who\n     is very fond of flowers exclaimed \"Oh I wonder who could have sent\n     them.\" We both looked at the card in the midst of the roses and saw\n     that it was written on in papa's handwriting, it was written in\n     German. 'Liebes Geshchenk on die mamma.' [I am sure I didn't say\n     \"on\"--that is Susy's spelling, not mine; also I am sure I didn't\n     spell Geschenk so liberally as all that.--S. L. C.] Mamma was\n     delighted. Papa came home and gave mamma her ticket; and after\n     visiting a while with her went to see Major Pond and mamma and I\n     sat down to our lunch. After lunch most of our time was taken up\n     with packing, and at about three o'clock we went to escort mamma to\n     the train. We got on board the train with her and stayed with her\n     about five minutes and then we said good-bye to her and the train\n     started for Hartford. It was the first time I had ever beene away\n     from home without mamma in my life, although I was 13 yrs. old.\n     Papa and I drove back to the hotel and got Major Pond and then went\n     to see the Brooklyn Bridge we went across it to Brooklyn on the\n     cars and then walked back across it from Brooklyn to New York. We\n     enjoyed looking at the beautiful scenery and we could see the\n     bridge moove under the intense heat of the sun. We had a perfectly\n     delightful time, but weer pretty tired when we got back to the\n     hotel.\n\n     The next morning we rose early, took our breakfast and took an\n     early train to Poughkeepsie. We had a very pleasant journey to\n     Poughkeepsie. The Hudson was magnificent--shrouded with beautiful\n     mist. When we arived at Poughkeepsie it was raining quite hard;\n     which fact greatly dissapointed me because I very much wanted to\n     see the outside of the buildings of Vassar College and as it rained\n     that would be impossible. It was quite a long drive from the\n     station to Vasser College and papa and I had a nice long time to\n     discuss and laugh over German profanity. One of the German phrases\n     papa particularly enjoys is \"O heilige maria Mutter Jesus!\" Jean\n     has a German nurse, and this was one of her phrases, there was a\n     time when Jean exclaimed \"Ach Gott!\" to every trifle, but when\n     mamma found it out she was shocked and instantly put a stop to it.\n\n\nIt brings that pretty little German girl vividly before me--a sweet and\ninnocent and plump little creature with peachy cheeks; a clear-souled\nlittle maiden and without offence, notwithstanding her profanities, and\nshe was loaded to the eyebrows with them. She was a mere child. She was\nnot fifteen yet. She was just from Germany, and knew no English. She was\nalways scattering her profanities around, and they were such a\nsatisfaction to me that I never dreamed of such a thing as modifying\nher. For my own sake, I had no disposition to tell on her. Indeed I took\npains to keep her from being found out. I told her to confine her\nreligious exercises to the children's quarters, and urged her to\nremember that Mrs. Clemens was prejudiced against pieties on week-days.\nTo the children, the little maid's profanities sounded natural and\nproper and right, because they had been used to that kind of talk in\nGermany, and they attached no evil importance to it. It grieves me that\nI have forgotten those vigorous remarks. I long hoarded them in my\nmemory as a treasure. But I remember one of them still, because I heard\nit so many times. The trial of that little creature's life was the\nchildren's hair. She would tug and strain with her comb, accompanying\nher work with her misplaced pieties. And when finally she was through\nwith her triple job she always fired up and exploded her thanks toward\nthe sky, where they belonged, in this form: \"_Gott sei Dank ich bin\nfertig mit'm Gott verdammtes Haar!_\" (I believe I am not quite brave\nenough to translate it.)\n\n_From Susy's Biography_.\n\n\n     We at length reached Vassar College and she looked very finely, her\n     buildings and her grounds being very beautiful. We went to the\n     front doore and range the bell. The young girl who came to the\n     doore wished to know who we wanted to see. Evidently we were not\n     expected. Papa told her who we wanted to see and she showed us to\n     the parlor. We waited, no one came; and waited, no one came, still\n     no one came. It was beginning to seem pretty awkward, \"Oh well this\n     is a pretty piece of business,\" papa exclaimed. At length we heard\n     footsteps coming down the long corridor and Miss C, (the lady who\n     had invited papa) came into the room. She greeted papa very\n     pleasantly and they had a nice little chatt together. Soon the lady\n     principal also entered and she was very pleasant and agreable. She\n     showed us to our rooms and said she would send for us when dinner\n     was ready. We went into our rooms, but we had nothing to do for\n     half an hour exept to watch the rain drops as they fell upon the\n     window panes. At last we were called to dinner, and I went down\n     without papa as he never eats anything in the middle of the day. I\n     sat at the table with the lady principal and enjoyed very much\n     seeing all the young girls trooping into the dining-room. After\n     dinner I went around the College with the young ladies and papa\n     stayed in his room and smoked. When it was supper time papa went\n     down and ate supper with us and we had a very delightful supper.\n     After supper the young ladies went to their rooms to dress for the\n     evening. Papa went to his room and I went with the lady principal.\n     At length the guests began to arive, but papa still remained in his\n     room until called for. Papa read in the chapell. It was the first\n     time I had ever heard him read in my life--that is in public. When\n     he came out on to the stage I remember the people behind me\n     exclaimed \"Oh how queer he is! Isn't he funny!\" I thought papa was\n     very funny, although I did not think him queer. He read \"A Trying\n     Situation\" and \"The Golden Arm,\" a ghost story that he heard down\n     South when he was a little boy. \"The Golden Arm\" papa had told me\n     before, but he had startled me so that I did not much wish to hear\n     it again. But I had resolved this time to be prepared and not to\n     let myself be startled, but still papa did, and very very much; he\n     startled the whole roomful of people and they jumped as one man.\n     The other story was also very funny and interesting and I enjoyed\n     the evening inexpressibly much. After papa had finished reading we\n     all went down to the collation in the dining-room and after that\n     there was dancing and singing. Then the guests went away and papa\n     and I went to bed. The next morning we rose early, took an early\n     train for Hartford and reached Hartford at 1/2 past 2 o'clock. We\n     were very glad to get back.\n\n\nHow charitably she treats that ghastly experience! It is a dear and\nlovely disposition, and a most valuable one, that can brush away\nindignities and discourtesies and seek and find the pleasanter features\nof an experience. Susy had that disposition, and it was one of the\njewels of her character that had come to her straight from her mother.\nIt is a feature that was left out of me at birth. And, at seventy, I\nhave not yet acquired it. I did not go to Vassar College professionally,\nbut as a guest--as a guest, and gratis. Aunt Clara (now Mrs. John B.\nStanchfield) was a graduate of Vassar and it was to please her that I\ninflicted that journey upon Susy and myself. The invitation had come to\nme from both the lady mentioned by Susy and the President of the\nCollege--a sour old saint who has probably been gathered to his fathers\nlong ago; and I hope they enjoy him; I hope they value his society. I\nthink I can get along without it, in either end of the next world.\n\nWe arrived at the College in that soaking rain, and Susy has described,\nwith just a suggestion of dissatisfaction, the sort of reception we got.\nSusy had to sit in her damp clothes half an hour while we waited in the\nparlor; then she was taken to a fireless room and left to wait there\nagain, as she has stated. I do not remember that President's name, and I\nam sorry. He did not put in an appearance until it was time for me to\nstep upon the platform in front of that great garden of young and lovely\nblossoms. He caught up with me and advanced upon the platform with me\nand was going to introduce me. I said in substance:\n\n\"You have allowed me to get along without your help thus far, and if you\nwill retire from the platform I will try to do the rest without it.\"\n\nI did not see him any more, but I detest his memory. Of course my\nresentment did not extend to the students, and so I had an unforgettable\ngood time talking to them. And I think they had a good time too, for\nthey responded \"as one man,\" to use Susy's unimprovable phrase.\n\nGirls are charming creatures. I shall have to be twice seventy years old\nbefore I change my mind as to that. I am to talk to a crowd of them this\nafternoon, students of Barnard College (the sex's annex to Columbia\nUniversity), and I think I shall have as pleasant a time with those\nlasses as I had with the Vassar girls twenty-one years ago.\n\n_From Susy's Biography._\n\n\n     I stopped in the middle of mamma's early history to tell about our\n     tripp to Vassar because I was afraid I would forget about it, now I\n     will go on where I left off. Some time after Miss Emma Nigh died\n     papa took mamma and little Langdon to Elmira for the summer. When\n     in Elmira Langdon began to fail but I think mamma did not know just\n     what was the matter with him.\n\n\nI was the cause of the child's illness. His mother trusted him to my\ncare and I took him a long drive in an open barouche for an airing. It\nwas a raw, cold morning, but he was well wrapped about with furs and, in\nthe hands of a careful person, no harm would have come to him. But I\nsoon dropped into a reverie and forgot all about my charge. The furs\nfell away and exposed his bare legs. By and by the coachman noticed\nthis, and I arranged the wraps again, but it was too late. The child was\nalmost frozen. I hurried home with him. I was aghast at what I had done,\nand I feared the consequences. I have always felt shame for that\ntreacherous morning's work and have not allowed myself to think of it\nwhen I could help it. I doubt if I had the courage to make confession at\nthat time. I think it most likely that I have never confessed until now.\n\n_From Susy's Biography._\n\n\n     At last it was time for papa to return to Hartford, and Langdon was\n     real sick at that time, but still mamma decided to go with him,\n     thinking the journey might do him good. But after they reached\n     Hartford he became very sick, and his trouble prooved to be\n     diptheeria. He died about a week after mamma and papa reached\n     Hartford. He was burried by the side of grandpa at Elmira, New\n     York. [Susy rests there with them.--S. L. C.] After that, mamma\n     became very very ill, so ill that there seemed great danger of\n     death, but with a great deal of good care she recovered. Some\n     months afterward mamma and papa [and Susy, who was perhaps fourteen\n     or fifteen months old at the time.--S. L. C.] went to Europe and\n     stayed for a time in Scotland and England. In Scotland mamma and\n     papa became very well equanted with Dr. John Brown, the author of\n     \"Rab and His Friends,\" and he mett, but was not so well equanted\n     with, Mr. Charles Kingsley, Mr. Henry M. Stanley, Sir Thomas Hardy\n     grandson of the Captain Hardy to whom Nellson said \"Kiss me Hardy,\"\n     when dying on shipboard, Mr. Henry Irving, Robert Browning, Sir\n     Charles Dilke, Mr. Charles Reade, Mr. William Black, Lord Houghton,\n     Frank Buckland, Mr. Tom Hughes, Anthony Trollope, Tom Hood, son of\n     the poet--and mamma and papa were quite well equanted with Dr.\n     Macdonald and family, and papa met Harrison Ainsworth.\n\n\nI remember all these men very well indeed, except the last one. I do not\nrecall Ainsworth. By my count, Susy mentions fourteen men. They are all\ndead except Sir Charles Dilke.\n\nWe met a great many other interesting people, among them Lewis Carroll,\nauthor of the immortal \"Alice\"--but he was only interesting to look at,\nfor he was the stillest and shyest full-grown man I have ever met except\n\"Uncle Remus.\" Dr. Macdonald and several other lively talkers were\npresent, and the talk went briskly on for a couple of hours, but Carroll\nsat still all the while except that now and then he answered a question.\nHis answers were brief. I do not remember that he elaborated any of\nthem.\n\nAt a dinner at Smalley's we met Herbert Spencer. At a large luncheon\nparty at Lord Houghton's we met Sir Arthur Helps, who was a celebrity of\nworld-wide fame at the time, but is quite forgotten now. Lord Elcho, a\nlarge vigorous man, sat at some distance down the table. He was talking\nearnestly about Godalming. It was a deep and flowing and unarticulated\nrumble, but I got the Godalming pretty clearly every time it broke free\nof the rumble, and as all the strength was on the first end of the word\nit startled me every time, because it sounded so like swearing. In the\nmiddle of the luncheon Lady Houghton rose, remarked to the guests on her\nright and on her left in a matter-of-fact way, \"Excuse me, I have an\nengagement,\" and without further ceremony she went off to meet it. This\nwould have been doubtful etiquette in America. Lord Houghton told a\nnumber of delightful stories. He told them in French, and I lost nothing\nof them but the nubs.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[5] I was his publisher.

I was born heedless; and therefore I was\nconstantly, and quite unconsciously, committing breaches of the minor\nproprieties, which brought upon me humiliations which ought to have\nhumiliated me but didn't, because I didn't know anything had happened.\nBut Livy knew; and so the humiliations fell to her share, poor child,\nwho had not earned them and did not deserve them. She always said I was\nthe most difficult child she had. She was very sensitive about me. It\ndistressed her to see me do heedless things which could bring me under\ncriticism, and so she was always watchful and alert to protect me from\nthe kind of transgressions which I have been speaking of.\n\nWhen I was leaving Hartford for Washington, upon the occasion referred\nto, she said: \"I have written a small warning and put it in a pocket of\nyour dress-vest. When you are dressing to go to the Authors' Reception\nat the White House you will naturally put your fingers in your vest\npockets, according to your custom, and you will find that little note\nthere. Read it carefully, and do as it tells you. I cannot be with you,\nand so I delegate my sentry duties to this little note. If I should give\nyou the warning by word of mouth, now, it would pass from your head and\nbe forgotten in a few minutes.\"\n\nIt was President Cleveland's first term. I had never seen his wife--the\nyoung, the beautiful, the good-hearted, the sympathetic, the\nfascinating. Sure enough, just as I had finished dressing to go to the\nWhite House I found that little note, which I had long ago forgotten. It\nwas a grave little note, a serious little note, like its writer, but it\nmade me laugh. Livy's gentle gravities often produced that effect upon\nme, where the expert humorist's best joke would have failed, for I do\nnot laugh easily.\n\nWhen we reached the White House and I was shaking hands with the\nPresident, he started to say something, but I interrupted him and said:\n\n\"If your Excellency will excuse me, I will come back in a moment; but\nnow I have a very important matter to attend to, and it must be attended\nto at once.\"\n\nI turned to Mrs. Cleveland, the young, the beautiful, the fascinating,\nand gave her my card, on the back of which I had written \"_He\ndidn't_\"--and I asked her to sign her name below those words.\n\nShe said: \"He didn't? He didn't what?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said, \"never mind. We cannot stop to discuss that now. This is\nurgent. Won't you please sign your name?\" (I handed her a fountain-pen.)\n\n\"Why,\" she said, \"I cannot commit myself in that way. Who is it that\ndidn't?--and what is it that he didn't?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said, \"time is flying, flying, flying. Won't you take me out of\nmy distress and sign your name to it? It's all right. I give you my word\nit's all right.\"\n\nShe looked nonplussed; but hesitatingly and mechanically she took the\npen and said:\n\n\"I will sign it. I will take the risk. But you must tell me all about\nit, right afterward, so that you can be arrested before you get out of\nthe house in case there should be anything criminal about this.\"\n\nThen she signed; and I handed her Mrs. Clements's note, which was very\nbrief, very simple, and to the point. It said: \"_Don't wear your arctics\nin the White House._\" It made her shout; and at my request she summoned\na messenger and we sent that card at once to the mail on its way to Mrs.\nClemens in Hartford.\n\nWhen the little Ruth was about a year or a year and a half old, Mason,\nan old and valued friend of mine, was consul-general at\nFrankfort-on-the-Main. I had known him well in 1867, '68 and '69, in\nAmerica, and I and mine had spent a good deal of time with him and his\nfamily in Frankfort in '78. He was a thoroughly competent, diligent, and\nconscientious official. Indeed he possessed these qualities in so large\na degree that among American consuls he might fairly be said to be\nmonumental, for at that time our consular service was largely--and I\nthink I may say mainly--in the hands of ignorant, vulgar, and incapable\nmen who had been political heelers in America, and had been taken care\nof by transference to consulates where they could be supported at the\nGovernment's expense instead of being transferred to the poor house,\nwhich would have been cheaper and more patriotic. Mason, in '78, had\nbeen consul-general in Frankfort several years--four, I think. He had\ncome from Marseilles with a great record. He had been consul there\nduring thirteen years, and one part of his record was heroic. There had\nbeen a desolating cholera epidemic, and Mason was the only\nrepresentative of any foreign country who stayed at his post and saw it\nthrough. And during that time he not only represented his own country,\nbut he represented all the other countries in Christendom and did their\nwork, and did it well and was praised for it by them in words of no\nuncertain sound. This great record of Mason's had saved him from\nofficial decapitation straight along while Republican Presidents\noccupied the chair, but now it was occupied by a Democrat. Mr. Cleveland\nwas not seated in it--he was not yet inaugurated--before he was deluged\nwith applications from Democratic politicians desiring the appointment\nof a thousand or so politically useful Democrats to Mason's place. A\nyear or two later Mason wrote me and asked me if I couldn't do something\nto save him from destruction.\n\nI was very anxious to keep him in his place, but at first I could not\nthink of any way to help him, for I was a mugwump. We, the mugwumps, a\nlittle company made up of the unenslaved of both parties, the very best\nmen to be found in the two great parties--that was our idea of it--voted\nsixty thousand strong for Mr. Cleveland in New York and elected him. Our\nprinciples were high, and very definite. We were not a party; we had no\ncandidates; we had no axes to grind. Our vote laid upon the man we cast\nit for no obligation of any kind. By our rule we could not ask for\noffice; we could not accept office. When voting, it was our duty to vote\nfor the best man, regardless of his party name. We had no other creed.\nVote for the best man--that was creed enough.\n\nSuch being my situation, I was puzzled to know how to try to help Mason,\nand, at the same time, save my mugwump purity undefiled. It was a\ndelicate place. But presently, out of the ruck of confusions in my mind,\nrose a sane thought, clear and bright--to wit: since it was a mugwump's\nduty to do his best to put the beet man in office, necessarily it must\nbe a mugwump's duty to try to _keep_ the best man in when he was already\nthere. My course was easy now. It might not be quite delicate for a\nmugwump to approach the President directly, but I could approach him\nindirectly, with all delicacy, since in that case not even courtesy\nwould require him to take notice of an application which no one could\nprove had ever reached him.\n\nYes, it was easy and simple sailing now. I could lay the matter before\nRuth, in her cradle, and wait for results. I wrote the little child, and\nsaid to her all that I have just been saying about mugwump principles\nand the limitations which they put upon me. I explained that it would\nnot be proper for me to apply to her father in Mr. Mason's behalf, but I\ndetailed to her Mr. Mason's high and honorable record and suggested that\nshe take the matter in her own hands and do a patriotic work which I\nfelt some delicacy about venturing upon myself. I asked her to forget\nthat her father was only President of the United States, and her subject\nand servant; I asked her not to put her application in the form of a\ncommand, but to modify it, and give it the fictitious and pleasanter\nform of a mere request--that it would be no harm to let him gratify\nhimself with the superstition that he was independent and could do as he\npleased in the matter. I begged her to put stress, and plenty of it,\nupon the proposition that to keep Mason in his place would be a\nbenefaction to the nation; to enlarge upon that, and keep still about\nall other considerations.\n\nIn due time I received a letter from the President, written with his own\nhand, signed by his own hand, acknowledging Ruth's intervention and\nthanking me for enabling him to save to the country the services of so\ngood and well-tried a servant as Mason, and thanking me, also, for the\ndetailed fulness of Mason's record, which could leave no doubt in any\none's mind that Mason was in his right place and ought to be kept there.\nMason has remained in the service ever since, and is now consul-general\nat Paris.\n\nDuring the time that we were living in Buffalo in '70-'71, Mr. Cleveland\nwas sheriff, but I never happened to make his acquaintance, or even see\nhim. In fact, I suppose I was not even aware of his existence. Fourteen\nyears later, he was become the greatest man in the State. I was not\nliving in the State at the time. He was Governor, and was about to step\ninto the post of President of the United States. At that time I was on\nthe public highway in company with another bandit, George W. Cable. We\nwere robbing the public with readings from our works during four\nmonths--and in the course of time we went to Albany to levy tribute, and\nI said, \"We ought to go and pay our respects to the Governor.\"\n\nSo Cable and I went to that majestic Capitol building and stated our\nerrand. We were shown into the Governor's private office, and I saw Mr.\nCleveland for the first time. We three stood chatting together. I was\nborn lazy, and I comforted myself by turning the corner of a table into\na sort of seat. Presently the Governor said:\n\n\"Mr. Clemens, I was a fellow citizen of yours in Buffalo a good many\nmonths, a good while ago, and during those months you burst suddenly\ninto a mighty fame, out of a previous long-continued and no doubt proper\nobscurity--but I was a nobody, and you wouldn't notice me nor have\nanything to do with me. But now that I have become somebody, you have\nchanged your style, and you come here to shake hands with me and be\nsociable. How do you explain this kind of conduct?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said, \"it is very simple, your Excellency. In Buffalo you were\nnothing but a sheriff. I was in society. I couldn't afford to associate\nwith sheriffs. But you are a Governor now, and you are on your way to\nthe Presidency. It is a great difference, and it makes you worth while.\"\n\nThere appeared to be about sixteen doors to that spacious room. From\neach door a young man now emerged, and the sixteen lined up and moved\nforward and stood in front of the Governor with an aspect of respectful\nexpectancy in their attitude. No one spoke for a moment. Then the\nGovernor said:\n\n\"You are dismissed, gentlemen. Your services are not required. Mr.\nClemens is sitting on the bells.\"\n\nThere was a cluster of sixteen bell buttons on the corner of the table;\nmy proportions at that end of me were just right to enable me to cover\nthe whole of that nest, and that is how I came to hatch out those\nsixteen clerks.\n\nIn accordance with the suggestion made in Gilder's letter recently\nreceived I have written the following note to ex-President Cleveland\nupon his sixty-ninth birthday:\n\n\n     HONORED SIR:--\n\n     Your patriotic virtues have won for you the homage of half the\n     nation and the enmity of the other half. This places your character\n     as a citizen upon a summit as high as Washington's. The verdict is\n     unanimous and unassailable. The votes of both sides are necessary\n     in cases like these, and the votes of the one side are quite as\n     valuable as are the votes of the other. Where the votes are all in\n     a man's favor the verdict is against him. It is sand, and history\n     will wash it away. But the verdict for you is rock, and will stand.\n\n                                                       S. L. CLEMENS.\n\n        As of date March 18, 1906....\n\n\nIn a diary which Mrs. Clemens kept for a little while, a great many\nyears ago, I find various mentions of Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, who\nwas a near neighbor of ours in Hartford, with no fences between. And in\nthose days she made as much use of our grounds as of her own, in\npleasant weather. Her mind had decayed, and she was a pathetic figure.\nShe wandered about all the day long in the care of a muscular\nIrishwoman. Among the colonists of our neighborhood the doors always\nstood open in pleasant weather. Mrs. Stowe entered them at her own free\nwill, and as she was always softly slippered and generally full of\nanimal spirits, she was able to deal in surprises, and she liked to do\nit. She would slip up behind a person who was deep in dreams and\nmusings and fetch a war-whoop that would jump that person out of his\nclothes. And she had other moods. Sometimes we would hear gentle music\nin the drawing-room and would find her there at the piano singing\nancient and melancholy songs with infinitely touching effect.\n\nHer husband, old Professor Stowe, was a picturesque figure. He wore a\nbroad slouch hat. He was a large man, and solemn. His beard was white\nand thick and hung far down on his breast. The first time our little\nSusy ever saw him she encountered him on the street near our house and\ncame flying wide-eyed to her mother and said, \"Santa Claus has got\nloose!\"\n\nWhich reminds me of Rev. Charley Stowe's little boy--a little boy of\nseven years. I met Rev. Charley crossing his mother's grounds one\nmorning and he told me this little tale. He had been out to Chicago to\nattend a Convention of Congregational clergymen, and had taken his\nlittle boy with him. During the trip he reminded the little chap, every\nnow and then, that he must be on his very best behavior there in\nChicago. He said: \"We shall be the guests of a clergyman, there will be\nother guests--clergymen and their wives--and you must be careful to let\nthose people see by your walk and conversation that you are of a godly\nhousehold. Be very careful about this.\" The admonition bore fruit. At\nthe first breakfast which they ate in the Chicago clergyman's house he\nheard his little son say in the meekest and most reverent way to the\nlady opposite him,\n\n\"Please, won't you, for Christ's sake, pass the butter?\"\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCV.\n\nDECEMBER 21, 1906.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--VIII.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n[Sidenote: (1864.)]\n\n[_Dictated in 1906._] In those early days duelling suddenly became a\nfashion in the new Territory of Nevada, and by 1864 everybody was\nanxious to have a chance in the new sport, mainly for the reason that he\nwas not able to thoroughly respect himself so long as he had not killed\nor crippled somebody in a duel or been killed or crippled in one\nhimself.\n\nAt that time I had been serving as city editor on Mr. Goodman's Virginia\nCity \"Enterprise\" for a matter of two years. I was twenty-nine years\nold. I was ambitious in several ways, but I had entirely escaped the\nseductions of that particular craze. I had had no desire to fight a\nduel; I had no intention of provoking one. I did not feel respectable,\nbut I got a certain amount of satisfaction out of feeling safe. I was\nashamed of myself; the rest of the staff were ashamed of me--but I got\nalong well enough. I had always been accustomed to feeling ashamed of\nmyself, for one thing or another, so there was no novelty for me in the\nsituation. I bore it very well. Plunkett was on the staff; R. M. Daggett\nwas on the staff. These had tried to get into duels, but for the present\nhad failed, and were waiting. Goodman was the only one of us who had\ndone anything to shed credit upon the paper. The rival paper was the\nVirginia \"Union.\" Its editor for a little while was Tom Fitch, called\nthe \"silver-tongued orator of Wisconsin\"--that was where he came from.\nHe tuned up his oratory in the editorial columns of the \"Union,\" and Mr.\nGoodman invited him out and modified him with a bullet. I remember the\njoy of the staff when Goodman's challenge was accepted by Fitch. We ran\nlate that night, and made much of Joe Goodman. He was only twenty-four\nyears old; he lacked the wisdom which a person has at twenty-nine, and\nhe was as glad of being _it_ as I was that I wasn't. He chose Major\nGraves for his second (that name is not right, but it's close enough; I\ndon't remember the Major's name). Graves came over to instruct Joe in\nthe duelling art. He had been a Major under Walker, the \"gray-eyed man\nof destiny,\" and had fought all through that remarkable man's\nfilibustering campaign in Central America. That fact gauges the Major.\nTo say that a man was a Major under Walker, and came out of that\nstruggle ennobled by Walker's praise, is to say that the Major was not\nmerely a brave man but that he was brave to the very utmost limit of\nthat word. All of Walker's men were like that. I knew the Gillis family\nintimately. The father made the campaign under Walker, and with him one\nson. They were in the memorable Plaza fight, and stood it out to the\nlast against overwhelming odds, as did also all of the Walker men. The\nson was killed at the father's side. The father received a bullet\nthrough the eye. The old man--for he was an old man at the time--wore\nspectacles, and the bullet and one of the glasses went into his skull\nand remained there. There were some other sons: Steve, George, and Jim,\nvery young chaps--the merest lads--who wanted to be in the Walker\nexpedition, for they had their father's dauntless spirit. But Walker\nwouldn't have them; he said it was a serious expedition, and no place\nfor children.\n\nThe Major was a majestic creature, with a most stately and dignified and\nimpressive military bearing, and he was by nature and training\ncourteous, polite, graceful, winning; and he had that quality which I\nthink I have encountered in only one other man--Bob Howland--a\nmysterious quality which resides in the eye; and when that eye is turned\nupon an individual or a squad, in warning, that is enough. The man that\nhas that eye doesn't need to go armed; he can move upon an armed\ndesperado and quell him and take him prisoner without saying a single\nword. I saw Bob Howland do that, once--a slender, good-natured, amiable,\ngentle, kindly little skeleton of a man, with a sweet blue eye that\nwould win your heart when it smiled upon you, or turn cold and freeze\nit, according to the nature of the occasion.\n\nThe Major stood Joe up straight; stood Steve Gillis up fifteen paces\naway; made Joe turn right side towards Steve, cock his navy\nsix-shooter--that prodigious weapon--and hold it straight down against\nhis leg; told him that _that_ was the correct position for the gun--that\nthe position ordinarily in use at Virginia City (that is to say, the gun\nstraight up in the air, then brought slowly down to your man) was all\nwrong. At the word \"_One_,\" you must raise the gun slowly and steadily\nto the place on the other man's body that you desire to convince. Then,\nafter a pause, \"_two, three--fire--Stop!_\" At the word \"stop,\" you may\nfire--but not earlier. You may give yourself as much time as you please\n_after_ that word. Then, when you fire, you may advance and go on firing\nat your leisure and pleasure, if you can get any pleasure out of it.\nAnd, in the meantime, the other man, if he has been properly instructed\nand is alive to his privileges, is advancing on _you_, and firing--and\nit is always likely that more or less trouble will result.\n\nNaturally, when Joe's revolver had risen to a level it was pointing at\nSteve's breast, but the Major said \"No, that is not wise. Take all the\nrisks of getting murdered yourself, but don't run any risk of murdering\nthe other man. If you survive a duel you want to survive it in such a\nway that the memory of it will not linger along with you through the\nrest of your life and interfere with your sleep. Aim at your man's leg;\nnot at the knee, not above the knee; for those are dangerous spots. Aim\nbelow the knee; cripple him, but leave the rest of him to his mother.\"\n\nBy grace of these truly wise and excellent instructions, Joe tumbled\nFitch down next morning with a bullet through his lower leg, which\nfurnished him a permanent limp. And Joe lost nothing but a lock of hair,\nwhich he could spare better then than he could now. For when I saw him\nhere in New York a year ago, his crop was gone: he had nothing much left\nbut a fringe, with a dome rising above.\n\n[Sidenote: (1864.)]\n\nAbout a year later I got _my_ chance. But I was not hunting for it.\nGoodman went off to San Francisco for a week's holiday, and left me to\nbe chief editor. I had supposed that that was an easy berth, there being\nnothing to do but write one editorial per day; but I was disappointed in\nthat superstition. I couldn't find anything to write an article about,\nthe first day. Then it occurred to me that inasmuch as it was the 22nd\nof April, 1864, the next morning would be the three-hundredth\nanniversary of Shakespeare's birthday--and what better theme could I\nwant than that? I got the Cyclop\u00e6dia and examined it, and found out who\nShakespeare was and what he had done, and I borrowed all that and laid\nit before a community that couldn't have been better prepared for\ninstruction about Shakespeare than if they had been prepared by art.\nThere wasn't enough of what Shakespeare had done to make an editorial of\nthe necessary length, but I filled it out with what he hadn't\ndone--which in many respects was more important and striking and\nreadable than the handsomest things he had really accomplished. But next\nday I was in trouble again. There were no more Shakespeares to work up.\nThere was nothing in past history, or in the world's future\npossibilities, to make an editorial out of, suitable to that community;\nso there was but one theme left. That theme was Mr. Laird, proprietor of\nthe Virginia \"Union.\" _His_ editor had gone off to San Francisco too,\nand Laird was trying his hand at editing. I woke up Mr. Laird with some\ncourtesies of the kind that were fashionable among newspaper editors in\nthat region, and he came back at me the next day in a most vitriolic\nway. He was hurt by something I had said about him--some little thing--I\ndon't remember what it was now--probably called him a horse-thief, or\none of those little phrases customarily used to describe another\neditor. They were no doubt just, and accurate, but Laird was a very\nsensitive creature, and he didn't like it. So we expected a challenge\nfrom Mr. Laird, because according to the rules--according to the\netiquette of duelling as reconstructed and reorganized and improved by\nthe duellists of that region--whenever you said a thing about another\nperson that he didn't like, it wasn't sufficient for him to talk back in\nthe same offensive spirit: etiquette required him to send a challenge;\nso we waited for a challenge--waited all day. It didn't come. And as the\nday wore along, hour after hour, and no challenge came, the boys grew\ndepressed. They lost heart. But I was cheerful; I felt better and better\nall the time. They couldn't understand it, but _I_ could understand it.\nIt was my _make_ that enabled me to be cheerful when other people were\ndespondent. So then it became necessary for us to waive etiquette and\nchallenge Mr. Laird. When we reached that decision, they began to cheer\nup, but I began to lose some of my animation. However, in enterprises of\nthis kind you are in the hands of your friends; there is nothing for you\nto do but to abide by what they consider to be the best course. Daggett\nwrote a challenge for me, for Daggett had the language--the right\nlanguage--the convincing language--and I lacked it. Daggett poured out a\nstream of unsavory epithets upon Mr. Laird, charged with a vigor and\nvenom of a strength calculated to persuade him; and Steve Gillis, my\nsecond, carried the challenge and came back to wait for the return. It\ndidn't come. The boys were exasperated, but I kept my temper. Steve\ncarried another challenge, hotter than the other, and we waited again.\nNothing came of it. I began to feel quite comfortable. I began to take\nan interest in the challenges myself. I had not felt any before; but it\nseemed to me that I was accumulating a great and valuable reputation at\nno expense, and my delight in this grew and grew, as challenge after\nchallenge was declined, until by midnight I was beginning to think that\nthere was nothing in the world so much to be desired as a chance to\nfight a duel. So I hurried Daggett up; made him keep on sending\nchallenge after challenge. Oh, well, I overdid it; Laird accepted. I\nmight have known that that would happen--Laird was a man you couldn't\ndepend on.\n\nThe boys were jubilant beyond expression. They helped me make my will,\nwhich was another discomfort--and I already had enough. Then they took\nme home. I didn't sleep any--didn't want to sleep. I had plenty of\nthings to think about, and less than four hours to do it in,--because\nfive o'clock was the hour appointed for the tragedy, and I should have\nto use up one hour--beginning at four--in practising with the revolver\nand finding out which end of it to level at the adversary. At four we\nwent down into a little gorge, about a mile from town, and borrowed a\nbarn door for a mark--borrowed it of a man who was over in California on\na visit--and we set the barn door up and stood a fence-rail up against\nthe middle of it, to represent Mr. Laird. But the rail was no proper\nrepresentative of him, for he was longer than a rail and thinner.\nNothing would ever fetch him but a line shot, and then as like as not he\nwould split the bullet--the worst material for duelling purposes that\ncould be imagined. I began on the rail. I couldn't hit the rail; then I\ntried the barn door; but I couldn't hit the barn door. There was nobody\nin danger except stragglers around on the flanks of that mark. I was\nthoroughly discouraged, and I didn't cheer up any when we presently\nheard pistol-shots over in the next little ravine. I knew what that\nwas--that was Laird's gang out practising him. They would hear my shots,\nand of course they would come up over the ridge to see what kind of a\nrecord I was making--see what their chances were against me. Well, I\nhadn't any record; and I knew that if Laird came over that ridge and saw\nmy barn door without a scratch on it, he would be as anxious to fight as\nI was--or as I had been at midnight, before that disastrous acceptance\ncame.\n\nNow just at this moment, a little bird, no bigger than a sparrow, flew\nalong by and lit on a sage-bush about thirty yards away. Steve whipped\nout his revolver and shot its head off. Oh, he was a marksman--much\nbetter than I was. We ran down there to pick up the bird, and just then,\nsure enough, Mr. Laird and his people came over the ridge, and they\njoined us. And when Laird's second saw that bird, with its head shot\noff, he lost color, he faded, and you could see that he was interested.\nHe said:\n\n\"Who did that?\"\n\nBefore I could answer, Steve spoke up and said quite calmly, and in a\nmatter-of-fact way,\n\n\"Clemens did it.\"\n\nThe second said, \"Why, that is wonderful. How far off was that bird?\"\n\nSteve said, \"Oh, not far--about thirty yards.\"\n\nThe second said, \"Well, that is astonishing shooting. How often can he\ndo that?\"\n\nSteve said languidly, \"Oh, about four times out of five.\"\n\nI knew the little rascal was lying, but I didn't say anything. The\nsecond said, \"Why, that is _amazing_ shooting; I supposed he couldn't\nhit a church.\"\n\nHe was supposing very sagaciously, but I didn't say anything. Well, they\nsaid good morning. The second took Mr. Laird home, a little tottery on\nhis legs, and Laird sent back a note in his own hand declining to fight\na duel with me on any terms whatever.\n\nWell, my life was saved--saved by that accident. I don't know what the\nbird thought about that interposition of Providence, but I felt very,\nvery comfortable over it--satisfied and content. Now, we found out,\nlater, that Laird had _hit_ his mark four times out of six, right along.\nIf the duel had come off, he would have so filled my skin with\nbullet-holes that it wouldn't have held my principles.\n\nBy breakfast-time the news was all over town that I had sent a challenge\nand Steve Gillis had carried it. Now that would entitle us to two years\napiece in the penitentiary, according to the brand-new law. Judge North\nsent us no message as coming from himself, but a message _came_ from a\nclose friend of his. He said it would be a good idea for us to leave the\nterritory by the first stage-coach. This would sail next morning, at\nfour o'clock--and in the meantime we would be searched for, but not with\navidity; and if we were in the Territory after that stage-coach left, we\nwould be the first victims of the new law. Judge North was anxious to\nhave some object-lessons for that law, and he would absolutely keep us\nin the prison the full two years.\n\nWell, it seemed to me that our society was no longer desirable in\nNevada; so we stayed in our quarters and observed proper caution all\nday--except that once Steve went over to the hotel to attend to another\ncustomer of mine. That was a Mr. Cutler. You see Laird was not the only\nperson whom I had tried to reform during my occupancy of the editorial\nchair. I had looked around and selected several other people, and\ndelivered a new zest of life into them through warm criticism and\ndisapproval--so that when I laid down my editorial pen I had four\nhorse-whippings and two duels owing to me. We didn't care for the\nhorse-whippings; there was no glory in them; they were not worth the\ntrouble of collecting. But honor required that some notice should be\ntaken of that other duel. Mr. Cutler had come up from Carson City, and\nhad sent a man over with a challenge from the hotel. Steve went over to\npacify him. Steve weighed only ninety-five pounds, but it was well known\nthroughout the territory that with his fists he could whip anybody that\nwalked on two legs, let his weight and science be what they might. Steve\nwas a Gillis, and when a Gillis confronted a man and had a proposition\nto make, the proposition always contained business. When Cutler found\nthat Steve was my second he cooled down; he became calm and rational,\nand was ready to listen. Steve gave him fifteen minutes to get out of\nthe hotel, and half an hour to get out of town or there would be\nresults. So _that_ duel went off successfully, because Mr. Cutler\nimmediately left for Carson a convinced and reformed man.\n\nI have never had anything to do with duels since. I thoroughly\ndisapprove of duels. I consider them unwise, and I know they are\ndangerous. Also, sinful. If a man should challenge me now, I would go to\nthat man and take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him to\na quiet retired spot, and _kill_ him.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCVI.\n\nJANUARY 4, 1907.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--IX.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n[_Dictated December 13, 1906._] As regards the coming American monarchy.\nIt was before the Secretary of State had been heard from that the\nchairman of the banquet said:\n\n\"In this time of unrest it is of great satisfaction that such a man as\nyou, Mr. Root, is chief adviser of the President.\"\n\nMr. Root then got up and in the most quiet and orderly manner touched\noff the successor to the San Francisco earthquake. As a result, the\nseveral State governments were well shaken up and considerably weakened.\nMr. Root was prophesying. He was prophesying, and it seems to me that no\nshrewder and surer forecasting has been done in this country for a good\nmany years.\n\nHe did not say, in so many words, that we are proceeding, in a steady\nmarch, toward eventual and unavoidable replacement of the republic by\nmonarchy; but I suppose he was aware that that is the case. He notes the\nseveral steps, the customary steps, which in all the ages have led to\nthe consolidation of loose and scattered governmental forces into\nformidable centralizations of authority; but he stops there, and doesn't\nadd up the sum. He is not unaware that heretofore the sum has been\nultimate monarchy, and that the same figures can fairly be depended upon\nto furnish the same sum whenever and wherever they can be produced, so\nlong as human nature shall remain as it is; but it was not needful that\nhe do the adding, since any one can do it; neither would it have been\ngracious in him to do it.\n\nIn observing the changed conditions which in the course of time have\nmade certain and sure the eventual seizure by the Washington government\nof a number of State duties and prerogatives which have been betrayed\nand neglected by the several States, he does not attribute those changes\nand the vast results which are to flow from them to any thought-out\npolicy of any party or of any body of dreamers or schemers, but properly\nand rightly attributes them to that stupendous power--_Circumstance_--\nwhich moves by laws of its own, regardless of parties and policies, and\nwhose decrees are final, and must be obeyed by all--and will be. The\nrailway is a Circumstance, the steamship is a Circumstance, the\ntelegraph is a Circumstance. They were mere happenings; and to the whole\nworld, the wise and the foolish alike, they were entirely trivial,\nwholly inconsequential; indeed silly, comical, grotesque. No man, and no\nparty, and no thought-out policy said, \"Behold, we will build railways\nand steamships and telegraphs, and presently you will see the condition\nand way of life of every man and woman and child in the nation totally\nchanged; unimaginable changes of law and custom will follow, in spite of\nanything that anybody can do to prevent it.\"\n\nThe changed conditions have come, and Circumstance knows what is\nfollowing, and will follow. So does Mr. Root. His language is not\nunclear, it is crystal:\n\n\n     \"Our whole life has swung away from the old State centres, and is\n     crystallizing about national centres.\"\n\n     \" ... The old barriers which kept the States as separate\n     communities are completely lost from sight.\"\n\n     \" ... That [State] power of regulation and control is gradually\n     passing into the hands of the national government.\"\n\n     \"Sometimes by an assertion of the inter-State commerce power,\n     sometimes by an assertion of the taxing power, the national\n     government is taking up the performance of duties which under the\n     changed conditions the separate States are no longer capable of\n     adequately performing.\"\n\n     \"We are urging forward in a development of business and social life\n     which tends more and more to the obliteration of State lines and\n     the decrease of State power as compared with national power.\"\n\n     \"It is useless for the advocates of State rights to inveigh against\n     ... the extension of national authority in the fields of necessary\n     control where the States themselves fail in the performance of\n     their duty.\"\n\n\nHe is not announcing a policy; he is not forecasting what a party of\nplanners will bring about; he is merely telling what the people will\nrequire and compel. And he could have added--which would be perfectly\ntrue--that the people will not be moved to it by speculation and\ncogitation and planning, but by _Circumstance_--that power which\narbitrarily compels all their actions, and over which they have not the\nslightest control.\n\n_\"The end is not yet.\"_\n\nIt is a true word. We are on the march, but at present we are only just\ngetting started.\n\nIf the States continue to fail to do their duty as required by the\npeople--\n\n\" ... _constructions of the Constitution will be found_ to vest the\npower where it will be exercised--in the national government.\"\n\nI do not know whether that has a sinister meaning or not, and so I will\nnot enlarge upon it lest I should chance to be in the wrong. It sounds\nlike ship-money come again, but it may not be so intended.\n\n\nHuman nature being what it is, I suppose we must expect to drift into\nmonarchy by and by. It is a saddening thought, but we cannot change our\nnature: we are all alike, we human beings; and in our blood and bone,\nand ineradicable, we carry the seeds out of which monarchies and\naristocracies are grown: worship of gauds, titles, distinctions, power.\nWe have to worship these things and their possessors, we are all born\nso, and we cannot help it. We have to be despised by somebody whom we\nregard as above us, or we are not happy; we have to have somebody to\nworship and envy, or we cannot be content. In America we manifest this\nin all the ancient and customary ways. In public we scoff at titles and\nhereditary privilege, but privately we hanker after them, and when we\nget a chance we buy them for cash and a daughter. Sometimes we get a\ngood man and worth the price, but we are ready to take him anyway,\nwhether he be ripe or rotten, whether he be clean and decent, or merely\na basket of noble and sacred and long-descended offal. And when we get\nhim the whole nation publicly chaffs and scoffs--and privately envies;\nand also is proud of the honor which has been conferred upon us. We run\nover our list of titled purchases every now and then, in the newspapers,\nand discuss them and caress them, and are thankful and happy.\n\nLike all the other nations, we worship money and the possessors of\nit--they being our aristocracy, and we have to have one. We like to read\nabout rich people in the papers; the papers know it, and they do their\nbest to keep this appetite liberally fed. They even leave out a football\nbull-fight now and then to get room for all the particulars of\nhow--according to the display heading--\"Rich Woman Fell Down Cellar--Not\nHurt.\" The falling down the cellar is of no interest to us when the\nwoman is not rich, but no rich woman can fall down cellar and we not\nyearn to know all about it and wish it was us.\n\nIn a monarchy the people willingly and rejoicingly revere and take pride\nin their nobilities, and are not humiliated by the reflection that this\nhumble and hearty homage gets no return but contempt. Contempt does not\nshame them, they are used to it, and they recognize that it is their\nproper due. We are all made like that. In Europe we easily and quickly\nlearn to take that attitude toward the sovereigns and the aristocracies;\nmoreover, it has been observed that when we get the attitude we go on\nand exaggerate it, presently becoming more servile than the natives, and\nvainer of it. The next step is to rail and scoff at republics and\ndemocracies. All of which is natural, for we have not ceased to be human\nbeings by becoming Americans, and the human race was always intended to\nbe governed by kingship, not by popular vote.\n\nI suppose we must expect that unavoidable and irresistible Circumstances\nwill gradually take away the powers of the States and concentrate them\nin the central government, and that the republic will then repeat the\nhistory of all time and become a monarchy; but I believe that if we\nobstruct these encroachments and steadily resist them the monarchy can\nbe postponed for a good while yet.\n\n[Sidenote: (1849-'51.)]\n\n[_Dictated December 1, 1906._] An exciting event in our village\n(Hannibal) was the arrival of the mesmerizer. I think the year was 1850.\nAs to that I am not sure, but I know the month--it was May; that detail\nhas survived the wear of fifty-five years. A pair of connected little\nincidents of that month have served to keep the memory of it green for\nme all this time; incidents of no consequence, and not worth embalming,\nyet my memory has preserved them carefully and flung away things of real\nvalue to give them space and make them comfortable. The truth is, a\nperson's memory has no more sense than his conscience, and no\nappreciation whatever of values and proportions. However, never mind\nthose trifling incidents; my subject is the mesmerizer, now.\n\nHe advertised his show, and promised marvels. Admission as usual: 25\ncents, children and negroes half price. The village had heard of\nmesmerism, in a general way, but had not encountered it yet. Not many\npeople attended, the first night, but next day they had so many wonders\nto tell that everybody's curiosity was fired, and after that for a\nfortnight the magician had prosperous times. I was fourteen or fifteen\nyears old--the age at which a boy is willing to endure all things,\nsuffer all things, short of death by fire, if thereby he may be\nconspicuous and show off before the public; and so, when I saw the\n\"subjects\" perform their foolish antics on the platform and make the\npeople laugh and shout and admire, I had a burning desire to be a\nsubject myself. Every night, for three nights, I sat in the row of\ncandidates on the platform, and held the magic disk in the palm of my\nhand, and gazed at it and tried to get sleepy, but it was a failure; I\nremained wide awake, and had to retire defeated, like the majority.\nAlso, I had to sit there and be gnawed with envy of Hicks, our\njourneyman; I had to sit there and see him scamper and jump when Simmons\nthe enchanter exclaimed, \"See the snake! see the snake!\" and hear him\nsay, \"My, how beautiful!\" in response to the suggestion that he was\nobserving a splendid sunset; and so on--the whole insane business. I\ncouldn't laugh, I couldn't applaud; it filled me with bitterness to have\nothers do it, and to have people make a hero of Hicks, and crowd around\nhim when the show was over, and ask him for more and more particulars of\nthe wonders he had seen in his visions, and manifest in many ways that\nthey were proud to be acquainted with him. Hicks--the idea! I couldn't\nstand it; I was getting boiled to death in my own bile.\n\nOn the fourth night temptation came, and I was not strong enough to\nresist. When I had gazed at the disk awhile I pretended to be sleepy,\nand began to nod. Straightway came the professor and made passes over my\nhead and down my body and legs and arms, finishing each pass with a snap\nof his fingers in the air, to discharge the surplus electricity; then he\nbegan to \"draw\" me with the disk, holding it in his fingers and telling\nme I could not take my eyes off it, try as I might; so I rose slowly,\nbent and gazing, and followed that disk all over the place, just as I\nhad seen the others do. Then I was put through the other paces. Upon\nsuggestion I fled from snakes; passed buckets at a fire; became excited\nover hot steamboat-races; made love to imaginary girls and kissed them;\nfished from the platform and landed mud-cats that outweighed me--and so\non, all the customary marvels. But not in the customary way. I was\ncautious at first, and watchful, being afraid the professor would\ndiscover that I was an impostor and drive me from the platform in\ndisgrace; but as soon as I realized that I was not in danger, I set\nmyself the task of terminating Hicks's usefulness as a subject, and of\nusurping his place.\n\nIt was a sufficiently easy task. Hicks was born honest; I, without that\nincumbrance--so some people said. Hicks saw what he saw, and reported\naccordingly; I saw more than was visible, and added to it such details\nas could help. Hicks had no imagination, I had a double supply. He was\nborn calm, I was born excited. No vision could start a rapture in him,\nand he was constipated as to language, anyway; but if I saw a vision I\nemptied the dictionary onto it and lost the remnant of my mind into the\nbargain.\n\nAt the end of my first half-hour Hicks was a thing of the past, a fallen\nhero, a broken idol, and I knew it and was glad, and said in my heart,\nSuccess to crime! Hicks could never have been mesmerized to the point\nwhere he could kiss an imaginary girl in public, or a real one either,\nbut I was competent. Whatever Hicks had failed in, I made it a point to\nsucceed in, let the cost be what it might, physically or morally. He\nhad shown several bad defects, and I had made a note of them. For\ninstance, if the magician asked, \"What do you see?\" and left him to\ninvent a vision for himself, Hicks was dumb and blind, he couldn't see a\nthing nor say a word, whereas the magician soon found that when it came\nto seeing visions of a stunning and marketable sort I could get along\nbetter without his help than with it. Then there was another thing:\nHicks wasn't worth a tallow dip on mute mental suggestion. Whenever\nSimmons stood behind him and gazed at the back of his skull and tried to\ndrive a mental suggestion into it, Hicks sat with vacant face, and never\nsuspected. If he had been noticing, he could have seen by the rapt faces\nof the audience that something was going on behind his back that\nrequired a response. Inasmuch as I was an impostor I dreaded to have\nthis test put upon me, for I knew the professor would be \"willing\" me to\ndo something, and as I couldn't know what it was, I should be exposed\nand denounced. However, when my time came, I took my chance. I perceived\nby the tense and expectant faces of the people that Simmons was behind\nme willing me with all his might. I tried my best to imagine what he\nwanted, but nothing suggested itself. I felt ashamed and miserable,\nthen. I believed that the hour of my disgrace was come, and that in\nanother moment I should go out of that place disgraced. I ought to be\nashamed to confess it, but my next thought was, not how I could win the\ncompassion of kindly hearts by going out humbly and in sorrow for my\nmisdoings, but how I could go out most sensationally and spectacularly.\n\nThere was a rusty and empty old revolver lying on the table, among the\n\"properties\" employed in the performances. On May-day, two or three\nweeks before, there had been a celebration by the schools, and I had had\na quarrel with a big boy who was the school-bully, and I had not come\nout of it with credit. That boy was now seated in the middle of the\nhouse, half-way down the main aisle. I crept stealthily and impressively\ntoward the table, with a dark and murderous scowl on my face, copied\nfrom a popular romance, seized the revolver suddenly, flourished it,\nshouted the bully's name, jumped off the platform, and made a rush for\nhim and chased him out of the house before the paralyzed people could\ninterfere to save him. There was a storm of applause, and the magician,\naddressing the house, said, most impressively--\n\n\"That you may know how really remarkable this is, and how wonderfully\ndeveloped a subject we have in this boy, I assure you that without a\nsingle spoken word to guide him he has carried out what I mentally\ncommanded him to do, to the minutest detail. I could have stopped him at\na moment in his vengeful career by a mere exertion of my will, therefore\nthe poor fellow who has escaped was at no time in danger.\"\n\nSo I was not in disgrace. I returned to the platform a hero, and happier\nthan I have ever been in this world since. As regards mental suggestion,\nmy fears of it were gone. I judged that in case I failed to guess what\nthe professor might be willing me to do, I could count on putting up\nsomething that would answer just as well. I was right, and exhibitions\nof unspoken suggestion became a favorite with the public. Whenever I\nperceived that I was being willed to do something I got up and did\nsomething--anything that occurred to me--and the magician, not being a\nfool, always ratified it. When people asked me, \"How _can_ you tell what\nhe is willing you to do?\" I said, \"It's just as easy,\" and they always\nsaid, admiringly, \"Well it beats _me_ how you can do it.\"\n\nHicks was weak in another detail. When the professor made passes over\nhim and said \"his whole body is without sensation now--come forward and\ntest him, ladies and gentlemen,\" the ladies and gentlemen always\ncomplied eagerly, and stuck pins into Hicks, and if they went deep Hicks\nwas sure to wince, then that poor professor would have to explain that\nHicks \"wasn't sufficiently under the influence.\" But I didn't wince; I\nonly suffered, and shed tears on the inside. The miseries that a\nconceited boy will endure to keep up his \"reputation\"! And so will a\nconceited man; I know it in my own person, and have seen it in a hundred\nthousand others. That professor ought to have protected me, and I often\nhoped he would, when the tests were unusually severe, but he didn't. It\nmay be that he was deceived as well as the others, though I did not\nbelieve it nor think it possible. Those were dear good people, but they\nmust have carried simplicity and credulity to the limit. They would\nstick a pin in my arm and bear on it until they drove it a third of its\nlength in, and then be lost in wonder that by a mere exercise of\nwill-power the professor could turn my arm to iron and make it\ninsensible to pain. Whereas it was not insensible at all; I was\nsuffering agonies of pain.\n\nAfter that fourth night, that proud night, that triumphant night, I was\nthe only subject. Simmons invited no more candidates to the platform. I\nperformed alone, every night, the rest of the fortnight. In the\nbeginning of the second week I conquered the last doubters. Up to that\ntime a dozen wise old heads, the intellectual aristocracy of the town,\nhad held out, as implacable unbelievers. I was as hurt by this as if I\nwere engaged in some honest occupation. There is nothing surprising\nabout this. Human beings feel dishonor the most, sometimes, when they\nmost deserve it. That handful of overwise old gentlemen kept on shaking\ntheir heads all the first week, and saying they had seen no marvels\nthere that could not have been produced by collusion; and they were\npretty vain of their unbelief, too, and liked to show it and air it, and\nbe superior to the ignorant and the gullible. Particularly old Dr.\nPeake, who was the ringleader of the irreconcilables, and very\nformidable; for he was an F.F.V., he was learned, white-haired and\nvenerable, nobly and richly clad in the fashions of an earlier and a\ncourtlier day, he was large and stately, and he not only seemed wise,\nbut was what he seemed, in that regard. He had great influence, and his\nopinion upon any matter was worth much more than that of any other\nperson in the community. When I conquered him, at last, I knew I was\nundisputed master of the field; and now, after more than fifty years, I\nacknowledge, with a few dry old tears, that I rejoiced without shame.\n\n\n[Sidenote: (1847.)]\n\n[_Dictated December 2, 1906._] In 1847 we were living in a large white\nhouse on the corner of Hill and Main Streets--a house that still stands,\nbut isn't large now, although it hasn't lost a plank; I saw it a year\nago and noticed that shrinkage. My father died in it in March of the\nyear mentioned, but our family did not move out of it until some months\nafterward. Ours was not the only family in the house, there was\nanother--Dr. Grant's. One day Dr. Grant and Dr. Reyburn argued a matter\non the street with sword-canes, and Grant was brought home\nmultifariously punctured. Old Dr. Peake calked the leaks, and came every\nday for a while, to look after him. The Grants were Virginians, like\nPeake, and one day when Grant was getting well enough to be on his feet\nand sit around in the parlor and talk, the conversation fell upon\nVirginia and old times. I was present, but the group were probably quite\nunconscious of me, I being only a lad and a negligible quantity. Two of\nthe group--Dr. Peake and Mrs. Crawford, Mrs. Grant's mother--had been of\nthe audience when the Richmond theatre burned down, thirty-six years\nbefore, and they talked over the frightful details of that memorable\ntragedy. These were eye-witnesses, and with their eyes I saw it all with\nan intolerable vividness: I saw the black smoke rolling and tumbling\ntoward the sky, I saw the flames burst through it and turn red, I heard\nthe shrieks of the despairing, I glimpsed their faces at the windows,\ncaught fitfully through the veiling smoke, I saw them jump to their\ndeath, or to mutilation worse than death. The picture is before me yet,\nand can never fade.\n\nIn due course they talked of the colonial mansion of the Peakes, with\nits stately columns and its spacious grounds, and by odds and ends I\npicked up a clearly defined idea of the place. I was strongly\ninterested, for I had not before heard of such palatial things from the\nlips of people who had seen them with their own eyes. One detail,\ncasually dropped, hit my imagination hard. In the wall, by the great\nfront door, there was a round hole as big as a saucer--a British\ncannon-ball had made it, in the war of the Revolution. It was\nbreath-taking; it made history real; history had never been real to me\nbefore.\n\nVery well, three or four years later, as already mentioned, I was\nking-bee and sole \"subject\" in the mesmeric show; it was the beginning\nof the second week; the performance was half over; just then the\nmajestic Dr. Peake, with his ruffled bosom and wristbands and his\ngold-headed cane, entered, and a deferential citizen vacated his seat\nbeside the Grants and made the great chief take it. This happened while\nI was trying to invent something fresh in the way of a vision, in\nresponse to the professor's remark--\n\n\"Concentrate your powers. Look--look attentively. There--don't you see\nsomething? Concentrate--concentrate. Now then--describe it.\"\n\nWithout suspecting it, Dr. Peake, by entering the place, had reminded me\nof the talk of three years before. He had also furnished me capital and\nwas become my confederate, an accomplice in my frauds. I began on a\nvision, a vague and dim one (that was part of the game at the beginning\nof a vision; it isn't best to see it too clearly at first, it might look\nas if you had come loaded with it). The vision developed, by degrees,\nand gathered swing, momentum, energy. It was the Richmond fire. Dr.\nPeake was cold, at first, and his fine face had a trace of polite scorn\nin it; but when he began to recognize that fire, that expression\nchanged, and his eyes began to light up. As soon as I saw that, I threw\nthe valves wide open and turned on all the steam, and gave those people\na supper of fire and horrors that was calculated to last them one while!\nThey couldn't gasp, when I got through--they were petrified. Dr. Peake\nhad risen, and was standing,--and breathing hard. He said, in a great\nvoice--\n\n\"My doubts are ended. No collusion could produce that miracle. It was\ntotally impossible for him to know those details, yet he has described\nthem with the clarity of an eye-witness--and with what unassailable\ntruthfulness God knows I know!\"\n\nI saved the colonial mansion for the last night, and solidified and\nperpetuated Dr. Peake's conversion with the cannon-ball hole. He\nexplained to the house that I could never have heard of that small\ndetail, which differentiated this mansion from all other Virginian\nmansions and perfectly identified it, therefore the fact stood proven\nthat I had _seen_ it in my vision. Lawks!\n\nIt is curious. When the magician's engagement closed there was but one\nperson in the village who did not believe in mesmerism, and I was the\none. All the others were converted, but I was to remain an implacable\nand unpersuadable disbeliever in mesmerism and hypnotism for close upon\nfifty years. This was because I never would examine them, in after life.\nI couldn't. The subject revolted me. Perhaps because it brought back to\nme a passage in my life which for pride's sake I wished to forget;\nthough I thought--or persuaded myself I thought--I should never come\nacross a \"proof\" which wasn't thin and cheap, and probably had a fraud\nlike me behind it.\n\nThe truth is, I did not have to wait long to get tired of my triumphs.\nNot thirty days, I think. The glory which is built upon a lie soon\nbecomes a most unpleasant incumbrance. No doubt for a while I enjoyed\nhaving my exploits told and retold and told again in my presence and\nwondered over and exclaimed about, but I quite distinctly remember that\nthere presently came a time when the subject was wearisome and odious to\nme and I could not endure the disgusting discomfort of it. I am well\naware that the world-glorified doer of a deed of great and real splendor\nhas just my experience; I know that he deliciously enjoys hearing about\nit for three or four weeks, and that pretty soon after that he begins to\ndread the mention of it, and by and by wishes he had been with the\ndamned before he ever thought of doing that deed; I remember how General\nSherman used to rage and swear over \"When we were Marching through\nGeorgia,\" which was played at him and sung at him everywhere he went;\nstill, I think I suffered a shade more than the legitimate hero does, he\nbeing privileged to soften his misery with the reflection that his glory\nwas at any rate golden and reproachless in its origin, whereas I had no\nsuch privilege, there being no possible way to make mine respectable.\n\nHow easy it is to make people believe a lie, and how hard it is to undo\nthat work again! Thirty-five years after those evil exploits of mine I\nvisited my old mother, whom I had not seen for ten years; and being\nmoved by what seemed to me a rather noble and perhaps heroic impulse, I\nthought I would humble myself and confess my ancient fault. It cost me a\ngreat effort to make up my mind; I dreaded the sorrow that would rise in\nher face, and the shame that would look out of her eyes; but after long\nand troubled reflection, the sacrifice seemed due and right, and I\ngathered my resolution together and made the confession.\n\nTo my astonishment there were no sentimentalities, no dramatics, no\nGeorge Washington effects; she was not moved in the least degree; she\nsimply did not believe me, and said so! I was not merely disappointed, I\nwas nettled, to have my costly truthfulness flung out of the market in\nthis placid and confident way when I was expecting to get a profit out\nof it. I asserted, and reasserted, with rising heat, my statement that\nevery single thing I had done on those long-vanished nights was a lie\nand a swindle; and when she shook her head tranquilly and said she knew\nbetter, I put up my hand and _swore_ to it--adding a triumphant \"_Now_\nwhat do you say?\"\n\nIt did not affect her at all; it did not budge her the fraction of an\ninch from her position. If this was hard for me to endure, it did not\nbegin with the blister she put upon the raw when she began to put my\nsworn oath out of court with _arguments_ to prove that I was under a\ndelusion and did not know what I was talking about. Arguments! Arguments\nto show that a person on a man's outside can know better what is on his\ninside than he does himself! I had cherished some contempt for arguments\nbefore, I have not enlarged my respect for them since. She refused to\nbelieve that I had invented my visions myself; she said it was folly:\nthat I was only a child at the time and could not have done it. She\ncited the Richmond fire and the colonial mansion and said they were\nquite beyond my capacities. Then I saw my chance! I said she was\nright--I didn't invent those, I got them from Dr. Peake. Even this great\nshot did no damage. She said Dr. Peake's evidence was better than mine,\nand he had said in plain words that it was impossible for me to have\nheard about those things. Dear, dear, what a grotesque and unthinkable\nsituation: a confessed swindler convicted of honesty and condemned to\nacquittal by circumstantial evidence furnished by the swindled!\n\nI realised, with shame and with impotent vexation, that I was defeated\nall along the line. I had but one card left, but it was a formidable\none. I played it--and stood from under. It seemed ignoble to demolish\nher fortress, after she had defended it so valiantly; but the defeated\nknow not mercy. I played that matter card. It was the pin-sticking. I\nsaid, solemnly--\n\n\"I give you my honor, a pin was never stuck into me without causing me\ncruel pain.\"\n\nShe only said--\n\n\"It is thirty-five years. I believe you do think that, _now_, but I was\nthere, and I know better. You never winced.\"\n\nShe was so calm! and I was so far from it, so nearly frantic.\n\n\"Oh, my goodness!\" I said, \"let me _show_ you that I am speaking the\ntruth. Here is my arm; drive a pin into it--drive it to the head--I\nshall not wince.\"\n\nShe only shook her gray head and said, with simplicity and conviction--\n\n\"You are a man, now, and could dissemble the hurt; but you were only a\nchild then, and could not have done it.\"\n\nAnd so the lie which I played upon her in my youth remained with her as\nan unchallengeable truth to the day of her death. Carlyle said \"a lie\ncannot live.\" It shows that he did not know how to tell them. If I had\ntaken out a life policy on this one the premiums would have bankrupted\nme ages ago.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCVII.\n\nJANUARY 18, 1907.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--X.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n[Sidenote: (1825.)]\n\n[Sidenote: (1837.)]\n\n[_Dictated March 28, 1906._] Orion Clemens was born in Jamestown,\nFentress County, Tennessee, in 1825. He was the family's first-born, and\nantedated me ten years. Between him and me came a sister, Margaret, who\ndied, aged ten, in 1837, in that village of Florida, Missouri, where I\nwas born; and Pamela, mother of Samuel E. Moffett, who was an invalid\nall her life and died in the neighborhood of New York a year ago, aged\nabout seventy-five. Her character was without blemish, and she was of a\nmost kindly and gentle disposition. Also there was a brother, Benjamin,\nwho died in 1848 aged ten or twelve.\n\n[Sidenote: (1843.)]\n\nOrion's boyhood was spent in that wee little log hamlet of Jamestown up\nthere among the \"knobs\"--so called--of East Tennessee. The family\nmigrated to Florida, Missouri, then moved to Hannibal, Missouri, when\nOrion was twelve and a half years old. When he was fifteen or sixteen he\nwas sent to St. Louis and there he learned the printer's trade. One of\nhis characteristics was eagerness. He woke with an eagerness about some\nmatter or other every morning; it consumed him all day; it perished in\nthe night and he was on fire with a fresh new interest next morning\nbefore he could get his clothes on. He exploited in this way three\nhundred and sixty-five red-hot new eagernesses every year of his life.\nBut I am forgetting another characteristic, a very pronounced one. That\nwas his deep glooms, his despondencies, his despairs; these had their\nplace in each and every day along with the eagernesses. Thus his day was\ndivided--no, not divided, mottled--from sunrise to midnight with\nalternating brilliant sunshine and black cloud. Every day he was the\nmost joyous and hopeful man that ever was, I think, and also every day\nhe was the most miserable man that ever was.\n\nWhile he was in his apprenticeship in St. Louis, he got well acquainted\nwith Edward Bates, who was afterwards in Mr. Lincoln's first cabinet.\nBates was a very fine man, an honorable and upright man, and a\ndistinguished lawyer. He patiently allowed Orion to bring to him each\nnew project; he discussed it with him and extinguished it by argument\nand irresistible logic--at first. But after a few weeks he found that\nthis labor was not necessary; that he could leave the new project alone\nand it would extinguish itself the same night. Orion thought he would\nlike to become a lawyer. Mr. Bates encouraged him, and he studied law\nnearly a week, then of course laid it aside to try something new. He\nwanted to become an orator. Mr. Bates gave him lessons. Mr. Bates walked\nthe floor reading from an English book aloud and rapidly turning the\nEnglish into French, and he recommended this exercise to Orion. But as\nOrion knew no French, he took up that study and wrought at it like a\nvolcano for two or three days; then gave it up. During his\napprenticeship in St. Louis he joined a number of churches, one after\nanother, and taught in their Sunday-schools--changing his Sunday-school\nevery time he changed his religion. He was correspondingly erratic in\nhis politics--Whig to-day, Democrat next week, and anything fresh that\nhe could find in the political market the week after. I may remark here\nthat throughout his long life he was always trading religions and\nenjoying the change of scenery. I will also remark that his sincerity\nwas never doubted; his truthfulness was never doubted; and in matters of\nbusiness and money his honesty was never questioned. Notwithstanding his\nforever-recurring caprices and changes, his principles were high, always\nhigh, and absolutely unshakable. He was the strangest compound that ever\ngot mixed in a human mould. Such a person as that is given to acting\nupon impulse and without reflection; that was Orion's way. Everything he\ndid he did with conviction and enthusiasm and with a vainglorious pride\nin the thing he was doing--and no matter what that thing was, whether\ngood, bad or indifferent, he repented of it every time in sackcloth and\nashes before twenty-four hours had sped. Pessimists are born, not made.\nOptimists are born, not made. But I think he was the only person I have\never known in whom pessimism and optimism were lodged in exactly equal\nproportions. Except in the matter of grounded principle, he was as\nunstable as water. You could dash his spirits with a single word; you\ncould raise them into the sky again with another one. You could break\nhis heart with a word of disapproval; you could make him as happy as an\nangel with a word of approval. And there was no occasion to put any\nsense or any vestige of mentality of any kind into these miracles;\nanything you might say would answer.\n\nHe had another conspicuous characteristic, and it was the father of\nthose which I have just spoken of. This was an intense lust for\napproval. He was so eager to be approved, so girlishly anxious to be\napproved by anybody and everybody, without discrimination, that he was\ncommonly ready to forsake his notions, opinions and convictions at a\nmoment's notice in order to get the approval of any person who disagreed\nwith them. I wish to be understood as reserving his fundamental\nprinciples all the time. He never forsook those to please anybody. Born\nand reared among slaves and slaveholders, he was yet an abolitionist\nfrom his boyhood to his death. He was always truthful; he was always\nsincere; he was always honest and honorable. But in light\nmatters--matters of small consequence, like religion and politics and\nsuch things--he never acquired a conviction that could survive a\ndisapproving remark from a cat.\n\nHe was always dreaming; he was a dreamer from birth, and this\ncharacteristic got him into trouble now and then.\n\nOnce when he was twenty-three or twenty-four years old, and was become a\njourneyman, he conceived the romantic idea of coming to Hannibal without\ngiving us notice, in order that he might furnish to the family a\npleasant surprise. If he had given notice, he would have been informed\nthat we had changed our residence and that that gruff old bass-voiced\nsailorman, Dr. G., our family physician, was living in the house which\nwe had formerly occupied and that Orion's former room in that house was\nnow occupied by Dr. G.'s two middle-aged maiden sisters. Orion arrived\nat Hannibal per steamboat in the middle of the night, and started with\nhis customary eagerness on his excursion, his mind all on fire with his\nromantic project and building and enjoying his surprise in advance. He\nwas always enjoying things in advance; it was the make of him. He never\ncould wait for the event, but must build it out of dream-stuff and enjoy\nit beforehand--consequently sometimes when the event happened he saw\nthat it was not as good as the one he had invented in his imagination,\nand so he had lost profit by not keeping the imaginary one and letting\nthe reality go.\n\nWhen he arrived at the house he went around to the back door and slipped\noff his boots and crept up-stairs and arrived at the room of those\nelderly ladies without having wakened any sleepers. He undressed in the\ndark and got into bed and snuggled up against somebody. He was a little\nsurprised, but not much--for he thought it was our brother Ben. It was\nwinter, and the bed was comfortable, and the supposed Ben added to the\ncomfort--and so he was dropping off to sleep very well satisfied with\nhis progress so far and full of happy dreams of what was going to happen\nin the morning. But something else was going to happen sooner than that,\nand it happened now. The maid that was being crowded fumed and fretted\nand struggled and presently came to a half-waking condition and\nprotested against the crowding. That voice paralyzed Orion. He couldn't\nmove a limb; he couldn't get his breath; and the crowded one discovered\nhis new whiskers and began to scream. This removed the paralysis, and\nOrion was out of bed and clawing round in the dark for his clothes in a\nfraction of a second. Both maids began to scream then, so Orion did not\nwait to get his whole wardrobe. He started with such parts of it as he\ncould grab. He flew to the head of the stairs and started down, and was\nparalyzed again at that point, because he saw the faint yellow flame of\na candle soaring up the stairs from below and he judged that Dr. G. was\nbehind it, and he was. He had no clothes on to speak of, but no matter,\nhe was well enough fixed for an occasion like this, because he had a\nbutcher-knife in his hand. Orion shouted to him, and this saved his\nlife, for the Doctor recognized his voice. Then in those deep-sea-going\nbass tones of his that I used to admire so much when I was a little boy,\nhe explained to Orion the change that had been made, told him where to\nfind the Clemens family, and closed with some quite unnecessary advice\nabout posting himself before he undertook another adventure like\nthat--advice which Orion probably never needed again as long as he\nlived.\n\nOne bitter December night, Orion sat up reading until three o'clock in\nthe morning and then, without looking at a clock, sallied forth to call\non a young lady. He hammered and hammered at the door; couldn't get any\nresponse; didn't understand it. Anybody else would have regarded that as\nan indication of some kind or other and would have drawn inferences and\ngone home. But Orion didn't draw inferences, he merely hammered and\nhammered, and finally the father of the girl appeared at the door in a\ndressing-gown. He had a candle in his hand and the dressing-gown was all\nthe clothing he had on--except an expression of unwelcome which was so\nthick and so large that it extended all down his front to his instep and\nnearly obliterated the dressing-gown. But Orion didn't notice that this\nwas an unpleasant expression. He merely walked in. The old gentleman\ntook him into the parlor, set the candle on a table, and stood. Orion\nmade the usual remarks about the weather, and sat down--sat down and\ntalked and talked and went on talking--that old man looking at him\nvindictively and waiting for his chance--waiting treacherously and\nmalignantly for his chance. Orion had not asked for the young lady. It\nwas not customary. It was understood that a young fellow came to see the\ngirl of the house, not the founder of it. At last Orion got up and made\nsome remark to the effect that probably the young lady was busy and he\nwould go now and call again. That was the old man's chance, and he said\nwith fervency \"Why good land, aren't you going to stop to breakfast?\"\n\n\nOrion did not come to Hannibal until two or three years after my\nfather's death. Meantime he remained in St Louis. He was a journeyman\nprinter and earning wages. Out of his wage he supported my mother and my\nbrother Henry, who was two years younger than I. My sister Pamela helped\nin this support by taking piano pupils. Thus we got along, but it was\npretty hard sledding. I was not one of the burdens, because I was taken\nfrom school at once, upon my father's death, and placed in the office of\nthe Hannibal \"Courier,\" as printer's apprentice, and Mr. S., the editor\nand proprietor of the paper, allowed me the usual emolument of the\noffice of apprentice--that is to say board and clothes, but no money.\nThe clothes consisted of two suits a year, but one of the suits always\nfailed to materialize and the other suit was not purchased so long as\nMr. S.'s old clothes held out. I was only about half as big as Mr. S.,\nconsequently his shirts gave me the uncomfortable sense of living in a\ncircus tent, and I had to turn up his pants to my ears to make them\nshort enough.\n\nThere were two other apprentices. One was Steve Wilkins, seventeen or\neighteen years old and a giant. When he was in Mr. S.'s clothes they\nfitted him as the candle-mould fits the candle--thus he was generally in\na suffocated condition, particularly in the summer-time. He was a\nreckless, hilarious, admirable creature; he had no principles, and was\ndelightful company. At first we three apprentices had to feed in the\nkitchen with the old slave cook and her very handsome and bright and\nwell-behaved young mulatto daughter. For his own amusement--for he was\nnot generally laboring for other people's amusement--Steve was\nconstantly and persistently and loudly and elaborately making love to\nthat mulatto girl and distressing the life out of her and worrying the\nold mother to death. She would say, \"Now, Marse Steve, Marse Steve,\ncan't you behave yourself?\" With encouragement like that, Steve would\nnaturally renew his attentions and emphasize them. It was killingly\nfunny to Ralph and me. And, to speak truly, the old mother's distress\nabout it was merely a pretence. She quite well understood that by the\ncustoms of slaveholding communities it was Steve's right to make love to\nthat girl if he wanted to. But the girl's distress was very real. She\nhad a refined nature, and she took all Steve's extravagant love-making\nin resentful earnest.\n\nWe got but little variety in the way of food at that kitchen table, and\nthere wasn't enough of it anyway. So we apprentices used to keep alive\nby arts of our own--that is to say, we crept into the cellar nearly\nevery night, by a private entrance which we had discovered, and we\nrobbed the cellar of potatoes and onions and such things, and carried\nthem down-town to the printing-office, where we slept on pallets on the\nfloor, and cooked them at the stove and had very good times.\n\nAs I have indicated, Mr. S.'s economies were of a pretty close and rigid\nkind. By and by, when we apprentices were promoted from the basement to\nthe ground floor and allowed to sit at the family table, along with the\none journeyman, Harry H., the economies continued. Mrs. S. was a bride.\nShe had attained to that distinction very recently, after waiting a good\npart of a lifetime for it, and she was the right woman in the right\nplace, according to the economics of the place, for she did not trust\nthe sugar-bowl to us, but sweetened our coffee herself. That is, she\nwent through the motions. She didn't really sweeten it. She seemed to\nput one heaping teaspoonful of brown sugar into each cup, but, according\nto Steve, that was a deceit. He said she dipped the spoon in the coffee\nfirst to make the sugar stick, and then scooped the sugar out of the\nbowl with the spoon upside down, so that the effect to the eye was a\nheaped-up spoon, whereas the sugar on it was nothing but a layer. This\nall seems perfectly true to me, and yet that thing would be so difficult\nto perform that I suppose it really didn't happen, but was one of\nSteve's lies.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCVIII.\n\nFEBRUARY 1, 1907.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XI.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n[Sidenote: (1850.)]\n\n[_Dictated March 28th, 1906._] About 1849 or 1850 Orion severed his\nconnection with the printing-house in St. Louis and came up to Hannibal,\nand bought a weekly paper called the Hannibal \"Journal,\" together with\nits plant and its good-will, for the sum of five hundred dollars cash.\nHe borrowed the cash at ten per cent. interest, from an old farmer named\nJohnson who lived five miles out of town. Then he reduced the\nsubscription price of the paper from two dollars to one dollar. He\nreduced the rates for advertising in about the same proportion, and\nthus he created one absolute and unassailable certainty--to wit: that\nthe business would never pay him a single cent of profit. He took me out\nof the \"Courier\" office and engaged my services in his own at three\ndollars and a half a week, which was an extravagant wage, but Orion was\nalways generous, always liberal with everybody except himself. It cost\nhim nothing in my case, for he never was able to pay me a penny as long\nas I was with him. By the end of the first year he found he must make\nsome economies. The office rent was cheap, but it was not cheap enough.\nHe could not afford to pay rent of any kind, so he moved the whole plant\ninto the house we lived in, and it cramped the dwelling-place cruelly.\nHe kept that paper alive during four years, but I have at this time no\nidea how he accomplished it. Toward the end of each year he had to turn\nout and scrape and scratch for the fifty dollars of interest due Mr.\nJohnson, and that fifty dollars was about the only cash he ever received\nor paid out, I suppose, while he was proprietor of that newspaper,\nexcept for ink and printing-paper. The paper was a dead failure. It had\nto be that from the start. Finally he handed it over to Mr. Johnson, and\nwent up to Muscatine, Iowa, and acquired a small interest in a weekly\nnewspaper there. It was not a sort of property to marry on--but no\nmatter. He came across a winning and pretty girl who lived in Quincy,\nIllinois, a few miles below Keokuk, and they became engaged. He was\nalways falling in love with girls, but by some accident or other he had\nnever gone so far as engagement before. And now he achieved nothing but\nmisfortune by it, because he straightway fell in love with a Keokuk\ngirl. He married the Keokuk girl and they began a struggle for life\nwhich turned out to be a difficult enterprise, and very unpromising.\n\nTo gain a living in Muscatine was plainly impossible, so Orion and his\nnew wife went to Keokuk to live, for she wanted to be near her\nrelatives. He bought a little bit of a job-printing plant--on credit, of\ncourse--and at once put prices down to where not even the apprentices\ncould get a living out of it, and this sort of thing went on.\n\n[Sidenote: (1853.)]\n\nI had not joined the Muscatine migration. Just before that happened\n(which I think was in 1853) I disappeared one night and fled to St.\nLouis. There I worked in the composing-room of the \"Evening News\" for a\ntime, and then started on my travels to see the world. The world was New\nYork City, and there was a little World's Fair there. It had just been\nopened where the great reservoir afterward was, and where the sumptuous\npublic library is now being built--Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street.\nI arrived in New York with two or three dollars in pocket change and a\nten-dollar bank-bill concealed in the lining of my coat. I got work at\nvillainous wages in the establishment of John A. Gray and Green in Cliff\nStreet, and I found board in a sufficiently villainous mechanics'\nboarding-house in Duane Street. The firm paid my wages in wildcat money\nat its face value, and my week's wage merely sufficed to pay board and\nlodging. By and by I went to Philadelphia and worked there some months\nas a \"sub\" on the \"Inquirer\" and the \"Public Ledger.\" Finally I made a\nflying trip to Washington to see the sights there, and in 1854 I went\nback to the Mississippi Valley, sitting upright in the smoking-car two\nor three days and nights. When I reached St. Louis I was exhausted. I\nwent to bed on board a steamboat that was bound for Muscatine. I fell\nasleep at once, with my clothes on, and didn't wake again for thirty-six\nhours.\n\n[Sidenote: (1854.)]\n\n... I worked in that little job-office in Keokuk as much as two years, I\nshould say, without ever collecting a cent of wages, for Orion was never\nable to pay anything--but Dick Higham and I had good times. I don't know\nwhat Dick got, but it was probably only uncashable promises.\n\n[Sidenote: (1856.)]\n\nOne day in the midwinter of 1856 or 1857--I think it was 1856--I was\ncoming along the main street of Keokuk in the middle of the forenoon. It\nwas bitter weather--so bitter that that street was deserted, almost. A\nlight dry snow was blowing here and there on the ground and on the\npavement, swirling this way and that way and making all sorts of\nbeautiful figures, but very chilly to look at. The wind blew a piece of\npaper past me and it lodged against a wall of a house. Something about\nthe look of it attracted my attention and I gathered it in. It was a\nfifty-dollar bill, the only one I had ever seen, and the largest\nassemblage of money I had ever encountered in one spot. I advertised it\nin the papers and suffered more than a thousand dollars' worth of\nsolicitude and fear and distress during the next few days lest the owner\nshould see the advertisement and come and take my fortune away. As many\nas four days went by without an applicant; then I could endure this kind\nof misery no longer. I felt sure that another four could not go by in\nthis safe and secure way. I felt that I must take that money out of\ndanger. So I bought a ticket for Cincinnati and went to that city. I\nworked there several months in the printing-office of Wrightson and\nCompany. I had been reading Lieutenant Herndon's account of his\nexplorations of the Amazon and had been mightily attracted by what he\nsaid of coca. I made up my mind that I would go to the head waters of\nthe Amazon and collect coca and trade in it and make a fortune. I left\nfor New Orleans in the steamer \"Paul Jones\" with this great idea filling\nmy mind. One of the pilots of that boat was Horace Bixby. Little by\nlittle I got acquainted with him, and pretty soon I was doing a lot of\nsteering for him in his daylight watches. When I got to New Orleans I\ninquired about ships leaving for Par\u00e1 and discovered that there weren't\nany, and learned that there probably wouldn't be any during that\ncentury. It had not occurred to me to inquire about those particulars\nbefore leaving Cincinnati, so there I was. I couldn't get to the Amazon.\nI had no friends in New Orleans and no money to speak of. I went to\nHorace Bixby and asked him to make a pilot out of me. He said he would\ndo it for a hundred dollars cash in advance. So I steered for him up to\nSt. Louis, borrowed the money from my brother-in-law and closed the\nbargain. I had acquired this brother-in-law several years before. This\nwas Mr. William A. Moffett, a merchant, a Virginian--a fine man in every\nway. He had married my sister Pamela, and the Samuel E. Moffett of whom\nI have been speaking was their son. Within eighteen months I became a\ncompetent pilot, and I served that office until the Mississippi River\ntraffic was brought to a standstill by the breaking out of the civil\nwar.\n\n... Meantime Orion had gone down the river and established his little\njob-printing-office in Keokuk. On account of charging next to nothing\nfor the work done in his job-office, he had almost nothing to do there.\nHe was never able to comprehend that work done on a profitless basis\ndeteriorates and is presently not worth anything, and that customers are\nthen obliged to go where they can get better work, even if they must pay\nbetter prices for it. He had plenty of time, and he took up Blackstone\nagain. He also put up a sign which offered his services to the public\nas a lawyer. He never got a case, in those days, nor even an applicant,\nalthough he was quite willing to transact law business for nothing and\nfurnish the stationery himself. He was always liberal that way.\n\n[Sidenote: (1861.)]\n\nPresently he moved to a wee little hamlet called Alexandria, two or\nthree miles down the river, and he put up that sign there. He got no\ncustom. He was by this time very hard aground. But by this time I was\nbeginning to earn a wage of two hundred and fifty dollars a month as\npilot, and so I supported him thenceforth until 1861, when his ancient\nfriend, Edward Bates, then a member of Mr. Lincoln's first cabinet, got\nhim the place of Secretary of the new Territory of Nevada, and Orion and\nI cleared for that country in the overland stage-coach, I paying the\nfares, which were pretty heavy, and carrying with me what money I had\nbeen able to save--this was eight hundred dollars, I should say--and it\nwas all in silver coin and a good deal of a nuisance because of its\nweight. And we had another nuisance, which was an Unabridged Dictionary.\nIt weighed about a thousand pounds, and was a ruinous expense, because\nthe stage-coach Company charged for extra baggage by the ounce. We could\nhave kept a family for a time on what that dictionary cost in the way of\nextra freight--and it wasn't a good dictionary anyway--didn't have any\nmodern words in it--only had obsolete ones that they used to use when\nNoah Webster was a child.\n\nThe Government of the new Territory of Nevada was an interesting\nmenagerie. Governor Nye was an old and seasoned politician from New\nYork--politician, not statesman. He had white hair; he was in fine\nphysical condition; he had a winningly friendly face and deep lustrous\nbrown eyes that could talk as a native language the tongue of every\nfeeling, every passion, every emotion. His eyes could outtalk his\ntongue, and this is saying a good deal, for he was a very remarkable\ntalker, both in private and on the stump. He was a shrewd man; he\ngenerally saw through surfaces and perceived what was going on inside\nwithout being suspected of having an eye on the matter.\n\nWhen grown-up persons indulge in practical jokes, the fact gauges them.\nThey have lived narrow, obscure, and ignorant lives, and at full manhood\nthey still retain and cherish a job-lot of left-over standards and\nideals that would have been discarded with their boyhood if they had\nthen moved out into the world and a broader life. There were many\npractical jokers in the new Territory. I do not take pleasure in\nexposing this fact, for I liked those people; but what I am saying is\ntrue. I wish I could say a kindlier thing about them instead--that they\nwere burglars, or hat-rack thieves, or something like that, that\nwouldn't be utterly uncomplimentary. I would prefer it, but I can't say\nthose things, they would not be true. These people were practical\njokers, and I will not try to disguise it. In other respects they were\nplenty good-enough people; honest people; reputable and likable. They\nplayed practical jokes upon each other with success, and got the\nadmiration and applause and also the envy of the rest of the community.\nNaturally they were eager to try their arts on big game, and that was\nwhat the Governor was. But they were not able to score. They made\nseveral efforts, but the Governor defeated these efforts without any\ntrouble and went on smiling his pleasant smile as if nothing had\nhappened. Finally the joker chiefs of Carson City and Virginia City\nconspired together to see if their combined talent couldn't win a\nvictory, for the jokers were getting into a very uncomfortable place:\nthe people were laughing at them, instead of at their proposed victim.\nThey banded themselves together to the number of ten and invited the\nGovernor to what was a most extraordinary attention in those\ndays--pickled oyster stew and champagne--luxuries very seldom seen in\nthat region, and existing rather as fabrics of the imagination than as\nfacts.\n\nThe Governor took me with him. He said disparagingly,\n\n\"It's a poor invention. It doesn't deceive. Their idea is to get me\ndrunk and leave me under the table, and from their standpoint this will\nbe very funny. But they don't know me. I am familiar with champagne and\nhave no prejudices against it.\"\n\nThe fate of the joke was not decided until two o'clock in the morning.\nAt that hour the Governor was serene, genial, comfortable, contented,\nhappy and sober, although he was so full that he couldn't laugh without\nshedding champagne tears. Also, at that hour the last joker joined his\ncomrades under the table, drunk to the last perfection. The Governor\nremarked,\n\n\"This is a dry place, Sam, let's go and get something to drink and go to\nbed.\"\n\nThe Governor's official menagerie had been drawn from the humblest\nranks of his constituents at home--harmless good fellows who had helped\nin his campaigns, and now they had their reward in petty salaries\npayable in greenbacks that were worth next to nothing. Those boys had a\nhard time to make both ends meet. Orion's salary was eighteen hundred\ndollars a year, and he wouldn't even support his dictionary on it. But\nthe Irishwoman who had come out on the Governor's staff charged the\nmenagerie only ten dollars a week apiece for board and lodging. Orion\nand I were of her boarders and lodgers; and so, on these cheap terms the\nsilver I had brought from home held out very well.\n\n[Sidenote: ('62 or '63)]\n\nAt first I roamed about the country seeking silver, but at the end of\n'62 or the beginning of '63 when I came up from Aurora to begin a\njournalistic life on the Virginia City \"Enterprise,\" I was presently\nsent down to Carson City to report the legislative session. Orion was\nsoon very popular with the members of the legislature, because they\nfound that whereas they couldn't usually trust each other, nor anybody\nelse, they could trust him. He easily held the belt for honesty in that\ncountry, but it didn't do him any good in a pecuniary way, because he\nhad no talent for either persuading or scaring legislators. But I was\ndifferently situated. I was there every day in the legislature to\ndistribute compliment and censure with evenly balanced justice and\nspread the same over half a page of the \"Enterprise\" every morning,\nconsequently I was an influence. I got the legislature to pass a wise\nand very necessary law requiring every corporation doing business in the\nTerritory to record its charter in full, without skipping a word, in a\nrecord to be kept by the Secretary of the Territory--my brother. All the\ncharters were framed in exactly the same words. For this record-service\nhe was authorized to charge forty cents a folio of one hundred words for\nmaking the record; also five dollars for furnishing a certificate of\neach record, and so on. Everybody had a toll-road franchise, but no\ntoll-road. But the franchise had to be recorded and paid for. Everybody\nwas a mining corporation, and had to have himself recorded and pay for\nit. Very well, we prospered. The record-service paid an average of a\nthousand dollars a month, in gold.\n\nGovernor Nye was often absent from the Territory. He liked to run down\nto San Francisco every little while and enjoy a rest from Territorial\ncivilization. Nobody complained, for he was prodigiously popular, he\nhad been a stage-driver in his early days in New York or New England,\nand had acquired the habit of remembering names and faces, and of making\nhimself agreeable to his passengers. As a politician this had been\nvaluable to him, and he kept his arts in good condition by practice. By\nthe time he had been Governor a year, he had shaken hands with every\nhuman being in the Territory of Nevada, and after that he always knew\nthese people instantly at sight and could call them by name. The whole\npopulation, of 20,000 persons, were his personal friends, and he could\ndo anything he chose to do and count upon their being contented with it.\nWhenever he was absent from the Territory--which was generally--Orion\nserved his office in his place, as Acting Governor, a title which was\nsoon and easily shortened to \"Governor.\" He recklessly built and\nfurnished a house at a cost of twelve thousand dollars, and there was no\nother house in the sage-brush capital that could approach this property\nfor style and cost.\n\nWhen Governor Nye's four-year term was drawing to a close, the mystery\nof why he had ever consented to leave the great State of New York and\nhelp inhabit that jack-rabbit desert was solved: he had gone out there\nin order to become a United States Senator. All that was now necessary\nwas to turn the Territory into a State. He did it without any\ndifficulty. That undeveloped country and that sparse population were not\nwell fitted for the heavy burden of a State Government, but no matter,\nthe people were willing to have the change, and so the Governor's game\nwas made.\n\nOrion's game was made too, apparently, for he was as popular because of\nhis honesty as the Governor was for more substantial reasons; but at the\ncritical moment the inborn capriciousness of his character rose up\nwithout warning, and disaster followed.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCIX.\n\nFEBRUARY 15, 1907.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XII.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n[Sidenote: (1864-5.)]\n\n_Orion Clemens--resumed._\n\n[_Dictated April 5, 1906._] There were several candidates for all the\noffices in the gift of the new State of Nevada save two--United States\nSenator, and Secretary of State. Nye was certain to get a Senatorship,\nand Orion was so sure to get the Secretaryship that no one but him was\nnamed for that office. But he was hit with one of his spasms of virtue\non the very day that the Republican party was to make its nominations in\nthe Convention, and refused to go near the Convention. He was urged, but\nall persuasions failed. He said his presence there would be an unfair\nand improper influence and that if he was to be nominated the compliment\nmust come to him as a free and unspotted gift. This attitude would have\nsettled his case for him without further effort, but he had another\nattack of virtue on the same day, that made it absolutely sure. It had\nbeen his habit for a great many years to change his religion with his\nshirt, and his ideas about temperance at the same time. He would be a\nteetotaler for a while and the champion of the cause; then he would\nchange to the other side for a time. On nomination day he suddenly\nchanged from a friendly attitude toward whiskey--which was the popular\nattitude--to uncompromising teetotalism, and went absolutely dry. His\nfriends besought and implored, but all in vain. He could not be\npersuaded to cross the threshold of a saloon. The paper next morning\ncontained the list of chosen nominees. His name was not in it. He had\nnot received a vote.\n\nHis rich income ceased when the State government came into power. He was\nwithout an occupation. Something had to be done. He put up his sign as\nattorney-at-law, but he got no clients. It was strange. It was difficult\nto account for. I cannot account for it--but if I were going to guess at\na solution I should guess that by the make of him he would examine both\nsides of a case so diligently and so conscientiously that when he got\nthrough with his argument neither he nor a jury would know which side he\nwas on. I think that his client would find out his make in laying his\ncase before him, and would take warning and withdraw it in time to save\nhimself from probable disaster.\n\nI had taken up my residence in San Francisco about a year before the\ntime I have just been speaking of. One day I got a tip from Mr. Camp, a\nbold man who was always making big fortunes in ingenious speculations\nand losing them again in the course of six months by other speculative\ningenuities. Camp told me to buy some shares in the Hale and Norcross. I\nbought fifty shares at three hundred dollars a share. I bought on a\nmargin, and put up twenty per cent. It exhausted my funds. I wrote Orion\nand offered him half, and asked him to send his share of the money. I\nwaited and waited. He wrote and said he was going to attend to it. The\nstock went along up pretty briskly. It went higher and higher. It\nreached a thousand dollars a share. It climbed to two thousand, then to\nthree thousand; then to twice that figure. The money did not come, but I\nwas not disturbed. By and by that stock took a turn and began to gallop\ndown. Then I wrote urgently. Orion answered that he had sent the money\nlong ago--said he had sent it to the Occidental Hotel. I inquired for\nit. They said it was not there. To cut a long story short, that stock\nwent on down until it fell below the price I had paid for it. Then it\nbegan to eat up the margin, and when at last I got out I was very badly\ncrippled.\n\nWhen it was too late, I found out what had become of Orion's money. Any\nother human being would have sent a check, but he sent gold. The hotel\nclerk put it in the safe and went on vacation, and there it had reposed\nall this time enjoying its fatal work, no doubt. Another man might have\nthought to tell me that the money was not in a letter, but was in an\nexpress package, but it never occurred to Orion to do that.\n\nLater, Mr. Camp gave me another chance. He agreed to buy our Tennessee\nland for two hundred thousand dollars, pay a part of the amount in cash\nand give long notes for the rest. His scheme was to import foreigners\nfrom grape-growing and wine-making districts in Europe, settle them on\nthe land, and turn it into a wine-growing country. He knew what Mr.\nLongworth thought of those Tennessee grapes, and was satisfied. I sent\nthe contracts and things to Orion for his signature, he being one of the\nthree heirs. But they arrived at a bad time--in a doubly bad time, in\nfact. The temperance virtue was temporarily upon him in strong force,\nand he wrote and said that he would not be a party to debauching the\ncountry with wine. Also he said how could he know whether Mr. Camp was\ngoing to deal fairly and honestly with those poor people from Europe or\nnot?--and so, without waiting to find out, he quashed the whole trade,\nand there it fell, never to be brought to life again. The land, from\nbeing suddenly worth two hundred thousand dollars, became as suddenly\nworth what it was before--nothing, and taxes to pay. I had paid the\ntaxes and the other expenses for some years, but I dropped the Tennessee\nland there, and have never taken any interest in it since, pecuniarily\nor otherwise, until yesterday.\n\nI had supposed, until yesterday, that Orion had frittered away the last\nacre, and indeed that was his own impression. But a gentleman arrived\nyesterday from Tennessee and brought a map showing that by a correction\nof the ancient surveys we still own a thousand acres, in a coal\ndistrict, out of the hundred thousand acres which my father left us when\nhe died in 1847. The gentleman brought a proposition; also he brought a\nreputable and well-to-do citizen of New York. The proposition was that\nthe Tennesseean gentleman should sell that land; that the New York\ngentleman should pay all the expenses and fight all the lawsuits, in\ncase any should turn up, and that of such profit as might eventuate the\nTennesseean gentleman should take a third, the New-Yorker a third, and\nSam Moffett and his sister and I--who are surviving heirs--the remaining\nthird.\n\nThis time I hope we shall get rid of the Tennessee land for good and all\nand never hear of it again.\n\n[Sidenote: (1867.)]\n\n[Sidenote: (1871.)]\n\nI came East in January, 1867. Orion remained in Carson City perhaps a\nyear longer. Then he sold his twelve-thousand-dollar house and its\nfurniture for thirty-five hundred in greenbacks at about sixty per cent.\ndiscount. He and his wife took passage in the steamer for home in\nKeokuk. About 1871 or '72 they came to New York. Orion had been trying\nto make a living in the law ever since he had arrived from the Pacific\nCoast, but he had secured only two cases. Those he was to try free of\ncharge--but the possible result will never be known, because the parties\nsettled the cases out of court without his help.\n\nOrion got a job as proof-reader on the New York \"Evening Post\" at ten\ndollars a week. By and by he came to Hartford and wanted me to get him a\nplace as reporter on a Hartford paper. Here was a chance to try my\nscheme again, and I did it. I made him go to the Hartford \"Evening\nPost,\" without any letter of introduction, and propose to scrub and\nsweep and do all sorts of things for nothing, on the plea that he didn't\nneed money but only needed work, and that that was what he was pining\nfor. Within six weeks he was on the editorial staff of that paper at\ntwenty dollars a week, and he was worth the money. He was presently\ncalled for by some other paper at better wages, but I made him go to the\n\"Post\" people and tell them about it. They stood the raise and kept him.\nIt was the pleasantest berth he had ever had in his life. It was an easy\nberth. He was in every way comfortable. But ill-luck came. It was bound\nto come.\n\nA new Republican daily was to be started in a New England city by a\nstock company of well-to-do politicians, and they offered him the chief\neditorship at three thousand a year. He was eager to accept. My\nbeseechings and reasonings went for nothing. I said,\n\n\"You are as weak as water. Those people will find it out right away.\nThey will easily see that you have no backbone; that they can deal with\nyou as they would deal with a slave. You may last six months, but not\nlonger. Then they will not dismiss you as they would dismiss a\ngentleman: they will fling you out as they would fling out an intruding\ntramp.\"\n\nIt happened just so. Then he and his wife migrated to Keokuk once more.\nOrion wrote from there that he was not resuming the law; that he thought\nthat what his health needed was the open air, in some sort of outdoor\noccupation; that his father-in-law had a strip of ground on the river\nborder a mile above Keokuk with some sort of a house on it, and his idea\nwas to buy that place and start a chicken-farm and provide Keokuk with\nchickens and eggs, and perhaps butter--but I don't know whether you can\nraise butter on a chicken-farm or not. He said the place could be had\nfor three thousand dollars cash, and I sent the money. He began to raise\nchickens, and he made a detailed monthly report to me, whereby it\nappeared that he was able to work off his chickens on the Keokuk people\nat a dollar and a quarter a pair. But it also appeared that it cost a\ndollar and sixty cents to raise the pair. This did not seem to\ndiscourage Orion, and so I let it go. Meantime he was borrowing a\nhundred dollars per month of me regularly, month by month. Now to show\nOrion's stern and rigid business ways--and he really prided himself on\nhis large business capacities--the moment he received the advance of a\nhundred dollars at the beginning of each month, he always sent me his\nnote for the amount, and with it he sent, _out of that money, three\nmonths' interest_ on the hundred dollars at six per cent. per annum,\nthese notes being always for three months.\n\nAs I say, he always sent a detailed statement of the month's profit and\nloss on the chickens--at least the month's loss on the chickens--and\nthis detailed statement included the various items of expense--corn for\nthe chickens, boots for himself, and so on; even car fares, and the\nweekly contribution of ten cents to help out the missionaries who were\ntrying to damn the Chinese after a plan not satisfactory to those\npeople.\n\nI think the poultry experiment lasted about a year, possibly two years.\nIt had then cost me six thousand dollars.\n\nOrion returned to the law business, and I suppose he remained in that\nharness off and on for the succeeding quarter of a century, but so far\nas my knowledge goes he was only a lawyer in name, and had no clients.\n\n[Sidenote: (1890.)]\n\nMy mother died, in her eighty-eighth year, in the summer of 1890. She\nhad saved some money, and she left it to me, because it had come from\nme. I gave it to Orion and he said, with thanks, that I had supported\nhim long enough and now he was going to relieve me of that burden, and\nwould also hope to pay back some of that expense, and maybe the whole of\nit. Accordingly, he proceeded to use up that money in building a\nconsiderable addition to the house, with the idea of taking boarders and\ngetting rich. We need not dwell upon this venture. It was another of his\nfailures. His wife tried hard to make the scheme succeed, and if anybody\ncould have made it succeed she would have done it. She was a good woman,\nand was greatly liked. She had a practical side, and she would have made\nthat boarding-house lucrative if circumstances had not been against her.\n\nOrion had other projects for recouping me, but as they always required\ncapital I stayed out of them, and they did not materialize. Once he\nwanted to start a newspaper. It was a ghastly idea, and I squelched it\nwith a promptness that was almost rude. Then he invented a wood-sawing\nmachine and patched it together himself, and he really sawed wood with\nit. It was ingenious; it was capable; and it would have made a\ncomfortable little fortune for him; but just at the wrong time\nProvidence interfered again. Orion applied for a patent and found that\nthe same machine had already been patented and had gone into business\nand was thriving.\n\nPresently the State of New York offered a fifty-thousand-dollar prize\nfor a practical method of navigating the Erie Canal with steam\ncanal-boats. Orion worked at that thing for two or three years, invented\nand completed a method, and was once more ready to reach out and seize\nupon imminent wealth when somebody pointed out a defect: his steam\ncanal-boat could not be used in the winter-time; and in the summer-time\nthe commotion its wheels would make in the water would wash away the\nState of New York on both sides.\n\nInnumerable were Orion's projects for acquiring the means to pay off\nthe debt to me. These projects extended straight through the succeeding\nthirty years, but in every case they failed. During all those thirty\nyears his well-established honesty kept him in offices of trust where\nother people's money had to be taken care of, but where no salary was\npaid. He was treasurer of all the benevolent institutions; he took care\nof the money and other property of widows and orphans; he never lost a\ncent for anybody, and never made one for himself. Every time he changed\nhis religion the church of his new faith was glad to get him; made him\ntreasurer at once, and at once he stopped the graft and the leaks in\nthat church. He exhibited a facility in changing his political\ncomplexion that was a marvel to the whole community. Once the following\ncurious thing happened, and he wrote me all about it himself.\n\nOne morning he was a Republican, and upon invitation he agreed to make a\ncampaign speech at the Republican mass-meeting that night. He prepared\nthe speech. After luncheon he became a Democrat and agreed to write a\nscore of exciting mottoes to be painted upon the transparencies which\nthe Democrats would carry in their torchlight procession that night. He\nwrote these shouting Democratic mottoes during the afternoon, and they\noccupied so much of his time that it was night before he had a chance to\nchange his politics again; so he actually made a rousing Republican\ncampaign speech in the open air while his Democratic transparencies\npassed by in front of him, to the joy of every witness present.\n\nHe was a most strange creature--but in spite of his eccentricities he\nwas beloved, all his life, in whatsoever community he lived. And he was\nalso held in high esteem, for at bottom he was a sterling man.\n\nAbout twenty-five years ago--along there somewhere--I suggested to Orion\nthat he write an autobiography. I asked him to try to tell the straight\ntruth in it; to refrain from exhibiting himself in creditable attitudes\nexclusively, and to honorably set down all the incidents of his life\nwhich he had found interesting to him, including those which were burned\ninto his memory because he was ashamed of them. I said that this had\nnever been done, and that if he could do it his autobiography would be a\nmost valuable piece of literature. I said I was offering him a job which\nI could not duplicate in my own case, but I would cherish the hope that\nhe might succeed with it. I recognise now that I was trying to saddle\nupon him an impossibility. I have been dictating this autobiography of\nmine daily for three months; I have thought of fifteen hundred or two\nthousand incidents in my life which I am ashamed of, but I have not\ngotten one of them to consent to go on paper yet. I think that that\nstock will still be complete and unimpaired when I finish these memoirs,\nif I ever finish them. I believe that if I should put in all or any of\nthose incidents I should be sure to strike them out when I came to\nrevise this book.\n\nOrion wrote his autobiography and sent it to me. But great was my\ndisappointment; and my vexation, too. In it he was constantly making a\nhero of himself, exactly as I should have done and am doing now, and he\nwas constantly forgetting to put in the episodes which placed him in an\nunheroic light. I knew several incidents of his life which were\ndistinctly and painfully unheroic, but when I came across them in his\nautobiography they had changed color. They had turned themselves inside\nout, and were things to be intemperately proud of. In my dissatisfaction\nI destroyed a considerable part of that autobiography. But in what\nremains there are passages which are interesting, and I shall quote from\nthem here and there and now and then, as I go along.\n\n[Sidenote: (1898.)]\n\nWhile we were living in Vienna in 1898 a cablegram came from Keokuk\nannouncing Orion's death. He was seventy-two years old. He had gone down\nto the kitchen in the early hours of a bitter December morning; he had\nbuilt the fire, and had then sat down at a table to write something; and\nthere he died, with the pencil in his hand and resting against the paper\nin the middle of an unfinished word--an indication that his release from\nthe captivity of a long and troubled and pathetic and unprofitable life\nwas mercifully swift and painless.\n\n[_Dictated in 1904._] A quarter of a century ago I was visiting John Hay\nat Whitelaw Reid's house in New York, which Hay was occupying for a few\nmonths while Reid was absent on a holiday in Europe. Temporarily also,\nHay was editing Reid's paper, the New York \"Tribune.\" I remember two\nincidents of that Sunday visit particularly well. I had known John Hay a\ngood many years, I had known him when he was an obscure young editorial\nwriter on the \"Tribune\" in Horace Greely's time, earning three or four\ntimes the salary he got, considering the high character of the work\nwhich came from his pen. In those earlier days he was a picture to look\nat, for beauty of feature, perfection of form and grace of carriage and\nmovement. He had a charm about him of a sort quite unusual to my Western\nignorance and inexperience--a charm of manner, intonation, apparently\nnative and unstudied elocution, and all that--the groundwork of it\nnative, the ease of it, the polish of it, the winning naturalness of it,\nacquired in Europe where he had been Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires some time at the\nCourt of Vienna. He was joyous and cordial, a most pleasant comrade. One\nof the two incidents above referred to as marking that visit was this:\n\nIn trading remarks concerning our ages I confessed to forty-two and Hay\nto forty. Then he asked if I had begun to write my autobiography, and I\nsaid I hadn't. He said that I ought to begin at once, and that I had\nalready lost two years. Then he said in substance this:\n\n\"At forty a man reaches the top of the hill of life and starts down on\nthe sunset side. The ordinary man, the average man, not to particularize\ntoo closely and say the commonplace man, has at that age succeeded or\nfailed; in either case he has lived all of his life that is likely to be\nworth recording; also in either case the life lived is worth setting\ndown, and cannot fail to be interesting if he comes as near to telling\nthe truth about himself as he can. And he _will_ tell the truth in spite\nof himself, for his facts and his fictions will work loyally together\nfor the protection of the reader; each fact and each fiction will be a\ndab of paint, each will fall in its right place, and together they will\npaint his portrait; not the portrait _he_ thinks they are painting, but\nhis real portrait, the inside of him, the soul of him, his character.\nWithout intending to lie he will lie all the time; not bluntly,\nconsciously, not dully unconsciously, but half-consciously--\nconsciousness in twilight; a soft and gentle and merciful twilight which\nmakes his general form comely, with his virtuous prominences and\nprojections discernible and his ungracious ones in shadow. His truths\nwill be recognizable as truths, his modifications of facts which would\ntell against him will go for nothing, the reader will see the fact\nthrough the film and know his man.\n\n\"There is a subtle devilish something or other about autobiographical\ncomposition that defeats all the writer's attempts to paint his portrait\n_his_ way.\"\n\nHay meant that he and I were ordinary average commonplace people, and I\ndid not resent my share of the verdict, but nursed my wound in silence.\nHis idea that we had finished our work in life, passed the summit and\nwere westward bound down-hill, with me two years ahead of him and\nneither of us with anything further to do as benefactors to mankind, was\nall a mistake. I had written four books then, possibly five. I have been\ndrowning the world in literary wisdom ever since, volume after volume;\nsince that day's sun went down he has been the historian of Mr. Lincoln,\nand his book will never perish; he has been ambassador, brilliant\norator, competent and admirable Secretary of State.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCX.\n\nMARCH 1, 1907.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XIII.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n[Sidenote: (1847.)]\n\n... As I have said, that vast plot of Tennessee land[6] was held by my\nfather twenty years--intact. When he died in 1847, we began to manage it\nourselves. Forty years afterward, we had managed it all away except\n10,000 acres, and gotten nothing to remember the sales by. About\n1887--possibly it was earlier--the 10,000 went. My brother found a\nchance to trade it for a house and lot in the town of Corry, in the oil\nregions of Pennsylvania. About 1894 he sold this property for $250. That\nended the Tennessee Land.\n\nIf any penny of cash ever came out of my father's wise investment but\nthat, I have no recollection of it. No, I am overlooking a detail. It\nfurnished me a field for Sellers and a book. Out of my half of the book\nI got $15,000 or $20,000; out of the play I got $75,000 or $80,000--just\nabout a dollar an acre. It is curious: I was not alive when my father\nmade the investment, therefore he was not intending any partiality; yet\nI was the only member of the family that ever profited by it. I shall\nhave occasion to mention this land again, now and then, as I go along,\nfor it influenced our life in one way or another during more than a\ngeneration. Whenever things grew dark it rose and put out its hopeful\nSellers hand and cheered us up, and said \"Do not be afraid--trust in\nme--wait.\" It kept us hoping and hoping, during forty years, and forsook\nus at last. It put our energies to sleep and made visionaries of\nus--dreamers and indolent. We were always going to be rich next year--no\noccasion to work. It is good to begin life poor; it is good to begin\nlife rich--these are wholesome; but to begin it _prospectively_ rich!\nThe man who has not experienced it cannot imagine the curse of it.\n\nMy parents removed to Missouri in the early thirties; I do not remember\njust when, for I was not born then, and cared nothing for such things.\nIt was a long journey in those days, and must have been a rough and\ntiresome one. The home was made in the wee village of Florida, in Monroe\ncounty, and I was born there in 1835. The village contained a hundred\npeople and I increased the population by one per cent. It is more than\nthe best man in history ever did for any other town. It may not be\nmodest in me to refer to this, but it is true. There is no record of a\nperson doing as much--not even Shakespeare. But I did it for Florida,\nand it shows that I could have done it for any place--even London, I\nsuppose.\n\nRecently some one in Missouri has sent me a picture of the house I was\nborn in. Heretofore I have always stated that it was a palace, but I\nshall be more guarded, now.\n\nI remember only one circumstance connected with my life in it. I\nremember it very well, though I was but two and a half years old at the\ntime. The family packed up everything and started in wagons for\nHannibal, on the Mississippi, thirty miles away. Toward night, when they\ncamped and counted up the children, one was missing. I was the one. I\nhad been left behind. Parents ought always to count the children before\nthey start. I was having a good enough time playing by myself until I\nfound that the doors were fastened and that there was a grisly deep\nsilence brooding over the place. I knew, then, that the family were\ngone, and that they had forgotten me. I was well frightened, and I made\nall the noise I could, but no one was near and it did no good. I spent\nthe afternoon in captivity and was not rescued until the gloaming had\nfallen and the place was alive with ghosts.\n\nMy brother Henry was six months old at that time. I used to remember his\nwalking into a fire outdoors when he was a week old. It was remarkable\nin me to remember a thing like that, which occurred when I was so young.\nAnd it was still more remarkable that I should cling to the delusion,\nfor thirty years, that I _did_ remember it--for of course it never\nhappened; he would not have been able to walk at that age. If I had\nstopped to reflect, I should not have burdened my memory with that\nimpossible rubbish so long. It is believed by many people that an\nimpression deposited in a child's memory within the first two years of\nits life cannot remain there five years, but that is an error. The\nincident of Benvenuto Cellini and the salamander must be accepted as\nauthentic and trustworthy; and then that remarkable and indisputable\ninstance in the experience of Helen Keller--however, I will speak of\nthat at another time. For many years I believed that I remembered\nhelping my grandfather drink his whiskey toddy when I was six weeks old,\nbut I do not tell about that any more, now; I am grown old, and my\nmemory is not as active as it used to be. When I was younger I could\nremember anything, whether it had happened or not; but my faculties are\ndecaying, now, and soon I shall be so I cannot remember any but the\nthings that happened. It is sad to go to pieces like this, but we all\nhave to do it.\n\nMy uncle, John A. Quarles, was a farmer, and his place was in the\ncountry four miles from Florida. He had eight children, and fifteen or\ntwenty negroes, and was also fortunate in other ways. Particularly in\nhis character. I have not come across a better man than he was. I was\nhis guest for two or three months every year, from the fourth year after\nwe removed to Hannibal till I was eleven or twelve years old. I have\nnever consciously used him or his wife in a book, but his farm has come\nvery handy to me in literature, once or twice. In \"Huck Finn\" and in\n\"Tom Sawyer Detective\" I moved it down to Arkansas. It was all of six\nhundred miles, but it was no trouble, it was not a very large farm;\nfive hundred acres, perhaps, but I could have done it if it had been\ntwice as large. And as for the morality of it, I cared nothing for that;\nI would move a State if the exigencies of literature required it.\n\nIt was a heavenly place for a boy, that farm of my uncle John's. The\nhouse was a double log one, with a spacious floor (roofed in) connecting\nit with the kitchen. In the summer the table was set in the middle of\nthat shady and breezy floor, and the sumptuous meals--well, it makes me\ncry to think of them. Fried chicken, roast pig, wild and tame turkeys,\nducks and geese; venison just killed; squirrels, rabbits, pheasants,\npartridges, prairie-chickens; biscuits, hot batter cakes, hot buckwheat\ncakes, hot \"wheat bread,\" hot rolls, hot corn pone; fresh corn boiled on\nthe ear, succotash, butter-beans, string-beans, tomatoes, pease, Irish\npotatoes, sweet-potatoes; buttermilk, sweet milk, \"clabber\";\nwatermelons, musk-melons, cantaloups--all fresh from the garden--apple\npie, peach pie, pumpkin pie, apple dumplings, peach cobbler--I can't\nremember the rest. The way that the things were cooked was perhaps the\nmain splendor--particularly a certain few of the dishes. For instance,\nthe corn bread, the hot biscuits and wheat bread, and the fried chicken.\nThese things have never been properly cooked in the North--in fact, no\none there is able to learn the art, so far as my experience goes. The\nNorth thinks it knows how to make corn bread, but this is gross\nsuperstition. Perhaps no bread in the world is quite as good as Southern\ncorn bread, and perhaps no bread in the world is quite so bad as the\nNorthern imitation of it. The North seldom tries to fry chicken, and\nthis is well; the art cannot be learned north of the line of Mason and\nDixon, nor anywhere in Europe. This is not hearsay; it is experience\nthat is speaking. In Europe it is imagined that the custom of serving\nvarious kinds of bread blazing hot is \"American,\" but that is too broad\na spread; it is custom in the South, but is much less than that in the\nNorth. In the North and in Europe hot bread is considered unhealthy.\nThis is probably another fussy superstition, like the European\nsuperstition that ice-water is unhealthy. Europe does not need\nice-water, and does not drink it; and yet, notwithstanding this, its\nword for it is better than ours, because it describes it, whereas ours\ndoesn't. Europe calls it \"iced\" water. Our word describes water made\nfrom melted ice--a drink which we have but little acquaintance with.\n\nIt seem a pity that the world should throw away so many good things\nmerely because they are unwholesome. I doubt if God has given us any\nrefreshment which, taken in moderation, is unwholesome, except microbes.\nYet there are people who strictly deprive themselves of each and every\neatable, drinkable and smokable which has in any way acquired a shady\nreputation. They pay this price for health. And health is all they get\nfor it. How strange it is; it is like paying out your whole fortune for\na cow that has gone dry.\n\nThe farmhouse stood in the middle of a very large yard, and the yard was\nfenced on three sides with rails and on the rear side with high palings;\nagainst these stood the smokehouse; beyond the palings was the orchard;\nbeyond the orchard were the negro quarter and the tobacco-fields. The\nfront yard was entered over a stile, made of sawed-off logs of graduated\nheights; I do not remember any gate. In a corner of the front yard were\na dozen lofty hickory-trees and a dozen black-walnuts, and in the\nnutting season riches were to be gathered there.\n\nDown a piece, abreast the house, stood a little log cabin against the\nrail fence; and there the woody hill fell sharply away, past the barns,\nthe corn-crib, the stables and the tobacco-curing house, to a limpid\nbrook which sang along over its gravelly bed and curved and frisked in\nand out and here and there and yonder in the deep shade of overhanging\nfoliage and vines--a divine place for wading, and it had swimming-pools,\ntoo, which were forbidden to us and therefore much frequented by us. For\nwe were little Christian children, and had early been taught the value\nof forbidden fruit.\n\nIn the little log cabin lived a bedridden white-headed slave woman whom\nwe visited daily, and looked upon with awe, for we believed she was\nupwards of a thousand years old and had talked with Moses. The younger\nnegroes credited these statistics, and had furnished them to us in good\nfaith. We accommodated all the details which came to us about her; and\nso we believed that she had lost her health in the long desert trip\ncoming out of Egypt, and had never been able to get it back again. She\nhad a round bald place on the crown of her head, and we used to creep\naround and gaze at it in reverent silence, and reflect that it was\ncaused by fright through seeing Pharaoh drowned. We called her \"Aunt\"\nHannah, Southern fashion. She was superstitious like the other negroes;\nalso, like them, she was deeply religious. Like them, she had great\nfaith in prayer, and employed it in all ordinary exigencies, but not in\ncases where a dead certainty of result was urgent. Whenever witches were\naround she tied up the remnant of her wool in little tufts, with white\nthread, and this promptly made the witches impotent.\n\nAll the negroes were friends of ours, and with those of our own age we\nwere in effect comrades. I say in effect, using the phrase as a\nmodification. We were comrades, and yet not comrades; color and\ncondition interposed a subtle line which both parties were conscious of,\nand which rendered complete fusion impossible. We had a faithful and\naffectionate good friend, ally and adviser in \"Uncle Dan'l,\" a\nmiddle-aged slave whose head was the best one in the negro quarter,\nwhose sympathies were wide and warm, and whose heart was honest and\nsimple and knew no guile. He has served me well, these many, many years.\nI have not seen him for more than half a century, and yet spiritually I\nhave had his welcome company a good part of that time, and have staged\nhim in books under his own name and as \"Jim,\" and carted him all\naround--to Hannibal, down the Mississippi on a raft, and even across the\nDesert of Sahara in a balloon--and he has endured it all with the\npatience and friendliness and loyalty which were his birthright. It was\non the farm that I got my strong liking for his race and my appreciation\nof certain of its fine qualities. This feeling and this estimate have\nstood the test of sixty years and more and have suffered no impairment.\nThe black face is as welcome to me now as it was then.\n\nIn my schoolboy days I had no aversion to slavery. I was not aware that\nthere was anything wrong about it. No one arraigned it in my hearing;\nthe local papers said nothing against it; the local pulpit taught us\nthat God approved it, that it was a holy thing, and that the doubter\nneed only look in the Bible if he wished to settle his mind--and then\nthe texts were read aloud to us to make the matter sure; if the slaves\nthemselves had an aversion to slavery they were wise and said nothing.\nIn Hannibal we seldom saw a slave misused; on the farm, never.\n\nThere was, however, one small incident of my boyhood days which touched\nthis matter, and it must have meant a good deal to me or it would not\nhave stayed in my memory, clear and sharp, vivid and shadowless, all\nthese slow-drifting years. We had a little slave boy whom we had hired\nfrom some one, there in Hannibal. He was from the Eastern Shore of\nMaryland, and had been brought away from his family and his friends,\nhalf-way across the American continent, and sold. He was a cheery\nspirit, innocent and gentle, and the noisiest creature that ever was,\nperhaps. All day long he was singing, whistling, yelling, whooping,\nlaughing--it was maddening, devastating, unendurable. At last, one day,\nI lost all my temper, and went raging to my mother, and said Sandy had\nbeen singing for an hour without a single break, and I couldn't stand\nit, and _wouldn't_ she please shut him up. The tears came into her eyes,\nand her lip trembled, and she said something like this--\n\n\"Poor thing, when he sings, it shows that he is not remembering, and\nthat comforts me; but when he is still, I am afraid he is thinking, and\nI cannot bear it. He will never see his mother again; if he can sing, I\nmust not hinder it, but be thankful for it. If you were older, you would\nunderstand me; then that friendless child's noise would make you glad.\"\n\nIt was a simple speech, and made up of small words, but it went home,\nand Sandy's noise was not a trouble to me any more. She never used large\nwords, but she had a natural gift for making small ones do effective\nwork. She lived to reach the neighborhood of ninety years, and was\ncapable with her tongue to the last--especially when a meanness or an\ninjustice roused her spirit. She has come handy to me several times in\nmy books, where she figures as Tom Sawyer's \"Aunt Polly.\" I fitted her\nout with a dialect, and tried to think up other improvements for her,\nbut did not find any. I used Sandy once, also; it was in \"Tom Sawyer\"; I\ntried to get him to whitewash the fence, but it did not work. I do not\nremember what name I called him by in the book.\n\nI can see the farm yet, with perfect clearness. I can see all its\nbelongings, all its details; the family room of the house, with a\n\"trundle\" bed in one corner and a spinning-wheel in another--a wheel\nwhose rising and falling wail, heard from a distance, was the\nmournfulest of all sounds to me, and made me homesick and low-spirited,\nand filled my atmosphere with the wandering spirits of the dead: the\nvast fireplace, piled high, on winter nights, with flaming hickory logs\nfrom whose ends a sugary sap bubbled out but did not go to waste, for we\nscraped it off and ate it; the lazy cat spread out on the rough\nhearthstones, the drowsy dogs braced against the jambs and blinking; my\naunt in one chimney-corner knitting, my uncle in the other smoking his\ncorn-cob pipe; the slick and carpetless oak floor faintly mirroring the\ndancing flame-tongues and freckled with black indentations where\nfire-coals had popped out and died a leisurely death; half a dozen\nchildren romping in the background twilight; \"split\"-bottomed chairs\nhere and there, some with rockers; a cradle--out of service, but\nwaiting, with confidence; in the early cold mornings a snuggle of\nchildren, in shirts and chemises, occupying the hearthstone and\nprocrastinating--they could not bear to leave that comfortable place and\ngo out on the wind-swept floor-space between the house and kitchen where\nthe general tin basin stood, and wash.\n\nAlong outside of the front fence ran the country road; dusty in the\nsummer-time, and a good place for snakes--they liked to lie in it and\nsun themselves; when they were rattlesnakes or puff adders, we killed\nthem: when they were black snakes, or racers, or belonged to the fabled\n\"hoop\" breed, we fled, without shame; when they were \"house snakes\" or\n\"garters\" we carried them home and put them in Aunt Patsy's work-basket\nfor a surprise; for she was prejudiced against snakes, and always when\nshe took the basket in her lap and they began to climb out of it it\ndisordered her mind. She never could seem to get used to them; her\nopportunities went for nothing. And she was always cold toward bats,\ntoo, and could not bear them; and yet I think a bat is as friendly a\nbird as there is. My mother was Aunt Patsy's sister, and had the same\nwild superstitions. A bat is beautifully soft and silky: I do not know\nany creature that is pleasanter to the touch, or is more grateful for\ncaressings, if offered in the right spirit. I know all about these\ncoleoptera, because our great cave, three miles below Hannibal, was\nmultitudinously stocked with them, and often I brought them home to\namuse my mother with. It was easy to manage if it was a school day,\nbecause then I had ostensibly been to school and hadn't any bats. She\nwas not a suspicious person, but full of trust and confidence; and when\nI said \"There's something in my coat pocket for you,\" she would put her\nhand in. But she always took it out again, herself; I didn't have to\ntell her. It was remarkable, the way she couldn't learn to like private\nbats.\n\nI think she was never in the cave in her life; but everybody else went\nthere. Many excursion parties came from considerable distances up and\ndown the river to visit the cave. It was miles in extent, and was a\ntangled wilderness of narrow and lofty clefts and passages. It was an\neasy place to get lost in; anybody could do it--including the bats. I\ngot lost in it myself, along with a lady, and our last candle burned\ndown to almost nothing before we glimpsed the search-party's lights\nwinding about in the distance.\n\n\"Injun Joe\" the half-breed got lost in there once, and would have\nstarved to death if the bats had run short. But there was no chance of\nthat; there were myriads of them. He told me all his story. In the book\ncalled \"Tom Sawyer\" I starved him entirely to death in the cave, but\nthat was in the interest of art; it never happened. \"General\" Gaines,\nwho was our first town drunkard before Jimmy Finn got the place, was\nlost in there for the space of a week, and finally pushed his\nhandkerchief out of a hole in a hilltop near Saverton, several miles\ndown the river from the cave's mouth, and somebody saw it and dug him\nout. There is nothing the matter with his statistics except the\nhandkerchief. I knew him for years, and he hadn't any. But it could have\nbeen his nose. That would attract attention.\n\nBeyond the road where the snakes sunned themselves was a dense young\nthicket, and through it a dim-lighted path led a quarter of a mile; then\nout of the dimness one emerged abruptly upon a level great prairie which\nwas covered with wild strawberry-plants, vividly starred with prairie\npinks, and walled in on all sides by forests. The strawberries were\nfragrant and fine, and in the season we were generally there in the\ncrisp freshness of the early morning, while the dew-beads still sparkled\nupon the grass and the woods were ringing with the first songs of the\nbirds.\n\nDown the forest slopes to the left were the swings. They were made of\nbark stripped from hickory saplings. When they became dry they were\ndangerous. They usually broke when a child was forty feet in the air,\nand this was why so many bones had to be mended every year. I had no\nill-luck myself, but none of my cousins escaped. There were eight of\nthem, and at one time and another they broke fourteen arms among them.\nBut it cost next to nothing, for the doctor worked by the year--$25 for\nthe whole family. I remember two of the Florida doctors, Chowning and\nMeredith. They not only tended an entire family for $25 a year, but\nfurnished the medicines themselves. Good measure, too. Only the largest\npersons could hold a whole dose. Castor-oil was the principal beverage.\nThe dose was half a dipperful, with half a dipperful of New Orleans\nmolasses added to help it down and make it taste good, which it never\ndid. The next standby was calomel; the next, rhubarb; and the next,\njalap. Then they bled the patient, and put mustard-plasters on him. It\nwas a dreadful system, and yet the death-rate was not heavy. The calomel\nwas nearly sure to salivate the patient and cost him some of his teeth.\nThere were no dentists. When teeth became touched with decay or were\notherwise ailing, the doctor knew of but one thing to do: he fetched his\ntongs and dragged them out. If the jaw remained, it was not his fault.\n\nDoctors were not called, in cases of ordinary illness; the family's\ngrandmother attended to those. Every old woman was a doctor, and\ngathered her own medicines in the woods, and knew how to compound doses\nthat would stir the vitals of a cast-iron dog. And then there was the\n\"Indian doctor\"; a grave savage, remnant of his tribe, deeply read in\nthe mysteries of nature and the secret properties of herbs; and most\nbackwoodsmen had high faith in his powers and could tell of wonderful\ncures achieved by him. In Mauritius, away off yonder in the solitudes of\nthe Indian Ocean, there is a person who answers to our Indian doctor of\nthe old times. He is a negro, and has had no teaching as a doctor, yet\nthere is one disease which he is master of and can cure, and the doctors\ncan't. They send for him when they have a case. It is a child's disease\nof a strange and deadly sort, and the negro cures it with a herb\nmedicine which he makes, himself, from a prescription which has come\ndown to him from his father and grandfather. He will not let any one see\nit. He keeps the secret of its components to himself, and it is feared\nthat he will die without divulging it; then there will be consternation\nin Mauritius. I was told these things by the people there, in 1896.\n\nWe had the \"faith doctor,\" too, in those early days--a woman. Her\nspecialty was toothache. She was a farmer's old wife, and lived five\nmiles from Hannibal. She would lay her hand on the patient's jaw and say\n\"Believe!\" and the cure was prompt. Mrs. Utterback. I remember her very\nwell. Twice I rode out there behind my mother, horseback, and saw the\ncure performed. My mother was the patient.\n\nDr. Meredith removed to Hannibal, by and by, and was our family\nphysician there, and saved my life several times. Still, he was a good\nman and meant well. Let it go.\n\nI was always told that I was a sickly and precarious and tiresome and\nuncertain child, and lived mainly on allopathic medicines during the\nfirst seven years of my life. I asked my mother about this, in her old\nage--she was in her 88th year--and said:\n\n\"I suppose that during all that time you were uneasy about me?\"\n\n\"Yes, the whole time.\"\n\n\"Afraid I wouldn't live?\"\n\nAfter a reflective pause--ostensibly to think out the facts--\n\n\"No--afraid you would.\"\n\nIt sounds like a plagiarism, but it probably wasn't. The country\nschoolhouse was three miles from my uncle's farm. It stood in a clearing\nin the woods, and would hold about twenty-five boys and girls. We\nattended the school with more or less regularity once or twice a week,\nin summer, walking to it in the cool of the morning by the forest paths,\nand back in the gloaming at the end of the day. All the pupils brought\ntheir dinners in baskets--corn-dodger, buttermilk and other good\nthings--and sat in the shade of the trees at noon and ate them. It is\nthe part of my education which I look back upon with the most\nsatisfaction. My first visit to the school was when I was seven. A\nstrapping girl of fifteen, in the customary sunbonnet and calico dress,\nasked me if I \"used tobacco\"--meaning did I chew it. I said, no. It\nroused her scorn. She reported me to all the crowd, and said--\n\n\"Here is a boy seven years old who can't chaw tobacco.\"\n\nBy the looks and comments which this produced, I realized that I was a\ndegraded object; I was cruelly ashamed of myself. I determined to\nreform. But I only made myself sick; I was not able to learn to chew\ntobacco. I learned to smoke fairly well, but that did not conciliate\nanybody, and I remained a poor thing, and characterless. I longed to be\nrespected, but I never was able to rise. Children have but little\ncharity for each other's defects.\n\nAs I have said, I spent some part of every year at the farm until I was\ntwelve or thirteen years old. The life which I led there with my cousins\nwas full of charm, and so is the memory of it yet. I can call back the\nsolemn twilight and mystery of the deep woods, the earthy smells, the\nfaint odors of the wild flowers, the sheen of rain-washed foliage, the\nrattling clatter of drops when the wind shook the trees, the far-off\nhammering of woodpeckers and the muffled drumming of wood-pheasants in\nthe remoteness of the forest, the snap-shot glimpses of disturbed wild\ncreatures skurrying through the grass,--I can call it all back and make\nit as real as it ever was, and as blessed. I can call back the prairie,\nand its loneliness and peace, and a vast hawk hanging motionless in the\nsky, with his wings spread wide and the blue of the vault showing\nthrough the fringe of their end-feathers. I can see the woods in their\nautumn dress, the oaks purple, the hickories washed with gold, the\nmaples and the sumacs luminous with crimson fires, and I can hear the\nrustle made by the fallen leaves as we ploughed through them. I can see\nthe blue clusters of wild grapes hanging amongst the foliage of the\nsaplings, and I remember the taste of them and the smell. I know how the\nwild blackberries looked, and how they tasted; and the same with the\npawpaws, the hazelnuts and the persimmons; and I can feel the thumping\nrain, upon my head, of hickory-nuts and walnuts when we were out in the\nfrosty dawn to scramble for them with the pigs, and the gusts of wind\nloosed them and sent them down. I know the stain of blackberries, and\nhow pretty it is; and I know the stain of walnut hulls, and how little\nit minds soap and water; also what grudged experience it had of either\nof them. I know the taste of maple sap, and when to gather it, and how\nto arrange the troughs and the delivery tubes, and how to boil down the\njuice, and how to hook the sugar after it is made; also how much better\nhooked sugar tastes than any that is honestly come by, let bigots say\nwhat they will. I know how a prize watermelon looks when it is sunning\nits fat rotundity among pumpkin-vines and \"simblins\"; I know how to tell\nwhen it is ripe without \"plugging\" it; I know how inviting it looks when\nit is cooling itself in a tub of water under the bed, waiting; I know\nhow it looks when it lies on the table in the sheltered great\nfloor-space between house and kitchen, and the children gathered for the\nsacrifice and their mouths watering; I know the crackling sound it makes\nwhen the carving-knife enters its end, and I can see the split fly along\nin front of the blade as the knife cleaves its way to the other end; I\ncan see its halves fall apart and display the rich red meat and the\nblack seeds, and the heart standing up, a luxury fit for the elect; I\nknow how a boy looks, behind a yard-long slice of that melon, and I know\nhow he feels; for I have been there. I know the taste of the watermelon\nwhich has been honestly come by, and I know the taste of the watermelon\nwhich has been acquired by art. Both taste good, but the experienced\nknow which tastes best. I know the look of green apples and peaches and\npears on the trees, and I know how entertaining they are when they are\ninside of a person. I know how ripe ones look when they are piled in\npyramids under the trees, and how pretty they are and how vivid their\ncolors. I know how a frozen apple looks, in a barrel down cellar in the\nwinter-time, and how hard it is to bite, and how the frost makes the\nteeth ache, and yet how good it is, notwithstanding. I know the\ndisposition of elderly people to select the specked apples for the\nchildren, and I once knew ways to beat the game. I know the look of an\napple that is roasting and sizzling on a hearth on a winter's evening,\nand I know the comfort that comes of eating it hot, along with some\nsugar and a drench of cream. I know the delicate art and mystery of so\ncracking hickory-nuts and walnuts on a flatiron with a hammer that the\nkernels will be delivered whole, and I know how the nuts, taken in\nconjunction with winter apples, cider and doughnuts, make old people's\ntales and old jokes sound fresh and crisp and enchanting, and juggle an\nevening away before you know what went with the time. I know the look of\nUncle Dan'l's kitchen as it was on privileged nights when I was a child,\nand I can see the white and black children grouped on the hearth, with\nthe firelight playing on their faces and the shadows flickering upon the\nwalls, clear back toward the cavernous gloom of the rear, and I can hear\nUncle Dan'l telling the immortal tales which Uncle Remus Harris was to\ngather into his books and charm the world with, by and by; and I can\nfeel again the creepy joy which quivered through me when the time for\nthe ghost-story of the \"Golden Arm\" was reached--and the sense of\nregret, too, which came over me, for it was always the last story of the\nevening, and there was nothing between it and the unwelcome bed.\n\nI can remember the bare wooden stairway in my uncle's house, and the\nturn to the left above the landing, and the rafters and the slanting\nroof over my bed, and the squares of moonlight on the floor, and the\nwhite cold world of snow outside, seen through the curtainless window.\nI can remember the howling of the wind and the quaking of the house on\nstormy nights, and how snug and cozy one felt, under the blankets,\nlistening, and how the powdery snow used to sift in, around the sashes,\nand lie in little ridges on the floor, and make the place look chilly in\nthe morning, and curb the wild desire to get up--in case there was any.\nI can remember how very dark that room was, in the dark of the moon, and\nhow packed it was with ghostly stillness when one woke up by accident\naway in the night, and forgotten sins came flocking out of the secret\nchambers of the memory and wanted a hearing; and how ill chosen the time\nseemed for this kind of business; and how dismal was the hoo-hooing of\nthe owl and the wailing of the wolf, sent mourning by on the night wind.\n\nI remember the raging of the rain on that roof, summer nights, and how\npleasant it was to lie and listen to it, and enjoy the white splendor of\nthe lightning and the majestic booming and crashing of the thunder. It\nwas a very satisfactory room; and there was a lightning-rod which was\nreachable from the window, an adorable and skittish thing to climb up\nand down, summer nights, when there were duties on hand of a sort to\nmake privacy desirable.\n\nI remember the 'coon and 'possum hunts, nights, with the negroes, and\nthe long marches through the black gloom of the woods, and the\nexcitement which fired everybody when the distant bay of an experienced\ndog announced that the game was treed; then the wild scramblings and\nstumblings through briars and bushes and over roots to get to the spot;\nthen the lighting of a fire and the felling of the tree, the joyful\nfrenzy of the dogs and the negroes, and the weird picture it all made in\nthe red glare--I remember it all well, and the delight that every one\ngot out of it, except the 'coon.\n\nI remember the pigeon seasons, when the birds would come in millions,\nand cover the trees, and by their weight break down the branches. They\nwere clubbed to death with sticks; guns were not necessary, and were not\nused. I remember the squirrel hunts, and the prairie-chicken hunts, and\nthe wild-turkey hunts, and all that; and how we turned out, mornings,\nwhile it was still dark, to go on these expeditions, and how chilly and\ndismal it was, and how often I regretted that I was well enough to go. A\ntoot on a tin horn brought twice as many dogs as were needed, and in\ntheir happiness they raced and scampered about, and knocked small people\ndown, and made no end of unnecessary noise. At the word, they vanished\naway toward the woods, and we drifted silently after them in the\nmelancholy gloom. But presently the gray dawn stole over the world, the\nbirds piped up, then the sun rose and poured light and comfort all\naround, everything was fresh and dewy and fragrant, and life was a boon\nagain. After three hours of tramping we arrived back wholesomely tired,\noverladen with game, very hungry, and just in time for breakfast.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[6] 100,000 acres.\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCXI.\n\nMARCH 15, 1907.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XIV.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n[_Dictated Thursday, December 6, 1906._]\n\n_From Susy's Biography of Me._\n\n\n     _Feb. 27, Sunday._\n\n     Clara's reputation as a baby was always a fine one, mine exactly\n     the contrary. One often related story concerning her braveness as a\n     baby and her own opinion of this quality of hers is this. Clara and\n     I often got slivers in our hands and when mama took them out with a\n     much dreaded needle, Clara was always very brave, and I very\n     cowardly. One day Clara got one of these slivers in her hand, a\n     very bad one, and while mama was taking it out, Clara stood\n     perfectly still without even wincing: I saw how brave she was and\n     turning to mamma said \"Mamma isn't she a brave little thing!\"\n     presently mamma had to give the little hand quite a dig with the\n     needle and noticing how perfectly quiet Clara was about it she\n     exclaimed, Why Clara! you are a brave little thing! Clara responded\n     \"No bodys braver but  God!\"--\n\n\nClara's pious remark is the main detail, and Susy has accurately\nremembered its phrasing. The three-year-older's wound was of a\nformidable sort, and not one which the mother's surgery would have been\nequal to. The flesh of the finger had been burst by a cruel accident. It\nwas the doctor that sewed it up, and to all appearances it was he, and\nthe other independent witnesses, that did the main part of the\nsuffering; each stitch that he took made Clara wince slightly, but it\nshrivelled the others.\n\nI take pride in Clara's remark, because it shows that although she was\nonly three years old, her fireside teachings were already making her a\nthinker--a thinker and also an observer of proportions. I am not\nclaiming any credit for this. I furnished to the children worldly\nknowledge and wisdom, but was not competent to go higher, and so I left\ntheir spiritual education in the hands of the mother. A result of this\nmodesty of mine was made manifest to me in a very striking way, some\nyears afterward, when Jean was nine years old. We had recently arrived\nin Berlin, at the time, and had begun housekeeping in a furnished\napartment. One morning at breakfast a vast card arrived--an invitation.\nTo be precise, it was a command from the Emperor of Germany to come to\ndinner. During several months I had encountered socially, on the\nContinent, men bearing lofty titles; and all this while Jean was\nbecoming more and more impressed, and awed, and subdued, by these\nimposing events, for she had not been abroad before, and they were new\nto her--wonders out of dreamland turned into realities. The imperial\ncard was passed from hand to hand, around the table, and examined with\ninterest; when it reached Jean she exhibited excitement and emotion, but\nfor a time was quite speechless; then she said,\n\n\"Why, papa, if it keeps going on like this, pretty soon there won't be\nanybody left for you to get acquainted with but God.\"\n\nIt was not complimentary to think I was not acquainted in that quarter,\nbut she was young, and the young jump to conclusions without reflection.\n\nNecessarily, I did myself the honor to obey the command of the Emperor\nWilhelm II. Prince Heinrich, and six or eight other guests were\npresent. The Emperor did most of the talking, and he talked well, and in\nfaultless English. In both of these conspicuousnesses I was gratified to\nrecognize a resemblance to myself--a very exact resemblance; no, almost\nexact, but not quite that--a modified exactness, with the advantage in\nfavor of the Emperor. My English, like his, is nearly faultless; like\nhim I talk well; and when I have guests at dinner I prefer to do all the\ntalking myself. It is the best way, and the pleasantest. Also the most\nprofitable for the others.\n\nI was greatly pleased to perceive that his Majesty was familiar with my\nbooks, and that his attitude toward them was not uncomplimentary. In the\ncourse of his talk he said that my best and most valuable book was \"Old\nTimes on the Mississippi.\" I will refer to that remark again, presently.\n\nAn official who was well up in the Foreign Office at that time, and had\nserved under Bismarck for fourteen years, was still occupying his old\nplace under Chancellor Caprivi. Smith, I will call him of whom I am\nspeaking, though that is not his name. He was a special friend of mine,\nand I greatly enjoyed his society, although in order to have it it was\nnecessary for me to seek it as late as midnight, and not earlier. This\nwas because Government officials of his rank had to work all day, after\nnine in the morning, and then attend official banquets in the evening;\nwherefore they were usually unable to get life-restoring fresh air and\nexercise for their jaded minds and bodies earlier than midnight; then\nthey turned out, in groups of two or three, and gratefully and violently\ntramped the deserted streets until two in the morning. Smith had been in\nthe Government service, at home and abroad, for more than thirty years,\nand he was now sixty years old, or close upon it. He could not remember\na year in which he had had a vacation of more than a fortnight's length;\nhe was weary all through to the bones and the marrow, now, and was\nyearning for a holiday of a whole three months--yearning so longingly\nand so poignantly that he had at last made up his mind to make a\ndesperate cast for it and stand the consequences, whatever they might\nbe. It was against all rules to _ask_ for a vacation--quite against all\netiquette; the shock of it would paralyze the Chancellery; stem\netiquette and usage required another form: the applicant was not\nprivileged to ask for a vacation, he must send in his _resignation_. The\nchancellor would know that the applicant was not really trying to\nresign, and didn't want to resign, but was merely trying in this\nleft-handed way to get a vacation.\n\nThe night before the Emperor's dinner I helped Smith take his exercise,\nafter midnight, and he was full of his project. He had sent in his\nresignation that day, and was trembling for the result; and naturally,\nbecause it might possibly be that the chancellor would be happy to fill\nhis place with somebody else, in which case he could accept the\nresignation without comment and without offence. Smith was in a very\nanxious frame of mind; not that he feared that Caprivi was dissatisfied\nwith him, for he had no such fear; it was the Emperor that he was afraid\nof; he did not know how he stood with the Emperor. He said that while\napparently it was Caprivi who would decide his case, it was in reality\nthe Emperor who would perform that service; that the Emperor kept\npersonal watch upon everything, and that no official sparrow could fall\nto the ground without his privity and consent; that the resignation\nwould be laid before his Majesty, who would accept it or decline to\naccept it, according to his pleasure, and that then his pleasure in the\nmatter would be communicated by Caprivi. Smith said he would know his\nfate the next evening, after the imperial dinner; that when I should\nescort his Majesty into the large salon contiguous to the dining-room, I\nwould find there about thirty men--Cabinet ministers, admirals, generals\nand other great officials of the Empire--and that these men would be\nstanding talking together in little separate groups of two or three\npersons; that the Emperor would move from group to group and say a word\nto each, sometimes two words, sometimes ten words; and that the length\nof his speech, whether brief or not so brief, would indicate the exact\nstanding in the Emperor's regard, of the man accosted; and that by\nobserving this thermometer an expert could tell, to half a degree, the\nstate of the imperial weather in each case; that in Berlin, as in the\nimperial days of Rome, the Emperor was the sun, and that his smile or\nhis frown meant good fortune or disaster to the man upon whom it should\nfall. Smith suggested that I watch the thermometer while the Emperor\nwent his rounds of the groups; and added that if his Majesty talked four\nminutes with any person there present, it meant high favor, and that the\nsun was in the zenith, and cloudless, for that man.\n\nI mentally recorded that four-minute altitude, and resolved to see if\nany man there on that night stood in sufficient favor to achieve it.\n\nVery well. After the dinner I watched the Emperor while he passed from\ngroup to group, and privately I timed him with a watch. Two or three\ntimes he came near to reaching the four-minute altitude, but always he\nfell short a little. The last man he came to was Smith. He put his hand\non Smith's shoulder and began to talk to him; and when he finished, the\nthermometer had scored seven minutes! The company then moved toward the\nsmoking-room, where cigars, beer and anecdotes would be in brisk service\nuntil midnight, and as Smith passed me he whispered,\n\n\"That settles it. The chancellor will ask me how much of a vacation I\nwant, and I sha'n't be afraid to raise the limit. I shall call for six\nmonths.\"\n\n[Sidenote: (1891)]\n\n[Sidenote: (1899)]\n\nSmith's dream had been to spend his three months' vacation--in case he\ngot a vacation instead of the other thing--in one of the great capitals\nof the Continent--a capital whose name I shall suppress, at present. The\nnext day the chancellor asked him how much of a vacation he wanted, and\nwhere he desired to spend it. Smith told him. His prayer was granted,\nand rather more than granted. The chancellor augmented his salary and\nattached him to the German Embassy of that selected capital, giving him\na place of high dignity bearing an imposing title, and with nothing to\ndo except attend banquets of an extraordinary character at the Embassy,\nonce or twice a year. The term of his vacation was not specified; he was\nto continue it until requested to come back to his work in the Foreign\nOffice. This was in 1891. Eight years later Smith was passing through\nVienna, and he called upon me. There had been no interruption of his\nvacation, as yet, and there was no likelihood that an interruption of it\nwould occur while he should still be among the living.\n\n[_Dictated Monday, December 17, 1906._] As I have already remarked, \"Old\nTimes on the Mississippi\" got the Kaiser's best praise. It was after\nmidnight when I reached home; I was usually out until toward midnight,\nand the pleasure of being out late was poisoned, every night, by the\ndread of what I must meet at my front door--an indignant face, a\nresentful face, the face of the _portier_. The _portier_ was a\ntow-headed young German, twenty-two or three years old; and it had been\nfor some time apparent to me that he did not enjoy being hammered out of\nhis sleep, nights, to let me in. He never had a kind word for me, nor a\npleasant look. I couldn't understand it, since it was his business to be\non watch and let the occupants of the several flats in at any and all\nhours of the night. I could not see why he so distinctly failed to get\nreconciled to it.\n\nThe fact is, I was ignorantly violating, every night, a custom in which\nhe was commercially interested. I did not suspect this. No one had told\nme of the custom, and if I had been left to guess it, it would have\ntaken me a very long time to make a success of it. It was a custom which\nwas so well established and so universally recognized, that it had all\nthe force and dignity of law. By authority of this custom, whosoever\nentered a Berlin house after ten at night must pay a trifling toll to\nthe _portier_ for breaking his sleep to let him in. This tax was either\ntwo and a half cents or five cents, I don't remember which; but I had\nnever paid it, and didn't know I owed it, and as I had been residing in\nBerlin several weeks, I was so far in arrears that my presence in the\nGerman capital was getting to be a serious disaster to that young\nfellow.\n\nI arrived from the imperial dinner sorrowful and anxious, made my\npresence known and prepared myself to wait in patience the tedious\nminute or two which the _portier_ usually allowed himself to keep me\ntarrying--as a punishment. But this time there was no stage-wait; the\ndoor was instantly unlocked, unbolted, unchained and flung wide; and in\nit appeared the strange and welcome apparition of the _portier's_ round\nface all sunshine and smiles and welcome, in place of the black frowns\nand hostility that I was expecting. Plainly he had not come out of his\nbed: he had been waiting for me, watching for me. He began to pour out\nupon me in the most enthusiastic and energetic way a generous stream of\nGerman welcome and homage, meanwhile dragging me excitedly to his small\nbedroom beside the front door; there he made me bend down over a row of\nGerman translations of my books and said,\n\n\"There--you wrote them! I have found it out! By God, I did not know it\nbefore, and I ask a million pardons! That one there, the 'Old Times on\nthe Mississippi,' is the best book you ever wrote!\"\n\nThe usual number of those curious accidents which we call coincidences\nhave fallen to my share in this life, but for picturesqueness this one\nputs all the others in the shade: that a crowned head and a _portier_,\nthe very top of an empire and the very bottom of it, should pass the\nvery same criticism and deliver the very same verdict upon a book of\nmine--and almost in the same hour and the same breath--is a coincidence\nwhich out-coincidences any coincidence which I could have imagined with\nsuch powers of imagination as I have been favored with; and I have not\nbeen accustomed to regard them as being small or of an inferior quality.\nIt is always a satisfaction to me to remember that whereas I do not\nknow, for sure, what any other nation thinks of any one of my\ntwenty-three volumes, I do at least know for a certainty what one nation\nof fifty millions thinks of one of them, at any rate; for if the mutual\nverdict of the top of an empire and the bottom of it does not establish\nfor good and all the judgment of the entire nation concerning that book,\nthen the axiom that we can get a sure estimate of a thing by arriving at\na general average of all the opinions involved, is a fallacy.\n\n[_Dictated Monday, February 10, 1907._] Two months ago (December 6) I\nwas dictating a brief account of a private dinner in Berlin, where the\nEmperor of Germany was host and I the chief guest. Something happened\nday before yesterday which moves me to take up that matter again.\n\nAt the dinner his Majesty chatted briskly and entertainingly along in\neasy and flowing English, and now and then he interrupted himself to\naddress a remark to me, or to some other individual of the guests. When\nthe reply had been delivered, he resumed his talk. I noticed that the\ntable etiquette tallied with that which was the law of my house at home\nwhen we had guests: that is to say, the guests answered when the host\nfavored them with a remark, and then quieted down and behaved themselves\nuntil they got another chance. If I had been in the Emperor's chair and\nhe in mine, I should have felt infinitely comfortable and at home, and\nshould have done a world of talking, and done it well; but I was guest\nnow, and consequently I felt less at home. From old experience, I was\nfamiliar with the rules of the game, and familiar with their exercise\nfrom the high place of host; but I was not familiar with the trammelled\nand less satisfactory position of guest, therefore I felt a little\nstrange and out of place. But there was no animosity--no, the Emperor\nwas host, therefore according to my own rule he had a right to do the\ntalking, and it was my honorable duty to intrude no interruptions or\nother improvements, except upon invitation; and of course it could be\n_my_ turn some day: some day, on some friendly visit of inspection to\nAmerica, it might be my pleasure and distinction to have him as guest at\nmy table; then I would give him a rest, and a remarkably quiet time.\n\nIn one way there was a difference between his table and mine--for\ninstance, atmosphere; the guests stood in awe of him, and naturally they\nconferred that feeling upon me, for, after all, I am only human,\nalthough I regret it. When a guest answered a question he did it with\ndeferential voice and manner; he did not put any emotion into it, and he\ndid not spin it out, but got it out of his system as quickly as he\ncould, and then looked relieved. The Emperor was used to this\natmosphere, and it did not chill his blood; maybe it was an inspiration\nto him, for he was alert, brilliant and full of animation; also he was\nmost gracefully and felicitously complimentary to my books,--and I will\nremark here that the happy phrasing of a compliment is one of the rarest\nof human gifts, and the happy delivery of it another. In that other\nchapter I mentioned the high compliment which he paid to the book, \"Old\nTimes on the Mississippi,\" but there were others; among them some\ngratifying praise of my description in \"A Tramp Abroad\" of certain\nstriking phases of German student life. I mention these things here\nbecause I shall have occasion to hark back to them presently.\n\n[_Dictated Tuesday, February 12, 1907._]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThose stars indicate the long chapter which I dictated yesterday, a\nchapter which is much too long for magazine purposes, and therefore must\nwait until this Autobiography shall appear in book form, five years\nhence, when I am dead: five years according to my calculation,\ntwenty-seven years according to the prediction furnished me a week ago\nby the latest and most confident of all the palmists who have ever read\nmy future in my hand. The Emperor's dinner, and its beer-and-anecdote\nappendix, covered six hours of diligent industry, and this accounts for\nthe extraordinary length of that chapter.\n\nA couple of days ago a gentleman called upon me with a message. He had\njust arrived from Berlin, where he had been acting for our Government in\na matter concerning tariff revision, he being a member of the commission\nappointed by our Government to conduct our share of the affair. Upon the\ncompletion of the commission's labors, the Emperor invited the members\nof it to an audience, and in the course of the conversation he made a\nreference to me; continuing, he spoke of my chapter on the German\nlanguage in \"A Tramp Abroad,\" and characterized it by an adjective which\nis too complimentary for me to repeat here without bringing my modesty\nunder suspicion. Then he paid some compliments to \"The Innocents\nAbroad,\" and followed these with the remark that my account in one of my\nbooks of certain striking phases of German student life was the best and\ntruest that had ever been written. By this I perceive that he remembers\nthat dinner of sixteen years ago, for he said the same thing to me about\nthe student-chapter at that time. Next he said he wished this gentleman\nto convey two messages to America from him and deliver them--one to the\nPresident, the other to me. The wording of the message to me was:\n\n\"Convey to Mr. Clemens my kindest regards. Ask him if he remembers that\ndinner, and ask him why he didn't do any talking.\"\n\nWhy, how could I talk when he was talking? He \"held the age,\" as the\npoker-clergy say, and two can't talk at the same time with good effect.\nIt reminds me of the man who was reproached by a friend, who said,\n\n\"I think it a shame that you have not spoken to your wife for fifteen\nyears. How do you explain it? How do you justify it?\"\n\nThat poor man said,\n\n\"I didn't want to interrupt her.\"\n\nIf the Emperor had been at my table, he would not have suffered from my\nsilence, he would only have suffered from the sorrows of his own\nsolitude. If I were not too old to travel, I would go to Berlin and\nintroduce the etiquette of my own table, which tallies with the\netiquette observable at other royal tables. I would say, \"Invite me\nagain, your Majesty, and give me a chance\"; then I would courteously\nwaive rank and do all the talking myself. I thank his Majesty for his\nkind message, and am proud to have it and glad to express my sincere\nreciprocation of its sentiments.\n\n[_Dictated January 17, 1906._] ... Rev. Joseph T. Harris and I have been\nvisiting General Sickles. Once, twenty or twenty-five years ago, just as\nHarris was coming out of his gate Sunday morning to walk to his church\nand preach, a telegram was put into his hand. He read it immediately,\nand then, in a manner, collapsed. It said: \"General Sickles died last\nnight at midnight.\" [He had been a chaplain under Sickles through the\nwar.]\n\n[Sidenote: (1880.)]\n\nIt wasn't so. But no matter--it was so to Harris at the time. He walked\nalong--walked to the church--but his mind was far away. All his\naffection and homage and worship of his General had come to the fore.\nHis heart was full of these emotions. He hardly knew where he was. In\nhis pulpit, he stood up and began the service, but with a voice over\nwhich he had almost no command. The congregation had never seen him thus\nmoved, before, in his pulpit. They sat there and gazed at him and\nwondered what was the matter; because he was now reading, in this broken\nvoice and with occasional tears trickling down his face, what to them\nseemed a quite unemotional chapter--that one about Moses begat Aaron,\nand Aaron begat Deuteronomy, and Deuteronomy begat St. Peter, and St.\nPeter begat Cain, and Cain begat Abel--and he was going along with this,\nand half crying--his voice continually breaking. The congregation left\nthe church that morning without being able to account for this most\nextraordinary thing--as it seemed to them. That a man who had been a\nsoldier for more than four years, and who had preached in that pulpit so\nmany, many times on really moving subjects, without even the quiver of a\nlip, should break all down over the Begats, they couldn't understand.\nBut there it is--any one can see how such a mystery as that would arouse\nthe curiosity of those people to the boiling-point.\n\nHarris has had many adventures. He has more adventures in a year than\nanybody else has in five. One Saturday night he noticed a bottle on his\nuncle's dressing-bureau. He thought the label said \"Hair Restorer,\" and\nhe took it in his room and gave his head a good drenching and sousing\nwith it and carried it back and thought no more about it. Next morning\nwhen he got up his head was a bright green! He sent around everywhere\nand couldn't get a substitute preacher, so he had to go to his church\nhimself and preach--and he did it. He hadn't a sermon in his barrel--as\nit happened--of any lightsome character, so he had to preach a very\ngrave one--a very serious one--and it made the matter worse. The gravity\nof the sermon did not harmonize with the gayety of his head, and the\npeople sat all through it with handkerchiefs stuffed in their mouths to\ntry to keep down their joy. And Harris told me that he was sure he never\nhad seen his congregation--the whole body of his congregation--the\n_entire_ body of his congregation--absorbed in interest in his sermon,\nfrom beginning to end, before. Always there had been an aspect of\nindifference, here and there, or wandering, somewhere; but this time\nthere was nothing of the kind. Those people sat there as if they\nthought, \"Good for this day and train only: we must have all there is of\nthis show, not waste any of it.\" And he said that when he came down out\nof the pulpit more people waited to shake him by the hand and tell him\nwhat a good sermon it was, than ever before. And it seemed a pity that\nthese people should do these fictions in such a place--right in the\nchurch--when it was quite plain they were not interested in the sermon\nat all; they only wanted to get a near view of his head.\n\nWell, Harris said--no, Harris didn't say, _I_ say, that as the days went\non and Sunday followed Sunday, the interest in Harris's hair grew and\ngrew; because it didn't stay merely and monotonously green, it took on\ndeeper and deeper shades of green; and then it would change and become\nreddish, and would go from that to some other color--purplish,\nyellowish, bluish, and so on--but it was never a solid color. It was\nalways mottled. And each Sunday it was a little more interesting than it\nwas the Sunday before--and Harris's head became famous, and people came\nfrom New York, and Boston, and South Carolina, and Japan, and so on, to\nlook. There wasn't seating-capacity for all the people that came while\nhis head was undergoing these various and fascinating mottlings. And it\nwas a good thing in several ways, because the business had been\nlanguishing a little, and now a lot of people joined the church so that\nthey could have the show, and it was the beginning of a prosperity for\nthat church which has never diminished in all these years.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCXII.\n\nAPRIL 5, 1907.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XV.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n[_Dictated October 8, 1906._]\n\n_From Susy's Biography of Me._\n\n\n     Papa says that if the collera comes here he will take Sour Mash to\n     the mountains.\n\n\n[Sidenote: (1885.)]\n\nThis remark about the cat is followed by various entries, covering a\nmonth, in which Jean, General Grant, the sculptor Gerhardt, Mrs. Candace\nWheeler, Miss Dora Wheeler, Mr. Frank Stockton, Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge,\nand the widow of General Custer appear and drift in procession across\nthe page, then vanish forever from the Biography; then Susy drops this\nremark in the wake of the vanished procession:\n\n\n     Sour Mash is a constant source of anxiety, care, and pleasure to\n     papa.\n\n\nI did, in truth, think a great deal of that old tortoise-shell harlot;\nbut I haven't a doubt that in order to impress Susy I was pretending\nagonies of solicitude which I didn't honestly feel. Sour Mash never gave\nme any real anxiety; she was always able to take care of herself, and\nshe was ostentatiously vain of the fact; vain of it to a degree which\noften made me ashamed of her, much as I esteemed her.\n\nMany persons would like to have the society of cats during the summer\nvacation in the country, but they deny themselves this pleasure because\nthey think they must either take the cats along when they return to the\ncity, where they would be a trouble and an encumbrance, or leave them in\nthe country, houseless and homeless. These people have no ingenuity, no\ninvention, no wisdom; or it would occur to them to do as I do: rent cats\nby the month for the summer and return them to their good homes at the\nend of it. Early last May I rented a kitten of a farmer's wife, by the\nmonth; then I got a discount by taking three. They have been good\ncompany for about five months now, and are still kittens--at least they\nhave not grown much, and to all intents and purposes are still kittens,\nand as full of romping energy and enthusiasm as they were in the\nbeginning. This is remarkable. I am an expert in cats, but I have not\nseen a kitten keep its kittenhood nearly so long before.\n\nThese are beautiful creatures--these triplets. Two of them wear the\nblackest and shiniest and thickest of sealskin vestments all over their\nbodies except the lower half of their faces and the terminations of\ntheir paws. The black masks reach down below the eyes, therefore when\nthe eyes are closed they are not visible; the rest of the face, and the\ngloves and stockings, are snow white. These markings are just the same\non both cats--so exactly the same that when you call one the other is\nlikely to answer, because they cannot tell each other apart. Since the\ncats are precisely alike, and can't be told apart by any of us, they do\nnot need two names, so they have but one between them. We call both of\nthem Sackcloth, and we call the gray one Ashes. I believe I have never\nseen such intelligent cats as these before. They are full of the nicest\ndiscriminations. When I read German aloud they weep; you can see the\ntears run down. It shows what pathos there is in the German tongue. I\nhad not noticed before that all German is pathetic, no matter what the\nsubject is nor how it is treated. It was these humble observers that\nbrought the knowledge to me. I have tried all kinds of German on these\ncats; romance, poetry, philosophy, theology, market reports; and the\nresult has always been the same--the cats sob, and let the tears run\ndown, which shows that all German is pathetic. French is not a familiar\ntongue to me, and the pronunciation is difficult, and comes out of me\nencumbered with a Missouri accent; but the cats like it, and when I make\nimpassioned speeches in that language they sit in a row and put up their\npaws, palm to palm, and frantically give thanks. Hardly any cats are\naffected by music, but these are; when I sing they go reverently away,\nshowing how deeply they feel it. Sour Mash never cared for these things.\nShe had many noble qualities, but at bottom she was not refined, and\ncared little or nothing for theology and the arts.\n\nIt is a pity to say it, but these cats are not above the grade of human\nbeings, for I know by certain signs that they are not sincere in their\nexhibitions of emotion, but exhibit them merely to show off and attract\nattention--conduct which is distinctly human, yet with a difference:\nthey do not know enough to conceal their desire to show off, but the\ngrown human being does. What is ambition? It is only the desire to be\nconspicuous. The desire for fame is only the desire to be continuously\nconspicuous and attract attention and be talked about.\n\nThese cats are like human beings in another way: when Ashes began to\nwork his fictitious emotions, and show off, the other members of the\nfirm followed suit, in order to be in the fashion. That is the way with\nhuman beings; they are afraid to be outside; whatever the fashion\nhappens to be, they conform to it, whether it be a pleasant fashion or\nthe reverse, they lacking the courage to ignore it and go their own way.\nAll human beings would like to dress in loose and comfortable and highly\ncolored and showy garments, and they had their desire until a century\nago, when a king, or some other influential ass, introduced sombre hues\nand discomfort and ugly designs into masculine clothing. The meek public\nsurrendered to the outrage, and by consequence we are in that odious\ncaptivity to-day, and are likely to remain in it for a long time to\ncome.\n\nFortunately the women were not included in the disaster, and so their\ngraces and their beauty still have the enhancing help of delicate\nfabrics and varied and beautiful colors. Their clothing makes a great\nopera audience an enchanting spectacle, a delight to the eye and the\nspirit, a Garden of Eden for charm and color. The men, clothed in dismal\nblack, are scattered here and there and everywhere over the Garden, like\nso many charred stumps, and they damage the effect, but cannot\nannihilate it.\n\nIn summer we poor creatures have a respite, and may clothe ourselves in\nwhite garments; loose, soft, and in some degree shapely; but in the\nwinter--the sombre winter, the depressing winter, the cheerless winter,\nwhen white clothes and bright colors are especially needed to brighten\nour spirits and lift them up--we all conform to the prevailing insanity,\nand go about in dreary black, each man doing it because the others do\nit, and not because he wants to. They are really no sincerer than\nSackcloth and Ashes. At bottom the Sackcloths do not care to exhibit\ntheir emotions when I am performing before them, they only do it because\nAshes started it.\n\nI would like to dress in a loose and flowing costume made all of silks\nand velvets, resplendent with all the stunning dyes of the rainbow, and\nso would every sane man I have ever known; but none of us dares to\nventure it. There is such a thing as carrying conspicuousness to the\npoint of discomfort; and if I should appear on Fifth Avenue on a Sunday\nmorning, at church-time, clothed as I would like to be clothed, the\nchurches would be vacant, and I should have all the congregations\ntagging after me, to look, and secretly envy, and publicly scoff. It is\nthe way human beings are made; they are always keeping their real\nfeelings shut up inside, and publicly exploiting their fictitious ones.\n\nNext after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, when the\nsummer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and comfortable white\nclothes and enter for the winter into the depressing captivity of the\nshapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the\nweather is growing cold up here in the New Hampshire hills, but it will\nnot succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the\nneighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a\nbrave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a\ncrowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might\ntake the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished\nand outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in\nthe village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuously, all\nsolitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and\nI found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten\nminutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings\nI had brought.\n\nI am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good\nmany privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted\nto younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage\nenough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It\nwill be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps\nthe largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every\nscoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my\nlead.\n\nThat mention that I have acquired new and great privileges by grace of\nmy age, is not an uncalculated remark. When I passed the seventieth\nmile-stone, ten months ago, I instantly realized that I had entered a\nnew country and a new atmosphere. To all the public I was become\nrecognizably old, undeniably old; and from that moment everybody assumed\na new attitude toward me--the reverent attitude granted by custom to\nage--and straightway the stream of generous new privileges began to flow\nin upon me and refresh my life. Since then, I have lived an ideal\nexistence; and I now believe what Choate said last March, and which at\nthe time I didn't credit: that the best of life begins at seventy; for\nthen your work is done; you know that you have done your best, let the\nquality of the work be what it may; that you have earned your holiday--a\nholiday of peace and contentment--and that thenceforth, to the setting\nof your sun, nothing will break it, nothing interrupt it.\n\n[_Dictated January 22, 1907._] In an earlier chapter I inserted some\nverses beginning \"Love Came at Dawn\" which had been found among Susy's\npapers after her death. I was not able to say that they were hers, but I\njudged that they might be, for the reason that she had not enclosed them\nin quotation marks according to her habit when storing up treasures\ngathered from other people. Stedman was not able to determine the\nauthorship for me, as the verses were new to him, but the authorship has\nnow been traced. The verses were written by William Wilfred Campbell, a\nCanadian poet, and they form a part of the contents of his book called\n\"Beyond the Hills of Dream.\"\n\nThe authorship of the beautiful lines which my wife and I inscribed upon\nSusy's gravestone was untraceable for a time. We had found them in a\nbook in India, but had lost the book and with it the author's name. But\nin time an application to the editor of \"Notes and Queries\" furnished me\nthe author's name,[7] and it has been added to the verses upon the\ngravestone.\n\nLast night, at a dinner-party where I was present, Mr. Peter Dunne\nDooley handed to the host several dollars, in satisfaction of a lost\nbet. I seemed to see an opportunity to better my condition, and I\ninvited Dooley, apparently disinterestedly, to come to my house Friday\nand play billiards. He accepted, and I judge that there is going to be a\ndeficit in the Dooley treasury as a result. In great qualities of the\nheart and brain, Dooley is gifted beyond all propriety. He is brilliant;\nhe is an expert with his pen, and he easily stands at the head of all\nthe satirists of this generation--but he is going to walk in darkness\nFriday afternoon. It will be a fraternal kindness to teach him that with\nall his light and culture, he does not know all the valuable things; and\nit will also be a fraternal kindness to him to complete his education\nfor him--and I shall do this on Friday, and send him home in that\nperfected condition.\n\nI possess a billiard secret which can be valuable to the Dooley sept,\nafter I shall have conferred it upon Dooley--for a consideration. It is\na discovery which I made by accident, thirty-eight years ago, in my\nfather-in-law's house in Elmira. There was a scarred and battered and\nancient billiard-table in the garret, and along with it a peck of\nchecked and chipped balls, and a rackful of crooked and headless cues. I\nplayed solitaire up there every day with that difficult outfit. The\ntable was not level, but slanted sharply to the southeast; there wasn't\na ball that was round, or would complete the journey you started it on,\nbut would always get tired and stop half-way and settle, with a jolty\nwabble, to a standstill on its chipped side. I tried making counts with\nfour balls, but found it difficult and discouraging, so I added a fifth\nball, then a sixth, then a seventh, and kept on adding until at last I\nhad twelve balls on the table and a thirteenth to play with. My game was\ncaroms--caroms solely--caroms plain, or caroms with cushion to\nhelp--anything that could furnish a count. In the course of time I found\nto my astonishment that I was never able to run fifteen, under any\ncircumstances. By huddling the balls advantageously in the beginning, I\ncould now and then coax fourteen out of them, but I couldn't reach\nfifteen by either luck or skill. Sometimes the balls would get scattered\ninto difficult positions and defeat me in that way; sometimes if I\nmanaged to keep them together, I would freeze; and always when I froze,\nand had to play away from the contact, there was sure to be nothing to\nplay at but a wide and uninhabited vacancy.\n\nOne day Mr. Dalton called on my brother-in-law, on a matter of business,\nand I was asked if I could entertain him awhile, until my brother-in-law\nshould finish an engagement with another gentleman. I said I could, and\ntook him up to the billiard-table. I had played with him many times at\nthe club, and knew that he could play billiards tolerably well--only\ntolerably well--but not any better than I could. He and I were just a\nmatch. He didn't know our table; he didn't know those balls; he didn't\nknow those warped and headless cues; he didn't know the southeastern\nslant of the table, and how to allow for it. I judged it would be safe\nand profitable to offer him a bet on my scheme. I emptied the avalanche\nof thirteen balls on the table and said:\n\n\"Take a ball and begin, Mr. Dalton. How many can you run with an outlay\nlike that?\"\n\nHe said, with the half-affronted air of a mathematician who has been\nasked how much of the multiplication table he can recite without a\nbreak:\n\n\"I suppose a million--eight hundred thousand, anyway.\"\n\nI said \"You shall hove the privilege of placing the balls to suit\nyourself, and I want to bet you a dollar that you can't run fifteen.\"\n\nI will not dwell upon the sequel. At the end of an hour his face was\nred, and wet with perspiration; his outer garments lay scattered here\nand there over the place; he was the angriest man in the State, and\nthere wasn't a rag or remnant of an injurious adjective left in him\nanywhere--and I had all his small change.\n\nWhen the summer was over, we went home to Hartford, and one day Mr.\nGeorge Robertson arrived from Boston with two or three hours to spare\nbetween then and the return train, and as he was a young gentleman to\nwhom we were in debt for much social pleasure, it was my duty, and a\nwelcome duty, to make his two or three hours interesting for him. So I\ntook him up-stairs and set up my billiard scheme for his comfort. Mine\nwas a good table, in perfect repair; the cues were in perfect condition;\nthe balls were ivory, and flawless--but I knew that Mr. Robertson was my\nprey, just the same, for by exhaustive tests with this outfit I had\nfound that my limit was thirty-one. I had proved to my satisfaction that\nwhereas I could not fairly expect to get more than six or eight or a\ndozen caroms out of a run, I could now and then reach twenty and\ntwenty-five, and after a long procession of failures finally achieve a\nrun of thirty-one; but in no case had I ever got beyond thirty-one.\nRobertson's game, as I knew, was a little better than mine, so I\nresolved to require him to make thirty-two. I believed it would\nentertain him. He was one of these brisk and hearty and cheery and\nself-satisfied young fellows who are brimful of confidence, and who\nplunge with grateful eagerness into any enterprise that offers a showy\ntest of their abilities. I emptied the balls on the table and said,\n\n\"Take a cue and a ball, George, and begin. How many caroms do you think\nyou can make out of that layout?\"\n\nHe laughed the laugh of the gay and the care-free, as became his youth\nand inexperience, and said,\n\n\"I can punch caroms out of that bunch a week without a break.\"\n\nI said \"Place the balls to suit yourself, and begin.\"\n\nConfidence is a necessary thing in billiards, but overconfidence is bad.\nGeorge went at his task with much too much lightsomeness of spirit and\ndisrespect for the situation. On his first shot he scored three caroms;\non his second shot he scored four caroms; and on his third shot he\nmissed as simple a carom as could be devised. He was very much\nastonished, and said he would not have supposed that careful play could\nbe needed with an acre of bunched balls in front of a person.\n\nHe began again, and played more carefully, but still with too much\nlightsomeness; he couldn't seem to learn to take the situation\nseriously. He made about a dozen caroms and broke down. He was irritated\nwith himself now, and he thought he caught me laughing. He didn't. I do\nnot laugh publicly at my client when this game is going on; I only do it\ninside--or save it for after the exhibition is over. But he thought he\nhad caught me laughing, and it increased his irritation. Of course I\nknew he thought I was laughing privately--for I was experienced; they\nall think that, and it has a good effect; it sharpens their annoyance\nand debilitates their play.\n\nHe made another trial and failed. Once more he was astonished; once more\nhe was humiliated--and as for his anger, it rose to summer-heat. He\narranged the balls again, grouping them carefully, and said he would win\nthis time, or die. When a client reaches this condition, it is a good\ntime to damage his nerve further, and this can always be done by saying\nsome little mocking thing or other that has the outside appearance of a\nfriendly remark--so I employed this art. I suggested that a bet might\ntauten his nerves, and that I would offer one, but that as I did not\nwant it to be an expense to him, but only a help, I would make it\nsmall--a cigar, if he were willing--a cigar that he would fail again;\nnot an expensive one, but a cheap native one, of the Crown Jewel breed,\nsuch as is manufactured in Hartford for the clergy. It set him afire all\nover! I could see the blue flame issue from his eyes. He said,\n\n\"Make it a hundred!--and no Connecticut cabbage-leaf product, but\nHavana, $25 the box!\"\n\nI took him up, but said I was sorry to see him do this, because it did\nnot seem to me right or fair for me to rob him under our own roof, when\nhe had been so kind to us. He said, with energy and acrimony:\n\n\"You take care of your own pocket, if you'll be so good, and leave me to\ntake care of mine.\"\n\nAnd he plunged at the congress of balls with a vindictiveness which was\ninfinitely contenting to me. He scored a failure--and began to undress.\nI knew it would come to that, for he was in the condition now that Mr.\nDooley will be in at about that stage of the contest on Friday\nafternoon. A clothes-rack will be provided for Mr. Dooley to hang his\nthings on as fast as he shall from time to time shed them. George raised\nhis voice four degrees and flung out the challenge--\n\n\"Double or quits!\"\n\n\"Done,\" I responded, in the gentle and compassionate voice of one who is\napparently getting sorrier and sorrier.\n\nThere was an hour and a half of straight disaster after that, and if it\nwas a sin to enjoy it, it is no matter--I did enjoy it. It is half a\nlifetime ago, but I enjoy it yet, every time I think of it George made\nfailure after failure. His fury increased with each failure as he\nscored it. With each defeat he flung off one or another rag of his\nraiment, and every time he started on a fresh inning he made it \"double\nor quits\" once more. Twice he reached thirty and broke down; once he\nreached thirty-one and broke down. These \"nears\" made him frantic, and I\nbelieve I was never so happy in my life, except the time, a few years\nlater, when the Rev. J. H. Twichell and I walked to Boston and he had\nthe celebrated conversation with the hostler at the Inn at Ashford,\nConnecticut.\n\nAt last, when we were notified that Patrick was at the door to drive him\nto his train, George owed me five thousand cigars at twenty-five cents\napiece, and I was so sorry I could have hugged him. But he shouted,\n\n\"Give me ten minutes more!\" and added stormily, \"it's double or quits\nagain, and I'll win out free of debt or owe you ten thousand cigars, and\nyou'll pay the funeral expenses.\"\n\nHe began on his final effort, and I believe that in all my experience\namong both amateurs and experts, I have never seen a cue so carefully\nhandled in my lifetime as George handled his upon this intensely\ninteresting occasion. He got safely up to twenty-five, and then ceased\nto breathe. So did I. He labored along, and added a point, another\npoint, still another point, and finally reached thirty-one. He stopped\nthere, and we took a breath. By this time the balls were scattered all\ndown the cushions, about a foot or two apart, and there wasn't a shot in\nsight anywhere that any man might hope to make. In a burst of anger and\nconfessed defeat, he sent his ball flying around the table at random,\nand it crotched a ball that was packed against the cushion and sprang\nacross to a ball against the bank on the opposite side, and counted!\n\nHis luck had set him free, and he didn't owe me anything. He had used up\nall his spare time, but we carried his clothes to the carriage, and he\ndressed on his way to the station, greatly wondered at and admired by\nthe ladies, as he drove along--but he got his train.\n\nI am very fond of Mr. Dooley, and shall await his coming with\naffectionate and pecuniary interest.\n\n_P.S. Saturday._ He has been here. Let us not talk about it.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[7] Robert Richardson, deceased, of Australia.\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCXIII.\n\nAPRIL 19, 1907.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XVI.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n[_Dictated January 12th, 1905._] ... But I am used to having my\nstatements discounted. My mother began it before I was seven years old.\nYet all through my life my facts have had a substratum of truth, and\ntherefore they were not without preciousness. Any person who is familiar\nwith me knows how to strike my average, and therefore knows how to get\nat the jewel of any fact of mine and dig it out of its blue-clay matrix.\nMy mother knew that art. When I was seven or eight, or ten, or twelve\nyears old--along there--a neighbor said to her,\n\n\"Do you ever believe anything that that boy says?\"\n\nMy mother said,\n\n\"He is the well-spring of truth, but you can't bring up the whole well\nwith one bucket\"--and she added, \"I know his average, therefore he never\ndeceives me. I discount him thirty per cent. for embroidery, and what is\nleft is perfect and priceless truth, without a flaw in it anywhere.\"\n\nNow to make a jump of forty years, without breaking the connection: that\nword \"embroidery\" was used again in my presence and concerning me, when\nI was fifty years old, one night at Rev. Frank Goodwin's house in\nHartford, at a meeting of the Monday Evening Club. The Monday Evening\nClub still exists. It was founded about forty-five years ago by that\ntheological giant, Rev. Dr. Bushnell, and some comrades of his, men of\nlarge intellectual calibre and more or less distinction, local or\nnational. I was admitted to membership in it in the fall of 1871 and was\nan active member thenceforth until I left Hartford in the summer of\n1891. The membership was restricted, in those days, to eighteen--\npossibly twenty. The meetings began about the 1st of October and were\nheld in the private houses of the members every fortnight thereafter\nthroughout the cold months until the 1st of May. Usually there were a\ndozen members present--sometimes as many as fifteen. There was an essay\nand a discussion. The essayists followed each other in alphabetical\norder through the season. The essayist could choose his own subject and\ntalk twenty minutes on it, from MS. or orally, according to his\npreference. Then the discussion followed, and each member present was\nallowed ten minutes in which to express his views. The wives of these\npeople were always present. It was their privilege. It was also their\nprivilege to keep still; they were not allowed to throw any light upon\nthe discussion. After the discussion there was a supper, and talk, and\ncigars. This supper began at ten o'clock promptly, and the company broke\nup and went away at midnight. At least they did except upon one\noccasion. In my recent Birthday speech I remarked upon the fact that I\nhave always bought cheap cigars, and that is true. I have never bought\ncostly ones.\n\nWell, that night at the Club meeting--as I was saying--George, our\ncolored butler, came to me when the supper was nearly over, and I\nnoticed that he was pale. Normally his complexion was a clear black, and\nvery handsome, but now it had modified to old amber. He said:\n\n\"Mr. Clemens, what are we going to do? There is not a cigar in the house\nbut those old Wheeling long nines. Can't nobody smoke them but you. They\nkill at thirty yards. It is too late to telephone--we couldn't get any\ncigars out from town--what can we do? Ain't it best to say nothing, and\nlet on that we didn't think?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"that would not be honest. Fetch out the long\nnines\"--which he did.\n\nI had just come across those \"long nines\" a few days or a week before. I\nhadn't seen a long nine for years. When I was a cub pilot on the\nMississippi in the late '50's, I had had a great affection for them,\nbecause they were not only--to my mind--perfect, but you could get a\nbasketful of them for a cent--or a dime, they didn't use cents out there\nin those days. So when I saw them advertised in Hartford I sent for a\nthousand at once. They came out to me in badly battered and\ndisreputable-looking old square pasteboard boxes, two hundred in a box.\nGeorge brought a box, which was caved in on all sides, looking the worst\nit could, and began to pass them around. The conversation had been\nbrilliantly animated up to that moment--but now a frost fell upon the\ncompany. That is to say, not all of a sudden, but the frost fell upon\neach man as he took up a cigar and held it poised in the air--and there,\nin the middle, his sentence broke off. That kind of thing went on all\naround the table, until when George had completed his crime the whole\nplace was full of a thick solemnity and silence.\n\nThose men began to light the cigars. Rev. Dr. Parker was the first man\nto light. He took three or four heroic whiffs--then gave it up. He got\nup with the remark that he had to go to the bedside of a sick\nparishioner. He started out. Rev. Dr. Burton was the next man. He took\nonly one whiff, and followed Parker. He furnished a pretext, and you\ncould see by the sound of his voice that he didn't think much of the\npretext, and was vexed with Parker for getting in ahead with a\nfictitious ailing client. Rev. Mr. Twichell followed, and said he had to\ngo now because he must take the midnight train for Boston. Boston was\nthe first place that occurred to him, I suppose.\n\nIt was only a quarter to eleven when they began to distribute pretexts.\nAt ten minutes to eleven all those people were out of the house. When\nnobody was left but George and me I was cheerful--I had no compunctions\nof conscience, no griefs of any kind. But George was beyond speech,\nbecause he held the honor and credit of the family above his own, and he\nwas ashamed that this smirch had been put upon it. I told him to go to\nbed and try to sleep it off. I went to bed myself. At breakfast in the\nmorning when George was passing a cup of coffee, I saw it tremble in his\nhand. I knew by that sign that there was something on his mind. He\nbrought the cup to me and asked impressively,\n\n\"Mr. Clemens, how far is it from the front door to the upper gate?\"\n\nI said, \"It is a hundred and twenty-five steps.\"\n\nHe said, \"Mr. Clemens, you can start at the front door and you can go\nplumb to the upper gate and tread on one of them cigars every time.\"\n\nIt wasn't true in detail, but in essentials it was.\n\nThe subject under discussion on the night in question was Dreams. The\ntalk passed from mouth to mouth in the usual serene way.\n\nI do not now remember what form my views concerning dreams took at the\ntime. I don't remember now what my notion about dreams was then, but I\ndo remember telling a dream by way of illustrating some detail of my\nspeech, and I also remember that when I had finished it Rev. Dr. Burton\nmade that doubting remark which contained that word I have already\nspoken of as having been uttered by my mother, in some such connection,\nforty or fifty years before. I was probably engaged in trying to make\nthose people believe that now and then, by some accident, or otherwise,\na dream which was prophetic turned up in the dreamer's mind. The date of\nmy memorable dream was about the beginning of May, 1858. It was a\nremarkable dream, and I had been telling it several times every year for\nmore than fifteen years--and now I was telling it again, here in the\nclub.\n\nIn 1858 I was a steersman on board the swift and popular New Orleans and\nSt. Louis packet, \"Pennsylvania,\" Captain Kleinfelter. I had been lent\nto Mr. Brown, one of the pilots of the \"Pennsylvania,\" by my owner, Mr.\nHorace E. Bixby, and I had been steering for Brown about eighteen\nmonths, I think. Then in the early days of May, 1858, came a tragic\ntrip--the last trip of that fleet and famous steamboat. I have told all\nabout it in one of my books called \"Old Times on the Mississippi.\" But\nit is not likely that I told the dream in that book. It is impossible\nthat I can ever have published it, I think, because I never wanted my\nmother to know about the dream, and she lived several years after I\npublished that volume.\n\nI had found a place on the \"Pennsylvania\" for my brother Henry, who was\ntwo years my junior. It was not a place of profit, it was only a place\nof promise. He was \"mud\" clerk. Mud clerks received no salary, but they\nwere in the line of promotion. They could become, presently, third clerk\nand second clerk, then chief clerk--that is to say, purser. The dream\nbegins when Henry had been mud clerk about three months. We were lying\nin port at St. Louis. Pilots and steersmen had nothing to do during the\nthree days that the boat lay in port in St. Louis and New Orleans, but\nthe mud clerk had to begin his labors at dawn and continue them into the\nnight, by the light of pine-knot torches. Henry and I, moneyless and\nunsalaried, had billeted ourselves upon our brother-in-law, Mr. Moffet,\nas night lodgers while in port. We took our meals on board the boat. No,\nI mean _I_ lodged at the house, not Henry. He spent the _evenings_ at\nthe house, from nine until eleven, then went to the boat to be ready for\nhis early duties. On the night of the dream he started away at eleven,\nshaking hands with the family, and said good-by according to custom. I\nmay mention that hand-shaking as a good-by was not merely the custom of\nthat family, but the custom of the region--the custom of Missouri, I may\nsay. In all my life, up to that time, I had never seen one member of the\nClemens family kiss another one--except once. When my father lay dying\nin our home in Hannibal--the 24th of March, 1847--he put his arm around\nmy sister's neck and drew her down and kissed her, saying \"Let me die.\"\nI remember that, and I remember the death rattle which swiftly followed\nthose words, which were his last. These good-bys of Henry's were always\nexecuted in the family sitting-room on the second floor, and Henry went\nfrom that room and down-stairs without further ceremony. But this time\nmy mother went with him to the head of the stairs and said good-by\n_again_. As I remember it she was moved to this by something in Henry's\nmanner, and she remained at the head of the stairs while he descended.\nWhen he reached the door he hesitated, and climbed the stairs and shook\nhands good-by once more.\n\nIn the morning, when I awoke I had been dreaming, and the dream was so\nvivid, so like reality, that it deceived me, and I thought it was real.\nIn the dream I had seen Henry a corpse. He lay in a metallic\nburial-case. He was dressed in a suit of my clothing, and on his breast\nlay a great bouquet of flowers, mainly white roses, with a red rose in\nthe centre. The casket stood upon a couple of chairs. I dressed, and\nmoved toward that door, thinking I would go in there and look at it, but\nI changed my mind. I thought I could not yet bear to meet my mother. I\nthought I would wait awhile and make some preparation for that ordeal.\nThe house was in Locust Street, a little above 13th, and I walked to\n14th, and to the middle of the block beyond, before it suddenly flashed\nupon me that there was nothing real about this--it was only a dream. I\ncan still feel something of the grateful upheaval of joy of that moment,\nand I can also still feel the remnant of doubt, the suspicion that maybe\nit _was_ real, after all. I returned to the house almost on a run, flew\nup the stairs two or three steps at a jump, and rushed into that\nsitting-room--and was made glad again, for there was no casket there.\n\nWe made the usual eventless trip to New Orleans--no, it was not\neventless, for it was on the way down that I had the fight with Mr.\nBrown[8] which resulted in his requiring that I be left ashore at New\nOrleans. In New Orleans I always had a job. It was my privilege to watch\nthe freight-piles from seven in the evening until seven in the morning,\nand get three dollars for it. It was a three-night job and occurred\nevery thirty-five days. Henry always joined my watch about nine in the\nevening, when his own duties were ended, and we often walked my rounds\nand chatted together until midnight. This time we were to part, and so\nthe night before the boat sailed I gave Henry some advice. I said, \"In\ncase of disaster to the boat, don't lose your head--leave that unwisdom\nto the passengers--they are competent--they'll attend to it. But you\nrush for the hurricane-deck, and astern to one of the life-boats lashed\naft the wheel-house, and obey the mate's orders--thus you will be\nuseful. When the boat is launched, give such help as you can in getting\nthe women and children into it, and be sure you don't try to get into it\nyourself. It is summer weather, the river is only a mile wide, as a\nrule, and you can swim that without any trouble.\" Two or three days\nafterward the boat's boilers exploded at Ship Island, below Memphis,\nearly one morning--and what happened afterward I have already told in\n\"Old Times on the Mississippi.\" As related there, I followed the\n\"Pennsylvania\" about a day later, on another boat, and we began to get\nnews of the disaster at every port we touched at, and so by the time we\nreached Memphis we knew all about it.\n\nI found Henry stretched upon a mattress on the floor of a great\nbuilding, along with thirty or forty other scalded and wounded persons,\nand was promptly informed, by some indiscreet person, that he had\ninhaled steam; that his body was badly scalded, and that he would live\nbut a little while; also, I was told that the physicians and nurses were\ngiving their whole attention to persons who had a chance of being saved.\nThey were short-handed in the matter of physicians and nurses; and Henry\nand such others as were considered to be fatally hurt were receiving\nonly such attention as could be spared, from time to time, from the more\nurgent cases. But Dr. Peyton, a fine and large-hearted old physician of\ngreat reputation in the community, gave me his sympathy and took\nvigorous hold of the case, and in about a week he had brought Henry\naround. Dr. Peyton never committed himself with prognostications which\nmight not materialize, but at eleven o'clock one night he told me that\nHenry was out of danger, and would get well. Then he said, \"At midnight\nthese poor fellows lying here and there all over this place will begin\nto mourn and mutter and lament and make outcries, and if this commotion\nshould disturb Henry it will be bad for him; therefore ask the physician\non watch to give him an eighth of a grain of morphine, but this is not\nto be done unless Henry shall show signs that he is being disturbed.\"\n\nOh well, never mind the rest of it. The physicians on watch were young\nfellows hardly out of the medical college, and they made a mistake--they\nhad no way of measuring the eighth of a grain of morphine, so they\nguessed at it and gave him a vast quantity heaped on the end of a\nknife-blade, and the fatal effects were soon apparent. I think he died\nabout dawn, I don't remember as to that. He was carried to the dead-room\nand I went away for a while to a citizen's house and slept off some of\nmy accumulated fatigue--and meantime something was happening. The\ncoffins provided for the dead were of unpainted white pine, but in this\ninstance some of the ladies of Memphis had made up a fund of sixty\ndollars and bought a metallic case, and when I came back and entered the\ndead-room Henry lay in that open case, and he was dressed in a suit of\nmy clothing. He had borrowed it without my knowledge during our last\nsojourn in St. Louis; and I recognized instantly that my dream of\nseveral weeks before was here exactly reproduced, so far as these\ndetails went--and I think I missed one detail; but that one was\nimmediately supplied, for just then an elderly lady entered the place\nwith a large bouquet consisting mainly of white roses, and in the centre\nof it was a red rose, and she laid it on his breast.\n\nI told the dream there in the Club that night just as I have told it\nhere.\n\nRev. Dr. Burton swung his leonine head around, focussed me with his eye,\nand said:\n\n\"When was it that this happened?\"\n\n\"In June, '58.\"\n\n\"It is a good many years ago. Have you told it several times since?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have, a good many times.\"\n\n\"How many?\"\n\n\"Why, I don't know how many.\"\n\n\"Well, strike an average. How many times a year do you think you have\ntold it?\"\n\n\"Well, I have told it as many as six times a year, possibly oftener.\"\n\n\"Very well, then you've told it, we'll say, seventy or eighty times\nsince it happened?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"that's a conservative estimate.\"\n\n\"Now then, Mark, a very extraordinary thing happened to me a great many\nyears ago, and I used to tell it a number of times--a good many\ntimes--every year, for it was so wonderful that it always astonished the\nhearer, and that astonishment gave me a distinct pleasure every time. I\nnever suspected that that tale was acquiring any auxiliary advantages\nthrough repetition until one day after I had been telling it ten or\nfifteen years it struck me that either I was getting old, and slow in\ndelivery, or that the tale was longer than it was when it was born.\nMark, I diligently and prayerfully examined that tale with this result:\nthat I found that its proportions were now, as nearly as I could make\noat, one part fact, straight fact, fact pure and undiluted, golden fact,\nand twenty-four parts embroidery. I never told that tale afterwards--I\nwas never able to tell it again, for I had lost confidence in it, and so\nthe pleasure of telling it was gone, and gone permanently. How much of\nthis tale of yours is embroidery?\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I don't know. I don't think any of it is embroidery. I\nthink it is all just as I have stated it, detail by detail.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" he said, \"then it is all right, but I wouldn't tell it any\nmore; because if you keep on, it will begin to collect embroidery sure.\nThe safest thing is to stop now.\"\n\nThat was a great many years ago. And to-day is the first time that I\nhave told that dream since Dr. Burton scared me into fatal doubts about\nit. No, I don't believe I can say that. I don't believe that I ever\nreally had any doubts whatever concerning the salient points of the\ndream, for those points are of such a nature that they are _pictures_,\nand pictures can be remembered, when they are vivid, much better than\none can remember remarks and unconcreted facts. Although it has been so\nmany years since I have told that dream, I can see those pictures now\njust as clearly defined as if they were before me in this room. I have\nnot told the entire dream. There was a good deal more of it. I mean I\nhave not told all that happened in the dream's fulfilment. After the\nincident in the death-room I may mention one detail, and that is this.\nWhen I arrived in St. Louis with the casket it was about eight o'clock\nin the morning, and I ran to my brother-in-law's place of business,\nhoping to find him there, but I missed him, for while I was on the way\nto his office he was on his way from the house to the boat. When I got\nback to the boat the casket was gone. He had conveyed it out to his\nhouse. I hastened thither, and when I arrived the men were just removing\nthe casket from the vehicle to carry it up-stairs. I stopped that\nprocedure, for I did not want my mother to see the dead face, because\none side of it was drawn and distorted by the effects of the opium. When\nI went up-stairs, there stood the two chairs--placed to receive the\ncoffin--just as I had seen them in my dream; and if I had arrived two or\nthree minutes later, the casket would have been resting upon them,\nprecisely as in my dream of several weeks before.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[8] See \"Old Times on the Mississippi.\"\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCXIV.\n\nMAY 3, 1907.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XVII.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n_From Susy's Biography of Me._\n\n\n     _Sept. 9, '85._--Mamma is teaching Jean a little natural history\n     and is making a little collection of insects for her. But mamma\n     does not allow Jean to kill any insects she only collects those\n     insects that are found dead. Mamma has told us all, perticularly\n     Jean, to bring her all the little dead insects that she finds. The\n     other day as we were all sitting at supper Jean broke into the room\n     and ran triumfantly up to Mamma and presented her with a plate full\n     of dead flies. Mamma thanked Jean vary enthusiastically although\n     she with difficulty concealed her amusement. Just then Soar Mash\n     entered the room and Jean believing her hungry asked Mamma for\n     permission to give her the flies. Mamma laughingly consented and\n     the flies almost immediately dissapeared.\n\n\n[_Monday, October 15, 1906._] Sour Hash's presence indicates that this\nadventure occurred at Quarry Farm. Susy's Biography interests itself\npretty exclusively with historical facts; where they happen is not a\nmatter of much concern to her. When other historians refer to the Bunker\nHill Monument they know it is not necessary to mention that that\nmonument is in Boston. Susy recognizes that when she mentions Sour Mash\nit is not necessary to localize her. To Susy, Sour Mash is the Bunker\nHill Monument of Quarry Farm.\n\nOrdinary cats have some partiality for living flies, but none for dead\nones; but Susy does not trouble herself to apologize for Sour Mash's\neccentricities of taste. This Biography was for _us_, and Susy knew that\nnothing that Sour Mash might do could startle us or need explanation, we\nbeing aware that she was not an ordinary cat, but moving upon a plane\nfar above the prejudices and superstitions which are law to common\ncatdom.\n\nOnce in Hartford the flies were so numerous for a time, and so\ntroublesome, that Mrs. Clemens conceived the idea of paying George[9] a\nbounty on all the flies he might kill. The children saw an opportunity\nhere for the acquisition of sudden wealth. They supposed that their\nmother merely wanted to accumulate dead flies, for some \u00e6sthetic or\nscientific reason or other, and they judged that the more flies she\ncould get the happier she would be; so they went into business with\nGeorge on a commission. Straightway the dead flies began to arrive in\nsuch quantities that Mrs. Clemens was pleased beyond words with the\nsuccess of her idea. Next, she was astonished that one house could\nfurnish so many. She was paying an extravagantly high bounty, and it\npresently began to look as if by this addition to our expenses we were\nnow probably living beyond our income. After a few days there was peace\nand comfort; not a fly was discoverable in the house: there wasn't a\nstraggler left. Still, to Mrs. Clement's surprise, the dead flies\ncontinued to arrive by the plateful, and the bounty expense was as\ncrushing as ever. Then she made inquiry, and found that our innocent\nlittle rascals had established a Fly Trust, and had hired all the\nchildren in the neighborhood to collect flies on a cheap and\nunburdensome commission.\n\nMrs. Clemens's experience in this matter was a new one for her, but the\ngovernments of the world had tried it, and wept over it, and discarded\nit, every half-century since man was created. Any Government could have\ntold her that the best way to increase wolves in America, rabbits in\nAustralia, and snakes in India, is to pay a bounty on their scalps. Then\nevery patriot goes to raising them.\n\n_From Susy's Biography of Me._\n\n\n     _Sept. 10, '85._--The other evening Clara and I brought down our\n     new soap bubble water and we all blew soap bubles. Papa blew his\n     soap bubles and filled them with tobacco smoke and as the light\n     shone on then they took very beautiful opaline colors. Papa would\n     hold them and then let us catch them in our hand and they felt\n     delightful to the touch the mixture of the smoke and water had a\n     singularly pleasant effect.\n\n\nIt is human life. We are blown upon the world; we float buoyantly upon\nthe summer air a little while, complacently showing off our grace of\nform and our dainty iridescent colors; then we vanish with a little\npuff, leaving nothing behind but a memory--and sometimes not even that.\nI suppose that at those solemn times when we wake in the deeps of the\nnight and reflect, there is not one of us who is not willing to confess\nthat he is really only a soap-bubble, and as little worth the making.\n\nI remember those days of twenty-one years ago, and a certain pathos\nclings about them. Susy, with her manifold young charms and her\niridescent mind, was as lovely a bubble as any we made that day--and as\ntransitory. She passed, as they passed, in her youth and beauty, and\nnothing of her is left but a heartbreak and a memory. That long-vanished\nday came vividly back to me a few weeks ago when, for the first time in\ntwenty-one years, I found myself again amusing a child with\nsmoke-charged soap-bubbles.\n\n[Sidenote: (1885.)]\n\nSusy's next date is November 29th, 1885, the eve of my fiftieth\nbirthday. It seems a good while ago. I must have been rather young for\nmy age then, for I was trying to tame an old-fashioned bicycle nine feet\nhigh. It is to me almost unbelievable, at my present stage of life, that\nthere have really been people willing to trust themselves upon a dizzy\nand unstable altitude like that, and that I was one of them. Twichell\nand I took lessons every day. He succeeded, and became a master of the\nart of riding that wild vehicle, but I had no gift in that direction and\nwas never able to stay on mine long enough to get any satisfactory view\nof the planet. Every time I tried to steal a look at a pretty girl, or\nany other kind of scenery, that single moment of inattention gave the\nbicycle the chance it had been waiting for, and I went over the front of\nit and struck the ground on my head or my back before I had time to\nrealise that something was happening. I didn't always go over the front\nway; I had other ways, and practised them all; but no matter which way\nwas chosen for me there was always one monotonous result--the bicycle\nskinned my leg and leaped up into the air and came down on top of me.\nSometimes its wires were so sprung by this violent performance that it\nhad the collapsed look of an umbrella that had had a misunderstanding\nwith a cyclone. After each day's practice I arrived at home with my skin\nhanging in ribbons, from my knees down. I plastered the ribbons on where\nthey belonged, and bound them there with handkerchiefs steeped in Pond's\nExtract, and was ready for more adventures next day. It was always a\nsurprise to me that I had so much skin, and that it held out so well.\nThere was always plenty, and I soon came to understand that the supply\nwas going to remain sufficient for all my needs. It turned out that I\nhad nine skins, in layers, one on top of the other like the leaves of a\nbook, and some of the doctors said it was quite remarkable.\n\nI was full of enthusiasm over this insane amusement. My teacher was a\nyoung German from the bicycle factory, a gentle, kindly, patient\ncreature, with a pathetically grave face. He never smiled; he never made\na remark; he always gathered me tenderly up when I plunged off, and\nhelped me on again without a word. When he had been teaching me twice a\nday for three weeks I introduced a new gymnastic--one that he had never\nseen before--and so at last a compliment was wrung from him, a thing\nwhich I had been risking my life for days to achieve. He gathered me up\nand said mournfully: \"Mr. Clemens, you can fall off a bicycle in more\ndifferent ways than any person I ever saw before.\"\n\n[Sidenote: (1849.)]\n\nA boy's life is not all comedy; much of the tragic enters into it. The\ndrunken tramp--mentioned in \"Tom Sawyer\" or \"Huck Finn\"--who was burned\nup in the village jail, lay upon my conscience a hundred nights\nafterward and filled them with hideous dreams--dreams in which I saw his\nappealing face as I had seen it in the pathetic reality, pressed against\nthe window-bars, with the red hell glowing behind him--a face which\nseemed to say to me, \"If you had not give me the matches, this would not\nhave happened; you are responsible for my death.\" I was _not_\nresponsible for it, for I had meant him no harm, but only good, when I\nlet him have the matches; but no matter, mine was a trained Presbyterian\nconscience, and knew but the one duty--to hunt and harry its slave upon\nall pretexts and on all occasions; particularly when there was no sense\nor reason in it. The tramp--who was to blame--suffered ten minutes; I,\nwho was not to blame, suffered three months.\n\nThe shooting down of poor old Smarr in the main street[10] at noonday\nsupplied me with some more dreams; and in them I always saw again the\ngrotesque closing picture--the great family Bible spread open on the\nprofane old man's breast by some thoughtful idiot, and rising and\nsinking to the labored breathings, and adding the torture of its leaden\nweight to the dying struggles. We are curiously made. In all the throng\nof gaping and sympathetic onlookers there was not one with common sense\nenough to perceive that an anvil would have been in better taste there\nthan the Bible, less open to sarcastic criticism, and swifter in its\natrocious work. In my nightmares I gasped and struggled for breath under\nthe crush of that vast book for many a night.\n\nAll within the space of a couple of years we had two or three other\ntragedies, and I had the ill-luck to be too near by on each occasion.\nThere was the slave man who was struck down with a chunk of slag for\nsome small offence; I saw him die. And the young California emigrant who\nwas stabbed with a bowie knife by a drunken comrade: I saw the red life\ngush from his breast. And the case of the rowdy young Hyde brothers and\ntheir harmless old uncle: one of them held the old man down with his\nknees on his breast while the other one tried repeatedly to kill him\nwith an Allen revolver which wouldn't go off. I happened along just\nthen, of course.\n\nThen there was the case of the young California emigrant who got drunk\nand proposed to raid the \"Welshman's house\" all alone one dark and\nthreatening night.[11] This house stood half-way up Holliday's Hill\n(\"Cardiff\" Hill), and its sole occupants were a poor but quite\nrespectable widow and her young and blameless daughter. The invading\nruffian woke the whole village with his ribald yells and coarse\nchallenges and obscenities. I went up there with a comrade--John Briggs,\nI think--to look and listen. The figure of the man was dimly risible;\nthe women were on their porch, but not visible in the deep shadow of its\nroof, but we heard the elder woman's voice. She had loaded an old musket\nwith slugs, and she warned the man that if he stayed where he was while\nshe counted ten it would cost him his life. She began to count, slowly:\nhe began to laugh. He stopped laughing at \"six\"; then through the deep\nstillness, in a steady voice, followed the rest of the tale: \"seven ...\neight ... nine\"--a long pause, we holding our breath--\"ten!\" A red spout\nof flame gushed out into the night, and the man dropped, with his breast\nriddled to rags. Then the rain and the thunder burst loose and the\nwaiting town swarmed up the hill in the glare of the lightning like an\ninvasion of ants. Those people saw the rest; I had had my share and was\nsatisfied. I went home to dream, and was not disappointed.\n\nMy teaching and training enabled me to see deeper into these tragedies\nthan an ignorant person could have done. I knew what they were for. I\ntried to disguise it from myself, but down in the secret deeps of my\nheart I knew--and I _knew_ that I knew. They were inventions of\nProvidence to beguile me to a better life. It sounds curiously innocent\nand conceited, now, but to me there was nothing strange about it; it was\nquite in accordance with the thoughtful and judicious ways of Providence\nas I understood them. It would not have surprised me, nor even\nover-flattered me, if Providence had killed off that whole community in\ntrying to save an asset like me. Educated as I had been, it would have\nseemed just the thing, and well worth the expense. _Why_ Providence\nshould take such an anxious interest in such a property--that idea never\nentered my head, and there was no one in that simple hamlet who would\nhave dreamed of putting it there. For one thing, no one was equipped\nwith it.\n\nIt is quite true I took all the tragedies to myself; and tallied them\noff, in turn as they happened, saying to myself in each case, with a\nsigh, \"Another one gone--and on my account; this ought to bring me to\nrepentance; His patience will not always endure.\" And yet privately I\nbelieved it would. That is, I believed it in the daytime; but not in the\nnight. With the going down of the sun my faith failed, and the clammy\nfears gathered about my heart. It was then that I repented. Those were\nawful nights, nights of despair, nights charged with the bitterness of\ndeath. After each tragedy I recognized the warning and repented;\nrepented and begged; begged like a coward, begged like a dog; and not in\nthe interest of those poor people who had been extinguished for my sake,\nbut only in my own interest. It seems selfish, when I look back on it\nnow.\n\nMy repentances were very real, very earnest; and after each tragedy they\nhappened every night for a long time. But as a rule they could not stand\nthe daylight. They faded out and shredded away and disappeared in the\nglad splendor of the sun. They were the creatures of fear and darkness,\nand they could not live out of their own place. The day gave me cheer\nand peace, and at night I repented again. In all my boyhood life I am\nnot sure that I ever tried to lead a better life in the daytime--or\nwanted to. In my age I should never think of wishing to do such a thing.\nBut in my age, as in my youth, night brings me many a deep remorse. I\nrealize that from the cradle up I have been like the rest of the\nrace--never quite sane in the night. When \"Injun Joe\" died.[12] ... But\nnever mind: in another chapter I have already described what a raging\nhell of repentance I passed through then. I believe that for months I\nwas as pure as the driven snow. After dark.\n\nIt was back in those far-distant days--1848 or '9--that Jim Wolf came to\nus. He was from Shelbyville, a hamlet thirty or forty miles back in the\ncountry, and he brought all his native sweetnesses and gentlenesses and\nsimplicities with him. He was approaching seventeen, a grave and slender\nlad, trustful, honest, a creature to love and cling to. And he was\nincredibly bashful.\n\nIt is to this kind that untoward things happen. My sister gave a\n\"candy-pull\" on a winter's night. I was too young to be of the company,\nand Jim was too diffident. I was sent up to bed early, and Jim followed\nof his own motion. His room was in the new part of the house, and his\nwindow looked out on the roof of the L annex. That roof was six inches\ndeep in snow, and the snow had an ice-crust upon it which was as slick\nas glass. Out of the comb of the roof projected a short chimney, a\ncommon resort for sentimental cats on moonlight nights--and this was a\nmoonlight night. Down at the eaves, below the chimney, a canopy of dead\nvines spread away to some posts, making a cozy shelter, and after an\nhour or two the rollicking crowd of young ladies and gentlemen grouped\nthemselves in its shade, with their saucers of liquid and piping-hot\ncandy disposed about them on the frozen ground to cool. There was joyous\nchaffing and joking and laughter--peal upon peal of it.\n\nAbout this time a couple of old disreputable tom-cats got up on the\nchimney and started a heated argument about something; also about this\ntime I gave up trying to get to sleep, and went visiting to Jim's room.\nHe was awake and fuming about the cats and their intolerable yowling. I\nasked him, mockingly, why he didn't climb out and drive them away. He\nwas nettled, and said over-boldly that for two cents he _would_.\n\nIt was a rash remark, and was probably repented of before it was fairly\nout of his mouth. But it was too late--he was committed. I knew him; and\nI knew he would rather break his neck than back down, if I egged him on\njudiciously.\n\n\"Oh, of course you would! Who's doubting it?\"\n\nIt galled him, and he burst out, with sharp irritation--\n\n\"Maybe _you_ doubt it!\"\n\n\"I? Oh no, I shouldn't think of such a thing. You are always doing\nwonderful things. With your mouth.\"\n\nHe was in a passion, now. He snatched on his yarn socks and began to\nraise the window, saying in a voice unsteady with anger--\n\n\"_You_ think I dasn't--_you_ do! Think what you blame please--_I_ don't\ncare what you think. I'll show you!\"\n\nThe window made him rage; it wouldn't stay up. I said--\n\n\"Never mind, I'll hold it.\"\n\nIndeed, I would have done anything to help. I was only a boy, and was\nalready in a radiant heaven of anticipation. He climbed carefully out,\nclung to the window-sill until his feet were safely placed, then began\nto pick his perilous way on all fours along the glassy comb, a foot and\na hand on each side of it. I believe I enjoy it now as much as I did\nthen: yet it is a good deal over fifty years ago. The frosty breeze\nflapped his short shirt about his lean legs; the crystal roof shone like\npolished marble in the intense glory of the moon; the unconscious cats\nsat erect upon the chimney, alertly watching each other, lashing their\ntails and pouring out their hollow grievances; and slowly and\ncautiously Jim crept on, flapping as he went, the gay and frolicsome\nyoung creatures under the vine-canopy unaware, and outraging these\nsolemnities with their misplaced laughter. Every time Jim slipped I had\na hope; but always on he crept and disappointed it. At last he was\nwithin reaching distance. He paused, raised himself carefully up,\nmeasured his distance deliberately, then made a frantic grab at the\nnearest cat--and missed. Of course he lost his balance. His heels flew\nup, he struck on his back, and like a rocket he darted down the roof\nfeet first, crashed through the dead vines and landed in a sitting\nposture in fourteen saucers of red-hot candy, in the midst of all that\nparty--and dressed as _he_ was: this lad who could not look a girl in\nthe face with his clothes on. There was a wild scramble and a storm of\nshrieks, and Jim fled up the stairs, dripping broken crockery all the\nway.\n\n[Sidenote: (1867.)]\n\nThe incident was ended. But I was not done with it yet, though I\nsupposed I was. Eighteen or twenty years later I arrived in New York\nfrom California, and by that time I had failed in all my other\nundertakings and had stumbled into literature without intending it. This\nwas early in 1867. I was offered a large sum to write something for the\n\"Sunday Mercury,\" and I answered with the tale of \"Jim Wolf and the\nCats.\" I also collected the money for it--twenty-five dollars. It seemed\nover-pay, but I did not say anything about that, for I was not so\nscrupulous then as I am now.\n\nA year or two later \"Jim Wolf and the Cats\" appeared in a Tennessee\npaper in a new dress--as to spelling; spelling borrowed from Artemus\nWard. The appropriator of the tale had a wide reputation in the West,\nand was exceedingly popular. Deservedly so, I think. He wrote some of\nthe breeziest and funniest things I have ever read, and did his work\nwith distinguished ease and fluency. His name has passed out of my\nmemory.\n\nA couple of years went by; then the original story--my own\nversion--cropped up again and went floating around in the spelling, and\nwith my name to it. Soon first one paper and then another fell upon me\nrigorously for \"stealing\" Jim Wolf and the Cats from the Tennessee man.\nI got a merciless beating, but I did not mind it. It's all in the game.\nBesides, I had learned, a good while before that, that it is not wise to\nkeep the fire going under a slander unless you can get some large\nadvantage out of keeping it alive. Few slanders can stand the wear of\nsilence.\n\n[Sidenote: (1873.)]\n\n[Sidenote: (1900.)]\n\nBut I was not done with Jim and the Cats yet. In 1873 I was lecturing in\nLondon, in the Queen's Concert Rooms, Hanover Square, and was living at\nthe Langham Hotel, Portland place. I had no domestic household, and no\nofficial household except George Dolby, lecture-agent, and Charles\nWarren Stoddard, the California poet, now (1900) Professor of English\nLiterature in the Roman Catholic University, Washington. Ostensibly\nStoddard was my private secretary; in reality he was merely my\ncomrade--I hired him in order to have his company. As secretary there\nwas nothing for him to do except to scrap-book the daily reports of the\ngreat trial of the Tichborne Claimant for perjury. But he made a\nsufficient job out of that, for the reports filled six columns a day and\nhe usually postponed the scrap-booking until Sunday; then he had 36\ncolumns to cut out and paste in--a proper labor for Hercules. He did his\nwork well, but if he had been older and feebler it would have killed him\nonce a week. Without doubt he does his literary lectures well, but also\nwithout doubt he prepares them fifteen minutes before he is due on his\nplatform and thus gets into them a freshness and sparkle which they\nmight lack if they underwent the staling process of overstudy.\n\nHe was good company when he was awake. He was refined, sensitive,\ncharming, gentle, generous, honest himself and unsuspicious of other\npeople's honesty, and I think he was the purest male I have known, in\nmind and speech. George Dolby was something of a contrast to him, but\nthe two were very friendly and sociable together, nevertheless. Dolby\nwas large and ruddy, full of life and strength and spirits, a tireless\nand energetic talker, and always overflowing with good-nature and\nbursting with jollity. It was a choice and satisfactory menagerie, this\npensive poet and this gladsome gorilla. An indelicate story was a sharp\ndistress to Stoddard; Dolby told him twenty-five a day. Dolby always\ncame home with us after the lecture, and entertained Stoddard till\nmidnight. Me too. After he left, I walked the floor and talked, and\nStoddard went to sleep on the sofa. I hired him for company.\n\nDolby had been agent for concerts, and theatres, and Charles Dickens and\nall sorts of shows and \"attractions\" for many years; he had known the\nhuman being in many aspects, and he didn't much believe in him. But the\npoet did. The waifs and estrays found a friend in Stoddard: Dolby tried\nto persuade him that he was dispensing his charities unworthily, but he\nwas never able to succeed.\n\nOne night a young American got access to Stoddard at the Concert Rooms\nand told him a moving tale. He said he was living on the Surrey side,\nand for some strange reason his remittances had failed to arrive from\nhome; he had no money, he was out of employment, and friendless; his\ngirl-wife and his new baby were actually suffering for food; for the\nlove of heaven could he lend him a sovereign until his remittances\nshould resume? Stoddard was deeply touched, and gave him a sovereign on\nmy account. Dolby scoffed, but Stoddard stood his ground. Each told me\nhis story later in the evening, and I backed Stoddard's judgment. Dolby\nsaid we were women in disguise, and not a sane kind of women, either.\n\nThe next week the young man came again. His wife was ill with the\npleurisy, the baby had the bots, or something, I am not sure of the name\nof the disease; the doctor and the drugs had eaten up the money, the\npoor little family was starving. If Stoddard \"in the kindness of his\nheart could only spare him another sovereign,\" etc., etc. Stoddard was\nmuch moved, and spared him a sovereign for me. Dolby was outraged. He\nspoke up and said to the customer--\n\n\"Now, young man, you are going to the hotel with us and state your case\nto the other member of the family. If you don't make him believe in you\nI sha'n't honor this poet's drafts in your interest any longer, for I\ndon't believe in you myself.\"\n\nThe young man was quite willing. I found no fault in him. On the\ncontrary, I believed in him at once, and was solicitous to heal the\nwounds inflicted by Dolby's too frank incredulity; therefore I did\neverything I could think of to cheer him up and entertain him and make\nhim feel at home and comfortable. I spun many yarns; among others the\ntale of Jim Wolf and the Cats. Learning that he had done something in a\nsmall way in literature, I offered to try to find a market for him in\nthat line. His face lighted joyfully at that, and he said that if I\ncould only sell a small manuscript to Tom Hood's Annual for him it would\nbe the happiest event of his sad life and he would hold me in grateful\nremembrance always. That was a most pleasant night for three of us, but\nDolby was disgusted and sarcastic.\n\nNext week the baby died. Meantime I had spoken to Tom Hood and gained\nhis sympathy. The young man had sent his manuscript to him, and the very\nday the child died the money for the MS. came--three guineas. The young\nman came with a poor little strip of crape around his arm and thanked\nme, and said that nothing could have been more timely than that money,\nand that his poor little wife was grateful beyond words for the service\nI had rendered. He wept, and in fact Stoddard and I wept with him, which\nwas but natural. Also Dolby wept. At least he wiped his eyes and wrung\nout his handkerchief, and sobbed stertorously and made other exaggerated\nshows of grief. Stoddard and I were ashamed of Dolby, and tried to make\nthe young man understand that he meant no harm, it was only his way. The\nyoung man said sadly that he was not minding it, his grief was too deep\nfor other hurts; that he was only thinking of the funeral, and the heavy\nexpenses which--\n\nWe cut that short and told him not to trouble about it, leave it all to\nus; send the bills to Mr. Dolby and--\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dolby, with a mock tremor in his voice, \"send them to me,\nand I will pay them. What, are you going? You must not go alone in your\nworn and broken condition; Mr. Stoddard and I will go with you. Come,\nStoddard. We will comfort the bereaved mamma and get a lock of the\nbaby's hair.\"\n\nIt was shocking. We were ashamed of him again, and said so. But he was\nnot disturbed. He said--\n\n\"Oh, I know this kind, the woods are full of them. I'll make this offer:\nif he will show me his family I will give him twenty pounds. Come!\" The\nyoung man said he would not remain to be insulted; and he said\ngood-night and took his hat. But Dolby said he would go with him, and\nstay by him until he found the family. Stoddard went along to soothe the\nyoung man and modify Dolby. They drove across the river and all over\nSouthwark, but did not find the family. At last the young man confessed\nthere wasn't any.\n\nThe thing he sold to Tom Hood's Annual was \"Jim and the Cats.\" And he\ndid not put my name to it.\n\nSo that small tale was sold three times. I am selling it again, now. It\nis one of the best properties I have come across.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[9] The colored butler.\n\n[10] See \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\"\n\n[11] Used in \"Huck Finn,\" I think.\n\n[12] Used in \"Tom Sawyer.\"\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCXV.\n\nMAY 17, 1907.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XVIII.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n[_Dictated December 21, 1906._] I wish to insert here some pages of\nSusy's Biography of me in which the biographer does not scatter,\naccording to her custom, but sticks pretty steadily to a single subject\nuntil she has fought it to a finish:\n\n\n     _Feb. 27, '86._--Last summer while we were in Elmira an article\n     came out in the \"Christian Union\" by name \"What ought he to have\n     done\" treating of the government of children, or rather giving an\n     account of a fathers battle with his little baby boy, by the mother\n     of the child and put in the form of a question as to whether the\n     father disciplined the child corectly or not, different people\n     wrote their opinions of the fathers behavior, and told what they\n     thought he should have done. Mamma had long known how to disciplin\n     children, for in fact the bringing up of children had been one of\n     her specialties for many years. She had a great many theories, but\n     one of them was, that if a child was big enough to be nauty, it was\n     big enough to be whipped and here we all agreed with her. I\n     remember one morning when Dr. ---- came up to the farm he had a\n     long discussion with mamma, upon the following topic. Mamma gave\n     _this_ as illustrative of one important rule for punishing a child.\n     She said we will suppose the boy has thrown a handkerchief onto the\n     floor, I tell him to pick it up, he refuses. I tell him again, he\n     refuses. Then I say you must either pick up the handkerchief or\n     have a whipping. My theory is never to make a child have a whipping\n     and pick up the handkerchief too. I say \"If you do not pick it up,\n     I must punish you,\" if he doesn't he gets the whipping, but _I_\n     pick up the handkerchief, if he does he gets no punishment. I tell\n     him to do a thing if he disobeys me he is punished for so doing,\n     but not forced to obey me afterwards.\n\n     When Clara and I had been very nauty or were being very nauty, the\n     nurse would go and call Mamma and she would appear suddenly and\n     look at us (she had a way of looking at us when she was displeased\n     as if she could see right through us) till we were ready to sink\n     through the floor from embarasment, and total absence of knowing\n     what to say. This look was usually followed with \"Clara\" or \"Susy\n     what do you mean by this? do you want to come to the bath-room with\n     me?\" Then followed the climax for Clara and I both new only too\n     well what going to the bath-room meant.\n\n     But mamma's first and foremost object was to make the child\n     understand that he is being punished for _his_ sake, and because\n     the mother so loves him that she cannot allow him to do wrong; also\n     that it is as hard for her to punish him as for him to be punished\n     and even harder. Mamma never allowed herself to punish us when she\n     was angry with us she never struck us because she was enoyed at us\n     and felt like striking us if we had been nauty and had enoyed her,\n     so that she thought she felt or would show the least bit of temper\n     toward us while punnishing us, she always postponed the punishment\n     until _she_ was no more chafed by our behavior. She never humored\n     herself by striking or punishing us because or while she was the\n     least bit enoyed with us.\n\n     Our very worst nautinesses were punished by being taken to the\n     bath-room and being whipped by the paper cutter. But after the\n     whipping was over, mamma did not allow us to leave her until we\n     were perfectly happy, and perfectly understood why we had been\n     whipped. I never remember having felt the least bit bitterly toward\n     mamma for punishing me. I always felt I had deserved my punishment,\n     and was much happier for having received it. For after mamma had\n     punished us and shown her displeasure, she showed no signs of\n     further displeasure, but acted as if we had not displeased her in\n     any way.\n\n\nOrdinary punishments answered very well for Susy. She was a thinker, and\nwould reason out the purpose of them, apply the lesson, and achieve the\nreform required. But it was much less easy to devise punishments that\nwould reform Clara. This was because she was a philosopher who was\nalways turning her attention to finding something good and satisfactory\nand entertaining in everything that came her way; consequently it was\nsometimes pretty discouraging to the troubled mother to find that after\nall her pains and thought in inventing what she meant to be a severe and\nreform-compelling punishment, the child had entirely missed the\nseverities through her native disposition to get interest and pleasure\nout of them as novelties. The mother, in her anxiety to find a penalty\nthat would take sharp hold and do its work effectively, at last\nresorted, with a sore heart, and with a reproachful conscience, to that\npunishment which the incorrigible criminal in the penitentiary dreads\nabove all the other punitive miseries which the warden inflicts upon him\nfor his good--solitary confinement in the dark chamber. The grieved and\nworried mother shut Clara up in a very small clothes-closet and went\naway and left her there--for fifteen minutes--it was all that the\nmother-heart could endure. Then she came softly back and\nlistened--listened for the sobs, but there weren't any; there were\nmuffled and inarticulate sounds, but they could not be construed into\nsobs. The mother waited half an hour longer; by that time she was\nsuffering so intensely with sorrow and compassion for the little\nprisoner that she was not able to wait any longer for the distressed\nsounds which she had counted upon to inform her when there had been\npunishment enough and the reform accomplished. She opened the closet to\nset the prisoner free and take her back into her loving favor and\nforgiveness, but the result was not the one expected. The captive had\nmanufactured a fairy cavern out of the closet, and friendly fairies out\nof the clothes hanging from the hooks, and was having a most sinful and\nunrepentant good time, and requested permission to spend the rest of the\nday there!\n\n_From Susy's Biography of Me._\n\n\n     But Mamma's oppinions and ideas upon the subject of bringing up\n     children has always been more or less of a joke in our family,\n     perticularly since Papa's article in the \"Christian Union,\" and I\n     am sure Clara and I have related the history of our old family\n     paper-cutter, our punishments and privations with rather more pride\n     and triumph than any other sentiment, because of Mamma's way of\n     rearing us.\n\n     When the article \"What ought he to have done?\" came out Mamma read\n     it, and was very much interested in it. And when papa heard that\n     she had read it he went to work and secretly wrote his opinion of\n     what the father ought to have done. He told Aunt Susy, Clara and I,\n     about it but mamma was not to see it or hear any thing about it\n     till it came out. He gave it to Aunt Susy to read, and after Clara\n     and I had gone up to get ready for bed he brought it up for us to\n     read. He told what he thought the father ought to have done by\n     telling what mamma would have done. The article was a beautiful\n     tribute to mamma and every word in it true. But still in writing\n     about mamma he partly forgot that the article was going to be\n     published, I think, and expressed himself more fully than he would\n     do the second time he wrote it; I think the article has done and\n     will do a great deal of good, and I think it would have been\n     perfect for the family and friend's enjoyment, but a little bit too\n     private to have been published as it was. And Papa felt so too,\n     because the very next day or a few days after, he went down to New\n     York to see if he couldn't get it back before it was published but\n     it was too late, and he had to return without it. When the\n     Christian Union reached the farm and papa's article in it all ready\n     and waiting to be read to mamma papa hadn't the courage to show it\n     to her (for he knew she wouldn't like it at all) at first, and he\n     didn't but he might have let it go and never let her see it, but\n     finally he gave his consent to her seeing it, and told Clara and I\n     we could take it to her, which we did, with tardiness, and we all\n     stood around mamma while she read it, all wondering what she would\n     say and think about it.\n\n     She was too much surprised, (and pleased privately, too) to say\n     much at first, but as we all expected publicly, (or rather when she\n     remembered that this article was to be read by every one that took\n     the Christian Union) she was rather shocked and a little\n     displeased.\n\n     Clara and I had great fun the night papa gave it to us to read and\n     then hide, so mamma couldn't see it, for just as we were in the\n     midst of reading it mamma appeared, papa following anxiously and\n     asked why we were not in bed? then a scuffle ensued for we told her\n     it was a secret and tried to hide it; but she chased us wherever we\n     went, till she thought it was time for us to go to bed, then she\n     surendered and left us to tuck it under Clara's matress.\n\n     A little while after the article was published letters began to\n     come in to papa crittisizing it, there were some very pleasant ones\n     but a few very disagreable. One of these, the very worst, mamma got\n     hold of and read, to papa's great regret, it was full of the most\n     disagreble things, and so very enoying to papa that he for a time\n     felt he must do something to show the author of it his great\n     displeasure at being so insulted. But he finally decided not to,\n     because he felt the man had some cause for feeling enoyed at, for\n     papa had spoken of him, (he was the baby's father) rather\n     slightingly in his Christian Union Article.\n\n     After all this, papa and mamma both wished I think they might never\n     hear or be spoken to on the subject of the Christian Union article,\n     and whenever any has spoken to me and told me \"How much they did\n     enjoy my father's article in the Christian Union\" I almost laughed\n     in their faces when I remembered what a great variety of oppinions\n     had been expressed upon the subject of the Christian Union article\n     of papa's.\n\n     The article was written in July or August and just the other day\n     papa received quite a bright letter from a gentleman who has read\n     the C. U. article and gave his opinion of it in these words.\n\n\nIt is missing. She probably put the letter between the leaves of the\nBiography and it got lost out. She threw away the hostile letters, but\ntried to keep the pleasantest one for her book; surely there has been no\nkindlier biographer than this one. Yet to a quite creditable degree she\nis loyal to the responsibilities of her position as historian--not\neulogist--and honorably gives me a quiet prod now and then. But how\nmany, many, many she has withheld that I deserved! I could prize them\nnow; there would be no acid in her words, and it is loss to me that she\ndid not set them all down. Oh, Susy, you sweet little biographer, you\nbreak my old heart with your gentle charities!\n\nI think a great deal of her work. Her canvases are on their easels, and\nher brush flies about in a care-free and random way, delivering a dash\nhere, a dash there and another yonder, and one might suppose that there\nwould be no definite result; on the contrary I think that an intelligent\nreader of her little book must find that by the time he has finished it\nhe has somehow accumulated a pretty clear and nicely shaded idea of the\nseveral members of this family--including Susy herself--and that the\nrandom dashes on the canvases have developed into portraits. I feel that\nmy own portrait, with some of the defects fined down and others left\nout, is here; and I am sure that any who knew the mother will recognize\nher without difficulty, and will say that the lines are drawn with a\njust judgment and a sure hand. Little creature though Susy was, the\npenetration which was born in her finds its way to the surface more than\nonce in these pages.\n\nBefore Susy began the Biography she let fall a remark now and then\nconcerning my character which showed that she had it under observation.\nIn the Record which we kept of the children's sayings there is an\ninstance of this. She was twelve years old at the time. We had\nestablished a rule that each member of the family must bring a fact to\nbreakfast--a fact drawn from a book or from any other source; any fact\nwould answer. Susy's first contribution was in substance as follows. Two\ngreat exiles and former opponents in war met in Ephesus--Scipio and\nHannibal. Scipio asked Hannibal to name the greatest general the world\nhad produced.\n\n\"Alexander\"--and he explained why.\n\n\"And the next greatest?\"\n\n\"Pyrrhus\"--and he explained why.\n\n\"But where do you place yourself, then?\"\n\n\"If I had conquered you I would place myself before the others.\"\n\nSusy's grave comment was--\n\n\"That _attracted_ me, it was just like papa--he is so frank about his\nbooks.\"\n\nSo frank in admiring them, she meant.\n\n\n[_Thursday, March 28, 1907._] Some months ago I commented upon a chapter\nof Susy's Biography wherein she very elaborately discussed an article\nabout the training and disciplining of children, which I had published\nin the \"Christian Union\" (this was twenty-one years ago), an article\nwhich was full of worshipful praises of Mrs. Clemens as a mother, and\nwhich little Clara, and Susy, and I had been hiding from this lovely and\nadmirable mother because we knew she would disapprove of public and\nprinted praises of herself. At the time that I was dictating these\ncomments, several months ago, I was trying to call back to my memory\nsome of the details of that article, but I was not able to do it, and I\nwished I had a copy of the article so that I could see what there was\nabout it which gave it such large interest for Susy.\n\nYesterday afternoon I elected to walk home from the luncheon at the St.\nRegis, which is in 56th Street and Fifth Avenue, for it was a fine\nspring day and I hadn't had a walk for a year or two, and felt the need\nof exercise. As I walked along down Fifth Avenue the desire to see that\n\"Christian Union\" article came into my head again. I had just reached\nthe corner of 42nd Street then, and there was the usual jam of wagons,\ncarriages, and automobiles there. I stopped to let it thin out before\ntrying to cross the street, but a stranger, who didn't require as much\nroom as I do, came racing by and darted into a crack among the vehicles\nand made the crossing. But on his way past me he thrust a couple of\nancient newspaper clippings into my hand, and said,\n\n\"There, you don't know me, but I have saved them in my scrap-book for\ntwenty years, and it occurred to me this morning that perhaps you would\nlike to see them, so I was carrying them down-town to mail them, I not\nexpecting to run across you in this accidental way, of course; but I\nwill give them into your own hands now. Good-by!\"--and he disappeared\namong the wagons.\n\nThose scraps which he had put into my hand were ancient newspaper copies\nof that \"Christian Union\" article! It is a handsome instance of mental\ntelegraphy--or if it isn't that, it is a handsome case of coincidence.\n\n_From the Biography._\n\n\n     _March 14th, '86._--Mr. Laurence Barrette and Mr. and Mrs. Hutton\n     were here a little while ago, and we had a very interesting visit\n     from them. Papa said Mr. Barette never had acted so well before\n     when he had seen him, as he did the first night he was staying with\n     us. And Mrs. ---- said she never had seen an actor on the stage,\n     whom she more wanted to speak with.\n\n     Papa has been very much interested of late, in the \"Mind Cure\"\n     theory. And in fact so have we all. A young lady in town has worked\n     wonders by using the \"Mind Cure\" upon people; she is constantly\n     busy now curing peoples deseases in this way--and curing her own\n     even, which to me seems the most remarkable of all.\n\n     A little while past, papa was delighted with the knowledge of what\n     he thought the best way of curing a cold, which was by starving it.\n     This starving did work beautifully, and freed him from a great many\n     severe colds. Now he says it wasn't the starving that helped his\n     colds, but the trust in the starving, the mind cure connected with\n     the starving.\n\n     I shouldn't wonder if we finally became firm believers in Mind\n     Cure. The next time papa has a cold, I haven't a doubt, he will\n     send for Miss H---- the young lady who is doctoring in the \"Mind\n     Cure\" theory, to cure him of it.\n\n     Mamma was over at Mrs. George Warners to lunch the other day, and\n     Miss H---- was there too. Mamma asked if anything as natural as\n     near sightedness could be cured she said oh yes just as well as\n     other deseases.\n\n     When mamma came home, she took me into her room, and told me that\n     perhaps my near-sightedness could be cured by the \"Mind Cure\" and\n     that she was going to have me try the treatment any way, there\n     could be no harm in it, and there might be great good. If her plan\n     succeeds there certainly will be a great deal in \"Mind Cure\" to my\n     oppinion, for I am very near sighted and so is mamma, and I never\n     expected there could be any more cure for it than for blindness,\n     but now I dont know but what theres a cure for _that_.\n\n\nIt was a disappointment; her near-sightedness remained with her to the\nend. She was born with it, no doubt; yet, strangely enough, she must\nhave been four years old, and possibly five, before we knew of its\nexistence. It is not easy to understand how that could have happened. I\ndiscovered the defect by accident. I was half-way up the hall stairs one\nday at home, and was leading her by the hand, when I glanced back\nthrough the open door of the dining-room and saw what I thought she\nwould recognise as a pretty picture. It was \"Stray Kit,\" the slender,\nthe graceful, the sociable, the beautiful, the incomparable, the cat of\ncats, the tortoise-shell, curled up as round as a wheel and sound asleep\non the fire-red cover of the dining-table, with a brilliant stream of\nsunlight falling across her. I exclaimed about it, but Susy said she\ncould see nothing there, neither cat nor table-cloth. The distance was\nso slight--not more than twenty feet, perhaps--that if it had been any\nother child I should not have credited the statement.\n\n_From the Biography._\n\n\n     _March 14th, '86._--Clara sprained her ankle, a little while ago,\n     by running into a tree, when coasting, and while she was unable to\n     walk with it she played solotaire with cards a great deal. While\n     Clara was sick and papa saw her play solotaire so much, he got very\n     much interested in the game, and finally began to play it himself a\n     little, then Jean took it up, and at last _mamma_, even played it\n     ocasionally; Jean's and papa's love for it rapidly increased, and\n     now Jean brings the cards every night to the table and papa and\n     mamma help her play, and before dinner is at an end, papa has\n     gotten a separate pack of cards, and is playing alone, with great\n     interest. Mamma and Clara next are made subject to the contagious\n     solatair, and there are four solotaireans at the table; while you\n     hear nothing but \"Fill up the place\" etc. It is dreadful! after\n     supper Clara goes into the library, and gets a little red mahogany\n     table, and placing it under the gas fixture seats herself and\n     begins to play again, then papa follows with another table of the\n     same discription, and they play solatair till bedtime.\n\n     We have just had our Prince and Pauper pictures taken; two groups\n     and some little single ones. The groups (the Interview and Lady\n     Jane Grey scene) were pretty good, the lady Jane scene was perfect,\n     just as pretty as it could be, the Interview was not so good; and\n     two of the little single pictures were very good indeed, but one\n     was very bad. Yet on the whole we think they were a success.\n\n     Papa has done a great deal in his life I think, that is good, and\n     very remarkable, but I think if he had had the advantages with\n     which he could have developed the gifts which he has made no use of\n     in writing his books, or in any other way for other peoples\n     pleasure and benefit outside of his own family and intimate\n     friends, he could have done _more_ than he has and a great deal\n     more even. He is known to the public as a humorist, but he has much\n     more in him that is earnest than that is humorous. He has a keen\n     sense of the ludicrous, notices funny stories and incidents knows\n     how to tell them, to improve upon them, and does not forget them.\n     He has been through a great many of the funny adventures related in\n     \"Tom Sawyer\" and in \"Huckleberry Finn,\" _himself_ and he lived among\n     just such boys, and in just such villages all the days of his early\n     life. His \"Prince and Pauper\" is his most orriginal, and best\n     production; it shows the most of any of his books what kind of\n     pictures are in his mind, usually. Not that the pictures of England\n     in the 16th Century and the adventures of a little prince and\n     pauper are the kind of things he mainly thinks about; but that\n     _that_ book, and those pictures represent the train of thought and\n     imagination he would be likely to be thinking of to-day, to-morrow,\n     or next day, more nearly than those given in \"Tom Sawyer\" or\n     \"Huckleberry Finn.\"[13]\n\n     Papa can make exceedingly bright jokes, and he enjoys funny things,\n     and when he is with people he jokes and laughs a great deal, but\n     still he is more interested in earnest books and earnest subjects\n     to talk upon, than in humorous ones.[14]\n\n     When we are all alone at home, nine times out of ten, he talks\n     about some very earnest subjects, (with an ocasional joke thrown\n     in) and he a good deal more often talks upon such subjects than\n     upon the other kind.\n\n     He is as much of a Pholosopher as anything I think. I think he\n     could have done a great deal in this direction if he had studied\n     while young, for he seems to enjoy reasoning out things, no matter\n     what; in a great many such directions he has greater ability than\n     in the gifts which have made him famous.\n\n\nThus at fourteen she had made up her mind about me, and in no timorous\nor uncertain terms had set down her reasons for her opinion. Fifteen\nyears were to pass before any other critic--except Mr. Howells, I\nthink--was to reutter that daring opinion and print it. Right or wrong,\nit was a brave position for that little analyser to take. She never\nwithdrew it afterward, nor modified it. She has spoken of herself as\nlacking physical courage, and has evinced her admiration of Clara's; but\nshe had moral courage, which is the rarest of human qualities, and she\nkept it functionable by exercising it. I think that in questions of\nmorals and politics she was usually on my side; but when she was not\nshe had her reasons and maintained her ground. Two years after she\npassed out of my life I wrote a Philosophy. Of the three persons who\nhave seen the manuscript only one understood it, and all three condemned\nit. If she could have read it, she also would have condemned it,\npossibly,--probably, in fact--but she would have understood it. It would\nhave had no difficulties for her on that score; also she would have\nfound a tireless pleasure in analyzing and discussing its problems.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[13] It is so yet--M.

One of them was \"on his knees\" honys-sneeze. There were a\n     good many other funny ones, all of which I dont remember. Mr. Grant\n     was very pleasant, and began playing the charades in the most\n     delightful way.\n\n\nSusy's spelling has defeated me, this time. I cannot make out what\n\"honys-sneeze\" stands for. Impromptu charades were almost a nightly\npastime of ours, from the children's earliest days--they played in them\nwith me when they were only five or six years old. As they increased in\nyears and practice their love for the sport almost amounted to a\npassion, and they acted their parts with a steadily increasing ability.\nAt first they required much drilling; but later they were generally\nready as soon as the parts were assigned, and they acted them according\nto their own devices. Their stage facility and absence of constraint and\nself-consciousness in the \"Prince and Pauper\" was a result of their\ncharading practice.\n\nAt ten and twelve Susy wrote plays, and she and Daisy Warner and Clara\nplayed them in the library or up-stairs in the school-room, with only\nthemselves and the servants for audience. They were of a tragic and\ntremendous sort, and were performed with great energy and earnestness.\nThey were dramatized (freely) from English history, and in them Mary\nQueen of Scots and Elizabeth had few holidays. The clothes were borrowed\nfrom the mother's wardrobe and the gowns were longer than necessary, but\nthat was not regarded as a defect. In one of these plays Jean (three\nyears old, perhaps) was Sir Francis Bacon. She was not dressed for the\npart, and did not have to say anything, but sat silent and decorous at a\ntiny table and was kept busy signing death-warrants. It was a really\nimportant office, for few entered those plays and got out of them alive.\n\n\n     _March 26._--Mamma and Papa have been in New York for two or three\n     days, and Miss Corey has been staying with us. They are coming home\n     to-day at two o'clock.\n\n     Papa has just begun to play chess, and he is very fond of it, so he\n     has engaged to play with Mrs. Charles Warner every morning from 10\n     to 12, he came down to supper last night, full of this pleasant\n     prospect, but evidently with something on his mind. Finally he said\n     to mamma in an appologetical tone, Susy Warner and I have a plan.\n\n     \"Well\" mamma said \"what now, I wonder?\"\n\n     Papa said that Susy Warner and he were going to name the chess\n     after some of the old bible heroes, and then play chess on Sunday.\n\n\n     _April 18, '86._--Mamma and papa Clara and Daisy have gone to New\n     York to see the \"Mikado.\" They are coming home to-night at half\n     past seven.\n\n     Last winter when Mr. Cable was lecturing with papa, he wrote this\n     letter to him just before he came to visit us.\n\n\n     DEAR UNCLE,--That's one nice thing about me, I never bother any\n     one, to offer me a good thing twice. You dont ask me to stay over\n     Sunday, but then you dont ask me to leave Saturday night, and\n     knowing the nobility of your nature as I do--thank you, I'll stay\n     till Monday morning.[15]\n\n                   Your's and the dear familie's\n                                              GEORGE W. CABLE.\n\n\n[_December 22, 1906._] It seems a prodigious while ago! Two or three\nnights ago I dined at a friend's house with a score of other men, and at\nmy side was Cable--actually almost an old man, really almost an old man,\nthat once so young chap! 62 years old, frost on his head, seven\ngrandchildren in stock, and a brand-new wife to re-begin life with!\n\n[_Dictated Nov. 19, 1906._]\n\n\n     Ever since papa and mamma were married, papa has written his books\n     and then taken them to mamma in manuscript and she has expergated\n     them. Papa read \"Huckleberry Finn\" to us in manuscript just before\n     it came out, and then he would leave parts of it with mamma to\n     expergate, while he went off up to the study to work, and sometimes\n     Clara and I would be sitting with mamma while she was looking the\n     manuscript over, and I remember so well, with what pangs of regret\n     we used to see her turn down the leaves of the pages, which meant\n     that some delightfully dreadful part must be scratched out. And I\n     remember one part pertickularly which was perfectly fascinating it\n     was dreadful, that Clara and I used to delight in, and oh with what\n     dispair we saw mamma turn down the leaf on which it was written, we\n     thought the book would be almost ruined without it. But we\n     gradually came to feel as mamma did.\n\n\nIt would be a pity to replace the vivacity and quaintness and felicity\nof Susy's innocent free spelling with the dull and petrified\nuniformities of the spelling-book. Nearly all the grimness it taken out\nof the \"expergating\" of my books by the subtle mollification\naccidentally infused into the word by Susy's modification of the\nspelling of it.\n\nI remember the special case mentioned by Susy, and can see the group\nyet--two-thirds of it pleading for the life of the culprit sentence that\nwas so fascinatingly dreadful and the other third of it patiently\nexplaining why the court could not grant the prayer of the pleaders; but\nI do not remember what the condemned phrase was. It had much company,\nand they all went to the gallows; but it is possible that that specially\ndreadful one which gave those little people so much delight was\ncunningly devised and put into the book for just that function, and not\nwith any hope or expectation that it would get by the \"exper-gator\"\nalive. It is possible, for I had that custom.\n\nSusy's quaint and effective spelling falls quite opportunely into\nto-day's atmosphere, which is heavy with the rumblings and grumblings\nand mutterings of the Simplified Spelling Reform. Andrew Carnegie\nstarted this storm, a couple of years ago, by moving a simplifying of\nEnglish orthography, and establishing a fund for the prosecution and\nmaintenance of the crusade. He began gently. He addressed a circular to\nsome hundreds of his friends, asking them to simplify the spelling of a\ndozen of our badly spelt words--I think they were only words which end\nwith the superfluous _ugh_. He asked that these friends use the\nsuggested spellings in their private correspondence.\n\nBy this, one perceives that the beginning was sufficiently quiet and\nunaggressive.\n\nNext stage: a small committee was appointed, with Brander Matthews for\nmanaging director and spokesman. It issued a list of three hundred\nwords, of average silliness as to spelling, and proposed new and sane\nspellings for these words. The President of the United States,\nunsolicited, adopted these simplified three hundred officially, and\nordered that they be used in the official documents of the Government.\nIt was now remarked, by all the educated and the thoughtful except the\nclergy that Sheol was to pay. This was most justly and comprehensively\ndescriptive. The indignant British lion rose, with a roar that was heard\nacross the Atlantic, and stood there on his little isle, gazing,\nred-eyed, out over the glooming seas, snow-flecked with driving\nspindrift, and lathing his tail--a most scary spectacle to see.\n\nThe lion was outraged because we, a nation of children, without any\ngrown-up people among us, with no property in the language, but using it\nmerely by courtesy of its owner the English nation, were trying to\ndefile the sacredness of it by removing from it peculiarities which had\nbeen its ornament and which had made it holy and beautiful for ages.\n\nIn truth there is a certain sardonic propriety in preserving our\northography, since ours is a mongrel language which started with a\nchild's vocabulary of three hundred words, and now consists of two\nhundred and twenty-five thousand; the whole lot, with the exception of\nthe original and legitimate three hundred, borrowed, stolen, smouched\nfrom every unwatched language under the sun, the spelling of each\nindividual word of the lot locating the source of the theft and\npreserving the memory of the revered crime.\n\nWhy is it that I have intruded into this turmoil and manifested a desire\nto get our orthography purged of its asininities? Indeed I do not know\nwhy I should manifest any interest in the matter, for at bottom I\ndisrespect our orthography most heartily, and as heartily disrespect\neverything that has been said by anybody in defence of it. Nothing\nprofessing to be a defence of our ludicrous spellings has had any basis,\nso far as my observation goes, except sentimentality. In these\n\"arguments\" the term venerable is used instead of mouldy, and hallowed\ninstead of devilish; whereas there is nothing properly venerable or\nantique about a language which is not yet four hundred years old, and\nabout a jumble of imbecile spellings which were grotesque in the\nbeginning, and which grow more and more grotesque with the flight of the\nyears.\n\n[_Dictated Monday, November 30, 1906._]\n\n\n     Jean and Papa were walking out past the barn the other day when\n     Jean saw some little newly born baby ducks, she exclaimed as she\n     perceived them \"I dont see why God gives us so much ducks when\n     Patrick kills them so.\"\n\n\nSusy is mistaken as to the origin of the ducks. They were not a gift, I\nbought them. I am not finding fault with her, for that would be most\nunfair. She is remarkably accurate in her statements as a historian, as\na rule, and it would not be just to make much of this small slip of\nhers; besides I think it was a quite natural slip, for by heredity and\nhabit ours was a religious household, and it was a common thing with us\nwhenever anybody did a handsome thing, to give the credit of it to\nProvidence, without examining into the matter. This may be called\nautomatic religion--in fact that is what it is; it is so used to its\nwork that it can do it without your help or even your privity; out of\nall the facts and statistics that may be placed before it, it will\nalways get the one result, since it has never been taught to seek any\nother. It is thus the unreflecting cause of much injustice. As we have\nseen, it betrayed Susy into an injustice toward me. It had to be\nautomatic, for she would have been far from doing me an injustice when\nin her right mind. It was a dear little biographer, and she meant me no\nharm, and I am not censuring her now, but am only desirous of correcting\nin advance an erroneous impression which her words would be sure to\nconvey to a reader's mind. No elaboration of this matter is necessary;\nit is sufficient to say _I_ provided the ducks.\n\nIt was in Hartford. The greensward sloped down-hill from the house to\nthe sluggish little river that flowed through the grounds, and Patrick,\nwho was fertile in good ideas, had early conceived the idea of having\nhome-made ducks for our table. Every morning he drove them from the\nstable down to the river, and the children were always there to see and\nadmire the waddling white procession; they were there again at sunset to\nsee Patrick conduct the procession back to its lodgings in the stable.\nBut this was not always a gay and happy holiday show, with joy in it for\nthe witnesses; no, too frequently there was a tragedy connected with it,\nand then there were tears and pain for the children. There was a\nstranded log or two in the river, and on these certain families of\nsnapping-turtles used to congregate and drowse in the sun and give\nthanks, in their dumb way, to Providence for benevolence extended to\nthem. It was but another instance of misplaced credit; it was the young\nducks that those pious reptiles were so thankful for--whereas they were\n_my_ ducks. I bought the ducks.\n\nWhen a crop of young ducks, not yet quite old enough for the table but\napproaching that age, began to join the procession, and paddle around in\nthe sluggish water, and give thanks--not to me--for that privilege, the\nsnapping-turtles would suspend their songs of praise and slide off the\nlogs and paddle along under the water and chew the feet of the young\nducks. Presently Patrick would notice that two or three of those little\ncreatures were not moving about, but were apparently at anchor, and were\nnot looking as thankful as they had been looking a short time before. He\nearly found out what that sign meant--a submerged snapping-turtle was\ntaking his breakfast, and silently singing his gratitude. Every day or\ntwo Patrick would rescue and fetch up a little duck with incomplete legs\nto stand upon--nothing left of their extremities but gnawed and bleeding\nstumps. Then the children said pitying things and wept--and at dinner we\nfinished the tragedy which the turtles had begun. Thus, as will be\nseen--out of season, at least--it was really the turtles that gave us\nso much ducks. At my expense.\n\n\n     Papa has written a new version of \"There is a happy land\" it is--\n\n\n     \"There is a boarding-house\n               Far, far away,\n     Where they have ham and eggs,\n               Three times a day.\n     Oh dont those boarders yell\n     When they hear the dinner-bell,\n     They give that land-lord rats\n               Three times a day.\"\n\n\nAgain Susy has made a small error. It was not I that wrote the song. I\nheard Billy Rice sing it in the negro minstrel show, and I brought it\nhome and sang it--with great spirit--for the elevation of the household.\nThe children admired it to the limit, and made me sing it with\nburdensome frequency. To their minds it was superior to the Battle Hymn\nof the Republic.\n\nHow many years ago that was! Where now is Billy Rice? He was a joy to\nme, and so were the other stars of the nigger-show--Billy Birch, David\nWambold, Backus, and a delightful dozen of their brethren, who made life\na pleasure to me forty years ago, and later. Birch, Wambold, and Backus\nare gone years ago; and with them departed to return no more forever, I\nsuppose, the real nigger-show--the genuine nigger-show, the extravagant\nnigger-show,--the show which to me had no peer and whose peer has not\nyet arrived, in my experience. We have the grand opera; and I have\nwitnessed, and greatly enjoyed, the first act of everything which Wagner\ncreated, but the effect on me has always been so powerful that one act\nwas quite sufficient; whenever I have witnessed two acts I have gone\naway physically exhausted; and whenever I have ventured an entire opera\nthe result has been the next thing to suicide. But if I could have the\nnigger-show back again, in its pristine purity and perfection, I should\nhave but little further use for opera. It seems to me that to the\nelevated mind and the sensitive spirit the hand-organ and the\nnigger-show are a standard and a summit to whose rarefied altitude the\nother forms of musical art may not hope to reach.\n\n[_Dictated September 5, 1906._] It is years since I have examined \"The\nChildren's Record.\" I have turned over a few of its pages this morning.\nThis book is a record in which Mrs. Clemens and I registered some of\nthe sayings and doings of the children, in the long ago, when they were\nlittle chaps. Of course, we wrote these things down at the time because\nthey were of momentary interest--things of the passing hour, and of no\npermanent value--but at this distant day I find that they still possess\nan interest for me and also a value, because it turns out that they were\n_registrations of character_. The qualities then revealed by fitful\nglimpses, in childish acts and speeches, remained as a permanency in the\nchildren's characters in the drift of the years, and were always\nafterwards clearly and definitely recognizable.\n\nThere is a masterful streak in Jean that now and then moves her to set\nmy authority aside for a moment and end a losing argument in that prompt\nand effective fashion. And here in this old book I find evidence that\nshe was just like that before she was quite four years old.\n\n\n     _From The Children's Record. Quarry Farm, July 7, 1884._--Yesterday\n     evening our cows (after being inspected and worshipped by Jean from\n     the shed for an hour,) wandered off down into the pasture, and left\n     her bereft. I thought I was going to get back home, now, but that\n     was an error. Jean knew of some more cows, in a field somewhere,\n     and took my hand and led me thitherward. When we turned the corner\n     and took the right-hand road, I saw that we should presently be out\n     of range of call and sight; so I began to argue against continuing\n     the expedition, and Jean began to argue in favor of it--she using\n     English for light skirmishing, and German for \"business.\" I kept up\n     my end with vigor, and demolished her arguments in detail, one\n     after the other, till I judged I had her about cornered. She\n     hesitated a moment, then answered up sharply:\n\n     \"_Wir werden nichts mehr dar\u00fcber sprechen!_\" (We won't talk any\n     more about it!)\n\n     It nearly took my breath away; though I thought I might possibly\n     have misunderstood. I said:\n\n     \"Why, you little rascal! _Was hast du gesagt?_\"\n\n     But she said the same words over again, and in the same decided\n     way. I suppose I ought to have been outraged; but I wasn't, I was\n     charmed. And I suppose I ought to have spanked her; but I didn't, I\n     fraternized with the enemy, and we went on and spent half an hour\n     with the cows.\n\n\nThat incident is followed in the \"Record\" by the following paragraph,\nwhich is another instance of a juvenile characteristic maintaining\nitself into mature age. Susy was persistently and conscientiously\ntruthful throughout her life with the exception of one interruption\ncovering several months, and perhaps a year. This was while she was\nstill a little child. Suddenly--not gradually--she began to lie; not\nfurtively, but frankly, openly, and on a scale quite disproportioned to\nher size. Her mother was so stunned, so nearly paralyzed for a day or\ntwo, that she did not know what to do with the emergency. Reasonings,\npersuasions, beseechings, all went for nothing; they produced no effect;\nthe lying went tranquilly on. Other remedies were tried, but they\nfailed. There is a tradition that success was finally accomplished by\nwhipping. I think the Record says so, but if it does it is because the\nRecord is incomplete. Whipping was indeed tried, and was faithfully kept\nup during two or three weeks, but the results were merely temporary; the\nreforms achieved were discouragingly brief.\n\nFortunately for Susy, an incident presently occurred which put a\ncomplete stop to all the mother's efforts in the direction of reform.\nThis incident was the chance discovery in Darwin of a passage which said\nthat when a child exhibits a sudden and unaccountable disposition to\nforsake the truth and restrict itself to lying, the explanation must be\nsought away back in the past; that an ancestor of the child had had the\nsame disease, at the same tender age; that it was irremovable by\npersuasion or punishment, and that it had ceased as suddenly and as\nmysteriously as it had come, when it had run its appointed course. I\nthink Mr. Darwin said that nothing was necessary but to leave the matter\nalone and let the malady have its way and perish by the statute of\nlimitations.\n\nWe had confidence in Darwin, and after that day Susy was relieved of our\nreformatory persecutions. She went on lying without let or hindrance\nduring several months, or a year; then the lying suddenly ceased, and\nshe became as conscientiously and exactingly truthful as she had been\nbefore the attack, and she remained so to the end of her life.\n\nThe paragraph in the Record to which I have been leading up is in my\nhandwriting, and is of a date so long posterior to the time of the lying\nmalady that she had evidently forgotten that truth-speaking had ever had\nany difficulties for her.\n\n\n     Mama was speaking of a servant who had been pretty unveracious, but\n     was now \"trying to tell the truth.\" Susy was a good deal surprised,\n     and said she shouldn't think anybody would have to _try_ to tell\n     the truth.\n\n\nIn the Record the children's acts and speeches quite definitely define\ntheir characters. Susy's indicated the presence of mentality--\nthought--and they were generally marked by gravity. She was timid, on\nher physical side, but had an abundance of moral courage. Clara was\nsturdy, independent, orderly, practical, persistent, plucky--just a\nlittle animal, and very satisfactory. Charles Dudley Warner said Susy\nwas made of mind, and Clara of matter.\n\nWhen Motley, the kitten, died, some one said that the thoughts of the\ntwo children need not be inquired into, they could be divined: that Susy\nwas wondering if this was the _end_ of Motley, and had his life been\nworth while; whereas Clara was merely interested in seeing to it that\nthere should be a creditable funeral.\n\nIn those days Susy was a dreamer, a thinker, a poet and philosopher, and\nClara--well, Clara wasn't. In after-years a passion for music developed\nthe latent spirituality and intellectuality in Clara, and her\npracticality took second and, in fact, even third place. Jean was from\nthe beginning orderly, steady, diligent, persistent; and remains so. She\npicked up languages easily, and kept them.\n\n\n     _Susy aged eleven, Jean three._--Susy said the other day when she\n     saw Jean bringing a cat to me of her own motion, \"Jean has found\n     out already that mamma loves morals and papa loves cats.\"\n\n\nIt is another of Susy's remorselessly sound verdicts.\n\nAs a child, Jean neglected my books. When she was nine years old Will\nGillette invited her and the rest of us to a dinner at the Murray Hill\nHotel in New York, in order that we might get acquainted with Mrs.\nLeslie and her daughters. Elsie Leslie was nine years old, and was a\ngreat celebrity on the stage. Jean was astonished and awed to see that\nlittle slip of a thing sit up at table and take part in the conversation\nof the grown people, capably and with ease and tranquillity. Poor Jean\nwas obliged to keep still, for the subjects discussed never happened to\nhit her level, but at last the talk fell within her limit and she had\nher chance to contribute to it. \"Tom Sawyer\" was mentioned. Jean spoke\ngratefully up and said,\n\n\"I know who wrote that book--Harriet Beecher Stowe!\"\n\n\n     One evening Susy had prayed, Clara was curled up for sleep; she was\n     reminded that it was her turn to pray now. She laid \"Oh! one's\n     enough,\" and dropped off to slumber.\n\n     _Clara five years old._--We were in Germany. The nurse, Rosa, was\n     not allowed to speak to the children otherwise than in German.\n     Clara grew very tired of it; by and by the little creature's\n     patience was exhausted, and she said \"Aunt Clara, I wish God had\n     made Rosa in English.\"\n\n     _Clara four years old, Susy six._--This morning when Clara\n     discovered that this is my birthday, she was greatly troubled\n     because she had provided no gift for me, and repeated her sorrow\n     several times. Finally she went musing to the nursery and presently\n     returned with her newest and dearest treasure, a large toy horse,\n     and said, \"You shall have this horse for your birthday, papa.\"\n\n     I accepted it with many thanks. After an hour she was racing up and\n     down the room with the horse, when Susy said,\n\n     \"Why Clara, you gave that horse to papa, and now you've tooken it\n     again.\"\n\n     _Clara._--\"I never give it to him for always; I give it to him for\n     his birthday.\"\n\n\n     In Geneva, in September, I lay abed late one morning, and as Clara\n     was passing through the room I took her on my bed a moment. Then\n     the child went to Clara Spaulding and said,\n\n     \"Aunt Clara, papa is a good deal of trouble to me.\"\n\n     \"Is he? Why?\"\n\n     \"Well, he wants me to get in bed with him, and I can't do that with\n     jelmuls [gentlemen]--I don't like jelmuls anyway.\"\n\n     \"What, you don't like gentlemen! Don't you like Uncle Theodore\n     Crane?\"\n\n     \"Oh yes, but he's not a jelmul, he's a friend.\"\n\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[15] Cable never travelled Sundays.\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCXVIII.\n\nJULY 5, 1907.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XX.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n[Sidenote: (1868.)]\n\n[_Notes on \"Innocents Abroad.\" Dictated in Florence, Italy, April,\n1904._]--I will begin with a note upon the dedication. I wrote the book\nin the months of March and April, 1868, in San Francisco. It was\npublished in August, 1869. Three years afterward Mr. Goodman, of\nVirginia City, Nevada, on whose newspaper I had served ten years before,\ncame East, and we were walking down Broadway one day when he said: \"How\ndid you come to steal Oliver Wendell Holmes's dedication and put it in\nyour book?\"\n\nI made a careless and inconsequential answer, for I supposed he was\njoking. But he assured me that he was in earnest. He said: \"I'm not\ndiscussing the question of whether you stole it or didn't--for that is a\nquestion that can be settled in the first bookstore we come to--I am\nonly asking you _how_ you came to steal it, for that is where my\ncuriosity is focalized.\"\n\nI couldn't accommodate him with this information, as I hadn't it in\nstock. I could have made oath that I had not stolen anything, therefore\nmy vanity was not hurt nor my spirit troubled. At bottom I supposed that\nhe had mistaken another book for mine, and was now getting himself into\nan untenable place and preparing sorrow for himself and triumph for me.\nWe entered a bookstore and he asked for \"The Innocents Abroad\" and for\nthe dainty little blue and gold edition of Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes's\npoems. He opened the books, exposed their dedications and said: \"Read\nthem. It is plain that the author of the second one stole the first one,\nisn't it?\"\n\nI was very much ashamed, and unspeakably astonished. We continued our\nwalk, but I was not able to throw any gleam of light upon that original\nquestion of his. I could not remember ever having seen Dr. Holmes's\ndedication. I knew the poems, but the dedication was new to me.\n\nI did not get hold of the key to that secret until months afterward,\nthen it came in a curious way, and yet it was a natural way; for the\nnatural way provided by nature and the construction of the human mind\nfor the discovery of a forgotten event is to employ another forgotten\nevent for its resurrection.\n\n[Sidenote: (1866.)]\n\nI received a letter from the Rev. Dr. Rising, who had been rector of the\nEpiscopal church in Virginia City in my time, in which letter Dr. Rising\nmade reference to certain things which had happened to us in the\nSandwich Islands six years before; among things he made casual mention\nof the Honolulu Hotel's poverty in the matter of literature. At first I\ndid not see the bearing of the remark, it called nothing to my mind. But\npresently it did--with a flash! There was but one book in Mr. Kirchhof's\nhotel, and that was the first volume of Dr. Holmes's blue and gold\nseries. I had had a fortnight's chance to get well acquainted with its\ncontents, for I had ridden around the big island (Hawaii) on horseback\nand had brought back so many saddle boils that if there had been a duty\non them it would have bankrupted me to pay it. They kept me in my room,\nunclothed, and in persistent pain for two weeks, with no company but\ncigars and the little volume of poems. Of course I read them almost\nconstantly; I read them from beginning to end, then read them backwards,\nthen began in the middle and read them both ways, then read them wrong\nend first and upside down. In a word, I read the book to rags, and was\ninfinitely grateful to the hand that wrote it.\n\nHere we have an exhibition of what repetition can do, when persisted in\ndaily and hourly over a considerable stretch of time, where one is\nmerely reading for entertainment, without thought or intention of\npreserving in the memory that which is read. It is a process which in\nthe course of years dries all the juice out of a familiar verse of\nScripture, leaving nothing but a sapless husk behind. In that case you\nat least know the origin of the husk, but in the case in point I\napparently preserved the husk but presently forgot whence it came. It\nlay lost in some dim corner of my memory a year or two, then came\nforward when I needed a dedication, and was promptly mistaken by me as a\nchild of my own happy fancy.\n\nI was new, I was ignorant, the mysteries of the human mind were a sealed\nbook to me as yet, and I stupidly looked upon myself as a tough and\nunforgivable criminal. I wrote to Dr. Holmes and told him the whole\ndisgraceful affair, implored him in impassioned language to believe that\nI had never intended to commit this crime, and was unaware that I had\ncommitted it until I was confronted with the awful evidence. I have lost\nhis answer, I could better have afforded to lose an uncle. Of these I\nhad a surplus, many of them of no real value to me, but that letter was\nbeyond price, beyond uncledom, and unsparable. In it Dr. Holmes laughed\nthe kindest and healingest laugh over the whole matter, and at\nconsiderable length and in happy phrase assured me that there was no\ncrime in unconscious plagiarism; that I committed it every day, that he\ncommitted it every day, that every man alive on the earth who writes or\nspeaks commits it every day and not merely once or twice but every time\nhe opens his mouth; that all our phrasings are spiritualized shadows\ncast multitudinously from our readings; that no happy phrase of ours is\never quite original with us, there is nothing of our own in it except\nsome slight change born of our temperament, character, environment,\nteachings and associations; that this slight change differentiates it\nfrom another man's manner of saying it, stamps it with our special\nstyle, and makes it our own for the time being; all the rest of it being\nold, moldy, antique, and smelling of the breath of a thousand\ngenerations of them that have passed it over their teeth before!\n\nIn the thirty-odd years which have come and gone since then, I have\nsatisfied myself that what Dr. Holmes said was true.\n\nI wish to make a note upon the preface of the \"Innocents.\" In the last\nparagraph of that brief preface, I speak of the proprietors of the\n\"Daily Alta California\" having \"waived their rights\" in certain letters\nwhich I wrote for that journal while absent on the \"Quaker City\" trip. I\nwas young then, I am white-headed now, but the insult of that word\nrankles yet, now that I am reading that paragraph for the first time in\nmany years, reading it for the first time since it was written, perhaps.\nThere were rights, it is true--such rights as the strong are able to\nacquire over the weak and the absent. Early in '66 George Barnes invited\nme to resign my reportership on his paper, the San Francisco \"Morning\nCall,\" and for some months thereafter I was without money or work; then\nI had a pleasant turn of fortune. The proprietors of the \"Sacramento\nUnion,\" a great and influential daily journal, sent me to the Sandwich\nIslands to write four letters a month at twenty dollars apiece. I was\nthere four or five months, and returned to find myself about the best\nknown honest man on the Pacific Coast. Thomas McGuire, proprietor of\nseveral theatres, said that now was the time to make my fortune--strike\nwhile the iron was hot!--break into the lecture field! I did it. I\nannounced a lecture on the Sandwich Islands, closing the advertisement\nwith the remark, \"Admission one dollar; doors open at half-past 7, the\ntrouble begins at 8.\" A true prophecy. The trouble certainly did begin\nat 8, when I found myself in front of the only audience I had ever\nfaced, for the fright which pervaded me from head to foot was\nparalyzing. It lasted two minutes and was as bitter as death, the memory\nof it is indestructible, but it had its compensations, for it made me\nimmune from timidity before audiences for all time to come. I lectured\nin all the principal Californian towns and in Nevada, then lectured once\nor twice more in San Francisco, then retired from the field rich--for\nme--and laid out a plan to sail Westward from San Francisco, and go\naround the world. The proprietors of the \"Alta\" engaged me to write an\naccount of the trip for that paper--fifty letters of a column and a half\neach, which would be about two thousand words per letter, and the pay to\nbe twenty dollars per letter.\n\nI went East to St. Louis to say good-bye to my mother, and then I was\nbitten by the prospectus of Captain Duncan of the \"Quaker City\"\nexcursion, and I ended by joining it. During the trip I wrote and sent\nthe fifty letters; six of them miscarried, and I wrote six new ones to\ncomplete my contract. Then I put together a lecture on the trip and\ndelivered it in San Francisco at great and satisfactory pecuniary\nprofit, then I branched out into the country and was aghast at the\nresult: I had been entirely forgotten, I never had people enough in my\nhouses to sit as a jury of inquest on my lost reputation! I inquired\ninto this curious condition of things and found that the thrifty owners\nof that prodigiously rich \"Alta\" newspaper had _copyrighted_ all those\npoor little twenty-dollar letters, and had threatened with prosecution\nany journal which should venture to copy a paragraph from them!\n\nAnd there I was! I had contracted to furnish a large book, concerning\nthe excursion, to the American Publishing Co. of Hartford, and I\nsupposed I should need all those letters to fill it out with. I was in\nan uncomfortable situation--that is, if the proprietors of this\nstealthily acquired copyright should refuse to let me use the letters.\nThat is just what they did; Mr. Mac--something--I have forgotten the\nrest of his name--said his firm were going to make a book out of the\nletters in order to get back the thousand dollars which they had paid\nfor them. I said that if they had acted fairly and honorably, and had\nallowed the country press to use the letters or portions of them, my\nlecture-skirmish on the coast would have paid me ten thousand dollars,\nwhereas the \"Alta\" had lost me that amount. Then he offered a\ncompromise: he would publish the book and allow me ten per cent. royalty\non it. The compromise did not appeal to me, and I said so. I was now\nquite unknown outside of San Francisco, the book's sale would be\nconfined to that city, and my royalty would not pay me enough to board\nme three months; whereas my Eastern contract, if carried out, could be\nprofitable to me, for I had a sort of reputation on the Atlantic\nseaboard acquired through the publication of six excursion-letters in\nthe New York \"Tribune\" and one or two in the \"Herald.\"\n\nIn the end Mr. Mac agreed to suppress his book, on certain conditions:\nin my preface I must thank the \"Alta\" for waiving \"rights\" and granting\nme permission. I objected to the thanks. I could not with any large\ndegree of sincerity thank the \"Alta\" for bankrupting my lecture-raid.\nAfter considerable debate my point was conceded and the thanks left out.\n\n[Sidenote: (1902.)]\n\n[Sidenote: (1904.)]\n\n[Sidenote: (1897.)]\n\nNoah Brooks was the editor of the \"Alta\" at the time, a man of sterling\ncharacter and equipped with a right heart, also a good historian where\nfacts were not essential. In biographical sketches of me written many\nyears afterward (1902), he was quite eloquent in praises of the\ngenerosity of the \"Alta\" people in giving to me without compensation a\nbook which, as history had afterward shown, was worth a fortune. After\nall the fuss, I did not levy heavily upon the \"Alta\" letters. I found\nthat they were newspaper matter, not book matter. They had been written\nhere and there and yonder, as opportunity had given me a chance\nworking-moment or two during our feverish flight around about Europe or\nin the furnace-heat of my stateroom on board the \"Quaker City,\"\ntherefore they were loosely constructed, and needed to have some of the\nwind and water squeezed out of them. I used several of them--ten or\ntwelve, perhaps. I wrote the rest of \"The Innocents Abroad\" in sixty\ndays, and I could have added a fortnight's labor with the pen and gotten\nalong without the letters altogether. I was very young in those days,\nexceedingly young, marvellously young, younger than I am now, younger\nthan I shall ever be again, by hundreds of years. I worked every night\nfrom eleven or twelve until broad day in the morning, and as I did two\nhundred thousand words in the sixty days, the average was more than\nthree thousand words a day--nothing for Sir Walter Scott, nothing for\nLouis Stevenson, nothing for plenty of other people, but quite handsome\nfor me. In 1897, when we were living in Tedworth Square, London, and I\nwas writing the book called \"Following the Equator\" my average was\neighteen hundred words a day; here in Florence (1904), my average seems\nto be fourteen hundred words per sitting of four or five hours.[16]\n\nI was deducing from the above that I have been slowing down steadily in\nthese thirty-six years, but I perceive that my statistics have a\ndefect: three thousand words in the spring of 1868 when I was working\nseven or eight or nine hours at a sitting has little or no advantage\nover the sitting of to-day, covering half the time and producing half\nthe output. Figures often beguile me, particularly when I have the\narranging of them myself; in which case the remark attributed to\nDisraeli would often apply with justice and force:\n\n\"There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.\"\n\n[_Dictated, January 23, 1907._]--The proverb says that Providence\nprotects children and idiots. This is really true. I know it because I\nhave tested it. It did not protect George through the most of his\ncampaign, but it saved him in his last inning, and the veracity of the\nproverb stood confirmed.\n\n[Sidenote: (1865.)]\n\nI have several times been saved by this mysterious interposition, when I\nwas manifestly in extreme peril. It has been common, all my life, for\nsmart people to perceive in me an easy prey for selfish designs, and I\nhave walked without suspicion into the trap set for me, yet have often\ncome out unscathed, against all the likelihoods. More than forty years\nago, in San Francisco, the office staff adjourned, upon conclusion of\nits work at two o'clock in the morning, to a great bowling establishment\nwhere there were twelve alleys. I was invited, rather perfunctorily, and\nas a matter of etiquette--by which I mean that I was invited politely,\nbut not urgently. But when I diffidently declined, with thanks, and\nexplained that I knew nothing about the game, those lively young fellows\nbecame at once eager and anxious and urgent to have my society. This\nflattered me, for I perceived no trap, and I innocently and gratefully\naccepted their invitation. I was given an alley all to myself. The boys\nexplained the game to me, and they also explained to me that there would\nbe an hour's play, and that the player who scored the fewest ten-strikes\nin the hour would have to provide oysters and beer for the combination.\nThis disturbed me very seriously, since it promised me bankruptcy, and I\nwas sorry that this detail had been overlooked in the beginning. But my\npride would not allow me to back out now, so I stayed in, and did what I\ncould to look satisfied and glad I had come. It is not likely that I\nlooked as contented as I wanted to, but the others looked glad enough to\nmake up for it, for they were quite unable to hide their evil joy. They\nshowed me how to stand, and how to stoop, and how to aim the ball, and\nhow to let fly; and then the game began. The results were astonishing.\nIn my ignorance I delivered the balls in apparently every way except the\nright one; but no matter--during half an hour I never started a ball\ndown the alley that didn't score a ten-strike, every time, at the other\nend. The others lost their grip early, and their joy along with it. Now\nand then one of them got a ten-strike, but the occurrence was so rare\nthat it made no show alongside of my giant score. The boys surrendered\nat the end of the half-hour, and put on their coats and gathered around\nme and in courteous, but sufficiently definite, language expressed their\nopinion of an experience-worn and seasoned expert who would stoop to\nlying and deception in order to rob kind and well-meaning friends who\nhad put their trust in him under the delusion that he was an honest and\nhonorable person. I was not able to convince them that I had not lied,\nfor now my character was gone, and they refused to attach any value to\nanything I said. The proprietor of the place stood by for a while saying\nnothing, then he came to my defence. He said: \"It looks like a mystery,\ngentlemen, but it isn't a mystery after it's explained. That is a\n_grooved_ alley; you've only to start a ball down it any way you please\nand the groove will do the rest; it will slam the ball against the\nnortheast curve of the head pin every time, and nothing can save the ten\nfrom going down.\"\n\nIt was true. The boys made the experiment and they found that there was\nno art that could send a ball down that alley and fail to score a\nten-strike with it. When I had told those boys that I knew nothing about\nthat game I was speaking only the truth; but it was ever thus, all\nthrough my life: whenever I have diverged from custom and principle and\nuttered a truth, the rule has been that the hearer hadn't strength of\nmind enough to believe it.\n\n[Sidenote: (1873.)]\n\nA quarter of a century ago I arrived in London to lecture a few weeks\nunder the management of George Dolby, who had conducted the Dickens\nreadings in America five or six years before. He took me to the\nAlbemarle and fed me, and in the course of the dinner he enlarged a good\ndeal, and with great satisfaction, upon his reputation as a player of\nfifteen-ball pool, and when he learned by my testimony that I had never\nseen the game played, and knew nothing of the art of pocketing balls,\nhe enlarged more and more, and still more, and kept on enlarging, until\nI recognized that I was either in the presence of the very father of\nfifteen-ball pool or in the presence of his most immediate descendant.\nAt the end of the dinner Dolby was eager to introduce me to the game and\nshow me what he could do. We adjourned to the billiard-room and he\nframed the balls in a flat pyramid and told me to fire at the apex ball\nand then go on and do what I could toward pocketing the fifteen, after\nwhich he would take the cue and show me what a past-master of the game\ncould do with those balls. I did as required. I began with the\ndiffidence proper to my ignorant estate, and when I had finished my\ninning all the balls were in the pockets and Dolby was burying me under\na volcanic irruption of acid sarcasms.\n\nSo I was a liar in Dolby's belief. He thought he had been sold, and at a\ncheap rate; but he divided his sarcasms quite fairly and quite equally\nbetween the two of us. He was full of ironical admiration of his\nchildishness and innocence in letting a wandering and characterless and\nscandalous American load him up with deceptions of so transparent a\ncharacter that they ought not to have deceived the house cat. On the\nother hand, he was remorselessly severe upon me for beguiling him, by\nstudied and discreditable artifice, into bragging and boasting about his\npoor game in the presence of a professional expert disguised in lies and\nfrauds, who could empty more balls in billiard pockets in an hour than\nhe could empty into a basket in a day.\n\nIn the matter of fifteen-ball pool I never got Dolby's confidence wholly\nback, though I got it in other ways, and kept it until his death. I have\nplayed that game a number of times since, but that first time was the\nonly time in my life that I have ever pocketed all the fifteen in a\nsingle inning.\n\n[Sidenote: (1876.)]\n\nMy unsuspicious nature has made it necessary for Providence to save me\nfrom traps a number of times. Thirty years ago, a couple of Elmira\nbankers invited me to play the game of \"Quaker\" with them. I had never\nheard of the game before, and said that if it required intellect, I\nshould not be able to entertain them. But they said it was merely a game\nof chance, and required no mentality--so I agreed to make a trial of it.\nThey appointed four in the afternoon for the sacrifice. As the place,\nthey chose a ground-floor room with a large window in it. Then they\nwent treacherously around and advertised the \"sell\" which they were\ngoing to play upon me.\n\nI arrived on time, and we began the game--with a large and eager\nfree-list to superintend it. These superintendents were outside, with\ntheir noses pressed against the window-pane. The bankers described the\ngame to me. So far as I recollect, the pattern of it was this: they had\na pile of Mexican dollars on the table; twelve of them were of even\ndate, fifty of them were of odd dates. The bankers were to separate a\ncoin from the pile and hide it under a hand, and I must guess \"odd\" or\n\"even.\" If I guessed correctly, the coin would be mine; if incorrectly,\nI lost a dollar. The first guess I made was \"even,\" and was right. I\nguessed again, \"even,\" and took the money. They fed me another one and I\nguessed \"even\" again, and took the money. I guessed \"even\" the fourth\ntime, and took the money. It seemed to me that \"even\" was a good guess,\nand I might as well stay by it, which I did. I guessed \"even\" twelve\ntimes, and took the twelve dollars. I was doing as they secretly\ndesired. Their experience of human nature had convinced them that any\nhuman being as innocent as my face proclaimed me to be, would repeat his\nfirst guess if it won, and would go on repeating it if it should\ncontinue to win. It was their belief that an innocent would be almost\nsure at the beginning to guess \"even,\" and not \"odd,\" and that if an\ninnocent should guess \"even\" twelve times in succession and win every\ntime, he would go on guessing \"even\" to the end--so it was their purpose\nto let me win those twelve even dates and then advance the odd dates,\none by one, until I should lose fifty dollars, and furnish those\nsuperintendents something to laugh about for a week to come.\n\nBut it did not come out in that way; for by the time I had won the\ntwelfth dollar and last even date, I withdrew from the game because it\nwas so one-sided that it was monotonous, and did not entertain me. There\nwas a burst of laughter from the superintendents at the window when I\ncame out of the place, but I did not know what they were laughing at nor\nwhom they were laughing at, and it was a matter of no interest to me\nanyway. Through that incident I acquired an enviable reputation for\nsmartness and penetration, but it was not my due, for I had not\npenetrated anything that the cow could not have penetrated.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[16] With the pen, I mean. This Autobiography is dictated, not written.\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCXX.\n\nAUGUST 2, 1907.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XXI.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n_From Susy's Biography of Me._\n\n\n     _Feb. 12, '86._\n\n     Mamma and I have both been very much troubled of late because papa\n     since he has been publishing Gen. Grant's book has seemed to forget\n     his own books and work entirely, and the other evening as papa and\n     I were promonading up and down the library he told me that he\n     didn't expect to write but one more book, and then he was ready to\n     give up work altogether, die, or do anything, he said that he had\n     written more than he had ever expected to, and the only book that\n     he had been pertickularly anxious to write was one locked up in the\n     safe down stairs, not yet published.[17]\n\n     But this intended future of course will never do, and although papa\n     usually holds to his own opinions and intents with outsiders, when\n     mamma realy desires anything and says that it must be, papa allways\n     gives up his plans (at least so far) and does as she says is right\n     (and she is usually right, if she dissagrees with him at all). It\n     was because he knew his great tendency to being convinced by her,\n     that he published without her knowledge that article in the\n     \"Christian Union\" concerning the government of children. So judging\n     by the proofs of past years, I think that we will be able to\n     persuade papa to go back to work as before, and not leave off\n     writing with the end of his next story. Mamma says that she\n     sometimes feels, and I do too, that she would rather have papa\n     depend on his writing for a living than to have him think of giving\n     it up.\n\n\n[_Dictated, November 8, 1906._] I have a defect of a sort which I think\nis not common; certainly I hope it isn't: it is rare that I can call\nbefore my mind's eye the form and face of either friend or enemy. If I\nshould make a list, now, of persons whom I know in America and\nabroad--say to the number of even an entire thousand--it is quite\nunlikely that I could reproduce five of them in my mind's eye. Of my\ndearest and most intimate friends, I could name eight whom I have seen\nand talked with four days ago, but when I try to call them before me\nthey are formless shadows. Jean has been absent, this past eight or ten\ndays, in the country, and I wish I could reproduce her in the mirror of\nmy mind, but I can't do it.\n\nIt may be that this defect is not constitutional, but a result of\nlifelong absence of mind and indolent and inadequate observation. Once\nor twice in my life it has been an embarrassment to me. Twenty years\nago, in the days of Susy's Biography of Me, there was a dispute one\nmorning at the breakfast-table about the color of a neighbor's eyes. I\nwas asked for a verdict, but had to confess that if that valued neighbor\nand old friend had eyes I was not sure that I had ever seen them. It was\nthen mockingly suggested that perhaps I didn't even know the color of\nthe eyes of my own family, and I was required to shut my own at once and\ntestify. I was able to name the color of Mrs. Clemens's eyes, but was\nnot able to even suggest a color for Jean's, or Clara's, or Susy's.\n\nAll this talk is suggested by Susy's remark: \"The other evening as papa\nand I were promenading up and down the library.\" Down to the bottom of\nmy heart I am thankful that I can see _that_ picture! And it is not dim,\nbut stands out clear in the unfaded light of twenty-one years ago. In\nthose days Susy and I used to \"promonade\" daily up and down the\nlibrary, with our arms about each other's waists, and deal in intimate\ncommunion concerning affairs of State, or the deep questions of human\nlife, or our small personal affairs.\n\nIt was quite natural that I should think I had written myself out when I\nwas only fifty years old, for everybody who has ever written has been\nsmitten with that superstition at about that age. Not even yet have I\nreally written myself out. I have merely stopped writing because\ndictating is pleasanter work, and because dictating has given me a\nstrong aversion to the pen, and because two hours of talking per day is\nenough, and because--But I am only damaging my mind with this digging\naround in it for pretexts where no pretext is needed, and where the\nsimple truth is for this one time better than any invention, in this\nsmall emergency. I shall never finish my five or six unfinished books,\nfor the reason that by forty years of slavery to the pen I have earned\nmy freedom. I detest the pen and I wouldn't use it again to sign the\ndeath warrant of my dearest enemy.\n\n[_Dictated, March 8, 1906._] For thirty years, I have received an\naverage of a dozen letters a year from strangers who remember me, or\nwhose fathers remember me as boy and young man. But these letters are\nalmost always disappointing. I have not known these strangers nor their\nfathers. I have not heard of the names they mention; the reminiscences\nto which they call attention have had no part in my experience; all of\nwhich means that these strangers have been mistaking me for somebody\nelse. But at last I have the refreshment, this morning, of a letter from\na man who deals in names that were familiar to me in my boyhood. The\nwriter encloses a newspaper clipping which has been wandering through\nthe press for four or five weeks, and he wants to know if Capt Tonkray,\nlately deceased, was (as stated in the clipping) the original of\n\"Huckleberry Finn.\"\n\nI have replied that \"Huckleberry Finn\" was Frank F. As this inquirer\nevidently knew the Hannibal of the forties, he will easily recall Frank.\nFrank's father was at one time Town Drunkard, an exceedingly\nwell-defined and unofficial office of those days. He succeeded \"General\"\nGaines, and for a time he was sole and only incumbent of the office; but\nafterward Jimmy Finn proved competency and disputed the place with him,\nso we had two town drunkards at one time--and it made as much trouble in\nthat village as Christendom experienced in the fourteenth century when\nthere were two Popes at the same time.\n\nIn \"Huckleberry Finn\" I have drawn Frank exactly as he was. He was\nignorant, unwashed, insufficiently fed; but he had as good a heart as\never any boy had. His liberties were totally unrestricted. He was the\nonly really independent person--boy or man--in the community, and by\nconsequence he was tranquilly and continuously happy, and was envied by\nall the rest of us. We liked him; we enjoyed his society. And as his\nsociety was forbidden us by our parents, the prohibition trebled and\nquadrupled its value, and therefore we sought and got more of his\nsociety than of any other boy's. I heard, four years ago, that he was\nJustice of the Peace in a remote village in the State of ----, and was a\ngood citizen and was greatly respected.\n\nDuring Jimmy Finn's term he (Jimmy) was not exclusive; he was not\nfinical; he was not hypercritical; he was largely and handsomely\ndemocratic--and slept in the deserted tan-yard with the hogs. My father\ntried to reform him once, but did not succeed. My father was not a\nprofessional reformer. In him the spirit of reform was spasmodic. It\nonly broke out now and then, with considerable intervals between. Once\nhe tried to reform Injun Joe. That also was a failure. It was a failure,\nand we boys were glad. For Injun Joe, drunk, was interesting and a\nbenefaction to us, but Injun Joe, sober, was a dreary spectacle. We\nwatched my father's experiments upon him with a good deal of anxiety,\nbut it came out all right and we were satisfied. Injun Joe got drunk\noftener than before, and became intolerably interesting.\n\nI think that in \"Tom Sawyer\" I starved Injun Joe to death in the cave.\nBut that may have been to meet the exigencies of romantic literature. I\ncan't remember now whether the real Injun Joe died in the cave or out of\nit, but I do remember that the news of his death reached me at a most\nunhappy time--that is to say, just at bedtime on a summer night when a\nprodigious storm of thunder and lightning accompanied by a deluging rain\nthat turned the streets and lanes into rivers, caused me to repent and\nresolve to lead a better life. I can remember those awful thunder-bursts\nand the white glare of the lightning yet, and the wild lashing of the\nrain against the window-panes. By my teachings I perfectly well knew\nwhat all that wild riot was for--Satan had come to get Injun Joe. I had\nno shadow of doubt about it. It was the proper thing when a person like\nInjun Joe was required in the under world, and I should have thought it\nstrange and unaccountable if Satan had come for him in a less impressive\nway. With every glare of lightning I shrivelled and shrunk together in\nmortal terror, and in the interval of black darkness that followed I\npoured out my lamentings over my lost condition, and my supplications\nfor just one more chance, with an energy and feeling and sincerity quite\nforeign to my nature.\n\nBut in the morning I saw that it was a false alarm and concluded to\nresume business at the old stand and wait for another reminder.\n\nThe axiom says \"History repeats itself.\" A week or two ago Mr.\nBlank-Blank dined with us. At dinner he mentioned a circumstance which\nflashed me back over about sixty years and landed me in that little\nbedroom on that tempestuous night, and brought to my mind how creditable\nto me was my conduct through the whole night, and how barren it was of\nmoral spot or fleck during that entire period: he said Mr. X was sexton,\nor something, of the Episcopal church in his town, and had been for many\nyears the competent superintendent of all the church's worldly affairs,\nand was regarded by the whole congregation as a stay, a blessing, a\npriceless treasure. But he had a couple of defects--not large defects,\nbut they seemed large when flung against the background of his\nprofoundly religious character: he drank a good deal, and he could\noutswear a brakeman. A movement arose to persuade him to lay aside these\nvices, and after consulting with his pal, who occupied the same position\nas himself in the other Episcopal church, and whose defects were\nduplicates of his own and had inspired regret in the congregation he was\nserving, they concluded to try for reform--not wholesale, but half at a\ntime. They took the liquor pledge and waited for results. During nine\ndays the results were entirely satisfactory, and they were recipients of\nmany compliments and much congratulation. Then on New-year's eve they\nhad business a mile and a half out of town, just beyond the State line.\nEverything went well with them that evening in the barroom of the\ninn--but at last the celebration of the occasion by those villagers\ncame to be of a burdensome nature. It was a bitter cold night and the\nmultitudinous hot toddies that were circulating began by and by to exert\na powerful influence upon the new prohibitionists. At last X's friend\nremarked,\n\n\"X, does it occur to you that we are _outside the diocese_?\"\n\nThat ended reform No. 1. Then they took a chance in reform No. 2. For a\nwhile that one prospered, and they got much applause. I now reach the\nincident which sent me back a matter of sixty years, as I have remarked\na while ago.\n\nOne morning Mr. Blank-Blank met X on the street and said,\n\n\"You have made a gallant struggle against those defects of yours. I am\naware that you failed on No. 1, but I am also aware that you are having\nbetter luck with No. 2.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" X said; \"No. 2 is all right and sound up to date, and we are full\nof hope.\"\n\nBlank-Blank said, \"X, of course you have your troubles like other\npeople, but they never show on the outside. I have never seen you when\nyou were not cheerful. Are you always cheerful? Really always cheerful?\"\n\n\"Well, no,\" he said, \"no, I can't say that I am always cheerful,\nbut--well, you know that kind of a night that comes: _say_--you wake up\n'way in the night and the whole world is sunk in gloom and there are\nstorms and earthquakes and all sorts of disasters in the air\nthreatening, and you get cold and clammy; and when that happens to me I\nrecognize how sinful I am and it all goes clear to my heart and wrings\nit and I have such terrors and terrors!--oh, they are indescribable,\nthose terrors that assail me, and I slip out of bed and get on my knees\nand pray and pray and promise that I will be good, if I can only have\nanother chance. And then, you know, in the morning the sun shines out so\nlovely, and the birds sing and the whole world is so beautiful, and--_b'\nGod, I rally!_\"\n\nNow I will quote a brief paragraph from this letter which I have a\nminute ago spoken of. The writer says:\n\n\n     You no doubt are at a loss to know who I am. I will tell you. In my\n     younger days I was a resident of Hannibal, Mo., and you and I were\n     schoolmates attending Mr. Dawson's school along with Sam and Will\n     Bowen and Andy Fuqua and others whose names I have forgotten. I was\n     then about the smallest boy in school, for my age, and they called\n     me little Aleck for short.\n\n\nI only dimly remember him, but I knew those other people as well as I\nknew the town drunkards. I remember Dawson's schoolhouse perfectly. If I\nwanted to describe it I could save myself the trouble by conveying the\ndescription of it to these pages from \"Tom Sawyer.\" I can remember the\ndrowsy and inviting summer sounds that used to float in through the open\nwindows from that distant boy-Paradise, Cardiff Hill (Holliday's Hill),\nand mingle with the murmurs of the studying pupils and make them the\nmore dreary by the contrast. I remember Andy Fuqua, the oldest pupil--a\nman of twenty-five. I remember the youngest pupil, Nannie Owsley, a\nchild of seven. I remember George Robards, eighteen or twenty years old,\nthe only pupil who studied Latin. I remember--in some cases vividly, in\nothers vaguely--the rest of the twenty-five boys and girls. I remember\nMr. Dawson very well. I remember his boy, Theodore, who was as good as\nhe could be. In fact, he was inordinately good, extravagantly good,\noffensively good, detestably good--and he had pop-eyes--and I would have\ndrowned him if I had had a chance. In that school we were all about on\nan equality, and, so far as I remember, the passion of envy had no place\nin our hearts, except in the case of Arch Fuqua--the other one's\nbrother. Of course we all went barefoot in the summer-time. Arch Fuqua\nwas about my own age--ten or eleven. In the winter we could stand him,\nbecause he wore shoes then, and his great gift was hidden from our sight\nand we were enabled to forget it. But in the summer-time he was a\nbitterness to us. He was our envy, for he could double back his big toe\nand let it fly and you could hear it snap thirty yards. There was not\nanother boy in the school that could approach this feat. He had not a\nrival as regards a physical distinction--except in Theodore Eddy, who\ncould work his ears like a horse. But he was no real rival, because you\ncouldn't hear him work his ears; so all the advantage lay with Arch\nFuqua.\n\nI am not done with Dawson's school; I will return to it in a later\nchapter.\n\n[_Dictated at Hamilton, Bermuda, January 6, 1907._] \"That reminds me.\"\nIn conversation we are always using that phrase, and seldom or never\nnoticing how large a significance it bears. It stands for a curious and\ninteresting fact, to wit: that sleeping or waking, dreaming or talking,\nthe thoughts which swarm through our heads are almost constantly,\nalmost continuously, accompanied by a like swarm of reminders of\nincidents and episodes of our past. A man can never know what a large\ntraffic this commerce of association carries on in our minds until he\nsets out to write his autobiography; he then finds that a thought is\nseldom born to him that does not immediately remind him of some event,\nlarge or small, in his past experience. Quite naturally these remarks\nremind me of various things, among others this: that sometimes a\nthought, by the power of association, will bring back to your mind a\nlost word or a lost name which you have not been able to recover by any\nother process known to your mental equipment. Yesterday we had an\ninstance of this. Rev. Joseph H. Twichell is with me on this flying trip\nto Bermuda. He was with me on my last visit to Bermuda, and to-day we\nwere trying to remember when it was. We thought it was somewhere in the\nneighborhood of thirty years ago, but that was as near as we could get\nat the date. Twichell said that the landlady in whose boarding-house we\nsojourned in that ancient time could doubtless furnish us the date, and\nwe must look her up. We wanted to see her, anyway, because she and her\nblooming daughter of eighteen were the only persons whose acquaintance\nwe had made at that time, for we were travelling under fictitious names,\nand people who wear aliases are not given to seeking society and\nbringing themselves under suspicion. But at this point in our talk we\nencountered an obstruction: we could not recall the landlady's name. We\nhunted all around through our minds for that name, using all the\ncustomary methods of research, but without success; the name was gone\nfrom us, apparently permanently. We finally gave the matter up, and fell\nto talking about something else. The talk wandered from one subject to\nanother, and finally arrived at Twichell's school-days in Hartford--the\nHartford of something more than half a century ago--and he mentioned\nseveral of his schoolmasters, dwelling with special interest upon the\npeculiarities of an aged one named Olney. He remarked that Olney, humble\nvillage schoolmaster as he was, was yet a man of superior parts, and had\npublished text-books which had enjoyed a wide currency in America in\ntheir day. I said I remembered those books, and had studied Olney's\nGeography in school when I was a boy. Then Twichell said,\n\n\"That reminds me--our landlady's name was a name that was associated\nwith school-books of some kind or other fifty or sixty years ago. I\nwonder what it was. I believe it began with K.\"\n\nAssociation did the rest, and did it instantly. I said,\n\n\"Kirkham's Grammar!\"\n\nThat settled it. Kirkham was the name; and we went out to seek for the\nowner of it. There was no trouble about that, for Bermuda is not large,\nand is like the earlier Garden of Eden, in that everybody in it knows\neverybody else, just as it was in the serpent's headquarters in Adam's\ntime. We easily found Miss Kirkham--she that had been the blooming girl\nof a generation before--and she was still keeping boarders; but her\nmother had passed from this life. She settled the date for us, and did\nit with certainty, by help of a couple of uncommon circumstances, events\nof that ancient time. She said we had sailed from Bermuda on the 24th of\nMay, 1877, which was the day on which her only nephew was born--and he\nis now thirty years of age. The other unusual circumstance--she called\nit an unusual circumstance, and I didn't say anything--was that on that\nday the Rev. Mr. Twichell (bearing the assumed name of Peters) had made\na statement to her which she regarded as a fiction. I remembered the\ncircumstance very well. We had bidden the young girl good-by and had\ngone fifty yards, perhaps, when Twichell said he had forgotten something\n(I doubted it) and must go back. When he rejoined me he was silent, and\nthis alarmed me, because I had not seen an example of it before. He\nseemed quite uncomfortable, and I asked him what the trouble was. He\nsaid he had been inspired to give the girl a pleasant surprise, and so\nhad gone back and said to her--\n\n\"That young fellow's name is not Wilkinson--that's Mark Twain.\"\n\nShe did not lose her mind; she did not exhibit any excitement at all,\nbut said quite simply, quite tranquilly,\n\n\"Tell it to the marines, Mr. Peters--if that should happen to be _your_\nname.\"\n\nIt was very pleasant to meet her again. We were white-headed, but she\nwas not; in the sweet and unvexed spiritual atmosphere of the Bermudas\none does not achieve gray hairs at forty-eight.\n\nI had a dream last night, and of course it was born of association, like\nnearly everything else that drifts into a person's head, asleep or\nawake. On board ship, on the passage down, Twichell was talking about\nthe swiftly developing possibilities of aerial navigation, and he quoted\nthose striking verses of Tennyson's which forecast a future when\nair-borne vessels of war shall meet and fight above the clouds and\nredden the earth below with a rain of blood. This picture of carnage and\nblood and death reminded me of something which I had read a fortnight\nago--statistics of railway accidents compiled by the United States\nGovernment, wherein the appalling fact was set forth that on our 200,000\nmiles of railway we annually kill 10,000 persons outright and injure\n80,000. The war-ships in the air suggested the railway horrors, and\nthree nights afterward the railway horrors suggested my dream. The work\nof association was going on in my head, unconsciously, all that time. It\nwas an admirable dream, what there was of it.\n\nIn it I saw a funeral procession; I saw it from a mountain peak; I saw\nit crawling along and curving here and there, serpentlike, through a\nlevel vast plain. I seemed to see a hundred miles of the procession, but\nneither the beginning of it nor the end of it was within the limits of\nmy vision. The procession was in ten divisions, each division marked by\na sombre flag, and the whole represented ten years of our railway\nactivities in the accident line; each division was composed of 80,000\ncripples, and was bearing its own year's 10,000 mutilated corpses to the\ngrave: in the aggregate 800,000 cripples and 100,000 dead, drenched in\nblood!\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[17] It isn't yet. Title of it, \"Captain Stormfield's Visit to\nHeaven.\"--S. L. C.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XXII.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n[Sidenote: (1890.)]\n\n[_Dictated, October 10, 1906._] Susy has named a number of the friends\nwho were assembled at Onteora at the time of our visit, but there were\nothers--among them Laurence Hutton, Charles Dudley Warner, and Carroll\nBeckwith, and their wives. It was a bright and jolly company. Some of\nthose choice spirits are still with us; the others have passed from this\nlife: Mrs. Clemens, Susy, Mr. Warner, Mary Mapes Dodge, Laurence Hutton,\nDean Sage--peace to their ashes! Susy is in error in thinking Mrs. Dodge\nwas not there at that time; we were her guests.\n\nWe arrived at nightfall, dreary from a tiresome journey; but the\ndreariness did not last. Mrs. Dodge had provided a home-made banquet,\nand the happy company sat down to it, twenty strong, or more. Then the\nthing happened which always happens at large dinners, and is always\nexasperating: everybody talked to his elbow-mates and all talked at\nonce, and gradually raised their voices higher, and higher, and higher,\nin the desperate effort to be heard. It was like a riot, an\ninsurrection; it was an intolerable volume of noise. Presently I said to\nthe lady next me--\n\n\"I will subdue this riot, I will silence this racket. There is only one\nway to do it, but I know the art. You must tilt your head toward mine\nand seem to be deeply interested in what I am saying; I will talk in a\nlow voice; then, just because our neighbors won't be able to hear me,\nthey will _want_ to hear me. If I mumble long enough--say two\nminutes--you will see that the dialogues will one after another come to\na standstill, and there will be silence, not a sound anywhere but my\nmumbling.\"\n\nThen in a very low voice I began:\n\n\"When I went out to Chicago, eleven years ago, to witness the Grant\nfestivities, there was a great banquet on the first night, with six\nhundred ex-soldiers present. The gentleman who sat next me was Mr. X. X.\nHe was very hard of hearing, and he had a habit common to deaf people of\nshouting his remarks instead of delivering them in an ordinary voice. He\nwould handle his knife and fork in reflective silence for five or six\nminutes at a time and then suddenly fetch out a shout that would make\nyou jump out of the United States.\"\n\nBy this time the insurrection at Mrs. Dodge's table--at least that part\nof it in my immediate neighborhood--had died down, and the silence was\nspreading, couple by couple, down the long table. I went on in a lower\nand still lower mumble, and most impressively--\n\n\"During one of Mr. X. X.'s mute intervals, a man opposite us approached\nthe end of a story which he had been telling his elbow-neighbor. He was\nspeaking in a low voice--there was much noise--I was deeply interested,\nand straining my ears to catch his words, stretching my neck, holding my\nbreath, to hear, unconscious of everything but the fascinating tale. I\nheard him say, 'At this point he seized her by her long hair--she\nshrieking and begging--bent her neck across his knee, and with one awful\nsweep of the razor--'\n\n\"HOW DO YOU LIKE CHICA-A-AGO?!!!\"\n\nThat was X. X.'s interruption, hearable at thirty miles. By the time I\nhad reached that place in my mumblings Mrs. Dodge's dining-room was so\nsilent, so breathlessly still, that if you had dropped a thought\nanywhere in it you could have heard it smack the floor.[18] When I\ndelivered that yell the entire dinner company jumped as one person, and\npunched their heads through the ceiling, damaging it, for it was only\nlath and plaster, and it all came down on us, and much of it went into\nthe victuals and made them gritty, but no one was hurt. Then I explained\nwhy it was that I had played that game, and begged them to take the\nmoral of it home to their hearts and be rational and merciful\nthenceforth, and cease from screaming in mass, and agree to let one\nperson talk at a time and the rest listen in grateful and unvexed peace.\nThey granted my prayer, and we had a happy time all the rest of the\nevening; I do not think I have ever had a better time in my life. This\nwas largely because the new terms enabled me to keep the floor--now that\nI had it--and do all the talking myself. I do like to hear myself talk.\nSusy has exposed this in her Biography of me.\n\nDean Sage was a delightful man, yet in one way a terror to his friends,\nfor he loved them so well that he could not refrain from playing\npractical jokes on them. We have to be pretty deeply in love with a\nperson before we can do him the honor of joking familiarly with him.\nDean Sage was the best citizen I have known in America. It takes courage\nto be a good citizen, and he had plenty of it. He allowed no individual\nand no corporation to infringe his smallest right and escape unpunished.\nHe was very rich, and very generous, and benevolent, and he gave away\nhis money with a prodigal hand; but if an individual or corporation\ninfringed a right of his, to the value of ten cents, he would spend\nthousands of dollars' worth of time and labor and money and persistence\non the matter, and would not lower his flag until he had won his battle\nor lost it.\n\nHe and Rev. Mr. Harris had been classmates in college, and to the day of\nSage's death they were as fond of each other as an engaged pair. It\nfollows, without saying, that whenever Sage found an opportunity to play\na joke upon Harris, Harris was sure to suffer.\n\nAlong about 1873 Sage fell a victim to an illness which reduced him to a\nskeleton, and defied all the efforts of the physicians to cure it. He\nwent to the Adirondacks and took Harris with him. Sage had always been\nan active man, and he couldn't idle any day wholly away in inanition,\nbut walked every day to the limit of his strength. One day, toward\nnightfall, the pair came upon a humble log cabin which bore these words\npainted upon a shingle: \"Entertainment for Man and Beast.\" They were\nobliged to stop there for the night, Sage's strength being exhausted.\nThey entered the cabin and found its owner and sole occupant there, a\nrugged and sturdy and simple-hearted man of middle age. He cooked supper\nand placed it before the travellers--salt junk, boiled beans, corn bread\nand black coffee. Sage's stomach could abide nothing but the most\ndelicate food, therefore this banquet revolted him, and he sat at the\ntable unemployed, while Harris fed ravenously, limitlessly, gratefully;\nfor he had been chaplain in a fighting regiment all through the war, and\nhad kept in perfection the grand and uncritical appetite and splendid\nphysical vigor which those four years of tough fare and activity had\nfurnished him. Sage went supperless to bed, and tossed and writhed all\nnight upon a shuck mattress that was full of attentive and interested\ncorn-cobs. In the morning Harris was ravenous again, and devoured the\nodious breakfast as contentedly and as delightedly as he had devoured\nits twin the night before. Sage sat upon the porch, empty, and\ncontemplated the performance and meditated revenge. Presently he\nbeckoned to the landlord and took him aside and had a confidential talk\nwith him. He said,\n\n\"I am the paymaster. What is the bill?\"\n\n\"Two suppers, fifty cents; two beds, thirty cents; two breakfasts, fifty\ncents--total, a dollar and thirty cents.\"\n\nSage said, \"Go back and make out the bill and fetch it to me here on the\nporch. Make it thirteen dollars.\"\n\n\"Thirteen dollars! Why, it's impossible! I am no robber. I am charging\nyou what I charge everybody. It's a dollar and thirty cents, and that's\nall it is.\"\n\n\"My man, I've got something to say about this as well as you. It's\nthirteen dollars. You'll make out your bill for that, and you'll _take_\nit, too, or you'll not get a cent.\"\n\nThe man was troubled, and said, \"I don't understand this. I can't make\nit out.\"\n\n\"Well, I understand it. I know what I am about. It's thirteen dollars,\nand I want the bill made out for that. There's no other terms. Get it\nready and bring it out here. I will examine it and be outraged. You\nunderstand? I will dispute the bill. You must stand to it. You must\nrefuse to take less. I will begin to lose my temper; you must begin to\nlose yours. I will call you hard names; you must answer with harder\nones. I will raise my voice; you must raise yours. You must go into a\nrage--foam at the mouth, if you can; insert some soap to help it along.\nNow go along and follow your instructions.\"\n\nThe man played his assigned part, and played it well. He brought the\nbill and stood waiting for results. Sage's face began to cloud up, his\neyes to snap, and his nostrils to inflate like a horse's; then he broke\nout with--\n\n\"_Thirteen dollars!_ You mean to say that you charge thirteen dollars\nfor these damned inhuman hospitalities of yours? Are you a professional\nbuccaneer? Is it your custom to--\"\n\nThe man burst in with spirit: \"Now, I don't want any more out of\nyou--that's a plenty. The bill is thirteen dollars and you'll _pay_\nit--that's all; a couple of characterless adventurers bilking their way\nthrough this country and attempting to dictate terms to a gentleman! a\ngentleman who received you supposing you were gentlemen yourselves,\nwhereas in my opinion hell's full of--\"\n\nSage broke in--\n\n\"Not another word of that!--I won't have it. I regard you as the\nlowest-down thief that ever--\"\n\n\"Don't you use that word again! By ----, I'll take you by the neck\nand--\"\n\nHarris came rushing out, and just as the two were about to grapple he\npushed himself between them and began to implore--\n\n\"Oh, Dean, don't, _don't_--now, Mr. Smith, control yourself! Oh, think\nof your family, Dean!--think what a scandal--\"\n\nBut they burst out with maledictions, imprecations and all the hard\nnames they could dig out of the rich accumulations of their educated\nmemories, and in the midst of it the man shouted--\n\n\"When _gentlemen_ come to this house, I treat them _as_ gentlemen. When\npeople come to this house with the ordinary appetites of gentlemen, I\ncharge them a dollar and thirty cents for what I furnished you; but when\na man brings a hell-fired Famine here that gorges a barrel of pork and\nfour barrels of beans at two sittings--\"\n\nSage broke in, in a voice that was eloquent with remorse and\nself-reproach, \"I never thought of that, and I ask your pardon; I am\nashamed of myself and of my friend. Here's your thirteen dollars, and my\napologies along with it.\"\n\n\n[_Dictated March 12, 1906._] I have always taken a great interest in\nother people's duels. One always feels an abiding interest in any heroic\nthing which has entered into his own experience.\n\n[Sidenote: (1878.)]\n\nIn 1878, fourteen years after my unmaterialized duel, Messieurs Fortu\nand Gambetta fought a duel which made heroes of both of them in France,\nbut made them rather ridiculous throughout the rest of the world. I was\nliving in Munich that fall and winter, and I was so interested in that\nfunny tragedy that I wrote a long account of it, and it is in one of my\nbooks, somewhere--an account which had some inaccuracies in it, but as\nan exhibition of the _spirit_ of that duel, I think it was correct and\ntrustworthy. And when I was living in Vienna, thirty-four years after my\nineffectual duel, my interest in that kind of incident was still strong;\nand I find here among my Autobiographical manuscripts of that day a\nchapter which I began concerning it, but did not finish. I wanted to\nfinish it, but held it open in the hope that the Italian ambassador, M.\nNigra, would find time to furnish me the _full_ history of Se\u00f1or\nCavalotti's adventures in that line. But he was a busy man; there was\nalways an interruption before he could get well started; so my hope was\nnever fulfilled. The following is the unfinished chapter:\n\n\n[Sidenote: (1898.)]\n\n     As concerns duelling. This pastime is as common in Austria to-day\n     as it is in France. But with this difference, that here in the\n     Austrian States the duel is dangerous, while in France it is not.\n     Here it is tragedy, in France it in comedy; here it is a solemnity,\n     there it is monkey-shines; here the duellist risks his life, there\n     he does not even risk his shirt. Here he fights with pistol or\n     sabre, in France with a hairpin--a blunt one. Here the desperately\n     wounded man tries to walk to the hospital; there they paint the\n     scratch so that they can find it again, lay the sufferer on a\n     stretcher, and conduct him off the field with a band of music.\n\n     At the end of a French duel the pair hug and kiss and cry, and\n     praise each other's valor; then the surgeons make an examination\n     and pick out the scratched one, and the other one helps him on to\n     the litter and pays his fare; and in return the scratched one\n     treats to champagne and oysters in the evening, and then \"the\n     incident is closed,\" as the French say. It is all polite, and\n     gracious, and pretty, and impressive. At the end of an Austrian\n     duel the antagonist that is alive gravely offers his hand to the\n     other man, utters some phrases of courteous regret, then bids him\n     good-by and goes his way, and that incident also is closed. The\n     French duellist is painstakingly protected from danger, by the\n     rules of the game. His antagonist's weapon cannot reach so far as\n     his body; if he get a scratch it will not be above his elbow. But\n     in Austria the rules of the game do not provide against danger,\n     they carefully provide _for_ it, usually. Commonly the combat must\n     be kept up until one of the men is disabled; a non-disabling slash\n     or stab does not retire him.\n\n     For a matter of three months I watched the Viennese journals, and\n     whenever a duel was reported in their telegraphic columns I\n     scrap-booked it. By this record I find that duelling in Austria is\n     not confined to journalists and old maids, as in France, but is\n     indulged in by military men, journalists, students, physicians,\n     lawyers, members of the legislature, and even the Cabinet, the\n     Bench and the police. Duelling is forbidden by law; and so it seems\n     odd to see the makers and administrators of the laws dancing on\n     their work in this way. Some months ago Count Bodeni, at that time\n     Chief of the Government, fought a pistol-duel here in the capital\n     city of the Empire with representative Wolf, and both of those\n     distinguished Christians came near getting turned out of the\n     Church--for the Church as well as the State forbids duelling.\n\n     In one case, lately, in Hungary, the police interfered and stopped\n     a duel after the first innings. This was a sabre-duel between the\n     chief of police and the city attorney. Unkind things were said\n     about it by the newspapers. They said the police remembered their\n     duty uncommonly well when their own officials were the parties\n     concerned in duels. But I think the underlings showed good\n     bread-and-butter judgment. If their superiors had carved each other\n     well, the public would have asked, Where were the police? and their\n     places would have been endangered; but custom does not require them\n     to be around where mere unofficial citizens are explaining a thing\n     with sabres.\n\n     There was another duel--a double duel--going on in the immediate\n     neighborhood at the time, and in this case the police obeyed custom\n     and did not disturb it. Their bread and butter was not at stake\n     there. In this duel a physician fought a couple of surgeons, and\n     wounded both--one of them lightly, the other seriously. An\n     undertaker wanted to keep people from interfering, but that was\n     quite natural again.\n\n     Selecting at random from my record, I next find a duel at Tarnopol\n     between military men. An officer of the Tenth Dragoons charged an\n     officer of the Ninth Dragoons with an offence against the laws of\n     the card-table. There was a defect or a doubt somewhere in the\n     matter, and this had to be examined and passed upon by a Court of\n     Honor. So the case was sent up to Lemberg for this purpose. One\n     would like to know what the defect was, but the newspaper does not\n     say. A man here who has fought many duels and has a graveyard, says\n     that probably the matter in question was as to whether the\n     accusation was true or not; that if the charge was a very grave\n     one--cheating, for instance--proof of its truth would rule the\n     guilty officer out of the field of honor; the Court would not allow\n     a gentleman to fight with such a person. You see what a solemn\n     thing it is; you see how particular they are; any little careless\n     act can lose you your privilege of getting yourself shot, here. The\n     Court seems to have gone into the matter in a searching and careful\n     fashion, for several months elapsed before it reached a decision.\n     It then sanctioned a duel and the accused killed his accuser.\n\n     Next I find a duel between a prince and a major; first with\n     pistols--no result satisfactory to either party; then with sabres,\n     and the major badly hurt.\n\n     Next, a sabre-duel between journalists--the one a strong man, the\n     other feeble and in poor health. It was brief; the strong one drove\n     his sword through the weak one, and death was immediate.\n\n     Next, a duel between a lieutenant and a student of medicine.\n     According to the newspaper report these are the details. The\n     student was in a restaurant one evening: passing along, he halted\n     at a table to speak with some friends; near by sat a dozen military\n     men; the student conceived that one of these was \"staring\" at him;\n     he asked the officer to step outside and explain. This officer and\n     another one gathered up their caps and sabres and went out with the\n     student. Outside--this is the student's account--the student\n     introduced himself to the offending officer and said, \"You seemed\n     to stare at me\"; for answer, the officer struck at the student with\n     his fist; the student parried the blow; both officers drew their\n     sabres and attacked the young fellow, and one of them gave him a\n     wound on the left arm; then they withdrew. This was Saturday night.\n     The duel followed on Monday, in the military riding-school--the\n     customary duelling-ground all over Austria, apparently. The weapons\n     were pistols. The duelling terms were somewhat beyond custom in the\n     matter of severity, if I may gather that from the statement that\n     the combat was fought \"_unter sehr schweren Bedingungen_\"--to wit,\n     \"Distance, 15 steps--with 3 steps advance.\" There was but one\n     exchange of shots. The student was hit. \"He put his hand on his\n     breast, his body began to bend slowly forward, then collapsed in\n     death and sank to the ground.\"\n\n     It is pathetic. There are other duels in my list, but I find in\n     each and all of them one and the same ever-recurring defect--the\n     _principals_ are never present, but only their sham\n     representatives. The _real_ principals in any duel are not the\n     duellists themselves, but their families. They do the mourning, the\n     suffering, theirs is the loss and theirs the misery. They stake all\n     that, the duellist stakes nothing but his life, and that is a\n     trivial thing compared with what his death must cost those whom he\n     leaves behind him. Challenges should not mention the duellist; he\n     has nothing much at stake, and the real vengeance cannot reach him.\n     The challenge should summon the offender's old gray mother, and his\n     young wife and his little children,--these, or any to whom he is a\n     dear and worshipped possession--and should say, \"You have done me\n     no harm, but I am the meek slave of a custom which requires me to\n     crush the happiness out of your hearts and condemn you to years of\n     pain and grief, in order that I may wash clean with your tears a\n     stain which has been put upon me by another person.\"\n\n     The logic of it is admirable: a person has robbed me of a penny; I\n     must beggar ten innocent persons to make good my loss. Surely\n     nobody's \"honor\" is worth all that.\n\n     Since the duellist's family are the real principals in a duel, the\n     State ought to compel them to be present at it. Custom, also, ought\n     to be so amended as to require it; and without it no duel ought to\n     be allowed to go on. If that student's unoffending mother had been\n     present and watching the officer through her tears as he raised his\n     pistol, he--why, he would have fired in the air. We know that. For\n     we know how we are all made. Laws ought to be based upon the\n     ascertained facts of our nature. It would be a simple thing to make\n     a duelling law which would stop duelling.\n\n     As things are now, the mother is never invited. She submits to\n     this; and without outward complaint, for she, too, is the vassal of\n     custom, and custom requires her to conceal her pain when she learns\n     the disastrous news that her son must go to the duelling-field, and\n     by the powerful force that is lodged in habit and custom she is\n     enabled to obey this trying requirement--a requirement which exacts\n     a miracle of her, and gets it. Last January a neighbor of ours who\n     has a young son in the army was wakened by this youth at three\n     o'clock one morning, and she sat up in bed and listened to his\n     message:\n\n     \"I have come to tell you something, mother, which will distress\n     you, but you must be good and brave, and bear it. I have been\n     affronted by a fellow officer, and we fight at three this\n     afternoon. Lie down and sleep, now, and think no more about it.\"\n\n     She kissed him good night and lay down paralyzed with grief and\n     fear, but said nothing. But she did not sleep; she prayed and\n     mourned till the first streak of dawn, then fled to the nearest\n     church and implored the Virgin for help; and from that church she\n     went to another and another and another; church after church, and\n     still church after church, and so spent all the day until three\n     o'clock on her knees in agony and tears; then dragged herself home\n     and sat down comfortless and desolate, to count the minutes, and\n     wait, with an outward show of calm, for what had been ordained for\n     her--happiness, or endless misery. Presently she heard the clank of\n     a sabre--she had not known before what music was in that\n     sound!--and her son put his head in and said:\n\n     \"X was in the wrong, and he apologized.\"\n\n     So that incident was closed; and for the rest of her life the\n     mother will always find something pleasant about the clank of a\n     sabre, no doubt.\n\n     In one of my listed duels--however, let it go, there is nothing\n     particularly striking about it except that the seconds interfered.\n     And prematurely, too, for neither man was dead. This was certainly\n     irregular. Neither of the men liked it. It was a duel with cavalry\n     sabres, between an editor and a lieutenant. The editor walked to\n     the hospital, the lieutenant was carried. In this country an editor\n     who can write well is valuable, but he is not likely to remain so\n     unless he can handle a sabre with charm.\n\n     The following very recent telegram shows that also in France duels\n     are humanely stopped as soon as they approach the (French)\n     danger-point:\n\n     \"_Reuter's Telegram._--PARIS, _March 5_.--The duel between Colonels\n     Henry and Picquart took place this morning in the Riding School of\n     the Ecole Militaire, the doors of which were strictly guarded in\n     order to prevent intrusion. The combatants, who fought with swords,\n     were in position at ten o'clock.\n\n     \"At the first reengagement Lieutenant-Colonel Henry was slightly\n     scratched in the fore arm, and just at the same moment his own\n     blade appeared to touch his adversary's neck. Senator Ranc, who was\n     Colonel Picquart's second, stopped the fight, but as it was found\n     that his principal had not been touched, the combat continued. A\n     very sharp encounter ensued, in which Colonel Henry was wounded in\n     the elbow, and the duel terminated.\"\n\n     After which, the stretcher and the band. In lurid contrast with\n     this delicate flirtation, we have this fatal duel of day before\n     yesterday in Italy, where the earnest Austrian duel is in vogue. I\n     knew Cavalotti slightly, and this gives me a sort of personal\n     interest in his duel. I first saw him in Rome several years ago. He\n     was sitting on a block of stone in the Forum, and was writing\n     something in his note-book--a poem or a challenge, or something\n     like that--and the friend who pointed him out to me said, \"That is\n     Cavalotti--he has fought thirty duels; do not disturb him.\" I did\n     not disturb him.\n\n\n[_May 13, 1907._] It is a long time ago. Cavalotti--poet, orator,\nsatirist, statesman, patriot--was a great man, and his death was deeply\nlamented by his countrymen: many monuments to his memory testify to\nthis. In his duels he killed several of his antagonists and disabled the\nrest. By nature he was a little irascible. Once when the officials of\nthe library of Bologna threw out his books the gentle poet went up there\nand challenged the whole fifteen! His parliamentary duties were\nexacting, but he proposed to keep coming up and fighting duels between\ntrains until all those officials had been retired from the activities of\nlife. Although he always chose the sword to fight with, he had never had\na lesson with that weapon. When game was called he waited for nothing,\nbut always plunged at his opponent and rained such a storm of wild and\noriginal thrusts and whacks upon him that the man was dead or crippled\nbefore he could bring his science to bear. But his latest antagonist\ndiscarded science, and won. He held his sword straight forward like a\nlance when Cavalotti made his plunge--with the result that he impaled\nhimself upon it. It entered his mouth and passed out at the back of his\nneck. Death was instantaneous.\n\n\n[_Dictated December 20, 1906._] Six months ago, when I was recalling\nearly days in San Francisco, I broke off at a place where I was about\nto tell about Captain Osborn's odd adventure at the \"What Cheer,\" or\nperhaps it was at another cheap feeding-place--the \"Miners' Restaurant.\"\nIt was a place where one could get good food on the cheapest possible\nterms, and its popularity was great among the multitudes whose purses\nwere light It was a good place to go to, to observe mixed humanity.\nCaptain Osborn and Bret Harte went there one day and took a meal, and in\nthe course of it Osborn fished up an interesting reminiscence of a dozen\nyears before and told about it. It was to this effect:\n\nHe was a midshipman in the navy when the Californian gold craze burst\nupon the world and set it wild with excitement. His ship made the long\njourney around the Horn and was approaching her goal, the Golden Gate,\nwhen an accident happened.\n\n\"It happened to me,\" said Osborn. \"I fell overboard. There was a heavy\nsea running, but no one was much alarmed about me, because we had on\nboard a newly patented life-saving device which was believed to be\ncompetent to rescue anything that could fall overboard, from a\nmidshipman to an anchor. Ours was the only ship that had this device; we\nwere very proud of it, and had been anxious to give its powers a\npractical test. This thing was lashed to the garboard-strake of the\nmain-to'gallant mizzen-yard amidships,[19] and there was nothing to do\nbut cut the lashings and heave it over; it would do the rest. One day\nthe cry of 'Man overboard!' brought all hands on deck. Instantly the\nlashings were cut and the machine flung joyously over. Damnation, it\nwent to the bottom like an anvil! By the time that the ship was brought\nto and a boat manned, I was become but a bobbing speck on the waves half\na mile astern and losing my strength very fast; but by good luck there\nwas a common seaman on board who had practical ideas in his head and\nhadn't waited to see what the patent machine was going to do, but had\nrun aft and sprung over after me the moment the alarm was cried through\nthe ship. I had a good deal of a start of him, and the seas made his\nprogress slow and difficult, but he stuck to his work and fought his way\nto me, and just in the nick of time he put his saving arms about me when\nI was about to go down. He held me up until the boat reached us and\nrescued us. By that time I was unconscious, and I was still unconscious\nwhen we arrived at the ship. A dangerous fever followed, and I was\ndelirious for three days; then I come to myself and at once inquired\nfor my benefactor, of course. He was gone. We were lying at anchor in\nthe Bay and every man had deserted to the gold-mines except the\ncommissioned officers. I found out nothing about my benefactor but his\nname--Burton Sanders--a name which I have held in grateful memory ever\nsince. Every time I have been on the Coast, these twelve or thirteen\nyears, I have tried to get track of him, but have never succeeded. I\nwish I could find him and make him understand that his brave act has\nnever been forgotten by me. Harte, I would rather see him and take him\nby the hand than any other man on the planet.\"\n\nAt this stage or a little later there was an interruption. A waiter near\nby said to another waiter, pointing,\n\n\"Take a look at that tramp that's coming in. Ain't that the one that\nbilked the house, last week, out of ten cents?\"\n\n\"I believe it is. Let him alone--don't pay any attention to him; wait\ntill we can get a good look at him.\"\n\nThe tramp approached timidly and hesitatingly, with the air of one\nunsure and apprehensive. The waiters watched him furtively. When he was\npassing behind Harte's chair one of them said,\n\n\"He's the one!\"--and they pounced upon him and proposed to turn him over\nto the police as a bilk. He begged piteously. He confessed his guilt,\nbut said he had been driven to his crime by necessity--that when he had\neaten the plate of beans and flipped out without paying for it, it was\nbecause he was starving, and hadn't the ten cents to pay for it with.\nBut the waiters would listen to no explanations, no palliations; he must\nbe placed in custody. He brushed his hand across his eyes and said\nmeekly that he would submit, being friendless. Each waiter took him by\nan arm and faced him about to conduct him away. Then his melancholy eyes\nfell upon Captain Osborn, and a light of glad and eager recognition\nflashed from them. He said,\n\n\"Weren't you a midshipman once, sir, in the old 'Lancaster'?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Osborn. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Didn't you fall overboard?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did. How do you come to know about it?\"\n\n\"Wasn't there a new patent machine aboard, and didn't they throw it over\nto save you?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said Osborn, laughing gently, \"but it didn't do it.\"\n\n\"No, sir, it was a sailor that done it.\"\n\n\"It certainly was. Look here, my man, you are getting distinctly\ninteresting. Were you of our crew?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I was.\"\n\n\"I reckon you may be right. You do certainly know a good deal about that\nincident. What is your name?\"\n\n\"Burton Sanders.\"\n\nThe Captain sprang up, excited, and said,\n\n\"Give me your hand! Give me both your hands! I'd rather shake them than\ninherit a fortune!\"--and then he cried to the waiters, \"Let him\ngo!--take your hands off! He is my guest, and can have anything and\neverything this house is able to furnish. I am responsible.\"\n\nThere was a love-feast, then. Captain Osborn ordered it regardless of\nexpense, and he and Harte sat there and listened while the man told\nstirring adventures of his life and fed himself up to the eyebrows. Then\nOsborn wanted to be benefactor in his turn, and pay back some of his\ndebt. The man said it could all be paid with ten dollars--that it had\nbeen so long since he had owned that amount of money that it would seem\na fortune to him, and he should be grateful beyond words if the Captain\ncould spare him that amount. The Captain spared him ten broad\ntwenty-dollar gold pieces, and made him take them in spite of his modest\nprotestations, and gave him his address and said he must never fail to\ngive him notice when he needed grateful service.\n\nSeveral months later Harte stumbled upon the man in the street. He was\nmost comfortably drunk, and pleasant and chatty. Harte remarked upon the\nsplendidly and movingly dramatic incident of the restaurant, and said,\n\n\"How curious and fortunate and happy and interesting it was that you two\nshould come together, after that long separation, and at exactly the\nright moment to save you from disaster and turn your defeat by the\nwaiters into a victory. A preacher could make a great sermon out of\nthat, for it does look as if the hand of Providence was in it.\"\n\nThe hero's face assumed a sweetly genial expression, and he said,\n\n\"Well now, it wasn't Providence this time. I was running the\narrangements myself.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, I hadn't ever seen the gentleman before. I was at the next table,\nwith my back to you the whole time he was telling about it. I saw my\nchance, and slipped out and fetched the two waiters with me and offered\nto give them a commission out of what I could get out of the Captain if\nthey would do a quarrel act with me and give me an opening. So, then,\nafter a minute or two I straggled back, and you know the rest of it as\nwell as I do.\"\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[18] This was tried.

T.\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCXXIII.\n\nOCTOBER, 1907.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XXIII.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n[Sidenote: (1845.)]\n\n[_Dictated March 9, 1906._] ... I am talking of a time sixty years ago,\nand upwards. I remember the names of some of those schoolmates, and, by\nfitful glimpses, even their faces rise dimly before me for a\nmoment--only just long enough to be recognized; then they vanish. I\ncatch glimpses of George Robards, the Latin pupil--slender, pale,\nstudious, bending over his book and absorbed in it, his long straight\nblack hair hanging down below his jaws like a pair of curtains on the\nsides of his face. I can see him give his head a toss and flirt one of\nthe curtains back around his head--to get it out of his way, apparently;\nreally to show off. In that day it was a great thing among the boys to\nhave hair of so flexible a sort that it could be flung back in that way,\nwith a flirt of the head. George Robards was the envy of us all. For\nthere was no hair among us that was so competent for this exhibition as\nhis--except, perhaps, the yellow locks of Will Bowen and John Robards.\nMy hair was a dense ruck of short curls, and so was my brother Henry's.\nWe tried all kinds of devices to get these crooks straightened out so\nthat they would flirt, but we never succeeded. Sometimes, by soaking our\nheads and then combing and brushing our hair down tight and flat to our\nskulls, we could get it straight, temporarily, and this gave us a\ncomforting moment of joy; but the first time we gave it a flirt it all\nshrivelled into curls again and our happiness was gone.\n\nJohn Robards was the little brother of George; he was a wee chap with\nsilky golden curtains to his face which dangled to his shoulders and\nbelow, and could be flung back ravishingly. When he was twelve years old\nhe crossed the plains with his father amidst the rush of the\ngold-seekers of '49; and I remember the departure of the cavalcade when\nit spurred westward. We were all there to see and to envy. And I can\nstill see that proud little chap sailing by on a great horse, with his\nlong locks streaming out behind. We were all on hand to gaze and envy\nwhen he returned, two years later, in unimaginable glory--_for he had\ntravelled_! None of us had ever been forty miles from home. But he had\ncrossed the Continent. He had been in the gold-mines, that fairyland of\nour imagination. And he had done a still more wonderful thing. He had\nbeen in ships--in ships on the actual ocean; in ships on three actual\noceans. For he had sailed down the Pacific and around the Horn among\nicebergs and through snow-storms and wild wintry gales, and had sailed\non and turned the corner and flown northward in the trades and up\nthrough the blistering equatorial waters--and there in his brown face\nwere the proofs of what he had been through. We would have sold our\nsouls to Satan for the privilege of trading places with him.\n\nI saw him when I was out on that Missouri trip four years ago. He was\nold then--though not quite so old as I--and the burden of life was upon\nhim. He said his granddaughter, twelve years old, had read my books and\nwould like to see me. It was a pathetic time, for she was a prisoner in\nher room and marked for death. And John knew that she was passing\nswiftly away. Twelve years old--just her grandfather's age when he rode\naway on that great journey with his yellow hair flapping behind him. In\nher I seemed to see that boy again. It was as if he had come back out of\nthat remote past and was present before me in his golden youth. Her\nmalady was heart disease, and her brief life came to a close a few days\nlater.\n\nAnother of those schoolboys was John Garth. He became a prosperous\nbanker and a prominent and valued citizen; and a few years ago he died,\nrich and honored. _He died._ It is what I have to say about so many of\nthose boys and girls. The widow still lives, and there are\ngrandchildren. In her pantalette days and my barefoot days she was a\nschoolmate of mine. I saw John's tomb when I made that Missouri visit.\n\nHer father, Mr. Kercheval, had an apprentice in the early days when I\nwas nine years old, and he had also a slave woman who had many merits.\nBut I can't feel very kindly or forgivingly toward either that good\napprentice boy or that good slave woman, for they saved my life. One day\nwhen I was playing on a loose log which I supposed was attached to a\nraft--but it wasn't--it tilted me into Bear Creek. And when I had been\nunder water twice and was coming up to make the third and fatal descent\nmy fingers appeared above the water and that slave woman seized them and\npulled me out. Within a week I was in again, and that apprentice had to\ncome along just at the wrong time, and he plunged in and dived, pawed\naround on the bottom and found me, and dragged me out and emptied the\nwater out of me, and I was saved again. I was drowned seven times after\nthat before I learned to swim--once in Bear Creek and six times in the\nMississippi. I do not now know who the people were who interfered with\nthe intentions of a Providence wiser than themselves, but I hold a\ngrudge against them yet. When I told the tale of these remarkable\nhappenings to Rev. Dr. Burton of Hartford, he said he did not believe\nit. _He slipped on the ice the very next year and sprained his ankle._\n\nWill Bowen was another schoolmate, and so was his brother, Sam, who was\nhis junior by a couple of years. Before the Civil War broke out, both\nbecame St. Louis and New Orleans pilots. Both are dead, long ago.\n\n[Sidenote: (1845.)]\n\n[_Dictated March 16, 1906._] We will return to those schoolchildren of\nsixty years ago. I recall Mary Miller. She was not my first sweetheart,\nbut I think she was the first one that furnished me a broken heart. I\nfell in love with her when she was eighteen and I was nine, but she\nscorned me, and I recognized that this was a cold world. I had not\nnoticed that temperature before. I believe I was as miserable as even a\ngrown man could be. But I think that this sorrow did not remain with me\nlong. As I remember it, I soon transferred my worship to Artimisia\nBriggs, who was a year older than Mary Miller. When I revealed my\npassion to her she did not scoff at it. She did not make fun of it. She\nwas very kind and gentle about it. But she was also firm, and said she\ndid not want to be pestered by children.\n\nAnd there was Mary Lacy. She was a schoolmate. But she also was out of\nmy class because of her advanced age. She was pretty wild and determined\nand independent. But she married, and at once settled down and became in\nall ways a model matron and was as highly respected as any matron in the\ntown. Four years ago she was still living, and had been married fifty\nyears.\n\nJimmie McDaniel was another schoolmate. His age and mine about tallied.\nHis father kept the candy-shop and he was the most envied little chap in\nthe town--after Tom Blankenship (\"Huck Finn\")--for although we never saw\nhim eating candy, we supposed that it was, nevertheless, his ordinary\ndiet. He pretended that he never ate it, and didn't care for it because\nthere was nothing forbidden about it--there was plenty of it and he\ncould have as much of it as he wanted. He was the first human being to\nwhom I ever told a humorous story, so far as I can remember. This was\nabout Jim Wolfe and the cats; and I gave him that tale the morning after\nthat memorable episode. I thought he would laugh his teeth out. I had\nnever been so proud and happy before, and have seldom been so proud and\nhappy since. I saw him four years ago when I was out there. He wore a\nbeard, gray and venerable, that came half-way down to his knees, and yet\nit was not difficult for me to recognize him. He had been married\nfifty-four years. He had many children and grandchildren and\ngreat-grandchildren, and also even posterity, they all said--\nthousands--yet the boy to whom I had told the cat story when we were\ncallow juveniles was still present in that cheerful little old man.\n\nArtimisia Briggs got married not long after refusing me. She married\nRichmond, the stone mason, who was my Methodist Sunday-school teacher in\nthe earliest days, and he had one distinction which I envied him: at\nsome time or other he had hit his thumb with his hammer and the result\nwas a thumb nail which remained permanently twisted and distorted and\ncurved and pointed, like a parrot's beak. I should not consider it an\nornament now, I suppose, but it had a fascination for me then, and a\nvast value, because it was the only one in the town. He was a very\nkindly and considerate Sunday-school teacher, and patient and\ncompassionate, so he was the favorite teacher with us little chaps. In\nthat school they had slender oblong pasteboard blue tickets, each with a\nverse from the Testament printed on it, and you could get a blue ticket\nby reciting two verses. By reciting five verses you could get three blue\ntickets, and you could trade these at the bookcase and borrow a book for\na week. I was under Mr. Richmond's spiritual care every now and then for\ntwo or three years, and he was never hard upon me. I always recited the\nsame five verses every Sunday. He was always satisfied with the\nperformance. He never seemed to notice that these were the same five\nfoolish virgins that he had been hearing about every Sunday for months.\nI always got my tickets and exchanged them for a book. They were pretty\ndreary books, for there was not a bad boy in the entire bookcase. They\nwere _all_ good boys and good girls and drearily uninteresting, but they\nwere better society than none, and I was glad to have their company and\ndisapprove of it.\n\n[Sidenote: (1849.)]\n\nTwenty years ago Mr. Richmond had become possessed of Tom Sawyer's cave\nin the hills three miles from town, and had made a tourist-resort of it.\nIn 1849 when the gold-seekers were streaming through our little town of\nHannibal, many of our grown men got the gold fever, and I think that all\nthe boys had it. On the Saturday holidays in summer-time we used to\nborrow skiffs whose owners were not present and go down the river three\nmiles to the cave hollow (Missourian for \"valley\"), and there we staked\nout claims and pretended to dig gold, panning out half a dollar a day at\nfirst; two or three times as much, later, and by and by whole fortunes,\nas our imaginations became inured to the work. Stupid and unprophetic\nlads! We were doing this in play and never suspecting. Why, that cave\nhollow and all the adjacent hills were made of gold! But we did not know\nit. We took it for dirt. We left its rich secret in its own peaceful\npossession and grew up in poverty and went wandering about the world\nstruggling for bread--and this because we had not the gift of prophecy.\nThat region was all dirt and rocks to us, yet all it needed was to be\nground up and scientifically handled and it was gold. That is to say,\nthe whole region was a cement-mine--and they make the finest kind of\nPortland cement there now, five thousand barrels a day, with a plant\nthat cost $2,000,000.\n\nFor a little while Reuel Gridley attended that school of ours. He was an\nelderly pupil; he was perhaps twenty-two or twenty-three years old. Then\ncame the Mexican War and he volunteered. A company of infantry was\nraised in our town and Mr. Hickman, a tall, straight, handsome athlete\nof twenty-five, was made captain of it and had a sword by his side and a\nbroad yellow stripe down the leg of his gray pants. And when that\ncompany marched back and forth through the streets in its smart\nuniform--which it did several times a day for drill--its evolutions were\nattended by all the boys whenever the school hours permitted. I can see\nthat marching company yet, and I can almost feel again the consuming\ndesire that I had to join it. But they had no use for boys of twelve and\nthirteen, and before I had a chance in another war the desire to kill\npeople to whom I had not been introduced had passed away.\n\nI saw the splendid Hickman in his old age. He seemed about the oldest\nman I had ever seen--an amazing and melancholy contrast with the showy\nyoung captain I had seen preparing his warriors for carnage so many,\nmany years before. Hickman is dead--it is the old story. As Susy said,\n\"What is it all for?\"\n\nReuel Gridley went away to the wars and we heard of him no more for\nfifteen or sixteen years. Then one day in Carson City while I was having\na difficulty with an editor on the sidewalk--an editor better built for\nwar than I was--I heard a voice say, \"Give him the best you've got, Sam,\nI'm at your back.\" It was Reuel Gridley. He said he had not recognized\nme by my face but by my drawling style of speech.\n\nHe went down to the Reese River mines about that time and presently he\nlost an election bet in his mining camp, and by the terms of it he was\nobliged to buy a fifty-pound sack of self-raising flour and carry it\nthrough the town, preceded by music, and deliver it to the winner of the\nbet. Of course the whole camp was present and full of fluid and\nenthusiasm. The winner of the bet put up the sack at auction for the\nbenefit of the United States Sanitary Fund, and sold it. The excitement\ngrew and grew. The sack was sold over and over again for the benefit of\nthe Fund. The news of it came to Virginia City by telegraph. It produced\ngreat enthusiasm, and Reuel Gridley was begged by telegraph to bring the\nsack and have an auction in Virginia City. He brought it. An open\nbarouche was provided, also a brass band. The sack was sold over and\nover again at Gold Hill, then was brought up to Virginia City toward\nnight and sold--and sold again, and again, and still again, netting\ntwenty or thirty thousand dollars for the Sanitary Fund. Gridley carried\nit across California and sold it at various towns. He sold it for large\nsums in Sacramento and in San Francisco. He brought it East, sold it in\nNew York and in various other cities, then carried it out to a great\nFair at St. Louis, and went on selling it; and finally made it up into\nsmall cakes and sold those at a dollar apiece. First and last, the sack\nof flour which had originally cost ten dollars, perhaps, netted more\nthan two hundred thousand dollars for the Sanitary Fund. Reuel Gridley\nhas been dead these many, many years--it is the old story.\n\nIn that school were the first Jews I had ever seen. It took me a good\nwhile to get over the awe of it. To my fancy they were clothed invisibly\nin the damp and cobwebby mould of antiquity. They carried me back to\nEgypt, and in imagination I moved among the Pharaohs and all the shadowy\ncelebrities of that remote age. The name of the boys was Levin. We had a\ncollective name for them which was the only really large and handsome\nwitticism that was ever born in that Congressional district. We called\nthem \"Twenty-two\"--and even when the joke was old and had been worn\nthreadbare we always followed it with the explanation, to make sure that\nit would be understood, \"Twice Levin--twenty-two.\"\n\nThere were other boys whose names remain with me. Irving Ayres--but no\nmatter, he is dead. Then there was George Butler, whom I remember as a\nchild of seven wearing a blue leather belt with a brass buckle, and\nhated and envied by all the boys on account of it. He was a nephew of\nGeneral Ben Butler and fought gallantly at Ball's Bluff and in several\nother actions of the Civil War. He is dead, long and long ago.\n\nWill Bowen (dead long ago), Ed Stevens (dead long ago) and John Briggs\nwere special mates of mine. John is still living.\n\n[Sidenote: (1845.)]\n\nIn 1845, when I was ten years old, there was an epidemic of measles in\nthe town and it made a most alarming slaughter among the little people.\nThere was a funeral almost daily, and the mothers of the town were\nnearly demented with fright. My mother was greatly troubled. She worried\nover Pamela and Henry and me, and took constant and extraordinary pains\nto keep us from coming into contact with the contagion. But upon\nreflection I believed that her judgment was at fault. It seemed to me\nthat I could improve upon it if left to my own devices. I cannot\nremember now whether I was frightened about the measles or not, but I\nclearly remember that I grew very tired of the suspense I suffered on\naccount of being continually under the threat of death. I remember that\nI got so weary of it and so anxious to have the matter settled one way\nor the other, and promptly, that this anxiety spoiled my days and my\nnights. I had no pleasure in them. I made up my mind to end this\nsuspense and be done with it. Will Bowen was dangerously ill with the\nmeasles and I thought I would go down there and catch them. I entered\nthe house by the front way and slipped along through rooms and halls,\nkeeping sharp watch against discovery, and at last I reached Will's\nbed-chamber in the rear of the house on the second floor and got into it\nuncaptured. But that was as far as my victory reached. His mother caught\nme there a moment later and snatched me out of the house and gave me a\nmost competent scolding and drove me away. She was so scared that she\ncould hardly get her words out, and her face was white. I saw that I\nmust manage better next time, and I did. I hung about the lane at the\nrear of the house and watched through cracks in the fence until I was\nconvinced that the conditions were favorable; then I slipped through the\nback yard and up the back way and got into the room and into the bed\nwith Will Bowen without being observed. I don't know how long I was in\nthe bed. I only remember that Will Bowen, as society, had no value for\nme, for he was too sick to even notice that I was there. When I heard\nhis mother coming I covered up my head, but that device was a failure.\nIt was dead summer-time--the cover was nothing more than a limp blanket\nor sheet, and anybody could see that there were two of us under it. It\ndidn't remain two very long. Mrs. Bowen snatched me out of the bed and\nconducted me home herself, with a grip on my collar which she never\nloosened until she delivered me into my mother's hands along with her\nopinion of that kind of a boy.\n\nIt was a good case of measles that resulted. It brought me within a\nshade of death's door. It brought me to where I no longer took any\ninterest in anything, but, on the contrary, felt a total absence of\ninterest--which was most placid and enchanting. I have never enjoyed\nanything in my life any more than I enjoyed dying that time. I _was_, in\neffect, dying. The word had been passed and the family notified to\nassemble around the bed and see me off. I knew them all. There was no\ndoubtfulness in my vision. They were all crying, but that did not affect\nme. I took but the vaguest interest in it, and that merely because I was\nthe centre of all this emotional attention and was gratified by it and\nvain of it.\n\nWhen Dr. Cunningham had made up his mind that nothing more could be done\nfor me he put bags of hot ashes all over me. He put them on my breast,\non my wrists, on my ankles; and so, very much to his astonishment--and\ndoubtless to my regret--he dragged me back into this world and set me\ngoing again.\n\n[_Dictated July 26, 1907._] In an article entitled \"England's Ovation to\nMark Twain,\" Sydney Brooks--but never mind that, now.\n\nI was in Oxford by seven o'clock that evening (June 25, 1907), and\ntrying on the scarlet gown which the tailor had been constructing, and\nfound it right--right and surpassingly becoming. At half past ten the\nnext morning we assembled at All Souls College and marched thence,\ngowned, mortar-boarded and in double file, down a long street to the\nSheldonian Theatre, between solid walls of the populace, very much\nhurrah'd and limitlessly kodak'd. We made a procession of considerable\nlength and distinction and picturesqueness, with the Chancellor, Lord\nCurzon, late Viceroy of India, in his rich robe of black and gold, in\nthe lead, followed by a pair of trim little boy train-bearers, and the\ntrain-bearers followed by the young Prince Arthur of Connaught, who was\nto be made a D.C.L. The detachment of D.C.L.'s were followed by the\nDoctors of Science, and these by the Doctors of Literature, and these\nin turn by the Doctors of Music. Sidney Colvin marched in front of me; I\nwas coupled with Sidney Lee, and Kipling followed us; General Booth, of\nthe Salvation Army, was in the squadron of D.C.L.'s.\n\nOur journey ended, we were halted in a fine old hall whence we could\nsee, through a corridor of some length, the massed audience in the\ntheatre. Here for a little time we moved about and chatted and made\nacquaintanceships; then the D.C.L.'s were summoned, and they marched\nthrough that corridor and the shouting began in the theatre. It would be\nsome time before the Doctors of Literature and of Science would be\ncalled for, because each of those D.C.L.'s had to have a couple of Latin\nspeeches made over him before his promotion would be complete--one by\nthe Regius Professor of Civil Law, the other by the Chancellor. After a\nwhile I asked Sir William Ramsay if a person might smoke here and not\nget shot. He said, \"Yes,\" but that whoever did it and got caught would\nbe fined a guinea, and perhaps hanged later. He said he knew of a place\nwhere we could accomplish at least as much as half of a smoke before any\ninformers would be likely to chance upon us, and he was ready to show\nthe way to any who might be willing to risk the guinea and the hanging.\nBy request he led the way, and Kipling, Sir Norman Lockyer and I\nfollowed. We crossed an unpopulated quadrangle and stood under one of\nits exits--an archway of massive masonry--and there we lit up and began\nto take comfort. The photographers soon arrived, but they were courteous\nand friendly and gave us no trouble, and we gave them none. They grouped\nus in all sorts of ways and photographed us at their diligent leisure,\nwhile we smoked and talked. We were there more than an hour; then we\nreturned to headquarters, happy, content, and greatly refreshed.\nPresently we filed into the theatre, under a very satisfactory hurrah,\nand waited in a crimson column, dividing the crowded pit through the\nmiddle, until each of us in his turn should be called to stand before\nthe Chancellor and hear our merits set forth in sonorous Latin.\nMeantime, Kipling and I wrote autographs until some good kind soul\ninterfered in our behalf and procured for us a rest.\n\nI will now save what is left of my modesty by quoting a paragraph from\nSydney Brooks's \"Ovation.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLet those stars take the place of it for the present. Sydney Brooks has\ndone it well. It makes me proud to read it; as proud as I was in that\nold day, sixty-two years ago, when I lay dying, the centre of\nattraction, with one eye piously closed upon the fleeting vanities of\nthis life--an excellent effect--and the other open a crack to observe\nthe tears, the sorrow, the admiration--all for me--all for me!\n\nAh, that was the proudest moment of my long life--until Oxford!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMost Americans have been to Oxford and will remember what a dream of the\nMiddle Ages it is, with its crooked lanes, its gray and stately piles of\nancient architecture and its meditation-breeding air of repose and\ndignity and unkinship with the noise and fret and hurry and bustle of\nthese modern days. As a dream of the Middle Ages Oxford was not perfect\nuntil Pageant day arrived and furnished certain details which had been\nfor generations lacking. These details began to appear at mid-afternoon\non the 27th. At that time singles, couples, groups and squadrons of the\nthree thousand five hundred costumed characters who were to take part in\nthe Pageant began to ooze and drip and stream through house doors, all\nover the old town, and wend toward the meadows outside the walls. Soon\nthe lanes were thronged with costumes which Oxford had from time to time\nseen and been familiar with in bygone centuries--fashions of dress which\nmarked off centuries as by dates, and mile-stoned them back, and back,\nand back, until history faded into legend and tradition, when Arthur was\na fact and the Round Table a reality. In this rich commingling of quaint\nand strange and brilliantly colored fashions in dress the dress-changes\nof Oxford for twelve centuries stood livid and realized to the eye;\nOxford as a dream of the Middle Ages was complete now as it had never,\nin our day, before been complete; at last there was no discord; the\nmouldering old buildings, and the picturesque throngs drifting past\nthem, were in harmony; soon--astonishingly soon!--the only persons that\nseemed out of place, and grotesquely and offensively and criminally out\nof place were such persons as came intruding along clothed in the ugly\nand odious fashions of the twentieth century; they were a bitterness to\nthe feelings, an insult to the eye.\n\nThe make-ups of illustrious historic personages seemed perfect, both as\nto portraiture and costume; one had no trouble in recognizing them.\nAlso, I was apparently quite easily recognizable myself. The first\ncorner I turned brought me suddenly face to face with Henry VIII, a\nperson whom I had been implacably disliking for sixty years; but when he\nput out his hand with royal courtliness and grace and said, \"Welcome,\nwell-beloved stranger, to my century and to the hospitalities of my\nrealm,\" my old prejudices vanished away and I forgave him. I think now\nthat Henry the Eighth has been over-abused, and that most of us, if we\nhad been situated as he was, domestically, would not have been able to\nget along with as limited a graveyard as he forced himself to put up\nwith. I feel now that he was one of the nicest men in history. Personal\ncontact with a king is more effective in removing baleful prejudices\nthan is any amount of argument drawn from tales and histories. If I had\na child I would name it Henry the Eighth, regardless of sex.\n\nDo you remember Charles the First?--and his broad slouch with the plume\nin it? and his slender, tall figure? and his body clothed in velvet\ndoublet with lace sleeves, and his legs in leather, with long rapier at\nhis side and his spurs on his heels? I encountered him at the next\ncorner, and knew him in a moment--knew him as perfectly and as vividly\nas I should know the Grand Chain in the Mississippi if I should see it\nfrom the pilot-house after all these years. He bent his body and gave\nhis hat a sweep that fetched its plume within an inch of the ground, and\ngave me a welcome that went to my heart. This king has been much\nmaligned; I shall understand him better hereafter, and shall regret him\nmore than I have been in the habit of doing these fifty or sixty years.\nHe did some things in his time, which might better have been left\nundone, and which cast a shadow upon his name--we all know that, we all\nconcede it--but our error has been in regarding them as crimes and in\ncalling them by that name, whereas I perceive now that they were only\nindiscretions. At every few steps I met persons of deathless name whom I\nhad never encountered before outside of pictures and statuary and\nhistory, and these were most thrilling and charming encounters. I had\nhand-shakes with Henry the Second, who had not been seen in the Oxford\nstreets for nearly eight hundred years; and with the Fair Rosamond, whom\nI now believe to have been chaste and blameless, although I had thought\ndifferently about it before; and with Shakespeare, one of the\npleasantest foreigners I have ever gotten acquainted with; and with\nRoger Bacon; and with Queen Elizabeth, who talked five minutes and never\nswore once--a fact which gave me a new and good opinion of her and moved\nme to forgive her for beheading the Scottish Mary, if she really did it,\nwhich I now doubt; and with the quaintly and anciently clad young King\nHarold Harefoot, of near nine hundred years ago, who came flying by on a\nbicycle and smoking a pipe, but at once checked up and got off to shake\nwith me; and also I met a bishop who had lost his way because this was\nthe first time he had been inside the walls of Oxford for as much as\ntwelve hundred years or thereabouts. By this time I had grown so used to\nthe obliterated ages and their best-known people that if I had met Adam\nI should not have been either surprised or embarrassed; and if he had\ncome in a racing automobile and a cloud of dust, with nothing on but his\nfig-leaf, it would have seemed to me all right and harmonious.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XXIV.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n_From Susy's Biography of Me_ [1885-6].\n\n\n     Mamma and papa have returned from Onteora and they have had a\n     delightful visit. Mr. Frank Stockton was down in Virginia and could\n     not reach Onteora in time, so they did not see him, and Mrs. Mary\n     Mapes Dodge was ill and couldn't go to Onteora, but Mrs. General\n     Custer was there, and mamma said that she was a very attractive,\n     sweet appearing woman.\n\n\n[_Dictated October 9, 1906._] Onteora was situated high up in the\nCatskill Mountains, in the centre of a far-reaching solitude. I do not\nmean that the region was wholly uninhabited; there were farmhouses here\nand there, at generous distances apart. Their occupants were descendants\nof ancestors who had built the houses in Rip Van Winkle's time, or\nearlier; and those ancestors were not more primitive than were this\nposterity of theirs. The city people were as foreign and unfamiliar and\nstrange to them as monkeys would have been, and they would have\nrespected the monkeys as much as they respected these elegant\nsummer-resorters. The resorters were a puzzle to them, their ways were\nso strange and their interests so trivial. They drove the resorters over\nthe mountain roads and listened in shamed surprise at their bursts of\nenthusiasm over the scenery. The farmers had had that scenery on\nexhibition from their mountain roosts all their lives, and had never\nnoticed anything remarkable about it. By way of an incident: a pair of\nthese primitives were overheard chatting about the resorters, one day,\nand in the course of their talk this remark was dropped:\n\n\"I was a-drivin' a passel of 'em round about yisterday evenin', quiet\nones, you know, still and solemn, and all to wunst they busted out to\nmake your hair lift and I judged hell was to pay. Now what do you reckon\nit was? It wa'n't anything but jest one of them common damned yaller\nsunsets.\"\n\nIn those days--\n\n[_Tuesday, October 16, 1906._] ... Warner is gone. Stockton is gone. I\nattended both funerals. Warner was a near neighbor, from the autumn of\n'71 until his death, nineteen years afterward. It is not the privilege\nof the most of us to have many intimate friends--a dozen is our\naggregate--but I think he could count his by the score. It is seldom\nthat a man is so beloved by both sexes and all ages as Warner was. There\nwas a charm about his spirit, and his ways, and his words, that won all\nthat came within the sphere of its influence. Our children adopted him\nwhile they were little creatures, and thenceforth, to the end, he was\n\"Cousin Charley\" to them. He was \"Uncle Charley\" to the children of more\nthan one other friend. Mrs. Clemens was very fond of him, and he always\ncalled her by her first name--shortened. Warner died, as she died, and\nas I would die--without premonition, without a moment's warning.\n\nUncle Remus still lives, and must be over a thousand years old. Indeed,\nI know that this must be so, because I have seen a new photograph of him\nin the public prints within the last month or so, and in that picture\nhis aspects are distinctly and strikingly geological, and one can see he\nis thinking about the mastodons and plesiosaurians that he used to play\nwith when he was young.\n\nIt is just a quarter of a century since I have seen Uncle Remus. He\nvisited us in our home in Hartford and was reverently devoured by the\nbig eyes of Susy and Clara, for I made a deep and awful impression upon\nthe little creatures--who knew his book by heart through my nightly\ndeclamation of its tales to them--by revealing to them privately that he\nwas the real Uncle Remus whitewashed so that he could come into people's\nhouses the front way.\n\nHe was the bashfulest grown person I have ever met. When there were\npeople about he stayed silent, and seemed to suffer until they were\ngone. But he was lovely, nevertheless; for the sweetness and benignity\nof the immortal Remus looked out from his eyes, and the graces and\nsincerities of his character shone in his face.\n\nIt may be that Jim Wolf was as bashful as Harris. It hardly seems\npossible, yet as I look back fifty-six years and consider Jim Wolf, I am\nalmost persuaded that he was. He was our long slim apprentice in my\nbrother's printing-office in Hannibal. He was seventeen, and yet he was\nas much as four times as bashful as I was, though I was only fourteen.\nHe boarded and slept in the house, but he was always tongue-tied in the\npresence of my sister, and when even my gentle mother spoke to him he\ncould not answer save in frightened monosyllables. He would not enter a\nroom where a girl was; nothing could persuade him to do such a thing.\nOnce when he was in our small parlor alone, two majestic old maids\nentered and seated themselves in such a way that Jim could not escape\nwithout passing by them. He would as soon have thought of passing by one\nof Harris's plesiosaurians ninety feet long. I came in presently, was\ncharmed with the situation, and sat down in a corner to watch Jim\nsuffer, and enjoy it. My mother followed a minute later and sat down\nwith the visitors and began to talk. Jim sat upright in his chair, and\nduring a quarter of an hour he did not change his position by a\nshade--neither General Grant nor a bronze image could have maintained\nthat immovable pose more successfully. I mean as to body and limbs; with\nthe face there was a difference. By fleeting revealments of the face I\nsaw that something was happening--something out of the common. There\nwould be a sudden twitch of the muscles of the face, an instant\ndistortion, which in the next instant had passed and left no trace.\nThese twitches gradually grew in frequency, but no muscle outside of the\nface lost any of its rigidity, or betrayed any interest in what was\nhappening to Jim. I mean if something _was_ happening to him, and I knew\nperfectly well that that was the case. At last a pair of tears began to\nswim slowly down his cheeks amongst the twitchings, but Jim sat still\nand let them run; then I saw his right hand steal along his thigh until\nhalf-way to his knee, then take a vigorous grip upon the cloth.\n\nThat was a _wasp_ that he was grabbing! A colony of them were climbing\nup his legs and prospecting around, and every time he winced they\nstabbed him to the hilt--so for a quarter of an hour one group of\nexcursionists after another climbed up Jim's legs and resented even the\nslightest wince or squirm that he indulged himself with, in his misery.\nWhen the entertainment had become nearly unbearable, he conceived the\nidea of gripping them between his fingers and putting them out of\ncommission. He succeeded with many of them, but at great cost, for, as\nhe couldn't see the wasp, he was as likely to take hold of the wrong end\nof him as he was the right; then the dying wasp gave him a punch to\nremember the incident by.\n\nIf those ladies had stayed all day, and if all the wasps in Missouri had\ncome and climbed up Jim's legs, nobody there would ever have known it\nbut Jim and the wasps and me. There he would have sat until the ladies\nleft.\n\nWhen they finally went away we went up-stairs and he took his clothes\noff, and his legs were a picture to look at. They looked as if they were\nmailed all over with shirt buttons, each with a single red hole in the\ncentre. The pain was intolerable--no, would have been intolerable, but\nthe pain of the presence of those ladies had been so much harder to bear\nthat the pain of the wasps' stings was quite pleasant and enjoyable by\ncomparison.\n\nJim never could enjoy wasps. I remember once--\n\n\n     _From Susy's Biography of Me_ [1885-6].\n\n     Mamma has given me a very pleasant little newspaper scrap about\n     papa, to copy. I will put it in here.\n\n\n[_Thursday, October 11, 1906._] It was a rather strong compliment; I\nthink I will leave it out. It was from James Redpath.\n\nThe chief ingredients of Redpath's make-up were honesty, sincerity,\nkindliness, and pluck. He wasn't afraid. He was one of Ossawatomie\nBrown's right-hand men in the bleeding Kansas days; he was all through\nthat struggle. He carried his life in his hands, and from one day to\nanother it wasn't worth the price of a night's lodging. He had a small\nbody of daring men under him, and they were constantly being hunted by\nthe \"jayhawkers,\" who were proslavery Missourians, guerillas, modern\nfree lances.\n\n[_Friday, October 12, 1906._] ... I can't think of the name of that\ndaredevil guerilla who led the jayhawkers and chased Redpath up and\ndown the country, and, in turn, was chased by Redpath. By grace of the\nchances of war, the two men never met in the field, though they several\ntimes came within an ace of it.\n\nTen or twelve years later, Redpath was earning his living in Boston as\nchief of the lecture business in the United States. Fifteen or sixteen\nyears after his Kansas adventures I became a public lecturer, and he was\nmy agent. Along there somewhere was a press dinner, one November night,\nat the Tremont Hotel in Boston, and I attended it. I sat near the head\nof the table, with Redpath between me and the chairman; a stranger sat\non my other side. I tried several times to talk with the stranger, but\nhe seemed to be out of words and I presently ceased from troubling him.\nHe was manifestly a very shy man, and, moreover, he might have been\nlosing sleep the night before.\n\nThe first man called up was Redpath. At the mention of the name the\nstranger started, and showed interest. He fixed a fascinated eye on\nRedpath, and lost not a word of his speech. Redpath told some stirring\nincidents of his career in Kansas, and said, among other things:\n\n\"Three times I came near capturing the gallant jayhawker chief, and once\nhe actually captured _me_, but didn't know me and let me go, because he\nsaid he was hot on Redpath's trail and couldn't afford to waste time and\nrope on inconsequential small fry.\"\n\nMy stranger was called up next, and when Redpath heard his name he, in\nturn, showed a startled interest. The stranger said, bending a caressing\nglance upon Redpath and speaking gently--I may even say sweetly:\n\n\"You realize that I was that jayhawker chief. I am glad to know you now\nand take you to my heart and call you friend\"--then he added, in a voice\nthat was pathetic with regret, \"but if I had only known you then, what\ntumultuous happiness I should have had in your society!--while it\nlasted.\"\n\nThe last quarter of a century of my life has been pretty constantly and\nfaithfully devoted to the study of the human race--that is to say, the\nstudy of myself, for, in my individual person, I am the entire human\nrace compacted together. I have found that then is no ingredient of the\nrace which I do not possess in either a small way or a large way. When\nit is small, as compared with the same ingredient in somebody else,\nthere is still enough of it for all the purposes of examination. In my\ncontacts with the species I find no one who possesses a quality which I\ndo not possess. The shades of difference between other people and me\nserve to make variety and prevent monotony, but that is all; broadly\nspeaking, we are all alike; and so by studying myself carefully and\ncomparing myself with other people, and noting the divergences, I have\nbeen enabled to acquire a knowledge of the human race which I perceive\nis more accurate and more comprehensive than that which has been\nacquired and revealed by any other member of our species. As a result,\nmy private and concealed opinion of myself is not of a complimentary\nsort. It follows that my estimate of the human race is the duplicate of\nmy estimate of myself.\n\nI am not proposing to discuss all of the peculiarities of the human\nrace, at this time; I only wish to touch lightly upon one or two of\nthem. To begin with, I wonder why a man should prefer a good\nbilliard-table to a poor one; and why he should prefer straight cues to\ncrooked ones; and why he should prefer round balls to chipped ones; and\nwhy he should prefer a level table to one that slants; and why he should\nprefer responsive cushions to the dull and unresponsive kind. I wonder\nat these things, because when we examine the matter we find that the\nessentials involved in billiards are as competently and exhaustively\nfurnished by a bad billiard outfit as they are by the best one. One of\nthe essentials is amusement. Very well, if there is any more amusement\nto be gotten out of the one outfit than out of the other, the facts are\nin favor of the bad outfit. The bad outfit will always furnish thirty\nper cent. more fun for the players and for the spectators than will the\ngood outfit. Another essential of the game is that the outfit shall give\nthe players full opportunity to exercise their best skill, and display\nit in a way to compel the admiration of the spectators. Very well, the\nbad outfit is nothing behind the good one in this regard. It is a\ndifficult matter to estimate correctly the eccentricities of chipped\nballs and a slanting table, and make the right allowance for them and\nsecure a count; the finest kind of skill is required to accomplish the\nsatisfactory result. Another essential of the game is that it shall add\nto the interest of the game by furnishing opportunities to bet. Very\nwell, in this regard no good outfit can claim any advantage over a bad\none. I know, by experience, that a bad outfit is as valuable as the\nbest one; that an outfit that couldn't be sold at auction for seven\ndollars is just as valuable for all the essentials of the game as an\noutfit that is worth a thousand.\n\nI acquired some of this learning in Jackass Gulch, California, more than\nforty years ago. Jackass Gulch had once been a rich and thriving\nsurface-mining camp. By and by its gold deposits were exhausted; then\nthe people began to go away, and the town began to decay, and rapidly;\nin my time it had disappeared. Where the bank, and the city hall, and\nthe church, and the gambling-dens, and the newspaper office, and the\nstreets of brick blocks had been, was nothing now but a wide and\nbeautiful expanse of green grass, a peaceful and charming solitude. Half\na dozen scattered dwellings were still inhabited, and there was still\none saloon of a ruined and rickety character struggling for life, but\ndoomed. In its bar was a billiard outfit that was the counterpart of the\none in my father-in-law's garret. The balls were chipped, the cloth was\ndarned and patched, the table's surface was undulating, and the cues\nwere headless and had the curve of a parenthesis--but the forlorn\nremnant of marooned miners played games there, and those games were more\nentertaining to look at than a circus and a grand opera combined.\nNothing but a quite extraordinary skill could score a carom on that\ntable--a skill that required the nicest estimate of force, distance, and\nhow much to allow for the various slants of the table and the other\nformidable peculiarities and idiosyncrasies furnished by the\ncontradictions of the outfit. Last winter, here in New York, I saw Hoppe\nand Schaefer and Sutton and the three or four other billiard champions\nof world-wide fame contend against each other, and certainly the art and\nscience displayed were a wonder to see; yet I saw nothing there in the\nway of science and art that was more wonderful than shots which I had\nseen Texas Tom make on the wavy surface of that poor old wreck in the\nperishing saloon at Jackass Gulch forty years before. Once I saw Texas\nTom make a string of seven points on a single inning!--all calculated\nshots, and not a fluke or a scratch among them. I often saw him make\nruns of four, but when he made his great string of seven, the boys went\nwild with enthusiasm and admiration. The joy and the noise exceeded that\nwhich the great gathering at Madison Square produced when Sutton scored\nfive hundred points at the eighteen-inch game, on a world-famous night\nlast winter. With practice, that champion could score nineteen or\ntwenty on the Jackass Gulch table; but to start with, Texas Tom would\nshow him miracles that would astonish him; also it might have another\nhandsome result: it might persuade the great experts to discard their\nown trifling game and bring the Jackass Gulch outfit here and exhibit\ntheir skill in a game worth a hundred of the discarded one, for profound\nand breathless interest, and for displays of almost superhuman skill.\n\nIn my experience, games played with a fiendish outfit furnish ecstasies\nof delight which games played with the other kind cannot match.\nTwenty-seven years ago my budding little family spent the summer at\nBateman's Point, near Newport, Rhode Island. It was a comfortable\nboarding-place, well stocked with sweet mothers and little children, but\nthe male sex was scarce; however, there was another young fellow besides\nmyself, and he and I had good times--Higgins was his name, but that was\nnot his fault. He was a very pleasant and companionable person. On the\npremises there was what had once been a bowling-alley. It was a single\nalley, and it was estimated that it had been out of repair for sixty\nyears--but not the balls, the balls were in good condition; there were\nforty-one of them, and they ranged in size from a grapefruit up to a\nlignum-vit\u00e6 sphere that you could hardly lift. Higgins and I played on\nthat alley day after day. At first, one of us located himself at the\nbottom end to set up the pins in case anything should happen to them,\nbut nothing happened. The surface of that alley consisted of a rolling\nstretch of elevations and depressions, and neither of us could, by any\nart known to us, persuade a ball to stay on the alley until it should\naccomplish something. Little balls and big, the same thing always\nhappened--the ball left the alley before it was half-way home and went\nthundering down alongside of it the rest of the way and made the\ngamekeeper climb out and take care of himself. No matter, we persevered,\nand were rewarded. We examined the alley, noted and located a lot of its\npeculiarities, and little by little we learned how to deliver a ball in\nsuch a way that it would travel home and knock down a pin or two. By and\nby we succeeded in improving our game to a point where we were able to\nget all of the pins with thirty-five balls--so we made it a\nthirty-five-ball game. If the player did not succeed with thirty-five,\nhe had lost the game. I suppose that all the balls, taken together,\nweighed five hundred pounds, or maybe a ton--or along there\nsomewhere--but anyway it was hot weather, and by the time that a player\nhad sent thirty-five of them home he was in a drench of perspiration,\nand physically exhausted.\n\nNext, we started cocked hat--that is to say, a triangle of three pins,\nthe other seven being discarded. In this game we used the three smallest\nballs and kept on delivering them until we got the three pins down.\nAfter a day or two of practice we were able to get the chief pin with an\noutput of four balls, but it cost us a great many deliveries to get the\nother two; but by and by we succeeded in perfecting our art--at least we\nperfected it to our limit. We reached a scientific excellence where we\ncould get the three pins down with twelve deliveries of the three small\nballs, making thirty-six shots to conquer the cocked hat.\n\nHaving reached our limit for daylight work, we set up a couple of\ncandles and played at night. As the alley was fifty or sixty feet long,\nwe couldn't see the pins, but the candles indicated their locality. We\ncontinued this game until we were able to knock down the invisible pins\nwith thirty-six shots. Having now reached the limit of the candle game,\nwe changed and played it left-handed. We continued the left-handed game\nuntil we conquered its limit, which was fifty-four shots. Sometimes we\nsent down a succession of fifteen balls without getting anything at all.\nWe easily got out of that old alley five times the fun that anybody\ncould have gotten out of the best alley in New York.\n\nOne blazing hot day, a modest and courteous officer of the regular army\nappeared in our den and introduced himself. He was about thirty-five\nyears old, well built and militarily erect and straight, and he was\nhermetically sealed up in the uniform of that ignorant old day--a\nuniform made of heavy material, and much properer for January than July.\nWhen he saw the venerable alley, and glanced from that to the long\nprocession of shining balls in the trough, his eye lit with desire, and\nwe judged that he was our meat. We politely invited him to take a hand,\nand he could not conceal his gratitude; though his breeding, and the\netiquette of his profession, made him try. We explained the game to him,\nand said that there were forty-one balls, and that the player was\nprivileged to extend his inning and keep on playing until he had used\nthem all up--repeatedly--and that for every ten-strike he got a prize.\nWe didn't name the prize--it wasn't necessary, as no prize would ever be\nneeded or called for. He started a sarcastic smile, but quenched it,\naccording to the etiquette of his profession. He merely remarked that he\nwould like to select a couple of medium balls and one small one, adding\nthat he didn't think he would need the rest.\n\nThen he began, and he was an astonished man. He couldn't get a ball to\nstay on the alley. When he had fired about fifteen balls and hadn't yet\nreached the cluster of pins, his annoyance began to show out through his\nclothes. He wouldn't let it show in his face; but after another fifteen\nballs he was not able to control his face; he didn't utter a word, but\nhe exuded mute blasphemy from every pore. He asked permission to take\noff his coat, which was granted; then he turned himself loose, with\nbitter determination, and although he was only an infantry officer he\ncould have been mistaken for a battery, he got up such a volleying\nthunder with those balls. Presently he removed his cravat; after a\nlittle he took off his vest; and still he went bravely on. Higgins was\nsuffocating. My condition was the same, but it would not be courteous to\nlaugh; it would be better to burst, and we came near it. That officer\nwas good pluck. He stood to his work without uttering a word, and kept\nthe balls going until he had expended the outfit four times, making four\ntimes forty-one shots; then he had to give it up, and he did; for he was\nno longer able to stand without wobbling. He put on his clothes, bade us\na courteous good-by, invited us to call at the Fort, and started away.\nThen he came back, and said,\n\n\"What is the prize for the ten-strike?\"\n\nWe had to confess that we had not selected it yet.\n\nHe said, gravely, that he thought there was no occasion for hurry about\nit.\n\nI believe Bateman's alley was a better one than any other in America, in\nthe matter of the essentials of the game. It compelled skill; it\nprovided opportunity for bets; and if you could get a stranger to do the\nbowling for you, there was more and wholesomer and delightfuler\nentertainment to be gotten out of his industries than out of the finest\ngame by the best expert, and played upon the best alley elsewhere in\nexistence.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n                       (_To be Continued._)\n\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW\n\nNo. DCXXV.\n\nDECEMBER, 1907.\n\n\nCHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XXV.\n\nBY MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n_January 11, 1906._ Answer to a letter received this morning:\n\n\n     DEAR MRS. H.,--I am forever your debtor for reminding me of that\n     curious passage in my life. During the first year or two after it\n     happened, I could not bear to think of it. My pain and shame were\n     so intense, and my sense of having been an imbecile so settled,\n     established and confirmed, that I drove the episode entirely from\n     my mind--and so all these twenty-eight or twenty-nine years I have\n     lived in the conviction that my performance of that time was\n     coarse, vulgar and destitute of humor. But your suggestion that you\n     and your family found humor in it twenty-eight years ago moved me\n     to look into the matter. So I commissioned a Boston typewriter to\n     delve among the Boston papers of that bygone time and send me a\n     copy of it.\n\n     It came this morning, and if there is any vulgarity about it I am\n     not able to discover it. If it isn't innocently and ridiculously\n     funny, I am no judge. I will see to it that you get a copy.\n\n\n                Address of Samuel L. Clemens (\"Mark Twain\")\n            From a report of the dinner given by the Publishers\n                 of the Atlantic Monthly in honor of the\n                      Seventieth Anniversary of the\n         Birth of John Greenleaf Whittier, at the Hotel Brunswick,\n                         Boston, December 17, 1877,\n                            as published in the\n                         BOSTON EVENING TRANSCRIPT,\n                             December 18, 1877\n\n\n     Mr. Chairman--This is an occasion peculiarly meet for the digging\n     up of pleasant reminiscences concerning literary folk; therefore I\n     will drop lightly into history myself. Standing here on the shore\n     of the Atlantic and contemplating certain of its largest literary\n     billows, I am reminded of a thing which happened to me thirteen\n     years ago, when I had just succeeded in stirring up a little\n     Nevadian literary puddle myself, whose spume-flakes were beginning\n     to blow thinly Californiawards. I started an inspection tramp\n     through the southern mines of California. I was callow and\n     conceited, and I resolved to try the virtue of my _nom de guerre._\n     I very soon had an opportunity. I knocked at a miner's lonely log\n     cabin in the foothills of the Sierras just at nightfall. It was\n     snowing at the time. A jaded, melancholy man of fifty, barefooted,\n     opened the door to me. When he heard my _nom de guerre_ he looked\n     more dejected than before. He let me in--pretty reluctantly, I\n     thought--and after the customary bacon and beans, black coffee and\n     hot whiskey, I took a pipe. This sorrowful man had not said three\n     words up to this time. Now he spoke up and said, in the voice of\n     one who is secretly suffering, \"You're the fourth--I'm going to\n     move.\" \"The fourth what!\" said I. \"The fourth littery man that has\n     been here in twenty-four hours--I'm going to move.\" \"You don't tell\n     me!\" said I; \"who were the others!\" \"Mr. Longfellow, Mr. Emerson\n     and Mr. Oliver Wendell Holmes--consound the lot!\"\n\n     You can easily believe I was interested. I supplicated--three hot\n     whiskeys did the rest--and finally the melancholy miner began. Said\n     he--\n\n     \"They came here just at dark yesterday evening, and I let them in\n     of course. Said they were going to the Yosemite. They were a rough\n     lot, but that's nothing; everybody looks rough that travels afoot.\n     Mr. Emerson was a seedy little bit of a chap, red-headed. Mr.\n     Holmes as fat as a balloon; he weighed as much as three hundred,\n     and double chins all the way down to his stomach. Mr. Longfellow\n     built like a prize-fighter. His head was cropped and bristly, like\n     as if he had a wig made of hair-brushes. His nose lay straight down\n     his face, like a finger with the end joint tilted up. They had been\n     drinking, I could see that. And what queer talk they used! Mr.\n     Holmes inspected this cabin, then he took me by the buttonhole, and\n     says he--\n\n\n     \"'Through the deep cares of thought\n     I hear a voice that sings,\n     Build thee more stately mansions,\n     O my soul!'\n\n\n     \"Says I, 'I can't afford it, Mr. Holmes, and moreover I don't want\n     to.' Blamed if I liked it pretty well, either, coming from a\n     stranger, that way. However, I started to get out my bacon and\n     beans, when Mr. Emerson came and looked on awhile, and then he\n     takes me aside by the buttonhole and says--\n\n\n     \"'Give me agates for my meat;\n     Give me cantharids to eat;\n     From air and ocean bring me foods,\n     From all zones and altitudes.'\n\n\n     \"Says I, 'Mr. Emerson, if you'll excuse me, this ain't no hotel.'\n     You see it sort of riled me--I warn't used to the ways of littery\n     swells. But I went on a-sweating over my work, and next comes Mr.\n     Longfellow and buttonholes me, and interrupts me. Says he,\n\n\n     \"'Honor be to Mudjekeewis!\n     You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis--'\n\n\n     \"But I broke in, and says I, 'Beg your pardon, Mr. Longfellow, if\n     you'll be so kind as to hold your yawp for about five minutes and\n     let me get this grub ready, you'll do me proud.' Well, sir, after\n     they'd filled up I set out the jug. Mr. Holmes looks at it and then\n     he fires up all of a sudden and yells--\n\n\n     \"'Flash out a stream of blood-red wine!\n     For I would drink to other days.'\n\n\n     \"By George, I was getting kind of worked up. I don't deny it, I was\n     getting kind of worked up. I turns to Mr. Holmes, and says I,\n     'Looky here, my fat friend, I'm a-running this shanty, and if the\n     court knows herself, you'll take whiskey straight or you'll go\n     dry.' Them's the very words I said to him. Now I don't want to sass\n     such famous littery people, but you see they kind of forced me.\n     There ain't nothing onreasonable 'bout me; I don't mind a passel of\n     guests a-treadin' on my tail three or four times, but when it comes\n     to _standing_ on it it's different, 'and if the court knows\n     herself,' I says, 'you'll take whiskey straight or you'll go dry.'\n     Well, between drinks they'd swell around the cabin and strike\n     attitudes and spout; and pretty soon they got out a greasy old deck\n     and went to playing euchre at ten cents a corner--on trust. I began\n     to notice some pretty suspicious things. Mr. Emerson dealt, looked\n     at his hand, shook his head, says--\n\n\n     \"'I am the doubter and the doubt--'\n\n\n     and ca'mly bunched the hands and went to shuffling for a new\n     layout. Says he--\n\n\n     \"'They reckon ill who leave me out;\n     They know not well the subtle ways I keep.\n     I pass and deal _again_!'\n\n\n     Hang'd if he didn't go ahead and do it, too! O, he was a cool one!\n     Well, in about a minute, things were running pretty tight, but all\n     of a sudden I see by Mr. Emerson's eye he judged he had 'em. He had\n     already corralled two tricks and each of the others one. So now he\n     kind of lifts a little in his chair and says--\n\n\n     \"'I tire of globes and aces!--\n     Too long the game is played!'\n\n\n     --and down he fetched a right bower. Mr. Longfellow smiles as sweet\n     as pie and says--\n\n\n     \"'Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,\n     For the lesson thou hast taught,'\n\n\n     --and blamed if he didn't down with _another_ right bower! Emerson\n     claps his hand on his bowie, Longfellow claps his on his revolver,\n     and I went under a bunk. There was going to be trouble; but that\n     monstrous Holmes rose up, wobbling his double chins, and says he,\n     'Order, gentlemen; the first man that draws, I'll lay down on him\n     and smother him!' All quiet on the Potomac, you bet!\n\n     \"They were pretty how-come-you-so, by now, and they begun to blow.\n     Emerson says, 'The nobbiest thing I ever wrote was Barbara\n     Frietchie.' Says Longfellow, 'It don't begin with my Biglow\n     Papers.' Says Holmes, 'My Thanatopsis lays over 'em both.' They\n     mighty near ended in a fight. Then they wished they had some more\n     company--and Mr. Emerson pointed to me and says--\n\n\n     \"'Is yonder squalid peasant all\n     That this proud nursery could breed?'\n\n\n     He was a-whetting his bowie on his boot--so I let it pass. Well,\n     sir, next they took it into their heads that they would like some\n     music; so they made me stand up and sing 'When Johnny Comes\n     Marching Home' till I dropped--at thirteen minutes past four this\n     morning. That's what I've been through, my friend. When I woke at\n     seven, they were leaving, thank goodness, and Mr. Longfellow had my\n     only boots on, and his'n under his arm. Says I, 'Hold on, there,\n     Evangeline, what are you going to do with _them_! He says, 'Going\n     to make tracks with 'em; because--\n\n\n     \"'Lives of great men all remind us\n     We can make our lives sublime;\n     And, departing, leave behind us\n     Footprints on the sands of time.'\n\n\n     As I said, Mr. Twain, you are the fourth in twenty-four hours--and\n     I'm going to move; I ain't suited to a littery atmosphere.\"\n\n     I said to the miner, \"Why, my dear sir, _these_ were not the\n     gracious singers to whom we and the world pay loving reverence and\n     homage; these were impostors.\"\n\n     The miner investigated me with a calm eye for a while; then said\n     he, \"Ah! impostors, were they? Are _you_?\n\n     I did not pursue the subject, and since then I have not travelled\n     on my _nom de guerre_ enough to hurt. Such was the reminiscence I\n     was moved to contribute, Mr. Chairman. In my enthusiasm I may have\n     exaggerated the details a little, but you will easily forgive me\n     that fault, since I believe it is the first time I have ever\n     deflected from perpendicular fact on an occasion like this.\n\n\nWhat I have said to Mrs. H. is true. I did suffer during a year or two\nfrom the deep humiliations of that episode. But at last, in 1888, in\nVenice, my wife and I came across Mr. and Mrs. A. P. C., of Concord,\nMassachusetts, and a friendship began then of the sort which nothing but\ndeath terminates. The C.'s were very bright people and in every way\ncharming and companionable. We were together a month or two in Venice\nand several months in Rome, afterwards, and one day that lamented break\nof mine was mentioned. And when I was on the point of lathering those\npeople for bringing it to my mind when I had gotten the memory of it\nalmost squelched, I perceived with joy that the C.'s were indignant\nabout the way that my performance had been received in Boston. They\npoured out their opinions most freely and frankly about the frosty\nattitude of the people who were present at that performance, and about\nthe Boston newspapers for the position they had taken in regard to the\nmatter. That position was that I had been irreverent beyond belief,\nbeyond imagination. Very well, I had accepted that as a fact for a year\nor two, and had been thoroughly miserable about it whenever I thought of\nit--which was not frequently, if I could help it. Whenever I thought of\nit I wondered how I ever could have been inspired to do so unholy a\nthing. Well, the C.'s comforted me, but they did not persuade me to\ncontinue to think about the unhappy episode. I resisted that. I tried to\nget it out of my mind, and let it die, and I succeeded. Until Mrs. H.'s\nletter came, it had been a good twenty-five years since I had thought of\nthat matter; and when she said that the thing was funny I wondered if\npossibly she might be right. At any rate, my curiosity was aroused, and\nI wrote to Boston and got the whole thing copied, as above set forth.\n\nI vaguely remember some of the details of that gathering--dimly I can\nsee a hundred people--no, perhaps fifty--shadowy figures sitting at\ntables feeding, ghosts now to me, and nameless forever more. I don't\nknow who they were, but I can very distinctly see, seated at the grand\ntable and facing the rest of us, Mr. Emerson, supernaturally grave,\nunsmiling; Mr. Whittier, grave, lovely, his beautiful spirit shining out\nof his face; Mr. Longfellow, with his silken white hair and his\nbenignant face; Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, flashing smiles and affection\nand all good-fellowship everywhere like a rose-diamond whose facets are\nbeing turned toward the light first one way and then another--a charming\nman, and always fascinating, whether he was talking or whether he was\nsitting still (what _he_ would call still, but what would be more or\nlees motion to other people). I can see those figures with entire\ndistinctness across this abyss of time.\n\nOne other feature is clear--Willie Winter (for these past thousand years\ndramatic editor of the \"New York Tribune,\" and still occupying that high\npost in his old age) was there. He was much younger then than he is now,\nand he showed it. It was always a pleasure to me to see Willie Winter at\na banquet. During a matter of twenty years I was seldom at a banquet\nwhere Willie Winter was not also present, and where he did not read a\ncharming poem written for the occasion. He did it this time, and it was\nup to standard: dainty, happy, choicely phrased, and as good to listen\nto as music, and sounding exactly as if it was pouring unprepared out of\nheart and brain.\n\nNow at that point ends all that was pleasurable about that notable\ncelebration of Mr. Whittier's seventieth birthday--because I got up at\nthat point and followed Winter, with what I have no doubt I supposed\nwould be the gem of the evening--the gay oration above quoted from the\nBoston paper. I had written it all out the day before and had perfectly\nmemorized it, and I stood up there at my genial and happy and\nself-satisfied ease, and began to deliver it. Those majestic guests,\nthat row of venerable and still active volcanoes, listened, as did\neverybody else in the house, with attentive interest. Well, I delivered\nmyself of--we'll say the first two hundred words of my speech. I was\nexpecting no returns from that part of the speech, but this was not the\ncase as regarded the rest of it. I arrived now at the dialogue: 'The old\nminer said, \"You are the fourth, I'm going to move.\" \"The fourth what?\"\nsaid I. He answered, \"The fourth littery man that has been here in\ntwenty-four hours. I am going to move.\" \"Why, you don't tell me,\" said\nI. \"Who were the others?\" \"Mr. Longfellow, Mr. Emerson, Mr. Oliver\nWendell Holmes, consound the lot--\"'\n\nNow then the house's _attention_ continued, but the expression of\ninterest in the faces turned to a sort of black frost. I wondered what\nthe trouble was. I didn't know. I went on, but with difficulty--I\nstruggled along, and entered upon that miner's fearful description of\nthe bogus Emerson, the bogus Holmes, the bogus Longfellow, always\nhoping--but with a gradually perishing hope--that somebody would laugh,\nor that somebody would at least smile, but nobody did. I didn't know\nenough to give it up and sit down, I was too new to public speaking, and\nso I went on with this awful performance, and carried it clear through\nto the end, in front of a body of people who seemed turned to stone with\nhorror. It was the sort of expression their faces would have worn if I\nhad been making these remarks about the Deity and the rest of the\nTrinity; there is no milder way in which to describe the petrified\ncondition and the ghastly expression of those people.\n\nWhen I sat down it was with a heart which had long ceased to beat. I\nshall never be as dead again as I was then. I shall never be as\nmiserable again as I was then. I speak now as one who doesn't know what\nthe condition of things may be in the next world, but in this one I\nshall never be as wretched again as I was then. Howells, who was near\nme, tried to say a comforting word, but couldn't get beyond a gasp.\nThere was no use--he understood the whole size of the disaster. He had\ngood intentions, but the words froze before they could get out. It was\nan atmosphere that would freeze anything. If Benvenuto Cellini's\nsalamander had been in that place he would not have survived to be put\ninto Cellini's autobiography. There was a frightful pause. There was an\nawful silence, a desolating silence. Then the next man on the list had\nto get up--there was no help for it. That was Bishop--Bishop had just\nburst handsomely upon the world with a most acceptable novel, which had\nappeared in the \"Atlantic Monthly,\" a place which would make any novel\nrespectable and any author noteworthy. In this case the novel itself was\nrecognized as being, without extraneous help, respectable. Bishop was\naway up in the public favor, and he was an object of high interest,\nconsequently there was a sort of national expectancy in the air; we may\nsay our American millions were standing, from Maine to Texas and from\nAlaska to Florida, holding their breath, their lips parted, their hands\nready to applaud when Bishop should get up on that occasion, and for the\nfirst time in his life speak in public. It was under these damaging\nconditions that he got up to \"make good,\" as the vulgar say. I had\nspoken several times before, and that in the reason why I was able to go\non without dying in my tracks, as I ought to have done--but Bishop had\nhad no experience. He was up facing those awful deities--facing those\nother people, those strangers--facing human beings for the first time in\nhis life, with a speech to utter. No doubt it was well packed away in\nhis memory, no doubt it was fresh and usable, until I had been heard\nfrom. I suppose that after that, and under the smothering pall of that\ndreary silence, it began to waste away and disappear out of his head\nlike the rags breaking from the edge of a fog, and presently there\nwasn't any fog left. He didn't go on--he didn't last long. It was not\nmany sentences after his first before he began to hesitate, and break,\nand lose his grip, and totter, and wobble, and at last he slumped down\nin a limp and mushy pile.\n\nWell, the programme for the occasion was probably not more than\none-third finished, but it ended there. Nobody rose. The next man hadn't\nstrength enough to get up, and everybody looked so dazed, so stupefied,\nparalyzed, it was impossible for anybody to do anything, or even try.\nNothing could go on in that strange atmosphere. Howells mournfully, and\nwithout words, hitched himself to Bishop and me and supported us out of\nthe room. It was very kind--he was most generous. He towed us tottering\naway into some room in that building, and we sat down there. I don't\nknow what my remark was now, but I know the nature of it. It was the\nkind of remark you make when you know that nothing in the world can help\nyour case. But Howells was honest--he had to say the heart-breaking\nthings he did say: that there was no help for this calamity, this\nshipwreck, this cataclysm; that this was the most disastrous thing that\nhad ever happened in anybody's history--and then he added, \"That is, for\n_you_--and consider what you have done for Bishop. It is bad enough in\nyour case, you deserve to suffer. You have committed this crime, and you\ndeserve to have all you are going to get. But here is an innocent man.\nBishop had never done you any harm, and see what you have done to him.\nHe can never hold his head up again. The world can never look upon\nBishop as being a live person. He is a corpse.\"\n\nThat is the history of that episode of twenty-eight years ago, which\npretty nearly killed me with shame during that first year or two\nwhenever it forced its way into my mind.\n\nNow, then, I take that speech up and examine it. As I said, it arrived\nthis morning, from Boston. I have read it twice, and unless I am an\nidiot, it hasn't a single defect in it from the first word to the last.\nIt is just as good as good can be. It is smart; it is saturated with\nhumor. There isn't a suggestion of coarseness or vulgarity in it\nanywhere. What could have been the matter with that house? It is\namazing, it is incredible, that they didn't shout with laughter, and\nthose deities the loudest of them all. Could the fault have been with\nme? Did I lose courage when I saw those great men up there whom I was\ngoing to describe in such a strange fashion? If that happened, if I\nshowed doubt, that can account for it, for you can't be successfully\nfunny if you show that you are afraid of it. Well, I can't account for\nit, but if I had those beloved and revered old literary immortals back\nhere now on the platform at Carnegie Hall I would take that same old\nspeech, deliver it, word for word, and melt them till they'd run all\nover that stage. Oh, the fault must have been with _me_, it is not in\nthe speech at all.\n\n[_Dictated October 3, 1907._] In some ways, I was always honest; even\nfrom my earliest years I could never bring myself to use money which I\nhad acquired in questionable ways; many a time I tried, but principle\nwas always stronger than desire. Six or eight months ago,\nLieutenant-General Nelson A. Miles was given a great dinner-party in New\nYork, and when he and I were chatting together in the drawing-room\nbefore going out to dinner he said,\n\n\"I've known you as much as thirty years, isn't it?\"\n\nI said, \"Yes, that's about it, I think.\"\n\nHe mused a moment or two and then said,\n\n\"I wonder we didn't meet in Washington in 1867; you were there at that\ntime, weren't you?\"\n\nI said, \"Yes, but there was a difference; I was not known then; I had\nnot begun to bud--I was an obscurity; but you had been adding to your\nfine Civil War record; you had just come back from your brilliant\nIndian campaign in the Far West, and had been rewarded with a\nbrigadier-generalship in the regular army, and everybody was talking\nabout you and praising you. If you had met me, you wouldn't be able to\nremember it now--unless some unusual circumstance of the meeting had\nburnt it into your memory. It is forty years ago, and people don't\nremember nobodies over a stretch of time like that.\"\n\nI didn't wish to continue the conversation along that line, so I changed\nthe subject. I could have proven to him, without any trouble, that we\ndid meet in Washington in 1867, but I thought it might embarrass one or\nthe other of us, so I didn't do it. I remember the incident very well.\nThis was the way of it:\n\nI had just come back from the Quaker City Excursion, and had made a\ncontract with Bliss of Hartford to write \"The Innocents Abroad.\" I was\nout of money, and I went down to Washington to see if I could earn\nenough there to keep me in bread and butter while I should write the\nbook. I came across William Clinton, brother of the astronomer, and\ntogether we invented a scheme for our mutual sustenance; we became the\nfathers and originators of what is a common feature in the newspaper\nworld now--the syndicate. We became the old original first Newspaper\nSyndicate on the planet; it was on a small scale, but that is usual with\nuntried new enterprises. We had twelve journals on our list; they were\nall weeklies, all obscure and poor, and all scattered far away among the\nback settlements. It was a proud thing for those little newspapers to\nhave a Washington correspondence, and a fortunate thing for us that they\nfelt in that way about it. Each of the twelve took two letters a week\nfrom us, at a dollar per letter; each of us wrote one letter per week\nand sent off six duplicates of it to these benefactors, thus acquiring\ntwenty-four dollars a week to live on--which was all we needed, in our\ncheap and humble quarters.\n\nClinton was one of the dearest and loveliest human beings I have ever\nknown, and we led a charmed existence together, in a contentment which\nknew no bounds. Clinton was refined by nature and breeding; he was a\ngentleman by nature and breeding; he was highly educated; he was of a\nbeautiful spirit; he was pure in heart and speech. He was a Scotchman,\nand a Presbyterian; a Presbyterian of the old and genuine school, being\nhonest and sincere in his religion, and loving it, and finding serenity\nand peace in it. He hadn't a vice--unless a large and grateful sympathy\nwith Scotch whiskey may be called by that name. I didn't regard it as a\nvice, because he was a Scotchman, and Scotch whiskey to a Scotchman is\nas innocent as milk is to the rest of the human race. In Clinton's case\nit was a virtue, and not an economical one. Twenty-four dollars a week\nwould really have been riches to us if we hadn't had to support that\njug; because of the jug we were always sailing pretty close to the wind,\nand any tardiness in the arrival of any part of our income was sure to\ncause us some inconvenience.\n\nI remember a time when a shortage occurred; we had to have three\ndollars, and we had to have it before the close of the day. I don't know\nnow how we happened to want all that money at one time; I only know we\nhad to have it. Clinton told me to go out and find it--and he said he\nwould also go out and see what he could do. He didn't seem to have any\ndoubt that we would succeed, but I knew that that was his religion\nworking in him; I hadn't the same confidence; I hadn't any idea where to\nturn to raise all that bullion, and I said so. I think he was ashamed of\nme, privately, because of my weak faith. He told me to give myself no\nuneasiness, no concern; and said in a simple, confident, and\nunquestioning way, \"the Lord will provide.\" I saw that he fully believed\nthe Lord would provide, but it seemed to me that if he had had my\nexperience--\n\nBut never mind that; before he was done with me his strong faith had had\nits influence, and I went forth from the place almost convinced that the\nLord really would provide.\n\nI wandered around the streets for an hour, trying to think up some way\nto get that money, but nothing suggested itself. At last I lounged into\nthe big lobby of the Ebbitt House, which was then a new hotel, and sat\ndown. Presently a dog came loafing along. He paused, glanced up at me\nand said, with his eyes, \"Are you friendly?\" I answered, with my eyes,\nthat I was. He gave his tail a grateful little wag and came forward and\nrested his jaw on my knee and lifted his brown eyes to my face in a\nwinningly affectionate way. He was a lovely creature--as beautiful as a\ngirl, and he was made all of silk and velvet. I stroked his smooth brown\nhead and fondled his drooping ears, and we were a pair of lovers right\naway. Pretty soon Brigadier-General Miles, the hero of the land, came\nstrolling by in his blue and gold splendors, with everybody's admiring\ngaze upon him. He saw the dog and stopped, and there was a light in his\neye which showed that he had a warm place in his heart for dogs like\nthis gracious creature; then he came forward and patted the dog and\nsaid,\n\n\"He is very fine--he is a wonder; would you sell him?\"\n\nI was greatly moved; it seemed a marvellous thing to me, the way\nClinton's prediction had come true. I said,\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe General said,\n\n\"What do you ask for him?\"\n\n\"Three dollars.\"\n\nThe General was manifestly surprised. He said,\n\n\"Three dollars? Only three dollars? Why, that dog is a most uncommon\ndog; he can't possibly be worth leas than fifty. If he were mine, I\nwouldn't take a hundred for him. I'm afraid you are not aware of his\nvalue. Reconsider your price if you like, I don't wish to wrong you.\"\n\nBut if he had known me he would have known that I was no more capable of\nwronging him than he was of wronging me. I responded with the same quiet\ndecision as before,\n\n\"No--three dollars. That is his price.\"\n\n\"Very well, since you insist upon it,\" said the General, and he gave me\nthree dollars and led the dog away, and disappeared up-stairs.\n\nIn about ten minutes a gentle-faced middle-aged gentleman came along,\nand began to look around here and there and under tables and everywhere,\nand I said to him,\n\n\"Is it a dog you are looking for?\"\n\nHis face was sad, before, and troubled; but it lit up gladly now, and he\nanswered,\n\n\"Yes--have you seen him?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"he was here a minute ago, and I saw him follow a\ngentleman away. I think I could find him for you if you would like me to\ntry.\"\n\nI have seldom seen a person look so grateful--and there was gratitude in\nhis voice, too, when he conceded that he would like me to try. I said I\nwould do it with great pleasure, but that as it might take a little time\nI hoped he would not mind paying me something for my trouble. He said he\nwould do it most gladly--repeating that phrase \"most gladly\"--and asked\nme how much. I said--\n\n\"Three dollars.\"\n\nHe looked surprised, and said,\n\n\"Dear me, it is nothing! I will pay you ten, quite willingly.\"\n\nBut I said,\n\n\"No, three is the price\"--and I started for the stairs without waiting\nfor any further argument, for Clinton had said that that was the amount\nthat the Lord would provide, and it seemed to me that it would be\nsacrilegious to take a penny more than was promised.\n\nI got the number of the General's room from the office-clerk, as I\npassed by his wicket, and when I reached the room I found the General\nthere caressing his dog, and quite happy. I said,\n\n\"I am sorry, but I have to take the dog again.\"\n\nHe seemed very much surprised, and said,\n\n\"Take him again? Why, he is my dog; you sold him to me, and at your own\nprice.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"it is true--but I have to have him, because the man\nwants him again.\"\n\n\"What man?\"\n\n\"The man that owns him; he wasn't my dog.\"\n\nThe General looked even more surprised than before, and for a moment he\ncouldn't seem to find his voice; then he said,\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that you were selling another man's dog--and\nknew it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I knew it wasn't my dog.\"\n\n\"Then why did you sell him?\"\n\nI said,\n\n\"Well, that is a curious question to ask. I sold him because you wanted\nhim. You offered to buy the dog; you can't deny that I was not anxious\nto sell him--I had not even thought of selling him, but it seemed to me\nthat if it could be any accommodation to you--\"\n\nHe broke me off in the middle, and said,\n\n\"_Accommodation_ to me? It is the most extraordinary spirit of\naccommodation I have ever heard of--the idea of your selling a dog that\ndidn't belong to you--\"\n\nI broke him off there, and said,\n\n\"There is no relevancy about this kind of argument; you said yourself\nthat the dog was probably worth a hundred dollars, I only asked you\nthree; was there anything unfair about that? You offered to pay more,\nyou know you did. I only asked you three; you can't deny it.\"\n\n\"Oh, what in the world has that to do with it! The crux of the matter is\nthat you didn't own the dog--can't you see that? You seem to think that\nthere is no impropriety in selling property that isn't yours provided\nyou sell it cheap. Now, then--\"\n\nI said,\n\n\"Please don't argue about it any more. You can't get around the fact\nthat the price was perfectly fair, perfectly reasonable--considering\nthat I didn't own the dog--and so arguing about it is only a waste of\nwords. I have to have him back again because the man wants him; don't\nyou see that I haven't any choice in the matter? Put yourself in my\nplace. Suppose you had sold a dog that didn't belong to you; suppose\nyou--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"don't muddle my brains any more with your idiotic\nreasonings! Take him along, and give me a rest.\"\n\nSo I paid back the three dollars and led the dog down-stairs and passed\nhim over to his owner, and collected three for my trouble.\n\nI went away then with a good conscience, because I had acted honorably;\nI never could have used the three that I sold the dog for, because it\nwas not rightly my own, but the three I got for restoring him to his\nrightful owner was righteously and properly mine, because I had earned\nit. That man might never have gotten that dog back at all, if it hadn't\nbeen for me. My principles have remained to this day what they were\nthen. I was always honest; I know I can never be otherwise. It is as I\nsaid in the beginning--I was never able to persuade myself to use money\nwhich I had acquired in questionable ways.\n\nNow, then, that is the tale. Some of it is true.\n\n                                                     MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Chapters from My Autobiography, by Mark Twain\n\n\n\n"}

The church-bell began to ring at\nfour-thirty in the morning, and from the length of time it continued\nto ring I judged that it takes the Swiss sinner a good while to get the\ninvitation through his head. Most church-bells in the world are of poor\nquality, and have a harsh and rasping sound which upsets the temper and\nproduces much sin, but the St. Nicholas bell is a good deal the worst\none that has been contrived yet, and is peculiarly maddening in its\noperation. Still, it may have its right and its excuse to exist, for the\ncommunity is poor and not every citizen can afford a clock, perhaps; but\nthere cannot be any excuse for our church-bells at home, for there is\nno family in America without a clock, and consequently there is no fair\npretext for the usual Sunday medley of dreadful sounds that issues from\nour steeples. There is much more profanity in America on Sunday than in\nall in the other six days of the week put together, and it is of a more\nbitter and malignant character than the week-day profanity, too. It is\nproduced by the cracked-pot clangor of the cheap church-bells.\n\n\n\nWe build our churches almost without regard to cost; we rear an edifice\nwhich is an adornment to the town, and we gild it, and fresco it, and\nmortgage it, and do everything we can think of to perfect it, and then\nspoil it all by putting a bell on it which afflicts everybody who hears\nit, giving some the headache, others St. Vitus's dance, and the rest the\nblind staggers.\n\nAn American village at ten o'clock on a summer Sunday is the quietest\nand peacefulest and holiest thing in nature; but it is a pretty\ndifferent thing half an hour later. Mr. Poe's poem of the \"Bells\" stands\nincomplete to this day; but it is well enough that it is so, for the\npublic reciter or \"reader\" who goes around trying to imitate the sounds\nof the various sorts of bells with his voice would find himself \"up a\nstump\" when he got to the church-bell--as Joseph Addison would say. The\nchurch is always trying to get other people to reform; it might not be\na bad idea to reform itself a little, by way of example. It is still\nclinging to one or two things which were useful once, but which are\nnot useful now, neither are they ornamental. One is the bell-ringing\nto remind a clock-caked town that it is church-time, and another is the\nreading from the pulpit of a tedious list of \"notices\" which everybody\nwho is interested has already read in the newspaper. The clergyman even\nreads the hymn through--a relic of an ancient time when hymn-books are\nscarce and costly; but everybody has a hymn-book, now, and so the public\nreading is no longer necessary. It is not merely unnecessary, it is\ngenerally painful; for the average clergyman could not fire into his\ncongregation with a shotgun and hit a worse reader than himself, unless\nthe weapon scattered shamefully. I am not meaning to be flippant and\nirreverent, I am only meaning to be truthful. The average clergyman, in\nall countries and of all denominations, is a very bad reader. One would\nthink he would at least learn how to read the Lord's Prayer, by and by,\nbut it is not so. He races through it as if he thought the quicker\nhe got it in, the sooner it would be answered. A person who does not\nappreciate the exceeding value of pauses, and does not know how to\nmeasure their duration judiciously, cannot render the grand simplicity\nand dignity of a composition like that effectively.\n\nWe took a tolerably early breakfast, and tramped off toward Zermatt\nthrough the reeking lanes of the village, glad to get away from that\nbell. By and by we had a fine spectacle on our right. It was the\nwall-like butt end of a huge glacier, which looked down on us from an\nAlpine height which was well up in the blue sky. It was an astonishing\namount of ice to be compacted together in one mass. We ciphered upon it\nand decided that it was not less than several hundred feet from the base\nof the wall of solid ice to the top of it--Harris believed it was\nreally twice that. We judged that if St. Paul's, St. Peter's, the Great\nPyramid, the Strasburg Cathedral and the Capitol in Washington were\nclustered against that wall, a man sitting on its upper edge could not\nhang his hat on the top of any one of them without reaching down three\nor four hundred feet--a thing which, of course, no man could do.\n\nTo me, that mighty glacier was very beautiful. I did not imagine that\nanybody could find fault with it; but I was mistaken. Harris had been\nsnarling for several days. He was a rabid Protestant, and he was always\nsaying:\n\n\"In the Protestant cantons you never see such poverty and dirt and\nsqualor as you do in this Catholic one; you never see the lanes and\nalleys flowing with foulness; you never see such wretched little sties\nof houses; you never see an inverted tin turnip on top of a church for\na dome; and as for a church-bell, why, you never hear a church-bell at\nall.\"\n\nAll this morning he had been finding fault, straight along. First it was\nwith the mud. He said, \"It ain't muddy in a Protestant canton when it\nrains.\" Then it was with the dogs: \"They don't have those lop-eared dogs\nin a Protestant canton.\" Then it was with the roads: \"They don't leave\nthe roads to make themselves in a Protestant canton, the people make\nthem--and they make a road that IS a road, too.\" Next it was the goats:\n\"You never see a goat shedding tears in a Protestant canton--a goat,\nthere, is one of the cheerfulest objects in nature.\" Next it was the\nchamois: \"You never see a Protestant chamois act like one of these--they\ntake a bite or two and go; but these fellows camp with you and stay.\"\nThen it was the guide-boards: \"In a Protestant canton you couldn't get\nlost if you wanted to, but you never see a guide-board in a Catholic\ncanton.\" Next, \"You never see any flower-boxes in the windows,\nhere--never anything but now and then a cat--a torpid one; but you take\na Protestant canton: windows perfectly lovely with flowers--and as for\ncats, there's just acres of them. These folks in this canton leave a\nroad to make itself, and then fine you three francs if you 'trot' over\nit--as if a horse could trot over such a sarcasm of a road.\" Next about\nthe goiter: \"THEY talk about goiter!--I haven't seen a goiter in this\nwhole canton that I couldn't put in a hat.\"\n\nHe had growled at everything, but I judged it would puzzle him to find\nanything the matter with this majestic glacier. I intimated as much; but\nhe was ready, and said with surly discontent: \"You ought to see them in\nthe Protestant cantons.\"\n\nThis irritated me. But I concealed the feeling, and asked:\n\n\"What is the matter with this one?\"\n\n\"Matter? Why, it ain't in any kind of condition. They never take any\ncare of a glacier here. The moraine has been spilling gravel around it,\nand got it all dirty.\"\n\n\"Why, man, THEY can't help that.\"\n\n\"THEY? You're right. That is, they WON'T. They could if they wanted to.\nYou never see a speck of dirt on a Protestant glacier. Look at the Rhone\nglacier. It is fifteen miles long, and seven hundred feet thick. If this\nwas a Protestant glacier you wouldn't see it looking like this, I can\ntell you.\"\n\n\"That is nonsense. What would they do with it?\"\n\n\"They would whitewash it. They always do.\"\n\nI did not believe a word of this, but rather than have trouble I let it\ngo; for it is a waste of breath to argue with a bigot. I even doubted if\nthe Rhone glacier WAS in a Protestant canton; but I did not know, so I\ncould not make anything by contradicting a man who would probably put me\ndown at once with manufactured evidence.\n\nAbout nine miles from St. Nicholas we crossed a bridge over the raging\ntorrent of the Visp, and came to a log strip of flimsy fencing which\nwas pretending to secure people from tumbling over a perpendicular wall\nforty feet high and into the river. Three children were approaching; one\nof them, a little girl, about eight years old, was running; when pretty\nclose to us she stumbled and fell, and her feet shot under the rail of\nthe fence and for a moment projected over the stream. It gave us a\nsharp shock, for we thought she was gone, sure, for the ground slanted\nsteeply, and to save herself seemed a sheer impossibility; but she\nmanaged to scramble up, and ran by us laughing.\n\nWe went forward and examined the place and saw the long tracks which her\nfeet had made in the dirt when they darted over the verge. If she had\nfinished her trip she would have struck some big rocks in the edge of\nthe water, and then the torrent would have snatched her downstream among\nthe half-covered boulders and she would have been pounded to pulp in two\nminutes. We had come exceedingly near witnessing her death.\n\n\n\nAnd now Harris's contrary nature and inborn selfishness were strikingly\nmanifested. He has no spirit of self-denial. He began straight off, and\ncontinued for an hour, to express his gratitude that the child was not\ndestroyed. I never saw such a man. That was the kind of person he was;\njust so HE was gratified, he never cared anything about anybody else. I\nhad noticed that trait in him, over and over again. Often, of course, it\nwas mere heedlessness, mere want of reflection. Doubtless this may have\nbeen the case in most instances, but it was not the less hard to bar\non that account--and after all, its bottom, its groundwork, was\nselfishness. There is no avoiding that conclusion. In the instance under\nconsideration, I did think the indecency of running on in that way might\noccur to him; but no, the child was saved and he was glad, that was\nsufficient--he cared not a straw for MY feelings, or my loss of such a\nliterary plum, snatched from my very mouth at the instant it was\nready to drop into it. His selfishness was sufficient to place his own\ngratification in being spared suffering clear before all concern for\nme, his friend. Apparently, he did not once reflect upon the valuable\ndetails which would have fallen like a windfall to me: fishing the child\nout--witnessing the surprise of the family and the stir the thing would\nhave made among the peasants--then a Swiss funeral--then the roadside\nmonument, to be paid for by us and have our names mentioned in it. And\nwe should have gone into Baedeker and been immortal. I was silent. I was\ntoo much hurt to complain. If he could act so, and be so heedless and so\nfrivolous at such a time, and actually seem to glory in it, after all\nI had done for him, I would have cut my hand off before I would let him\nsee that I was wounded.\n\n\n\nWe were approaching Zermatt; consequently, we were approaching the\nrenowned Matterhorn. A month before, this mountain had been only a name\nto us, but latterly we had been moving through a steadily thickening\ndouble row of pictures of it, done in oil, water, chromo, wood, steel,\ncopper, crayon, and photography, and so it had at length become a shape\nto us--and a very distinct, decided, and familiar one, too. We were\nexpecting to recognize that mountain whenever or wherever we should run\nacross it. We were not deceived. The monarch was far away when we first\nsaw him, but there was no such thing as mistaking him. He has the rare\npeculiarity of standing by himself; he is peculiarly steep, too, and is\nalso most oddly shaped. He towers into the sky like a colossal wedge,\nwith the upper third of its blade bent a little to the left. The broad\nbase of this monster wedge is planted upon a grand glacier-paved Alpine\nplatform whose elevation is ten thousand feet above sea-level; as the\nwedge itself is some five thousand feet high, it follows that its apex\nis about fifteen thousand feet above sea-level. So the whole bulk of\nthis stately piece of rock, this sky-cleaving monolith, is above the\nline of eternal snow. Yet while all its giant neighbors have the look of\nbeing built of solid snow, from their waists up, the Matterhorn stands\nblack and naked and forbidding, the year round, or merely powdered or\nstreaked with white in places, for its sides are so steep that the\nsnow cannot stay there. Its strange form, its august isolation, and its\nmajestic unkinship with its own kind, make it--so to speak--the Napoleon\nof the mountain world. \"Grand, gloomy, and peculiar,\" is a phrase which\nfits it as aptly as it fitted the great captain.\n\nThink of a monument a mile high, standing on a pedestal two miles high!\nThis is what the Matterhorn is--a monument. Its office, henceforth, for\nall time, will be to keep watch and ward over the secret resting-place\nof the young Lord Douglas, who, in 1865, was precipitated from the\nsummit over a precipice four thousand feet high, and never seen again.\nNo man ever had such a monument as this before; the most imposing of\nthe world's other monuments are but atoms compared to it; and they will\nperish, and their places will pass from memory, but this will remain.\n\n[The accident which cost Lord Douglas his life (see Chapter xii) also\ncost the lives of three other men. These three fell four-fifths of a\nmile, and their bodies were afterward found, lying side by side, upon a\nglacier, whence they were borne to Zermatt and buried in the churchyard.\n\nThe remains of Lord Douglas have never been found. The secret of his\nsepulture, like that of Moses, must remain a mystery always.]\n\nA walk from St. Nicholas to Zermatt is a wonderful experience. Nature\nis built on a stupendous plan in that region. One marches continually\nbetween walls that are piled into the skies, with their upper heights\nbroken into a confusion of sublime shapes that gleam white and cold\nagainst the background of blue; and here and there one sees a big\nglacier displaying its grandeurs on the top of a precipice, or a\ngraceful cascade leaping and flashing down the green declivities. There\nis nothing tame, or cheap, or trivial--it is all magnificent. That\nshort valley is a picture-gallery of a notable kind, for it contains\nno mediocrities; from end to end the Creator has hung it with His\nmasterpieces.\n\n\n\nWe made Zermatt at three in the afternoon, nine hours out from\nSt. Nicholas. Distance, by guide-book, twelve miles; by pedometer\nseventy-two. We were in the heart and home of the mountain-climbers,\nnow, as all visible things testified. The snow-peaks did not hold\nthemselves aloof, in aristocratic reserve; they nestled close around,\nin a friendly, sociable way; guides, with the ropes and axes and other\nimplements of their fearful calling slung about their persons, roosted\nin a long line upon a stone wall in front of the hotel, and waited for\ncustomers; sun-burnt climbers, in mountaineering costume, and followed\nby their guides and porters, arrived from time to time, from breakneck\nexpeditions among the peaks and glaciers of the High Alps; male and\nfemale tourists, on mules, filed by, in a continuous procession,\nhotelward-bound from wild adventures which would grow in grandeur every\ntime they were described at the English or American fireside, and at\nlast outgrow the possible itself.\n\nWe were not dreaming; this was not a make-believe home of the\nAlp-climber, created by our heated imaginations; no, for here was Mr.\nGirdlestone himself, the famous Englishman who hunts his way to the most\nformidable Alpine summits without a guide. I was not equal to imagining\na Girdlestone; it was all I could do to even realize him, while looking\nstraight at him at short range. I would rather face whole Hyde Parks of\nartillery than the ghastly forms of death which he has faced among the\npeaks and precipices of the mountains. There is probably no pleasure\nequal to the pleasure of climbing a dangerous Alp; but it is a pleasure\nwhich is confined strictly to people who can find pleasure in it. I have\nnot jumped to this conclusion; I have traveled to it per gravel-train,\nso to speak. I have thought the thing all out, and am quite sure I am\nright. A born climber's appetite for climbing is hard to satisfy; when\nit comes upon him he is like a starving man with a feast before him; he\nmay have other business on hand, but it must wait. Mr. Girdlestone had\nhad his usual summer holiday in the Alps, and had spent it in his usual\nway, hunting for unique chances to break his neck; his vacation was\nover, and his luggage packed for England, but all of a sudden a hunger\nhad come upon him to climb the tremendous Weisshorn once more, for he\nhad heard of a new and utterly impossible route up it. His baggage\nwas unpacked at once, and now he and a friend, laden with knapsacks,\nice-axes, coils of rope, and canteens of milk, were just setting out.\nThey would spend the night high up among the snows, somewhere, and\nget up at two in the morning and finish the enterprise. I had a\nstrong desire to go with them, but forced it down--a feat which Mr.\nGirdlestone, with all his fortitude, could not do.\n\nEven ladies catch the climbing mania, and are unable to throw it off.\nA famous climber, of that sex, had attempted the Weisshorn a few days\nbefore our arrival, and she and her guides had lost their way in a\nsnow-storm high up among the peaks and glaciers and been forced to\nwander around a good while before they could find a way down. When this\nlady reached the bottom, she had been on her feet twenty-three hours!\n\nOur guides, hired on the Gemmi, were already at Zermatt when we\nreached there. So there was nothing to interfere with our getting up an\nadventure whenever we should choose the time and the object. I resolved\nto devote my first evening in Zermatt to studying up the subject of\nAlpine climbing, by way of preparation.\n\nI read several books, and here are some of the things I found out. One's\nshoes must be strong and heavy, and have pointed hobnails in them. The\nalpenstock must be of the best wood, for if it should break, loss of\nlife might be the result. One should carry an ax, to cut steps in the\nice with, on the great heights. There must be a ladder, for there are\nsteep bits of rock which can be surmounted with this instrument--or this\nutensil--but could not be surmounted without it; such an obstruction\nhas compelled the tourist to waste hours hunting another route, when a\nladder would have saved him all trouble. One must have from one hundred\nand fifty to five hundred feet of strong rope, to be used in lowering\nthe party down steep declivities which are too steep and smooth to\nbe traversed in any other way. One must have a steel hook, on another\nrope--a very useful thing; for when one is ascending and comes to a low\nbluff which is yet too high for the ladder, he swings this rope aloft\nlike a lasso, the hook catches at the top of the bluff, and then the\ntourist climbs the rope, hand over hand--being always particular to try\nand forget that if the hook gives way he will never stop falling till\nhe arrives in some part of Switzerland where they are not expecting him.\nAnother important thing--there must be a rope to tie the whole party\ntogether with, so that if one falls from a mountain or down a bottomless\nchasm in a glacier, the others may brace back on the rope and save him.\nOne must have a silk veil, to protect his face from snow, sleet, hail\nand gale, and colored goggles to protect his eyes from that dangerous\nenemy, snow-blindness. Finally, there must be some porters, to carry\nprovisions, wine and scientific instruments, and also blanket bags for\nthe party to sleep in.\n\n\n\nI closed my readings with a fearful adventure which Mr. Whymper once had\non the Matterhorn when he was prowling around alone, five thousand\nfeet above the town of Breil. He was edging his way gingerly around\nthe corner of a precipice where the upper edge of a sharp declivity of\nice-glazed snow joined it. This declivity swept down a couple of hundred\nfeet, into a gully which curved around and ended at a precipice eight\nhundred feet high, overlooking a glacier. His foot slipped, and he fell.\n\nHe says:\n\n\"My knapsack brought my head down first, and I pitched into some rocks\nabout a dozen feet below; they caught something, and tumbled me off\nthe edge, head over heels, into the gully; the baton was dashed from my\nhands, and I whirled downward in a series of bounds, each longer than\nthe last; now over ice, now into rocks, striking my head four or five\ntimes, each time with increased force. The last bound sent me spinning\nthrough the air in a leap of fifty or sixty feet, from one side of the\ngully to the other, and I struck the rocks, luckily, with the whole of\nmy left side. They caught my clothes for a moment, and I fell back on to\nthe snow with motion arrested. My head fortunately came the right side\nup, and a few frantic catches brought me to a halt, in the neck of the\ngully and on the verge of the precipice. Baton, hat, and veil skimmed\nby and disappeared, and the crash of the rocks--which I had started--as\nthey fell on to the glacier, told how narrow had been the escape from\nutter destruction. As it was, I fell nearly two hundred feet in seven or\neight bounds. Ten feet more would have taken me in one gigantic leap of\neight hundred feet on to the glacier below.\n\n\n\n\"The situation was sufficiently serious. The rocks could not be let go\nfor a moment, and the blood was spurting out of more than twenty cuts.\nThe most serious ones were in the head, and I vainly tried to close\nthem with one hand, while holding on with the other. It was useless;\nthe blood gushed out in blinding jets at each pulsation. At last, in a\nmoment of inspiration, I kicked out a big lump of snow and struck it\nas plaster on my head. The idea was a happy one, and the flow of blood\ndiminished. Then, scrambling up, I got, not a moment too soon, to\na place of safety, and fainted away. The sun was setting when\nconsciousness returned, and it was pitch-dark before the Great Staircase\nwas descended; but by a combination of luck and care, the whole four\nthousand seven hundred feet of descent to Breil was accomplished without\na slip, or once missing the way.\"\n\nHis wounds kept him abed some days. Then he got up and climbed that\nmountain again. That is the way with a true Alp-climber; the more fun he\nhas, the more he wants.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n[Our Imposing Column Starts Upward]\n\n\nAfter I had finished my readings, I was no longer myself; I was tranced,\nuplifted, intoxicated, by the almost incredible perils and adventures\nI had been following my authors through, and the triumphs I had been\nsharing with them. I sat silent some time, then turned to Harris and\nsaid:\n\n\"My mind is made up.\"\n\nSomething in my tone struck him: and when he glanced at my eye and\nread what was written there, his face paled perceptibly. He hesitated a\nmoment, then said:\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\nI answered, with perfect calmness:\n\n\"I will ascend the Riffelberg.\"\n\nIf I had shot my poor friend he could not have fallen from his chair\nmore suddenly. If I had been his father he could not have pleaded harder\nto get me to give up my purpose. But I turned a deaf ear to all he said.\nWhen he perceived at last that nothing could alter my determination, he\nceased to urge, and for a while the deep silence was broken only by his\nsobs. I sat in marble resolution, with my eyes fixed upon vacancy, for\nin spirit I was already wrestling with the perils of the mountains, and\nmy friend sat gazing at me in adoring admiration through his tears.\nAt last he threw himself upon me in a loving embrace and exclaimed in\nbroken tones:\n\n\"Your Harris will never desert you. We will die together.\"\n\nI cheered the noble fellow with praises, and soon his fears were\nforgotten and he was eager for the adventure. He wanted to summon the\nguides at once and leave at two in the morning, as he supposed the\ncustom was; but I explained that nobody was looking at that hour; and\nthat the start in the dark was not usually made from the village but\nfrom the first night's resting-place on the mountain side. I said we\nwould leave the village at 3 or 4 P.M. on the morrow; meantime he could\nnotify the guides, and also let the public know of the attempt which we\nproposed to make.\n\nI went to bed, but not to sleep. No man can sleep when he is about to\nundertake one of these Alpine exploits. I tossed feverishly all night\nlong, and was glad enough when I heard the clock strike half past eleven\nand knew it was time to get up for dinner. I rose, jaded and rusty, and\nwent to the noon meal, where I found myself the center of interest and\ncuriosity; for the news was already abroad. It is not easy to eat calmly\nwhen you are a lion; but it is very pleasant, nevertheless.\n\nAs usual, at Zermatt, when a great ascent is about to be undertaken,\neverybody, native and foreign, laid aside his own projects and took up\na good position to observe the start. The expedition consisted of 198\npersons, including the mules; or 205, including the cows. As follows:\n\n   CHIEFS OF SERVICE    SUBORDINATES\n\n    Myself      1  Veterinary Surgeon\n    Mr. Harris  1  Butler\n 17  Guides     12  Waiters\n 4  Surgeons     1  Footman\n 1  Geologist1  Barber\n 1  Botanist     1  Head Cook\n 3  Chaplains    9  Assistants\n 2  Draftsman    4  Pastry Cooks\n 15  Barkeepers  1  Confectionery Artist\n 1  Latinist\n\n    TRANSPORTATION, ETC.\n\n 27  Porters     3  Coarse Washers and Ironers\n 44  Mules       1  Fine ditto\n 44  Muleteers   7  Cows\n               2  Milkers\n\nTotal, 154 men, 51 animals. Grand Total, 205.\n\n\n   RATIONS, ETC.

At that hour it began to move. In point of numbers and\nspectacular effect, it was the most imposing expedition that had ever\nmarched from Zermatt.\n\n\n\nI commanded the chief guide to arrange the men and animals in single\nfile, twelve feet apart, and lash them all together on a strong rope. He\nobjected that the first two miles was a dead level, with plenty of room,\nand that the rope was never used except in very dangerous places. But\nI would not listen to that. My reading had taught me that many serious\naccidents had happened in the Alps simply from not having the people\ntied up soon enough; I was not going to add one to the list. The guide\nthen obeyed my order.\n\nWhen the procession stood at ease, roped together, and ready to move, I\nnever saw a finer sight. It was 3,122 feet long--over half a mile; every\nman and me was on foot, and had on his green veil and his blue goggles,\nand his white rag around his hat, and his coil of rope over one shoulder\nand under the other, and his ice-ax in his belt, and carried his\nalpenstock in his left hand, his umbrella (closed) in his right, and his\ncrutches slung at his back. The burdens of the pack-mules and the horns\nof the cows were decked with the Edelweiss and the Alpine rose.\n\nI and my agent were the only persons mounted. We were in the post of\ndanger in the extreme rear, and tied securely to five guides apiece. Our\narmor-bearers carried our ice-axes, alpenstocks, and other implements\nfor us. We were mounted upon very small donkeys, as a measure of safety;\nin time of peril we could straighten our legs and stand up, and let\nthe donkey walk from under. Still, I cannot recommend this sort of\nanimal--at least for excursions of mere pleasure--because his\nears interrupt the view. I and my agent possessed the regulation\nmountaineering costumes, but concluded to leave them behind. Out of\nrespect for the great numbers of tourists of both sexes who would be\nassembled in front of the hotels to see us pass, and also out of respect\nfor the many tourists whom we expected to encounter on our expedition,\nwe decided to make the ascent in evening dress.\n\n\n\nWe watered the caravan at the cold stream which rushes down a trough\nnear the end of the village, and soon afterward left the haunts of\ncivilization behind us. About half past five o'clock we arrived at a\nbridge which spans the Visp, and after throwing over a detachment to see\nif it was safe, the caravan crossed without accident. The way now led,\nby a gentle ascent, carpeted with fresh green grass, to the church at\nWinkelmatten. Without stopping to examine this edifice, I executed\na flank movement to the right and crossed the bridge over the\nFindelenbach, after first testing its strength. Here I deployed to the\nright again, and presently entered an inviting stretch of meadowland\nwhich was unoccupied save by a couple of deserted huts toward the\nfurthest extremity. These meadows offered an excellent camping-place.\nWe pitched our tents, supped, established a proper grade, recorded the\nevents of the day, and then went to bed.\n\nWe rose at two in the morning and dressed by candle-light. It was a\ndismal and chilly business. A few stars were shining, but the general\nheavens were overcast, and the great shaft of the Matterhorn was draped\nin a cable pall of clouds. The chief guide advised a delay; he said he\nfeared it was going to rain. We waited until nine o'clock, and then got\naway in tolerably clear weather.\n\n\n\nOur course led up some terrific steeps, densely wooded with larches and\ncedars, and traversed by paths which the rains had guttered and which\nwere obstructed by loose stones. To add to the danger and inconvenience,\nwe were constantly meeting returning tourists on foot and horseback, and\nas constantly being crowded and battered by ascending tourists who were\nin a hurry and wanted to get by.\n\nOur troubles thickened. About the middle of the afternoon the seventeen\nguides called a halt and held a consultation. After consulting an hour\nthey said their first suspicion remained intact--that is to say, they\nbelieved they were lost. I asked if they did not KNOW it? No, they said,\nthey COULDN'T absolutely know whether they were lost or not, because\nnone of them had ever been in that part of the country before. They had\na strong instinct that they were lost, but they had no proofs--except\nthat they did not know where they were. They had met no tourists for\nsome time, and they considered that a suspicious sign.\n\nPlainly we were in an ugly fix. The guides were naturally unwilling to\ngo alone and seek a way out of the difficulty; so we all went together.\nFor better security we moved slow and cautiously, for the forest was\nvery dense. We did not move up the mountain, but around it, hoping to\nstrike across the old trail. Toward nightfall, when we were about tired\nout, we came up against a rock as big as a cottage. This barrier took\nall the remaining spirit out of the men, and a panic of fear and despair\nensued. They moaned and wept, and said they should never see their homes\nand their dear ones again. Then they began to upbraid me for bringing\nthem upon this fatal expedition. Some even muttered threats against me.\n\nClearly it was no time to show weakness. So I made a speech in which I\nsaid that other Alp-climbers had been in as perilous a position as this,\nand yet by courage and perseverance had escaped. I promised to stand\nby them, I promised to rescue them. I closed by saying we had plenty\nof provisions to maintain us for quite a siege--and did they suppose\nZermatt would allow half a mile of men and mules to mysteriously\ndisappear during any considerable time, right above their noses, and\nmake no inquiries? No, Zermatt would send out searching-expeditions and\nwe should be saved.\n\nThis speech had a great effect. The men pitched the tents with some\nlittle show of cheerfulness, and we were snugly under cover when the\nnight shut down. I now reaped the reward of my wisdom in providing one\narticle which is not mentioned in any book of Alpine adventure but this.\nI refer to the paregoric. But for that beneficent drug, would have not\none of those men slept a moment during that fearful night. But for that\ngentle persuader they must have tossed, unsoothed, the night through;\nfor the whiskey was for me. Yes, they would have risen in the morning\nunfitted for their heavy task. As it was, everybody slept but my agent\nand me--only we and the barkeepers. I would not permit myself to sleep\nat such a time. I considered myself responsible for all those lives. I\nmeant to be on hand and ready, in case of avalanches up there, but I did\nnot know it then.\n\nWe watched the weather all through that awful night, and kept an eye on\nthe barometer, to be prepared for the least change. There was not the\nslightest change recorded by the instrument, during the whole time.\nWords cannot describe the comfort that that friendly, hopeful, steadfast\nthing was to me in that season of trouble. It was a defective barometer,\nand had no hand but the stationary brass pointer, but I did not know\nthat until afterward. If I should be in such a situation again, I should\nnot wish for any barometer but that one.\n\n\n\nAll hands rose at two in the morning and took breakfast, and as soon as\nit was light we roped ourselves together and went at that rock. For some\ntime we tried the hook-rope and other means of scaling it, but without\nsuccess--that is, without perfect success. The hook caught once, and\nHarris started up it hand over hand, but the hold broke and if there\nhad not happened to be a chaplain sitting underneath at the time, Harris\nwould certainly have been crippled. As it was, it was the chaplain. He\ntook to his crutches, and I ordered the hook-rope to be laid aside. It\nwas too dangerous an implement where so many people are standing around.\n\n\n\nWe were puzzled for a while; then somebody thought of the ladders.\nOne of these was leaned against the rock, and the men went up it tied\ntogether in couples. Another ladder was sent up for use in descending.\nAt the end of half an hour everybody was over, and that rock was\nconquered. We gave our first grand shout of triumph. But the joy was\nshort-lived, for somebody asked how we were going to get the animals\nover.\n\nThis was a serious difficulty; in fact, it was an impossibility.\nThe courage of the men began to waver immediately; once more we were\nthreatened with a panic. But when the danger was most imminent, we were\nsaved in a mysterious way. A mule which had attracted attention from the\nbeginning by its disposition to experiment, tried to eat a five-pound\ncan of nitroglycerin. This happened right alongside the rock. The\nexplosion threw us all to the ground, and covered us with dirt and\ndebris; it frightened us extremely, too, for the crash it made was\ndeafening, and the violence of the shock made the ground tremble.\nHowever, we were grateful, for the rock was gone. Its place was occupied\nby a new cellar, about thirty feet across, by fifteen feet deep. The\nexplosion was heard as far as Zermatt; and an hour and a half afterward,\nmany citizens of that town were knocked down and quite seriously injured\nby descending portions of mule meat, frozen solid. This shows, better\nthan any estimate in figures, how high the experimenter went.\n\n\n\nWe had nothing to do, now, but bridge the cellar and proceed on our way.\nWith a cheer the men went at their work. I attended to the engineering,\nmyself. I appointed a strong detail to cut down trees with ice-axes and\ntrim them for piers to support the bridge. This was a slow business, for\nice-axes are not good to cut wood with. I caused my piers to be firmly\nset up in ranks in the cellar, and upon them I laid six of my forty-foot\nladders, side by side, and laid six more on top of them. Upon this\nbridge I caused a bed of boughs to be spread, and on top of the boughs\na bed of earth six inches deep. I stretched ropes upon either side to\nserve as railings, and then my bridge was complete. A train of elephants\ncould have crossed it in safety and comfort. By nightfall the caravan\nwas on the other side and the ladders were taken up.\n\nNext morning we went on in good spirits for a while, though our way\nwas slow and difficult, by reason of the steep and rocky nature of the\nground and the thickness of the forest; but at last a dull despondency\ncrept into the men's faces and it was apparent that not only they, but\neven the guides, were now convinced that we were lost. The fact that we\nstill met no tourists was a circumstance that was but too significant.\nAnother thing seemed to suggest that we were not only lost, but very\nbadly lost; for there must surely be searching-parties on the road\nbefore this time, yet we had seen no sign of them.\n\nDemoralization was spreading; something must be done, and done quickly,\ntoo. Fortunately, I am not unfertile in expedients. I contrived one\nnow which commended itself to all, for it promised well. I took\nthree-quarters of a mile of rope and fastened one end of it around the\nwaist of a guide, and told him to go find the road, while the caravan\nwaited. I instructed him to guide himself back by the rope, in case of\nfailure; in case of success, he was to give the rope a series of violent\njerks, whereupon the Expedition would go to him at once. He departed,\nand in two minutes had disappeared among the trees. I payed out the rope\nmyself, while everybody watched the crawling thing with eager eyes.\nThe rope crept away quite slowly, at times, at other times with some\nbriskness. Twice or thrice we seemed to get the signal, and a shout was\njust ready to break from the men's lips when they perceived it was a\nfalse alarm. But at last, when over half a mile of rope had slidden\naway, it stopped gliding and stood absolutely still--one minute--two\nminutes--three--while we held our breath and watched.\n\nWas the guide resting? Was he scanning the country from some high point?\nWas he inquiring of a chance mountaineer? Stop,--had he fainted from\nexcess of fatigue and anxiety?\n\nThis thought gave us a shock. I was in the very first act of detailing\nan Expedition to succor him, when the cord was assailed with a series of\nsuch frantic jerks that I could hardly keep hold of it. The huzza that\nwent up, then, was good to hear. \"Saved! saved!\" was the word that rang\nout, all down the long rank of the caravan.\n\n\n\nWe rose up and started at once. We found the route to be good enough\nfor a while, but it began to grow difficult, by and by, and this feature\nsteadily increased. When we judged we had gone half a mile, we momently\nexpected to see the guide; but no, he was not visible anywhere; neither\nwas he waiting, for the rope was still moving, consequently he was\ndoing the same. This argued that he had not found the road, yet, but\nwas marching to it with some peasant. There was nothing for us to do\nbut plod along--and this we did. At the end of three hours we were\nstill plodding. This was not only mysterious, but exasperating. And very\nfatiguing, too; for we had tried hard, along at first, to catch up with\nthe guide, but had only fagged ourselves, in vain; for although he was\ntraveling slowly he was yet able to go faster than the hampered caravan\nover such ground.\n\nAt three in the afternoon we were nearly dead with exhaustion--and still\nthe rope was slowly gliding out. The murmurs against the guide had been\ngrowing steadily, and at last they were become loud and savage. A mutiny\nensued. The men refused to proceed. They declared that we had been\ntraveling over and over the same ground all day, in a kind of circle.\nThey demanded that our end of the rope be made fast to a tree, so as to\nhalt the guide until we could overtake him and kill him. This was not an\nunreasonable requirement, so I gave the order.\n\nAs soon as the rope was tied, the Expedition moved forward with that\nalacrity which the thirst for vengeance usually inspires. But after a\ntiresome march of almost half a mile, we came to a hill covered thick\nwith a crumbly rubbish of stones, and so steep that no man of us all\nwas now in a condition to climb it. Every attempt failed, and ended in\ncrippling somebody. Within twenty minutes I had five men on crutches.\n\n\n\nWhenever a climber tried to assist himself by the rope, it yielded and\nlet him tumble backward. The frequency of this result suggested an idea\nto me. I ordered the caravan to 'bout face and form in marching order; I\nthen made the tow-rope fast to the rear mule, and gave the command:\n\n\"Mark time--by the right flank--forward--march!\"\n\n\n\nThe procession began to move, to the impressive strains of a\nbattle-chant, and I said to myself, \"Now, if the rope don't break I\njudge THIS will fetch that guide into the camp.\" I watched the rope\ngliding down the hill, and presently when I was all fixed for triumph\nI was confronted by a bitter disappointment; there was no guide tied to\nthe rope, it was only a very indignant old black ram. The fury of the\nbaffled Expedition exceeded all bounds. They even wanted to wreak their\nunreasoning vengeance on this innocent dumb brute. But I stood between\nthem and their prey, menaced by a bristling wall of ice-axes and\nalpenstocks, and proclaimed that there was but one road to this murder,\nand it was directly over my corpse. Even as I spoke I saw that my doom\nwas sealed, except a miracle supervened to divert these madmen from\ntheir fell purpose. I see the sickening wall of weapons now; I see that\nadvancing host as I saw it then, I see the hate in those cruel eyes; I\nremember how I drooped my head upon my breast, I feel again the\nsudden earthquake shock in my rear, administered by the very ram I was\nsacrificing myself to save; I hear once more the typhoon of laughter\nthat burst from the assaulting column as I clove it from van to rear\nlike a Sepoy shot from a Rodman gun.\n\n\n\nI was saved. Yes, I was saved, and by the merciful instinct of\ningratitude which nature had planted in the breast of that treacherous\nbeast. The grace which eloquence had failed to work in those men's\nhearts, had been wrought by a laugh. The ram was set free and my life\nwas spared.\n\nWe lived to find out that that guide had deserted us as soon as he had\nplaced a half-mile between himself and us. To avert suspicion, he had\njudged it best that the line should continue to move; so he caught that\nram, and at the time that he was sitting on it making the rope fast to\nit, we were imagining that he was lying in a swoon, overcome by fatigue\nand distress. When he allowed the ram to get up it fell to plunging\naround, trying to rid itself of the rope, and this was the signal which\nwe had risen up with glad shouts to obey. We had followed this ram round\nand round in a circle all day--a thing which was proven by the discovery\nthat we had watered the Expedition seven times at one and same spring in\nseven hours. As expert a woodman as I am, I had somehow failed to notice\nthis until my attention was called to it by a hog. This hog was always\nwallowing there, and as he was the only hog we saw, his frequent\nrepetition, together with his unvarying similarity to himself, finally\ncaused me to reflect that he must be the same hog, and this led me to\nthe deduction that this must be the same spring, also--which indeed it\nwas.\n\nI made a note of this curious thing, as showing in a striking manner the\nrelative difference between glacial action and the action of the hog.\nIt is now a well-established fact that glaciers move; I consider that\nmy observations go to show, with equal conclusiveness, that a hog in a\nspring does not move. I shall be glad to receive the opinions of other\nobservers upon this point.\n\nTo return, for an explanatory moment, to that guide, and then I shall be\ndone with him. After leaving the ram tied to the rope, he had wandered\nat large a while, and then happened to run across a cow. Judging that a\ncow would naturally know more than a guide, he took her by the tail,\nand the result justified his judgment. She nibbled her leisurely way\ndownhill till it was near milking-time, then she struck for home and\ntowed him into Zermatt.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\n[I Conquer the Gorner Grat]\n\n\nWe went into camp on that wild spot to which that ram had brought us.\nThe men were greatly fatigued. Their conviction that we were lost was\nforgotten in the cheer of a good supper, and before the reaction had a\nchance to set in, I loaded them up with paregoric and put them to bed.\n\nNext morning I was considering in my mind our desperate situation and\ntrying to think of a remedy, when Harris came to me with a Baedeker\nmap which showed conclusively that the mountain we were on was still in\nSwitzerland--yes, every part of it was in Switzerland. So we were not\nlost, after all. This was an immense relief; it lifted the weight of two\nsuch mountains from my breast. I immediately had the news disseminated\nand the map was exhibited. The effect was wonderful. As soon as the men\nsaw with their own eyes that they knew where they were, and that it\nwas only the summit that was lost and not themselves, they cheered up\ninstantly and said with one accord, let the summit take care of itself.\n\nOur distresses being at an end, I now determined to rest the men in camp\nand give the scientific department of the Expedition a chance. First,\nI made a barometric observation, to get our altitude, but I could not\nperceive that there was any result. I knew, by my scientific reading,\nthat either thermometers or barometers ought to be boiled, to make them\naccurate; I did not know which it was, so I boiled them both. There was\nstill no result; so I examined these instruments and discovered that\nthey possessed radical blemishes: the barometer had no hand but the\nbrass pointer and the ball of the thermometer was stuffed with tin-foil.\nI might have boiled those things to rags, and never found out anything.\n\nI hunted up another barometer; it was new and perfect. I boiled it half\nan hour in a pot of bean soup which the cooks were making. The result\nwas unexpected: the instrument was not affecting at all, but there was\nsuch a strong barometer taste to the soup that the head cook, who was\na most conscientious person, changed its name in the bill of fare.\nThe dish was so greatly liked by all, that I ordered the cook to have\nbarometer soup every day.\n\n\n\nIt was believed that the barometer might eventually be injured, but I\ndid not care for that. I had demonstrated to my satisfaction that it\ncould not tell how high a mountain was, therefore I had no real use for\nit. Changes in the weather I could take care of without it; I did not\nwish to know when the weather was going to be good, what I wanted to\nknow was when it was going to be bad, and this I could find out from\nHarris's corns. Harris had had his corns tested and regulated at the\ngovernment observatory in Heidelberg, and one could depend upon them\nwith confidence. So I transferred the new barometer to the cooking\ndepartment, to be used for the official mess. It was found that even a\npretty fair article of soup could be made from the defective barometer;\nso I allowed that one to be transferred to the subordinate mess.\n\nI next boiled the thermometer, and got a most excellent result; the\nmercury went up to about 200 degrees Fahrenheit. In the opinion of the\nother scientists of the Expedition, this seemed to indicate that we had\nattained the extraordinary altitude of two hundred thousand feet above\nsea-level. Science places the line of eternal snow at about ten thousand\nfeet above sea-level. There was no snow where we were, consequently\nit was proven that the eternal snow-line ceases somewhere above the\nten-thousand-foot level and does not begin any more. This was an\ninteresting fact, and one which had not been observed by any observer\nbefore. It was as valuable as interesting, too, since it would open up\nthe deserted summits of the highest Alps to population and agriculture.\nIt was a proud thing to be where we were, yet it caused us a pang\nto reflect that but for that ram we might just as well have been two\nhundred thousand feet higher.\n\nThe success of my last experiment induced me to try an experiment with\nmy photographic apparatus. I got it out, and boiled one of my cameras,\nbut the thing was a failure; it made the wood swell up and burst, and I\ncould not see that the lenses were any better than they were before.\n\nI now concluded to boil a guide. It might improve him, it could not\nimpair his usefulness. But I was not allowed to proceed. Guides have\nno feeling for science, and this one would not consent to be made\nuncomfortable in its interest.\n\nIn the midst of my scientific work, one of those needless accidents\nhappened which are always occurring among the ignorant and thoughtless.\nA porter shot at a chamois and missed it and crippled the Latinist.\nThis was not a serious matter to me, for a Latinist's duties are as well\nperformed on crutches as otherwise--but the fact remained that if the\nLatinist had not happened to be in the way a mule would have got that\nload. That would have been quite another matter, for when it comes down\nto a question of value there is a palpable difference between a Latinist\nand a mule. I could not depend on having a Latinist in the right place\nevery time; so, to make things safe, I ordered that in the future the\nchamois must not be hunted within limits of the camp with any other\nweapon than the forefinger.\n\nMy nerves had hardly grown quiet after this affair when they got another\nshake-up--one which utterly unmanned me for a moment: a rumor swept\nsuddenly through the camp that one of the barkeepers had fallen over a\nprecipice!\n\nHowever, it turned out that it was only a chaplain. I had laid in an\nextra force of chaplains, purposely to be prepared for emergencies\nlike this, but by some unaccountable oversight had come away rather\nshort-handed in the matter of barkeepers.\n\nOn the following morning we moved on, well refreshed and in good\nspirits. I remember this day with peculiar pleasure, because it saw\nour road restored to us. Yes, we found our road again, and in quite an\nextraordinary way. We had plodded along some two hours and a half, when\nwe came up against a solid mass of rock about twenty feet high. I did\nnot need to be instructed by a mule this time. I was already beginning\nto know more than any mule in the Expedition. I at once put in a blast\nof dynamite, and lifted that rock out of the way. But to my surprise and\nmortification, I found that there had been a chalet on top of it.\n\nI picked up such members of the family as fell in my vicinity, and\nsubordinates of my corps collected the rest. None of these poor people\nwere injured, happily, but they were much annoyed. I explained to\nthe head chaleteer just how the thing happened, and that I was only\nsearching for the road, and would certainly have given him timely notice\nif I had known he was up there. I said I had meant no harm, and hoped\nI had not lowered myself in his estimation by raising him a few rods in\nthe air. I said many other judicious things, and finally when I offered\nto rebuild his chalet, and pay for the breakages, and throw in the\ncellar, he was mollified and satisfied. He hadn't any cellar at all,\nbefore; he would not have as good a view, now, as formerly, but what he\nhad lost in view he had gained in cellar, by exact measurement. He said\nthere wasn't another hole like that in the mountains--and he would have\nbeen right if the late mule had not tried to eat up the nitroglycerin.\n\nI put a hundred and sixteen men at work, and they rebuilt the chalet\nfrom its own debris in fifteen minutes. It was a good deal more\npicturesque than it was before, too. The man said we were now on the\nFeil-Stutz, above the Schwegmatt--information which I was glad to get,\nsince it gave us our position to a degree of particularity which we had\nnot been accustomed to for a day or so. We also learned that we were\nstanding at the foot of the Riffelberg proper, and that the initial\nchapter of our work was completed.\n\n\n\nWe had a fine view, from here, of the energetic Visp, as it makes its\nfirst plunge into the world from under a huge arch of solid ice, worn\nthrough the foot-wall of the great Gorner Glacier; and we could also see\nthe Furggenbach, which is the outlet of the Furggen Glacier.\n\nThe mule-road to the summit of the Riffelberg passed right in front of\nthe chalet, a circumstance which we almost immediately noticed, because\na procession of tourists was filing along it pretty much all the time.\n\n\"Pretty much\" may not be elegant English, but it is high time it was.\nThere is no elegant word or phrase which means just what it means.--M.T.\n\nThe chaleteer's business consisted in furnishing refreshments to\ntourists. My blast had interrupted this trade for a few minutes, by\nbreaking all the bottles on the place; but I gave the man a lot of\nwhiskey to sell for Alpine champagne, and a lot of vinegar which would\nanswer for Rhine wine, consequently trade was soon as brisk as ever.\n\nLeaving the Expedition outside to rest, I quartered myself in the\nchalet, with Harris, proposing to correct my journals and scientific\nobservations before continuing the ascent. I had hardly begun my work\nwhen a tall, slender, vigorous American youth of about twenty-three, who\nwas on his way down the mountain, entered and came toward me with that\nbreezy self-complacency which is the adolescent's idea of the well-bred\nease of the man of the world. His hair was short and parted accurately\nin the middle, and he had all the look of an American person who would\nbe likely to begin his signature with an initial, and spell his middle\nname out. He introduced himself, smiling a smirky smile borrowed from\nthe courtiers of the stage, extended a fair-skinned talon, and while he\ngripped my hand in it he bent his body forward three times at the\nhips, as the stage courtier does, and said in the airiest and most\ncondescending and patronizing way--I quite remember his exact language:\n\n\"Very glad to make your acquaintance, 'm sure; very glad indeed, assure\nyou. I've read all your little efforts and greatly admired them, and\nwhen I heard you were here, I ...\"\n\nI indicated a chair, and he sat down. This grandee was the grandson of\nan American of considerable note in his day, and not wholly forgotten\nyet--a man who came so near being a great man that he was quite\ngenerally accounted one while he lived.\n\n\n\nI slowly paced the floor, pondering scientific problems, and heard this\nconversation:\n\nGRANDSON. First visit to Europe?\n\nHARRIS. Mine? Yes.\n\nG.S. (With a soft reminiscent sigh suggestive of bygone joys that may\nbe tasted in their freshness but once.) Ah, I know what it is to you. A\nfirst visit!--ah, the romance of it! I wish I could feel it again.\n\nH. Yes, I find it exceeds all my dreams. It is enchantment. I go...\n\nG.S. (With a dainty gesture of the hand signifying \"Spare me your callow\nenthusiasms, good friend.\") Yes, _I_ know, I know; you go to cathedrals,\nand exclaim; and you drag through league-long picture-galleries and\nexclaim; and you stand here, and there, and yonder, upon historic\nground, and continue to exclaim; and you are permeated with your first\ncrude conceptions of Art, and are proud and happy. Ah, yes, proud and\nhappy--that expresses it. Yes-yes, enjoy it--it is right--it is an\ninnocent revel.\n\nH. And you? Don't you do these things now?\n\nG.S. I! Oh, that is VERY good! My dear sir, when you are as old a\ntraveler as I am, you will not ask such a question as that. _I_ visit\nthe regulation gallery, moon around the regulation cathedral, do the\nworn round of the regulation sights, YET?--Excuse me!\n\nH. Well, what DO you do, then?\n\nG.S. Do? I flit--and flit--for I am ever on the wing--but I avoid the\nherd. Today I am in Paris, tomorrow in Berlin, anon in Rome; but you\nwould look for me in vain in the galleries of the Louvre or the common\nresorts of the gazers in those other capitals. If you would find me, you\nmust look in the unvisited nooks and corners where others never think\nof going. One day you will find me making myself at home in some obscure\npeasant's cabin, another day you will find me in some forgotten castle\nworshiping some little gem or art which the careless eye has overlooked\nand which the unexperienced would despise; again you will find me as\nguest in the inner sanctuaries of palaces while the herd is content to\nget a hurried glimpse of the unused chambers by feeing a servant.\n\nH. You are a GUEST in such places?\n\nG.S. And a welcoming one.\n\nH. It is surprising. How does it come?\n\nG.S. My grandfather's name is a passport to all the courts in Europe. I\nhave only to utter that name and every door is open to me. I flit from\ncourt to court at my own free will and pleasure, and am always welcome.\nI am as much at home in the palaces of Europe as you are among your\nrelatives. I know every titled person in Europe, I think. I have my\npockets full of invitations all the time. I am under promise to go to\nItaly, where I am to be the guest of a succession of the noblest houses\nin the land. In Berlin my life is a continued round of gaiety in the\nimperial palace. It is the same, wherever I go.\n\nH. It must be very pleasant. But it must make Boston seem a little slow\nwhen you are at home.\n\nG.S. Yes, of course it does. But I don't go home much. There's no life\nthere--little to feed a man's higher nature. Boston's very narrow, you\nknow. She doesn't know it, and you couldn't convince her of it--so I say\nnothing when I'm there: where's the use? Yes, Boston is very narrow, but\nshe has such a good opinion of herself that she can't see it. A man who\nhas traveled as much as I have, and seen as much of the world, sees it\nplain enough, but he can't cure it, you know, so the best is to leave it\nand seek a sphere which is more in harmony with his tastes and culture.\nI run across there, once a year, perhaps, when I have nothing important\non hand, but I'm very soon back again. I spend my time in Europe.\n\nH. I see. You map out your plans and ...\n\nG.S. No, excuse me. I don't map out any plans. I simply follow the\ninclination of the day. I am limited by no ties, no requirements, I\nam not bound in any way. I am too old a traveler to hamper myself with\ndeliberate purposes. I am simply a traveler--an inveterate traveler--a\nman of the world, in a word--I can call myself by no other name. I do\nnot say, \"I am going here, or I am going there\"--I say nothing at all, I\nonly act. For instance, next week you may find me the guest of a grandee\nof Spain, or you may find me off for Venice, or flitting toward Dresden.\nI shall probably go to Egypt presently; friends will say to friends,\n\"He is at the Nile cataracts\"--and at that very moment they will be\nsurprised to learn that I'm away off yonder in India somewhere. I am\na constant surprise to people. They are always saying, \"Yes, he was\nin Jerusalem when we heard of him last, but goodness knows where he is\nnow.\"\n\nPresently the Grandson rose to leave--discovered he had an appointment\nwith some Emperor, perhaps. He did his graces over again: gripped me\nwith one talon, at arm's-length, pressed his hat against his stomach\nwith the other, bent his body in the middle three times, murmuring:\n\n\"Pleasure, 'm sure; great pleasure, 'm sure. Wish you much success.\"\n\nThen he removed his gracious presence. It is a great and solemn thing to\nhave a grandfather.\n\nI have not purposed to misrepresent this boy in any way, for what little\nindignation he excited in me soon passed and left nothing behind it but\ncompassion. One cannot keep up a grudge against a vacuum. I have tried\nto repeat this lad's very words; if I have failed anywhere I have at\nleast not failed to reproduce the marrow and meaning of what he said.\nHe and the innocent chatterbox whom I met on the Swiss lake are the most\nunique and interesting specimens of Young America I came across\nduring my foreign tramping. I have made honest portraits of them, not\ncaricatures.\n\n\n\nThe Grandson of twenty-three referred to himself five or six times as\nan \"old traveler,\" and as many as three times (with a serene complacency\nwhich was maddening) as a \"man of the world.\" There was something very\ndelicious about his leaving Boston to her \"narrowness,\" unreproved and\nuninstructed.\n\nI formed the caravan in marching order, presently, and after riding down\nthe line to see that it was properly roped together, gave the command to\nproceed. In a little while the road carried us to open, grassy land. We\nwere above the troublesome forest, now, and had an uninterrupted view,\nstraight before us, of our summit--the summit of the Riffelberg.\n\nWe followed the mule-road, a zigzag course, now to the right, now to\nthe left, but always up, and always crowded and incommoded by going and\ncoming files of reckless tourists who were never, in a single instance,\ntied together. I was obliged to exert the utmost care and caution, for\nin many places the road was not two yards wide, and often the lower side\nof it sloped away in slanting precipices eight and even nine feet deep.\nI had to encourage the men constantly, to keep them from giving way to\ntheir unmanly fears.\n\nWe might have made the summit before night, but for a delay caused by\nthe loss of an umbrella. I was allowing the umbrella to remain lost, but\nthe men murmured, and with reason, for in this exposed region we stood\nin peculiar need of protection against avalanches; so I went into camp\nand detached a strong party to go after the missing article.\n\nThe difficulties of the next morning were severe, but our courage\nwas high, for our goal was near. At noon we conquered the last\nimpediment--we stood at last upon the summit, and without the loss of a\nsingle man except the mule that ate the glycerin. Our great achievement\nwas achieved--the possibility of the impossible was demonstrated, and\nHarris and I walked proudly into the great dining-room of the Riffelberg\nHotel and stood our alpenstocks up in the corner.\n\nYes, I had made the grand ascent; but it was a mistake to do it in\nevening dress. The plug hats were battered, the swallow-tails were\nfluttering rags, mud added no grace, the general effect was unpleasant\nand even disreputable.\n\n\n\nThere were about seventy-five tourists at the hotel--mainly ladies and\nlittle children--and they gave us an admiring welcome which paid us for\nall our privations and sufferings. The ascent had been made, and the\nnames and dates now stand recorded on a stone monument there to prove it\nto all future tourists.\n\nI boiled a thermometer and took an altitude, with a most curious result:\nTHE SUMMIT WAS NOT AS HIGH AS THE POINT ON THE MOUNTAINSIDE WHERE I\nHAD TAKEN THE FIRST ALTITUDE. Suspecting that I had made an important\ndiscovery, I prepared to verify it. There happened to be a still higher\nsummit (called the Gorner Grat), above the hotel, and notwithstanding\nthe fact that it overlooks a glacier from a dizzy height, and that the\nascent is difficult and dangerous, I resolved to venture up there and\nboil a thermometer. So I sent a strong party, with some borrowed hoes,\nin charge of two chiefs of service, to dig a stairway in the soil all\nthe way up, and this I ascended, roped to the guides. This breezy height\nwas the summit proper--so I accomplished even more than I had originally\npurposed to do. This foolhardy exploit is recorded on another stone\nmonument.\n\n\n\nI boiled my thermometer, and sure enough, this spot, which purported to\nbe two thousand feet higher than the locality of the hotel, turned out\nto be nine thousand feet LOWER. Thus the fact was clearly demonstrated\nthat, ABOVE A CERTAIN POINT, THE HIGHER A POINT SEEMS TO BE, THE LOWER\nIT ACTUALLY IS. Our ascent itself was a great achievement, but this\ncontribution to science was an inconceivably greater matter.\n\nCavilers object that water boils at a lower and lower temperature the\nhigher and higher you go, and hence the apparent anomaly. I answer that\nI do not base my theory upon what the boiling water does, but upon what\na boiled thermometer says. You can't go behind the thermometer.\n\nI had a magnificent view of Monte Rosa, and apparently all the rest of\nthe Alpine world, from that high place. All the circling horizon was\npiled high with a mighty tumult of snowy crests. One might have\nimagined he saw before him the tented camps of a beleaguering host of\nBrobdingnagians.\n\n\n\nNOTE.--I had the very unusual luck to catch one little momentary glimpse\nof the Matterhorn wholly unencumbered by clouds. I leveled my\nphotographic apparatus at it without the loss of an instant, and should\nhave got an elegant picture if my donkey had not interfered. It was my\npurpose to draw this photograph all by myself for my book, but was\nobliged to put the mountain part of it into the hands of the\nprofessional artist because I found I could not do landscape well.\n\nBut lonely, conspicuous, and superb, rose that wonderful upright wedge,\nthe Matterhorn. Its precipitous sides were powdered over with snow, and\nthe upper half hidden in thick clouds which now and then dissolved to\ncobweb films and gave brief glimpses of the imposing tower as through a\nveil. A little later the Matterhorn took to himself the semblance of\na volcano; he was stripped naked to his apex--around this circled\nvast wreaths of white cloud which strung slowly out and streamed away\nslantwise toward the sun, a twenty-mile stretch of rolling and tumbling\nvapor, and looking just as if it were pouring out of a crater. Later\nagain, one of the mountain's sides was clean and clear, and another\nside densely clothed from base to summit in thick smokelike cloud which\nfeathered off and flew around the shaft's sharp edge like the smoke\naround the corners of a burning building. The Matterhorn is always\nexperimenting, and always gets up fine effects, too. In the sunset, when\nall the lower world is palled in gloom, it points toward heaven out of\nthe pervading blackness like a finger of fire. In the sunrise--well,\nthey say it is very fine in the sunrise.\n\nAuthorities agree that there is no such tremendous \"layout\" of snowy\nAlpine magnitude, grandeur, and sublimity to be seen from any other\naccessible point as the tourist may see from the summit of the\nRiffelberg. Therefore, let the tourist rope himself up and go there; for\nI have shown that with nerve, caution, and judgment, the thing can be\ndone.\n\nI wish to add one remark, here--in parentheses, so to speak--suggested\nby the word \"snowy,\" which I have just used. We have all seen hills and\nmountains and levels with snow on them, and so we think we know all the\naspects and effects produced by snow. But indeed we do not until we have\nseen the Alps. Possibly mass and distance add something--at any rate,\nsomething IS added. Among other noticeable things, there is a dazzling,\nintense whiteness about the distant Alpine snow, when the sun is on it,\nwhich one recognizes as peculiar, and not familiar to the eye. The snow\nwhich one is accustomed to has a tint to it--painters usually give it a\nbluish cast--but there is no perceptible tint to the distant Alpine snow\nwhen it is trying to look its whitest. As to the unimaginable\nsplendor of it when the sun is blazing down on it--well, it simply IS\nunimaginable.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\n[We Travel by Glacier]\n\n\nA guide-book is a queer thing. The reader has just seen what a man who\nundertakes the great ascent from Zermatt to the Riffelberg Hotel must\nexperience. Yet Baedeker makes these strange statements concerning this\nmatter:\n\n   1. Distance--3 hours.\n   2. The road cannot be mistaken.\n   3. Guide unnecessary.\n   4. Distance from Riffelberg Hotel to the Gorner Grat, one hour and a half.\n   5. Ascent simple and easy. Guide unnecessary.\n   6. Elevation of Zermatt above sea-level, 5,315 feet.\n   7. Elevation of Riffelberg Hotel above sea-level, 8,429 feet.\n   8. Elevation of the Gorner Grat above sea-level, 10,289 feet.\n\nI have pretty effectually throttled these errors by sending him the\nfollowing demonstrated facts:\n\n   1. Distance from Zermatt to Riffelberg Hotel, 7 days.\n   2. The road CAN be mistaken. If I am the first that did it, I want the credit\n      of it, too.\n   3. Guides ARE necessary, for none but a native can read those finger-boards.\n   4. The estimate of the elevation of the several localities above sea-level\n      is pretty correct--for Baedeker. He only misses it about a hundred and\n      eighty or ninety thousand feet.\n\nI found my arnica invaluable. My men were suffering excruciatingly, from\nthe friction of sitting down so much. During two or three days, not\none of them was able to do more than lie down or walk about; yet so\neffective was the arnica, that on the fourth all were able to sit up.\nI consider that, more than to anything else, I owe the success of our\ngreat undertaking to arnica and paregoric.\n\nMy men are being restored to health and strength, my main perplexity,\nnow, was how to get them down the mountain again. I was not willing to\nexpose the brave fellows to the perils, fatigues, and hardships of that\nfearful route again if it could be helped. First I thought of balloons;\nbut, of course, I had to give that idea up, for balloons were\nnot procurable. I thought of several other expedients, but upon\nconsideration discarded them, for cause. But at last I hit it. I was\naware that the movement of glaciers is an established fact, for I had\nread it in Baedeker; so I resolved to take passage for Zermatt on the\ngreat Gorner Glacier.\n\nVery good. The next thing was, how to get down the glacier\ncomfortably--for the mule-road to it was long, and winding, and\nwearisome. I set my mind at work, and soon thought out a plan. One looks\nstraight down upon the vast frozen river called the Gorner Glacier, from\nthe Gorner Grat, a sheer precipice twelve hundred feet high. We had\none hundred and fifty-four umbrellas--and what is an umbrella but a\nparachute?\n\nI mentioned this noble idea to Harris, with enthusiasm, and was about to\norder the Expedition to form on the Gorner Grat, with their umbrellas,\nand prepare for flight by platoons, each platoon in command of a guide,\nwhen Harris stopped me and urged me not to be too hasty. He asked me if\nthis method of descending the Alps had ever been tried before. I said\nno, I had not heard of an instance. Then, in his opinion, it was a\nmatter of considerable gravity; in his opinion it would not be well to\nsend the whole command over the cliff at once; a better way would be to\nsend down a single individual, first, and see how he fared.\n\nI saw the wisdom in this idea instantly. I said as much, and thanked\nmy agent cordially, and told him to take his umbrella and try the thing\nright away, and wave his hat when he got down, if he struck in a soft\nplace, and then I would ship the rest right along.\n\nHarris was greatly touched with this mark of confidence, and said so,\nin a voice that had a perceptible tremble in it; but at the same time he\nsaid he did not feel himself worthy of so conspicuous a favor; that it\nmight cause jealousy in the command, for there were plenty who would not\nhesitate to say he had used underhanded means to get the appointment,\nwhereas his conscience would bear him witness that he had not sought it\nat all, nor even, in his secret heart, desired it.\n\nI said these words did him extreme credit, but that he must not throw\naway the imperishable distinction of being the first man to descend\nan Alp per parachute, simply to save the feelings of some envious\nunderlings. No, I said, he MUST accept the appointment--it was no longer\nan invitation, it was a command.\n\nHe thanked me with effusion, and said that putting the thing in this\nform removed every objection. He retired, and soon returned with his\numbrella, his eye flaming with gratitude and his cheeks pallid with joy.\nJust then the head guide passed along. Harris's expression changed to\none of infinite tenderness, and he said:\n\n\"That man did me a cruel injury four days ago, and I said in my heart\nhe should live to perceive and confess that the only noble revenge a\nman can take upon his enemy is to return good for evil. I resign in his\nfavor. Appoint him.\"\n\nI threw my arms around the generous fellow and said:\n\n\"Harris, you are the noblest soul that lives. You shall not regret this\nsublime act, neither shall the world fail to know of it. You shall have\nopportunity far transcending this one, too, if I live--remember that.\"\n\nI called the head guide to me and appointed him on the spot. But the\nthing aroused no enthusiasm in him. He did not take to the idea at all.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"Tie myself to an umbrella and jump over the Gorner Grat! Excuse me,\nthere are a great many pleasanter roads to the devil than that.\"\n\n\n\nUpon a discussion of the subject with him, it appeared that he\nconsidered the project distinctly and decidedly dangerous. I was not\nconvinced, yet I was not willing to try the experiment in any risky\nway--that is, in a way that might cripple the strength and efficiency\nof the Expedition. I was about at my wits' end when it occurred to me to\ntry it on the Latinist.\n\nHe was called in. But he declined, on the plea of inexperience,\ndiffidence in public, lack of curiosity, and I didn't know what all.\nAnother man declined on account of a cold in the head; thought he\nought to avoid exposure. Another could not jump well--never COULD jump\nwell--did not believe he could jump so far without long and patient\npractice. Another was afraid it was going to rain, and his umbrella had\na hole in it. Everybody had an excuse. The result was what the reader\nhas by this time guessed: the most magnificent idea that was ever\nconceived had to be abandoned, from sheer lack of a person with\nenterprise enough to carry it out. Yes, I actually had to give that\nthing up--while doubtless I should live to see somebody use it and take\nall the credit from me.\n\nWell, I had to go overland--there was no other way. I marched the\nExpedition down the steep and tedious mule-path and took up as good a\nposition as I could upon the middle of the glacier--because Baedeker\nsaid the middle part travels the fastest. As a measure of economy,\nhowever, I put some of the heavier baggage on the shoreward parts, to go\nas slow freight.\n\nI waited and waited, but the glacier did not move. Night was coming on,\nthe darkness began to gather--still we did not budge. It occurred to me\nthen, that there might be a time-table in Baedeker; it would be well to\nfind out the hours of starting. I called for the book--it could not be\nfound. Bradshaw would certainly contain a time-table; but no Bradshaw\ncould be found.\n\nVery well, I must make the best of the situation. So I pitched the\ntents, picketed the animals, milked the cows, had supper, paregoricked\nthe men, established the watch, and went to bed--with orders to call me\nas soon as we came in sight of Zermatt.\n\nI awoke about half past ten next morning, and looked around. We hadn't\nbudged a peg! At first I could not understand it; then it occurred to me\nthat the old thing must be aground. So I cut down some trees and rigged\na spar on the starboard and another on the port side, and fooled away\nupward of three hours trying to spar her off. But it was no use. She\nwas half a mile wide and fifteen or twenty miles long, and there was\nno telling just whereabouts she WAS aground. The men began to show\nuneasiness, too, and presently they came flying to me with ashy faces,\nsaying she had sprung a leak.\n\n\n\nNothing but my cool behavior at this critical time saved us from another\npanic. I ordered them to show me the place. They led me to a spot where\na huge boulder lay in a deep pool of clear and brilliant water. It did\nlook like a pretty bad leak, but I kept that to myself. I made a pump\nand set the men to work to pump out the glacier. We made a success of\nit. I perceived, then, that it was not a leak at all. This boulder had\ndescended from a precipice and stopped on the ice in the middle of the\nglacier, and the sun had warmed it up, every day, and consequently it\nhad melted its way deeper and deeper into the ice, until at last it\nreposed, as we had found it, in a deep pool of the clearest and coldest\nwater.\n\nPresently Baedeker was found again, and I hunted eagerly for the\ntime-table. There was none. The book simply said the glacier was moving\nall the time. This was satisfactory, so I shut up the book and chose a\ngood position to view the scenery as we passed along. I stood there some\ntime enjoying the trip, but at last it occurred to me that we did\nnot seem to be gaining any on the scenery. I said to myself, \"This\nconfounded old thing's aground again, sure,\"--and opened Baedeker to\nsee if I could run across any remedy for these annoying interruptions.\nI soon found a sentence which threw a dazzling light upon the matter.\nIt said, \"The Gorner Glacier travels at an average rate of a little less\nthan an inch a day.\" I have seldom felt so outraged. I have seldom had\nmy confidence so wantonly betrayed. I made a small calculation: One inch\na day, say thirty feet a year; estimated distance to Zermatt, three and\none-eighteenth miles. Time required to go by glacier, A LITTLE OVER FIVE\nHUNDRED YEARS! I said to myself, \"I can WALK it quicker--and before I\nwill patronize such a fraud as this, I will do it.\"\n\nWhen I revealed to Harris the fact that the passenger part of this\nglacier--the central part--the lightning-express part, so to speak--was\nnot due in Zermatt till the summer of 2378, and that the baggage, coming\nalong the slow edge, would not arrive until some generations later, he\nburst out with:\n\n\"That is European management, all over! An inch a day--think of that!\nFive hundred years to go a trifle over three miles! But I am not a bit\nsurprised. It's a Catholic glacier. You can tell by the look of it. And\nthe management.\"\n\nI said, no, I believed nothing but the extreme end of it was in a\nCatholic canton.\n\n\"Well, then, it's a government glacier,\" said Harris. \"It's all the\nsame. Over here the government runs everything--so everything's slow;\nslow, and ill-managed. But with us, everything's done by private\nenterprise--and then there ain't much lolling around, you can depend\non it. I wish Tom Scott could get his hands on this torpid old slab\nonce--you'd see it take a different gait from this.\"\n\nI said I was sure he would increase the speed, if there was trade enough\nto justify it.\n\n\"He'd MAKE trade,\" said Harris. \"That's the difference between\ngovernments and individuals. Governments don't care, individuals do. Tom\nScott would take all the trade; in two years Gorner stock would go to\ntwo hundred, and inside of two more you would see all the other glaciers\nunder the hammer for taxes.\" After a reflective pause, Harris added, \"A\nlittle less than an inch a day; a little less than an INCH, mind you.\nWell, I'm losing my reverence for glaciers.\"\n\nI was feeling much the same way myself. I have traveled by canal-boat,\nox-wagon, raft, and by the Ephesus and Smyrna railway; but when it comes\ndown to good solid honest slow motion, I bet my money on the glacier. As\na means of passenger transportation, I consider the glacier a failure;\nbut as a vehicle of slow freight, I think she fills the bill. In the\nmatter of putting the fine shades on that line of business, I judge she\ncould teach the Germans something.\n\nI ordered the men to break camp and prepare for the land journey to\nZermatt. At this moment a most interesting find was made; a dark object,\nbedded in the glacial ice, was cut out with the ice-axes, and it proved\nto be a piece of the undressed skin of some animal--a hair trunk,\nperhaps; but a close inspection disabled the hair-trunk theory, and\nfurther discussion and examination exploded it entirely--that is, in the\nopinion of all the scientists except the one who had advanced it. This\none clung to his theory with affectionate fidelity characteristic of\noriginators of scientific theories, and afterward won many of the first\nscientists of the age to his view, by a very able pamphlet which he\nwrote, entitled, \"Evidences going to show that the hair trunk, in a wild\nstate, belonged to the early glacial period, and roamed the wastes of\nchaos in the company with the cave-bear, primeval man, and the other\nOoelitics of the Old Silurian family.\"\n\n\n\nEach of our scientists had a theory of his own, and put forward\nan animal of his own as a candidate for the skin. I sided with the\ngeologist of the Expedition in the belief that this patch of skin had\nonce helped to cover a Siberian elephant, in some old forgotten age--but\nwe divided there, the geologist believing that this discovery proved\nthat Siberia had formerly been located where Switzerland is now, whereas\nI held the opinion that it merely proved that the primeval Swiss was not\nthe dull savage he is represented to have been, but was a being of high\nintellectual development, who liked to go to the menagerie.\n\nWe arrived that evening, after many hardships and adventures, in some\nfields close to the great ice-arch where the mad Visp boils and surges\nout from under the foot of the great Gorner Glacier, and here we camped,\nour perils over and our magnificent undertaking successfully completed.\nWe marched into Zermatt the next day, and were received with the\nmost lavish honors and applause. A document, signed and sealed by the\nauthorities, was given to me which established and endorsed the fact\nthat I had made the ascent of the Riffelberg. This I wear around my\nneck, and it will be buried with me when I am no more.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\n[Piteous Relics at Chamonix]\n\n\nI am not so ignorant about glacial movement, now, as I was when I took\npassage on the Gorner Glacier. I have \"read up\" since. I am aware that\nthese vast bodies of ice do not travel at the same rate of speed; while\nthe Gorner Glacier makes less than an inch a day, the Unter-Aar Glacier\nmakes as much as eight; and still other glaciers are said to go twelve,\nsixteen, and even twenty inches a day. One writer says that the slowest\nglacier travels twenty-five feet a year, and the fastest four hundred.\n\nWhat is a glacier? It is easy to say it looks like a frozen river which\noccupies the bed of a winding gorge or gully between mountains. But that\ngives no notion of its vastness. For it is sometimes six hundred feet\nthick, and we are not accustomed to rivers six hundred feet deep; no,\nour rivers are six feet, twenty feet, and sometimes fifty feet deep; we\nare not quite able to grasp so large a fact as an ice-river six hundred\nfeet deep.\n\nThe glacier's surface is not smooth and level, but has deep swales and\nswelling elevations, and sometimes has the look of a tossing sea whose\nturbulent billows were frozen hard in the instant of their most violent\nmotion; the glacier's surface is not a flawless mass, but is a river\nwith cracks or crevices, some narrow, some gaping wide. Many a man, the\nvictim of a slip or a misstep, has plunged down one of these and met his\ndeath. Men have been fished out of them alive; but it was when they\ndid not go to a great depth; the cold of the great depths would quickly\nstupefy a man, whether he was hurt or unhurt. These cracks do not go\nstraight down; one can seldom see more than twenty to forty feet down\nthem; consequently men who have disappeared in them have been sought\nfor, in the hope that they had stopped within helping distance, whereas\ntheir case, in most instances, had really been hopeless from the\nbeginning.\n\nIn 1864 a party of tourists was descending Mont Blanc, and while picking\ntheir way over one of the mighty glaciers of that lofty region, roped\ntogether, as was proper, a young porter disengaged himself from the line\nand started across an ice-bridge which spanned a crevice. It broke under\nhim with a crash, and he disappeared. The others could not see how deep\nhe had gone, so it might be worthwhile to try and rescue him. A brave\nyoung guide named Michel Payot volunteered.\n\nTwo ropes were made fast to his leather belt and he bore the end of a\nthird one in his hand to tie to the victim in case he found him. He was\nlowered into the crevice, he descended deeper and deeper between the\nclear blue walls of solid ice, he approached a bend in the crack and\ndisappeared under it. Down, and still down, he went, into this profound\ngrave; when he had reached a depth of eighty feet he passed under\nanother bend in the crack, and thence descended eighty feet lower, as\nbetween perpendicular precipices. Arrived at this stage of one hundred\nand sixty feet below the surface of the glacier, he peered through the\ntwilight dimness and perceived that the chasm took another turn and\nstretched away at a steep slant to unknown deeps, for its course was\nlost in darkness. What a place that was to be in--especially if that\nleather belt should break! The compression of the belt threatened to\nsuffocate the intrepid fellow; he called to his friends to draw him up,\nbut could not make them hear. They still lowered him, deeper and deeper.\nThen he jerked his third cord as vigorously as he could; his friends\nunderstood, and dragged him out of those icy jaws of death.\n\nThen they attached a bottle to a cord and sent it down two hundred feet,\nbut it found no bottom. It came up covered with congelations--evidence\nenough that even if the poor porter reached the bottom with unbroken\nbones, a swift death from cold was sure, anyway.\n\nA glacier is a stupendous, ever-progressing, resistless plow. It pushes\nahead of it masses of boulders which are packed together, and they\nstretch across the gorge, right in front of it, like a long grave or a\nlong, sharp roof. This is called a moraine. It also shoves out a moraine\nalong each side of its course.\n\n\n\nImposing as the modern glaciers are, they are not so huge as were some\nthat once existed. For instance, Mr. Whymper says:\n\n\"At some very remote period the Valley of Aosta was occupied by a vast\nglacier, which flowed down its entire length from Mont Blanc to the\nplain of Piedmont, remained stationary, or nearly so, at its mouth\nfor many centuries, and deposited there enormous masses of debris. The\nlength of this glacier exceeded EIGHTY MILES, and it drained a basin\ntwenty-five to thirty-five miles across, bounded by the highest\nmountains in the Alps.\n\n\n\n\"The great peaks rose several thousand feet above the glaciers, and\nthen, as now, shattered by sun and frost, poured down their showers of\nrocks and stones, in witness of which there are the immense piles of\nangular fragments that constitute the moraines of Ivrea.\n\n\"The moraines around Ivrea are of extraordinary dimensions. That which\nwas on the left bank of the glacier is about THIRTEEN MILES long, and\nin some places rises to a height of TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY\nFEET above the floor of the valley! The terminal moraines (those which\nare pushed in front of the glaciers) cover something like twenty square\nmiles of country. At the mouth of the Valley of Aosta, the thickness of\nthe glacier must have been at least TWO THOUSAND feet, and its width, at\nthat part, FIVE MILES AND A QUARTER.\"\n\n\n\nIt is not easy to get at a comprehension of a mass of ice like that. If\none could cleave off the butt end of such a glacier--an oblong block\ntwo or three miles wide by five and a quarter long and two thousand\nfeet thick--he could completely hide the city of New York under it,\nand Trinity steeple would only stick up into it relatively as far as a\nshingle-nail would stick up into the bottom of a Saratoga trunk.\n\n\"The boulders from Mont Blanc, upon the plain below Ivrea, assure us\nthat the glacier which transported them existed for a prodigious length\nof time. Their present distance from the cliffs from which they were\nderived is about 420,000 feet, and if we assume that they traveled at\nthe rate of 400 feet per annum, their journey must have occupied them no\nless than 1,055 years! In all probability they did not travel so fast.\"\n\n\n\nGlaciers are sometimes hurried out of their characteristic snail-pace.\nA marvelous spectacle is presented then. Mr. Whymper refers to a case\nwhich occurred in Iceland in 1721:\n\n\"It seems that in the neighborhood of the mountain Kotlugja, large\nbodies of water formed underneath, or within the glaciers (either on\naccount of the interior heat of the earth, or from other causes), and at\nlength acquired irresistible power, tore the glaciers from their mooring\non the land, and swept them over every obstacle into the sea. Prodigious\nmasses of ice were thus borne for a distance of about ten miles over\nland in the space of a few hours; and their bulk was so enormous that\nthey covered the sea for seven miles from the shore, and remained\naground in six hundred feet of water! The denudation of the land was\nupon a grand scale. All superficial accumulations were swept away, and\nthe bedrock was exposed. It was described, in graphic language, how all\nirregularities and depressions were obliterated, and a smooth surface of\nseveral miles' area laid bare, and that this area had the appearance of\nhaving been PLANED BY A PLANE.\"\n\nThe account translated from the Icelandic says that the mountainlike\nruins of this majestic glacier so covered the sea that as far as the eye\ncould reach no open water was discoverable, even from the highest peaks.\nA monster wall or barrier of ice was built across a considerable stretch\nof land, too, by this strange irruption:\n\n\"One can form some idea of the altitude of this barrier of ice when it\nis mentioned that from Hofdabrekka farm, which lies high up on a fjeld,\none could not see Hjorleifshofdi opposite, which is a fell six hundred\nand forty feet in height; but in order to do so had to clamber up a\nmountain slope east of Hofdabrekka twelve hundred feet high.\"\n\nThese things will help the reader to understand why it is that a man who\nkeeps company with glaciers comes to feel tolerably insignificant by\nand by. The Alps and the glaciers together are able to take every bit of\nconceit out of a man and reduce his self-importance to zero if he will\nonly remain within the influence of their sublime presence long enough\nto give it a fair and reasonable chance to do its work.\n\nThe Alpine glaciers move--that is granted, now, by everybody. But there\nwas a time when people scoffed at the idea; they said you might as well\nexpect leagues of solid rock to crawl along the ground as expect leagues\nof ice to do it. But proof after proof was furnished, and the finally\nthe world had to believe.\n\nThe wise men not only said the glacier moved, but they timed its\nmovement. They ciphered out a glacier's gait, and then said confidently\nthat it would travel just so far in so many years. There is record of\na striking and curious example of the accuracy which may be attained in\nthese reckonings.\n\nIn 1820 the ascent of Mont Blanc was attempted by a Russian and two\nEnglishmen, with seven guides. They had reached a prodigious altitude,\nand were approaching the summit, when an avalanche swept several of the\nparty down a sharp slope of two hundred feet and hurled five of them\n(all guides) into one of the crevices of a glacier. The life of one\nof the five was saved by a long barometer which was strapped to his\nback--it bridged the crevice and suspended him until help came. The\nalpenstock or baton of another saved its owner in a similar way. Three\nmen were lost--Pierre Balmat, Pierre Carrier, and Auguste Tairraz. They\nhad been hurled down into the fathomless great deeps of the crevice.\n\nDr. Forbes, the English geologist, had made frequent visits to the Mont\nBlanc region, and had given much attention to the disputed question of\nthe movement of glaciers. During one of these visits he completed his\nestimates of the rate of movement of the glacier which had swallowed\nup the three guides, and uttered the prediction that the glacier would\ndeliver up its dead at the foot of the mountain thirty-five years from\nthe time of the accident, or possibly forty.\n\nA dull, slow journey--a movement imperceptible to any eye--but it was\nproceeding, nevertheless, and without cessation. It was a journey\nwhich a rolling stone would make in a few seconds--the lofty point of\ndeparture was visible from the village below in the valley.\n\nThe prediction cut curiously close to the truth; forty-one years after\nthe catastrophe, the remains were cast forth at the foot of the glacier.\n\nI find an interesting account of the matter in the HISTOIRE DU MONT\nBLANC, by Stephen d'Arve. I will condense this account, as follows:\n\nOn the 12th of August, 1861, at the hour of the close of mass, a guide\narrived out of breath at the mairie of Chamonix, and bearing on his\nshoulders a very lugubrious burden. It was a sack filled with human\nremains which he had gathered from the orifice of a crevice in the\nGlacier des Bossons. He conjectured that these were remains of the\nvictims of the catastrophe of 1820, and a minute inquest, immediately\ninstituted by the local authorities, soon demonstrated the correctness\nof his supposition. The contents of the sack were spread upon a long\ntable, and officially inventoried, as follows:\n\nPortions of three human skulls. Several tufts of black and blonde hair.\nA human jaw, furnished with fine white teeth. A forearm and hand, all\nthe fingers of the latter intact. The flesh was white and fresh,\nand both the arm and hand preserved a degree of flexibility in the\narticulations.\n\nThe ring-finger had suffered a slight abrasion, and the stain of the\nblood was still visible and unchanged after forty-one years. A left\nfoot, the flesh white and fresh.\n\nAlong with these fragments were portions of waistcoats, hats, hobnailed\nshoes, and other clothing; a wing of a pigeon, with black feathers; a\nfragment of an alpenstock; a tin lantern; and lastly, a boiled leg of\nmutton, the only flesh among all the remains that exhaled an unpleasant\nodor. The guide said that the mutton had no odor when he took it from\nthe glacier; an hour's exposure to the sun had already begun the work of\ndecomposition upon it.\n\nPersons were called for, to identify these poor pathetic relics, and a\ntouching scene ensued. Two men were still living who had witnessed the\ngrim catastrophe of nearly half a century before--Marie Couttet (saved\nby his baton) and Julien Davouassoux (saved by the barometer). These\naged men entered and approached the table. Davouassoux, more than eighty\nyears old, contemplated the mournful remains mutely and with a vacant\neye, for his intelligence and his memory were torpid with age; but\nCouttet's faculties were still perfect at seventy-two, and he exhibited\nstrong emotion. He said:\n\n\"Pierre Balmat was fair; he wore a straw hat. This bit of skull, with\nthe tuft of blond hair, was his; this is his hat. Pierre Carrier was\nvery dark; this skull was his, and this felt hat. This is Balmat's\nhand, I remember it so well!\" and the old man bent down and kissed it\nreverently, then closed his fingers upon it in an affectionate grasp,\ncrying out, \"I could never have dared to believe that before quitting\nthis world it would be granted me to press once more the hand of one of\nthose brave comrades, the hand of my good friend Balmat.\"\n\n\n\nThere is something weirdly pathetic about the picture of that\nwhite-haired veteran greeting with his loving handshake this friend\nwho had been dead forty years. When these hands had met last, they were\nalike in the softness and freshness of youth; now, one was brown and\nwrinkled and horny with age, while the other was still as young and fair\nand blemishless as if those forty years had come and gone in a single\nmoment, leaving no mark of their passage. Time had gone on, in the one\ncase; it had stood still in the other. A man who has not seen a friend\nfor a generation, keeps him in mind always as he saw him last, and is\nsomehow surprised, and is also shocked, to see the aging change the\nyears have wrought when he sees him again. Marie Couttet's experience,\nin finding his friend's hand unaltered from the image of it which he\nhad carried in his memory for forty years, is an experience which stands\nalone in the history of man, perhaps.\n\nCouttet identified other relics:\n\n\"This hat belonged to Auguste Tairraz. He carried the cage of pigeons\nwhich we proposed to set free upon the summit. Here is the wing of one\nof those pigeons. And here is the fragment of my broken baton; it was by\ngrace of that baton that my life was saved. Who could have told me that\nI should one day have the satisfaction to look again upon this bit of\nwood that supported me above the grave that swallowed up my unfortunate\ncompanions!\"\n\nNo portions of the body of Tairraz, other than a piece of the skull,\nhad been found. A diligent search was made, but without result. However,\nanother search was instituted a year later, and this had better success.\nMany fragments of clothing which had belonged to the lost guides were\ndiscovered; also, part of a lantern, and a green veil with blood-stains\non it. But the interesting feature was this:\n\nOne of the searchers came suddenly upon a sleeved arm projecting from\na crevice in the ice-wall, with the hand outstretched as if offering\ngreeting! \"The nails of this white hand were still rosy, and the pose\nof the extended fingers seemed to express an eloquent welcome to the\nlong-lost light of day.\"\n\nThe hand and arm were alone; there was no trunk. After being removed\nfrom the ice the flesh-tints quickly faded out and the rosy nails took\non the alabaster hue of death. This was the third RIGHT hand found;\ntherefore, all three of the lost men were accounted for, beyond cavil or\nquestion.\n\nDr. Hamel was the Russian gentleman of the party which made the ascent\nat the time of the famous disaster. He left Chamonix as soon as he\nconveniently could after the descent; and as he had shown a chilly\nindifference about the calamity, and offered neither sympathy nor\nassistance to the widows and orphans, he carried with him the cordial\nexecrations of the whole community. Four months before the first remains\nwere found, a Chamonix guide named Balmat--a relative of one of the lost\nmen--was in London, and one day encountered a hale old gentleman in the\nBritish Museum, who said:\n\n\"I overheard your name. Are you from Chamonix, Monsieur Balmat?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Haven't they found the bodies of my three guides, yet? I am Dr. Hamel.\"\n\n\"Alas, no, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well, you'll find them, sooner or later.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is the opinion of Dr. Forbes and Mr. Tyndall, that the glacier\nwill sooner or later restore to us the remains of the unfortunate\nvictims.\"\n\n\"Without a doubt, without a doubt. And it will be a great thing for\nChamonix, in the matter of attracting tourists. You can get up a museum\nwith those remains that will draw!\"\n\nThis savage idea has not improved the odor of Dr. Hamel's name in\nChamonix by any means. But after all, the man was sound on human nature.\nHis idea was conveyed to the public officials of Chamonix, and they\ngravely discussed it around the official council-table. They were only\nprevented from carrying it into execution by the determined opposition\nof the friends and descendants of the lost guides, who insisted on\ngiving the remains Christian burial, and succeeded in their purpose.\n\nA close watch had to be kept upon all the poor remnants and fragments,\nto prevent embezzlement. A few accessory odds and ends were sold. Rags\nand scraps of the coarse clothing were parted with at the rate equal to\nabout twenty dollars a yard; a piece of a lantern and one or two other\ntrifles brought nearly their weight in gold; and an Englishman offered a\npound sterling for a single breeches-button.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\n[The Fearful Disaster of 1865]\n\n\nOne of the most memorable of all the Alpine catastrophes was that of\nJuly, 1865, on the Matterhorn--already slightly referred to, a few\npages back. The details of it are scarcely known in America. To the vast\nmajority of readers they are not known at all. Mr. Whymper's account is\nthe only authentic one. I will import the chief portion of it into this\nbook, partly because of its intrinsic interest, and partly because it\ngives such a vivid idea of what the perilous pastime of Alp-climbing\nis. This was Mr. Whymper's NINTH attempt during a series of years, to\nvanquish that steep and stubborn pillar or rock; it succeeded, the other\neight were failures. No man had ever accomplished the ascent before,\nthough the attempts had been numerous.\n\nMR. WHYMPER'S NARRATIVE We started from Zermatt on the 13th of July, at\nhalf past five, on a brilliant and perfectly cloudless morning. We were\neight in number--Croz (guide), old Peter Taugwalder (guide) and his\ntwo sons; Lord F. Douglas, Mr. Hadow, Rev. Mr. Hudson, and I. To insure\nsteady motion, one tourist and one native walked together. The youngest\nTaugwalder fell to my share. The wine-bags also fell to my lot to carry,\nand throughout the day, after each drink, I replenished them secretly\nwith water, so that at the next halt they were found fuller than before!\nThis was considered a good omen, and little short of miraculous.\n\nOn the first day we did not intend to ascend to any great height, and we\nmounted, accordingly, very leisurely. Before twelve o'clock we had found\na good position for the tent, at a height of eleven thousand feet. We\npassed the remaining hours of daylight--some basking in the sunshine,\nsome sketching, some collecting; Hudson made tea, I coffee, and at\nlength we retired, each one to his blanket bag.\n\nWe assembled together before dawn on the 14th and started directly\nit was light enough to move. One of the young Taugwalders returned to\nZermatt. In a few minutes we turned the rib which had intercepted the\nview of the eastern face from our tent platform. The whole of this\ngreat slope was now revealed, rising for three thousand feet like a huge\nnatural staircase. Some parts were more, and others were less easy, but\nwe were not once brought to a halt by any serious impediment, for when\nan obstruction was met in front it could always be turned to the right\nor to the left. For the greater part of the way there was no occasion,\nindeed, for the rope, and sometimes Hudson led, sometimes myself. At\nsix-twenty we had attained a height of twelve thousand eight hundred\nfeet, and halted for half an hour; we then continued the ascent without\na break until nine-fifty-five, when we stopped for fifty minutes, at a\nheight of fourteen thousand feet.\n\n\n\nWe had now arrived at the foot of that part which, seen from the\nRiffelberg, seems perpendicular or overhanging. We could no longer\ncontinue on the eastern side. For a little distance we ascended by snow\nupon the AR\u00caTE--that is, the ridge--then turned over to the right, or\nnorthern side. The work became difficult, and required caution. In some\nplaces there was little to hold; the general slope of the mountain was\nLESS than forty degrees, and snow had accumulated in, and had filled\nup, the interstices of the rock-face, leaving only occasional fragments\nprojecting here and there. These were at times covered with a thin film\nof ice. It was a place which any fair mountaineer might pass in safety.\nWe bore away nearly horizontally for about four hundred feet, then\nascended directly toward the summit for about sixty feet, then doubled\nback to the ridge which descends toward Zermatt. A long stride round\na rather awkward corner brought us to snow once more. That last doubt\nvanished! The Matterhorn was ours! Nothing but two hundred feet of easy\nsnow remained to be surmounted.\n\nThe higher we rose, the more intense became the excitement. The slope\neased off, at length we could be detached, and Croz and I, dashed away,\nran a neck-and-neck race, which ended in a dead heat. At 1:40 P.M., the\nworld was at our feet, and the Matterhorn was conquered!\n\n\n\nThe others arrived. Croz now took the tent-pole, and planted it in the\nhighest snow. \"Yes,\" we said, \"there is the flag-staff, but where is the\nflag?\" \"Here it is,\" he answered, pulling off his blouse and fixing it\nto the stick. It made a poor flag, and there was no wind to float\nit out, yet it was seen all around. They saw it at Zermatt--at the\nRiffel--in the Val Tournanche... .\n\nWe remained on the summit for one hour--\n\nOne crowded hour of glorious life.\n\nIt passed away too quickly, and we began to prepare for the descent.\n\nHudson and I consulted as to the best and safest arrangement of the\nparty. We agreed that it was best for Croz to go first, and Hadow\nsecond; Hudson, who was almost equal to a guide in sureness of foot,\nwished to be third; Lord Douglas was placed next, and old Peter, the\nstrongest of the remainder, after him. I suggested to Hudson that we\nshould attach a rope to the rocks on our arrival at the difficult bit,\nand hold it as we descended, as an additional protection. He approved\nthe idea, but it was not definitely decided that it should be done. The\nparty was being arranged in the above order while I was sketching the\nsummit, and they had finished, and were waiting for me to be tied in\nline, when some one remembered that our names had not been left in a\nbottle. They requested me to write them down, and moved off while it was\nbeing done.\n\nA few minutes afterward I tied myself to young Peter, ran down after the\nothers, and caught them just as they were commencing the descent of the\ndifficult part. Great care was being taken. Only one man was moving at a\ntime; when he was firmly planted the next advanced, and so on. They had\nnot, however, attached the additional rope to rocks, and nothing was\nsaid about it. The suggestion was not made for my own sake, and I am not\nsure that it ever occurred to me again. For some little distance we two\nfollowed the others, detached from them, and should have continued so\nhad not Lord Douglas asked me, about 3 P.M., to tie on to old Peter, as\nhe feared, he said, that Taugwalder would not be able to hold his ground\nif a slip occurred.\n\nA few minutes later, a sharp-eyed lad ran into the Monte Rosa Hotel, at\nZermatt, saying that he had seen an avalanche fall from the summit of\nthe Matterhorn onto the Matterhorn glacier. The boy was reproved for\ntelling idle stories; he was right, nevertheless, and this was what he\nsaw.\n\nMichel Croz had laid aside his ax, and in order to give Mr. Hadow\ngreater security, was absolutely taking hold of his legs, and putting\nhis feet, one by one, into their proper positions. As far as I know, no\none was actually descending. I cannot speak with certainty, because the\ntwo leading men were partially hidden from my sight by an intervening\nmass of rock, but it is my belief, from the movements of their\nshoulders, that Croz, having done as I said, was in the act of turning\nround to go down a step or two himself; at this moment Mr. Hadow\nslipped, fell against him, and knocked him over. I heard one startled\nexclamation from Croz, then saw him and Mr. Hadow flying downward;\nin another moment Hudson was dragged from his steps, and Lord Douglas\nimmediately after him. All this was the work of a moment. Immediately we\nheard Croz's exclamation, old Peter and I planted ourselves as firmly as\nthe rocks would permit; the rope was taut between us, and the jerk came\non us both as on one man. We held; but the rope broke midway between\nTaugwalder and Lord Francis Douglas. For a few seconds we saw our\nunfortunate companions sliding downward on their backs, and spreading\nout their hands, endeavoring to save themselves. They passed from our\nsight uninjured, disappeared one by one, and fell from the precipice to\nprecipice onto the Matterhorn glacier below, a distance of nearly\nfour thousand feet in height. From the moment the rope broke it was\nimpossible to help them. So perished our comrades!\n\n\n\nFor more than two hours afterward I thought almost every moment that the\nnext would be my last; for the Taugwalders, utterly unnerved, were not\nonly incapable of giving assistance, but were in such a state that a\nslip might have been expected from them at any moment. After a time we\nwere able to do that which should have been done at first, and fixed\nrope to firm rocks, in addition to being tied together. These ropes were\ncut from time to time, and were left behind. Even with their assurance\nthe men were afraid to proceed, and several times old Peter turned,\nwith ashy face and faltering limbs, and said, with terrible emphasis, \"I\nCANNOT!\"\n\nAbout 6 P.M., we arrived at the snow upon the ridge descending toward\nZermatt, and all peril was over. We frequently looked, but in vain, for\ntraces of our unfortunate companions; we bent over the ridge and cried\nto them, but no sound returned. Convinced at last that they were neither\nwithin sight nor hearing, we ceased from our useless efforts; and, too\ncast down for speech, silently gathered up our things, and the little\neffects of those who were lost, and then completed the descent. Such\nis Mr. Whymper's graphic and thrilling narrative. Zermatt gossip\ndarkly hints that the elder Taugwalder cut the rope, when the accident\noccurred, in order to preserve himself from being dragged into the\nabyss; but Mr. Whymper says that the ends of the rope showed no evidence\nof cutting, but only of breaking. He adds that if Taugwalder had had the\ndisposition to cut the rope, he would not have had time to do it, the\naccident was so sudden and unexpected.\n\nLord Douglas' body has never been found. It probably lodged upon some\ninaccessible shelf in the face of the mighty precipice. Lord Douglas was\na youth of nineteen. The three other victims fell nearly four thousand\nfeet, and their bodies lay together upon the glacier when found by\nMr. Whymper and the other searchers the next morning. Their graves are\nbeside the little church in Zermatt.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\n[Chillon has a Nice, Roomy Dungeon]\n\n\nSwitzerland is simply a large, humpy, solid rock, with a thin skin of\ngrass stretched over it. Consequently, they do not dig graves, they\nblast them out with powder and fuse. They cannot afford to have large\ngraveyards, the grass skin is too circumscribed and too valuable. It is\nall required for the support of the living.\n\nThe graveyard in Zermatt occupies only about one-eighth of an acre.\nThe graves are sunk in the living rock, and are very permanent; but\noccupation of them is only temporary; the occupant can only stay till\nhis grave is needed by a later subject, he is removed, then, for they do\nnot bury one body on top of another. As I understand it, a family owns\na grave, just as it owns a house. A man dies and leaves his house to his\nson--and at the same time, this dead father succeeds to his own father's\ngrave. He moves out of the house and into the grave, and his predecessor\nmoves out of the grave and into the cellar of the chapel. I saw a black\nbox lying in the churchyard, with skull and cross-bones painted on it,\nand was told that this was used in transferring remains to the cellar.\n\nIn that cellar the bones and skulls of several hundred of former\ncitizens were compactly corded up. They made a pile eighteen feet long,\nseven feet high, and eight feet wide. I was told that in some of the\nreceptacles of this kind in the Swiss villages, the skulls were all\nmarked, and if a man wished to find the skulls of his ancestors for\nseveral generations back, he could do it by these marks, preserved in\nthe family records.\n\n\n\nAn English gentleman who had lived some years in this region, said it\nwas the cradle of compulsory education. But he said that the English\nidea that compulsory education would reduce bastardy and intemperance\nwas an error--it has not that effect. He said there was more seduction\nin the Protestant than in the Catholic cantons, because the confessional\nprotected the girls. I wonder why it doesn't protect married women in\nFrance and Spain?\n\nThis gentleman said that among the poorer peasants in the Valais, it was\ncommon for the brothers in a family to cast lots to determine which\nof them should have the coveted privilege of marrying, and his\nbrethren--doomed bachelors--heroically banded themselves together to\nhelp support the new family.\n\nWe left Zermatt in a wagon--and in a rain-storm, too--for St. Nicholas\nabout ten o'clock one morning. Again we passed between those grass-clad\nprodigious cliffs, specked with wee dwellings peeping over at us from\nvelvety green walls ten and twelve hundred feet high. It did not seem\npossible that the imaginary chamois even could climb those precipices.\nLovers on opposite cliffs probably kiss through a spy-glass, and\ncorrespond with a rifle.\n\nIn Switzerland the farmer's plow is a wide shovel, which scrapes up and\nturns over the thin earthy skin of his native rock--and there the man of\nthe plow is a hero. Now here, by our St. Nicholas road, was a grave, and\nit had a tragic story. A plowman was skinning his farm one morning--not\nthe steepest part of it, but still a steep part--that is, he was not\nskinning the front of his farm, but the roof of it, near the eaves--when\nhe absent-mindedly let go of the plow-handles to moisten his hands, in\nthe usual way; he lost his balance and fell out of his farm backward;\npoor fellow, he never touched anything till he struck bottom, fifteen\nhundred feet below. [This was on a Sunday.--M.T.] We throw a halo of\nheroism around the life of the soldier and the sailor, because of the\ndeadly dangers they are facing all the time. But we are not used to\nlooking upon farming as a heroic occupation. This is because we have not\nlived in Switzerland.\n\n\n\nFrom St. Nicholas we struck out for Visp--or Vispach--on foot. The\nrain-storms had been at work during several days, and had done a deal of\ndamage in Switzerland and Savoy. We came to one place where a stream had\nchanged its course and plunged down a mountain in a new place, sweeping\neverything before it. Two poor but precious farms by the roadside were\nruined. One was washed clear away, and the bed-rock exposed; the other\nwas buried out of sight under a tumbled chaos of rocks, gravel, mud,\nand rubbish. The resistless might of water was well exemplified. Some\nsaplings which had stood in the way were bent to the ground, stripped\nclean of their bark, and buried under rocky debris. The road had been\nswept away, too.\n\nIn another place, where the road was high up on the mountain's face, and\nits outside edge protected by flimsy masonry, we frequently came across\nspots where this masonry had carved off and left dangerous gaps for\nmules to get over; and with still more frequency we found the masonry\nslightly crumbled, and marked by mule-hoofs, thus showing that there had\nbeen danger of an accident to somebody. When at last we came to a\nbadly ruptured bit of masonry, with hoof-prints evidencing a desperate\nstruggle to regain the lost foothold, I looked quite hopefully over the\ndizzy precipice. But there was nobody down there.\n\nThey take exceedingly good care of their rivers in Switzerland and other\nportions of Europe. They wall up both banks with slanting solid stone\nmasonry--so that from end to end of these rivers the banks look like the\nwharves at St. Louis and other towns on the Mississippi River.\n\nIt was during this walk from St. Nicholas, in the shadow of the majestic\nAlps, that we came across some little children amusing themselves in\nwhat seemed, at first, a most odd and original way--but it wasn't; it\nwas in simply a natural and characteristic way. They were roped together\nwith a string, they had mimic alpenstocks and ice-axes, and were\nclimbing a meek and lowly manure-pile with a most blood-curdling amount\nof care and caution. The \"guide\" at the head of the line cut imaginary\nsteps, in a laborious and painstaking way, and not a monkey budged till\nthe step above was vacated. If we had waited we should have witnessed an\nimaginary accident, no doubt; and we should have heard the intrepid band\nhurrah when they made the summit and looked around upon the \"magnificent\nview,\" and seen them throw themselves down in exhausted attitudes for a\nrest in that commanding situation.\n\n\n\nIn Nevada I used to see the children play at silver-mining. Of course,\nthe great thing was an accident in a mine, and there were two \"star\"\nparts; that of the man who fell down the mimic shaft, and that of the\ndaring hero who was lowered into the depths to bring him up. I knew one\nsmall chap who always insisted on playing BOTH of these parts--and he\ncarried his point. He would tumble into the shaft and die, and then come\nto the surface and go back after his own remains.\n\nIt is the smartest boy that gets the hero part everywhere; he is head\nguide in Switzerland, head miner in Nevada, head bull-fighter in Spain,\netc.; but I knew a preacher's son, seven years old, who once selected\na part for himself compared to which those just mentioned are tame\nand unimpressive. Jimmy's father stopped him from driving imaginary\nhorse-cars one Sunday--stopped him from playing captain of an imaginary\nsteamboat next Sunday--stopped him from leading an imaginary army to\nbattle the following Sunday--and so on. Finally the little fellow said:\n\n\"I've tried everything, and they won't any of them do. What CAN I play?\"\n\n\"I hardly know, Jimmy; but you MUST play only things that are suitable\nto the Sabbath-day.\"\n\nNext Sunday the preacher stepped softly to a back-room door to see if\nthe children were rightly employed. He peeped in. A chair occupied the\nmiddle of the room, and on the back of it hung Jimmy's cap; one of\nhis little sisters took the cap down, nibbled at it, then passed it to\nanother small sister and said, \"Eat of this fruit, for it is good.\" The\nReverend took in the situation--alas, they were playing the Expulsion\nfrom Eden! Yet he found one little crumb of comfort. He said to himself,\n\"For once Jimmy has yielded the chief role--I have been wronging him, I\ndid not believe there was so much modesty in him; I should have expected\nhim to be either Adam or Eve.\" This crumb of comfort lasted but a very\nlittle while; he glanced around and discovered Jimmy standing in an\nimposing attitude in a corner, with a dark and deadly frown on his face.\nWhat that meant was very plain--HE WAS IMPERSONATING THE DEITY! Think of\nthe guileless sublimity of that idea.\n\n\n\nWe reached Vispach at 8 P.M., only about seven hours out from St.\nNicholas. So we must have made fully a mile and a half an hour, and it\nwas all downhill, too, and very muddy at that. We stayed all night at\nthe Hotel de Soleil; I remember it because the landlady, the portier,\nthe waitress, and the chambermaid were not separate persons, but were\nall contained in one neat and chipper suit of spotless muslin, and she\nwas the prettiest young creature I saw in all that region. She was the\nlandlord's daughter. And I remember that the only native match to her\nI saw in all Europe was the young daughter of the landlord of a village\ninn in the Black Forest. Why don't more people in Europe marry and keep\nhotel?\n\n\n\nNext morning we left with a family of English friends and went by train\nto Brevet, and thence by boat across the lake to Ouchy (Lausanne).\n\nOuchy is memorable to me, not on account of its beautiful situation and\nlovely surroundings--although these would make it stick long in one's\nmemory--but as the place where _I_ caught the London TIMES dropping into\nhumor. It was NOT aware of it, though. It did not do it on purpose.\nAn English friend called my attention to this lapse, and cut out the\nreprehensible paragraph for me. Think of encountering a grin like this\non the face of that grim journal:\n\nERRATUM.--We are requested by Reuter's Telegram Company to correct an\nerroneous announcement made in their Brisbane telegram of the 2d inst.,\npublished in our impression of the 5th inst., stating that \"Lady Kennedy\nhad given birth to twins, the eldest being a son.\" The Company explain\nthat the message they received contained the words \"Governor of\nQueensland, TWINS FIRST SON.\" Being, however, subsequently informed that\nSir Arthur Kennedy was unmarried and that there must be some mistake, a\ntelegraphic repetition was at once demanded. It has been received today\n(11th inst.) and shows that the words really telegraphed by Reuter's\nagent were \"Governor Queensland TURNS FIRST SOD,\" alluding to the\nMaryborough-Gympic Railway in course of construction. The words in\nitalics were mutilated by the telegraph in transmission from Australia,\nand reaching the company in the form mentioned above gave rise to the\nmistake.\n\nI had always had a deep and reverent compassion for the sufferings of\nthe \"prisoner of Chillon,\" whose story Byron had told in such moving\nverse; so I took the steamer and made pilgrimage to the dungeons of the\nCastle of Chillon, to see the place where poor Bonnivard endured his\ndreary captivity three hundred years ago. I am glad I did that, for it\ntook away some of the pain I was feeling on the prisoner's account. His\ndungeon was a nice, cool, roomy place, and I cannot see why he should\nhave been dissatisfied with it. If he had been imprisoned in a St.\nNicholas private dwelling, where the fertilizer prevails, and the goat\nsleeps with the guest, and the chickens roost on him and the cow comes\nin and bothers him when he wants to muse, it would have been another\nmatter altogether; but he surely could not have had a very cheerless\ntime of it in that pretty dungeon. It has romantic window-slits that\nlet in generous bars of light, and it has tall, noble columns, carved\napparently from the living rock; and what is more, they are written\nall over with thousands of names; some of them--like Byron's and Victor\nHugo's--of the first celebrity. Why didn't he amuse himself reading\nthese names? Then there are the couriers and tourists--swarms of them\nevery day--what was to hinder him from having a good time with them? I\nthink Bonnivard's sufferings have been overrated.\n\n\n\nNext, we took the train and went to Martigny, on the way to Mont Blanc.\nNext morning we started, about eight o'clock, on foot. We had plenty of\ncompany, in the way of wagon-loads and mule-loads of tourists--and dust.\nThis scattering procession of travelers was perhaps a mile long. The\nroad was uphill--interminable uphill--and tolerably steep. The weather\nwas blisteringly hot, and the man or woman who had to sit on a creeping\nmule, or in a crawling wagon, and broil in the beating sun, was an\nobject to be pitied. We could dodge among the bushes, and have the\nrelief of shade, but those people could not. They paid for a conveyance,\nand to get their money's worth they rode.\n\nWe went by the way of the T\u00eate Noir, and after we reached high ground\nthere was no lack of fine scenery. In one place the road was tunneled\nthrough a shoulder of the mountain; from there one looked down into a\ngorge with a rushing torrent in it, and on every hand was a charming\nview of rocky buttresses and wooded heights. There was a liberal\nallowance of pretty waterfalls, too, on the T\u00eate Noir route.\n\n\n\nAbout half an hour before we reached the village of Argenti\u00e8re a vast\ndome of snow with the sun blazing on it drifted into view and framed\nitself in a strong V-shaped gateway of the mountains, and we recognized\nMont Blanc, the \"monarch of the Alps.\" With every step, after that,\nthis stately dome rose higher and higher into the blue sky, and at last\nseemed to occupy the zenith.\n\nSome of Mont Blanc's neighbors--bare, light-brown, steeplelike\nrocks--were very peculiarly shaped. Some were whittled to a sharp point,\nand slightly bent at the upper end, like a lady's finger; one monster\nsugar-loaf resembled a bishop's hat; it was too steep to hold snow on\nits sides, but had some in the division.\n\n\n\nWhile we were still on very high ground, and before the descent toward\nArgenti\u00e8re began, we looked up toward a neighboring mountain-top, and\nsaw exquisite prismatic colors playing about some white clouds which\nwere so delicate as to almost resemble gossamer webs. The faint pinks\nand greens were peculiarly beautiful; none of the colors were deep, they\nwere the lightest shades. They were bewitching commingled. We sat down\nto study and enjoy this singular spectacle. The tints remained during\nseveral minutes--flitting, changing, melting into each other; paling\nalmost away for a moment, then reflushing--a shifting, restless,\nunstable succession of soft opaline gleams, shimmering over that air\nfilm of white cloud, and turning it into a fabric dainty enough to\nclothe an angel with.\n\nBy and by we perceived what those super-delicate colors, and their\ncontinuous play and movement, reminded us of; it is what one sees in a\nsoap-bubble that is drifting along, catching changes of tint from the\nobjects it passes. A soap-bubble is the most beautiful thing, and the\nmost exquisite, in nature; that lovely phantom fabric in the sky was\nsuggestive of a soap-bubble split open, and spread out in the sun. I\nwonder how much it would take to buy a soap-bubble, if there was only\none in the world? One could buy a hatful of Koh-i-Noors with the same\nmoney, no doubt.\n\n\n\nWe made the tramp from Martigny to Argenti\u00e8re in eight hours. We beat\nall the mules and wagons; we didn't usually do that. We hired a sort of\nopen baggage-wagon for the trip down the valley to Chamonix, and then\ndevoted an hour to dining. This gave the driver time to get drunk. He\nhad a friend with him, and this friend also had had time to get drunk.\n\nWhen we drove off, the driver said all the tourists had arrived and\ngone by while we were at dinner; \"but,\" said he, impressively, \"be not\ndisturbed by that--remain tranquil--give yourselves no uneasiness--their\ndust rises far before us--rest you tranquil, leave all to me--I am the\nking of drivers. Behold!\"\n\nDown came his whip, and away we clattered. I never had such a shaking up\nin my life. The recent flooding rains had washed the road clear away in\nplaces, but we never stopped, we never slowed down for anything. We tore\nright along, over rocks, rubbish, gullies, open fields--sometimes with\none or two wheels on the ground, but generally with none. Every now and\nthen that calm, good-natured madman would bend a majestic look over his\nshoulder at us and say, \"Ah, you perceive? It is as I have said--I am\nthe king of drivers.\" Every time we just missed going to destruction,\nhe would say, with tranquil happiness, \"Enjoy it, gentlemen, it is very\nrare, it is very unusual--it is given to few to ride with the king of\ndrivers--and observe, it is as I have said, I am he.\"\n\n\n\nHe spoke in French, and punctuated with hiccoughs. His friend was\nFrench, too, but spoke in German--using the same system of punctuation,\nhowever. The friend called himself the \"Captain of Mont Blanc,\" and\nwanted us to make the ascent with him. He said he had made more ascents\nthan any other man--forty seven--and his brother had made thirty-seven.\nHis brother was the best guide in the world, except himself--but he,\nyes, observe him well--he was the \"Captain of Mont Blanc\"--that title\nbelonged to none other.\n\nThe \"king\" was as good as his word--he overtook that long procession\nof tourists and went by it like a hurricane.

They had paddled over to\nthe Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six\nmiles below the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the\ntown till nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and\nalleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a\nchaos of invalided benches.\n\nAt breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to\nTom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of\ntalk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:\n\n\"Well, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody\nsuffering 'most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity\nyou could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come\nover on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give\nme a hint some way that you warn't dead, but only run off.\"\n\n\"Yes, you could have done that, Tom,\" said Mary; \"and I believe you\nwould if you had thought of it.\"\n\n\"Would you, Tom?\" said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. \"Say,\nnow, would you, if you'd thought of it?\"\n\n\"I--well, I don't know. 'Twould 'a' spoiled everything.\"\n\n\"Tom, I hoped you loved me that much,\" said Aunt Polly, with a grieved\ntone that discomforted the boy. \"It would have been something if you'd\ncared enough to THINK of it, even if you didn't DO it.\"\n\n\"Now, auntie, that ain't any harm,\" pleaded Mary; \"it's only Tom's\ngiddy way--he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of\nanything.\"\n\n\"More's the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and\nDONE it, too. Tom, you'll look back, some day, when it's too late, and\nwish you'd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so\nlittle.\"\n\n\"Now, auntie, you know I do care for you,\" said Tom.\n\n\"I'd know it better if you acted more like it.\"\n\n\"I wish now I'd thought,\" said Tom, with a repentant tone; \"but I\ndreamt about you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?\"\n\n\"It ain't much--a cat does that much--but it's better than nothing.\nWhat did you dream?\"\n\n\"Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the\nbed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.\"\n\n\"Well, so we did. So we always do. I'm glad your dreams could take\neven that much trouble about us.\"\n\n\"And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here.\"\n\n\"Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?\"\n\n\"Oh, lots. But it's so dim, now.\"\n\n\"Well, try to recollect--can't you?\"\n\n\"Somehow it seems to me that the wind--the wind blowed the--the--\"\n\n\"Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!\"\n\nTom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then\nsaid:\n\n\"I've got it now! I've got it now! It blowed the candle!\"\n\n\"Mercy on us! Go on, Tom--go on!\"\n\n\"And it seems to me that you said, 'Why, I believe that that door--'\"\n\n\"Go ON, Tom!\"\n\n\"Just let me study a moment--just a moment. Oh, yes--you said you\nbelieved the door was open.\"\n\n\"As I'm sitting here, I did! Didn't I, Mary! Go on!\"\n\n\"And then--and then--well I won't be certain, but it seems like as if\nyou made Sid go and--and--\"\n\n\"Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?\"\n\n\"You made him--you--Oh, you made him shut it.\"\n\n\"Well, for the land's sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my\ndays! Don't tell ME there ain't anything in dreams, any more. Sereny\nHarper shall know of this before I'm an hour older. I'd like to see her\nget around THIS with her rubbage 'bout superstition. Go on, Tom!\"\n\n\"Oh, it's all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I\nwarn't BAD, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more\nresponsible than--than--I think it was a colt, or something.\"\n\n\"And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!\"\n\n\"And then you began to cry.\"\n\n\"So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then--\"\n\n\"Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same,\nand she wished she hadn't whipped him for taking cream when she'd\nthrowed it out her own self--\"\n\n\"Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying--that's what you\nwas doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!\"\n\n\"Then Sid he said--he said--\"\n\n\"I don't think I said anything,\" said Sid.\n\n\"Yes you did, Sid,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?\"\n\n\"He said--I THINK he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone\nto, but if I'd been better sometimes--\"\n\n\"THERE, d'you hear that! It was his very words!\"\n\n\"And you shut him up sharp.\"\n\n\"I lay I did! There must 'a' been an angel there. There WAS an angel\nthere, somewheres!\"\n\n\"And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and\nyou told about Peter and the Painkiller--\"\n\n\"Just as true as I live!\"\n\n\"And then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river for\nus, and 'bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss\nHarper hugged and cried, and she went.\"\n\n\"It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I'm a-sitting in\nthese very tracks. Tom, you couldn't told it more like if you'd 'a'\nseen it! And then what? Go on, Tom!\"\n\n\"Then I thought you prayed for me--and I could see you and hear every\nword you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and\nwrote on a piece of sycamore bark, 'We ain't dead--we are only off\nbeing pirates,' and put it on the table by the candle; and then you\nlooked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned\nover and kissed you on the lips.\"\n\n\"Did you, Tom, DID you! I just forgive you everything for that!\" And\nshe seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the\nguiltiest of villains.\n\n\"It was very kind, even though it was only a--dream,\" Sid soliloquized\njust audibly.\n\n\"Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he'd do if he\nwas awake. Here's a big Milum apple I've been saving for you, Tom, if\nyou was ever found again--now go 'long to school. I'm thankful to the\ngood God and Father of us all I've got you back, that's long-suffering\nand merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though\ngoodness knows I'm unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His\nblessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places, there's\nfew enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long\nnight comes. Go 'long Sid, Mary, Tom--take yourselves off--you've\nhendered me long enough.\"\n\nThe children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper\nand vanquish her realism with Tom's marvellous dream. Sid had better\njudgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the\nhouse. It was this: \"Pretty thin--as long a dream as that, without any\nmistakes in it!\"\n\nWhat a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing,\nbut moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the\npublic eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see\nthe looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food\nand drink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as\nproud to be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the\ndrummer at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie\ninto town. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away\nat all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would\nhave given anything to have that swarthy suntanned skin of his, and his\nglittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a\ncircus.\n\nAt school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered\nsuch eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were not\nlong in becoming insufferably \"stuck-up.\" They began to tell their\nadventures to hungry listeners--but they only began; it was not a thing\nlikely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish\nmaterial. And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely\npuffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.\n\nTom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory\nwas sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished,\nmaybe she would be wanting to \"make up.\" Well, let her--she should see\nthat he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she\narrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group\nof boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was\ntripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,\npretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter\nwhen she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her\ncaptures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye\nin his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious\nvanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only \"set\nhim up\" the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that\nhe knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved\nirresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and\nwistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more\nparticularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp\npang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but\nher feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She\nsaid to a girl almost at Tom's elbow--with sham vivacity:\n\n\"Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn't you come to Sunday-school?\"\n\n\"I did come--didn't you see me?\"\n\n\"Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?\"\n\n\"I was in Miss Peters' class, where I always go. I saw YOU.\"\n\n\"Did you? Why, it's funny I didn't see you. I wanted to tell you about\nthe picnic.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's jolly. Who's going to give it?\"\n\n\"My ma's going to let me have one.\"\n\n\"Oh, goody; I hope she'll let ME come.\"\n\n\"Well, she will. The picnic's for me. She'll let anybody come that I\nwant, and I want you.\"\n\n\"That's ever so nice. When is it going to be?\"\n\n\"By and by. Maybe about vacation.\"\n\n\"Oh, won't it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?\"\n\n\"Yes, every one that's friends to me--or wants to be\"; and she glanced\never so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence\nabout the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the\ngreat sycamore tree \"all to flinders\" while he was \"standing within\nthree feet of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, may I come?\" said Grace Miller.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And me?\" said Sally Rogers.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And me, too?\" said Susy Harper. \"And Joe?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAnd so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged\nfor invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still\ntalking, and took Amy with him. Becky's lips trembled and the tears\ncame to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on\nchattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of\neverything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and\nhad what her sex call \"a good cry.\" Then she sat moody, with wounded\npride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast\nin her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what\nSHE'D do.\n\nAt recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant\nself-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate\nher with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden\nfalling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind\nthe schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple--and so\nabsorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,\nthat they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.\nJealousy ran red-hot through Tom's veins. He began to hate himself for\nthrowing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He\ncalled himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He\nwanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,\nfor her heart was singing, but Tom's tongue had lost its function. He\ndid not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he\ncould only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as\notherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and\nagain, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could\nnot help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that\nBecky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the\nliving. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her\nfight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.\n\nAmy's happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had to\nattend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in\nvain--the girl chirped on. Tom thought, \"Oh, hang her, ain't I ever\ngoing to get rid of her?\" At last he must be attending to those\nthings--and she said artlessly that she would be \"around\" when school\nlet out. And he hastened away, hating her for it.\n\n\"Any other boy!\" Tom thought, grating his teeth. \"Any boy in the whole\ntown but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is\naristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw\nthis town, mister, and I'll lick you again! You just wait till I catch\nyou out! I'll just take and--\"\n\nAnd he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy\n--pummelling the air, and kicking and gouging. \"Oh, you do, do you? You\nholler 'nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!\" And so the\nimaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction.\n\nTom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of\nAmy's grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the\nother distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but\nas the minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph\nbegan to cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absent-mindedness\nfollowed, and then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her\near at a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she\ngrew entirely miserable and wished she hadn't carried it so far. When\npoor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept\nexclaiming: \"Oh, here's a jolly one! look at this!\" she lost patience\nat last, and said, \"Oh, don't bother me! I don't care for them!\" and\nburst into tears, and got up and walked away.\n\nAlfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she\nsaid:\n\n\"Go away and leave me alone, can't you! I hate you!\"\n\nSo the boy halted, wondering what he could have done--for she had said\nshe would look at pictures all through the nooning--and she walked on,\ncrying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was\nhumiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth--the girl\nhad simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.\nHe was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.\nHe wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much\nrisk to himself. Tom's spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his\nopportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and\npoured ink upon the page.\n\nBecky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,\nand moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now,\nintending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their\ntroubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she\nhad changed her mind. The thought of Tom's treatment of her when she\nwas talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with\nshame. She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged\nspelling-book's account, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt\nsaid to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an\nunpromising market:\n\n\"Tom, I've a notion to skin you alive!\"\n\n\"Auntie, what have I done?\"\n\n\"Well, you've done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an\nold softy, expecting I'm going to make her believe all that rubbage\nabout that dream, when lo and behold you she'd found out from Joe that\nyou was over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I\ndon't know what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes\nme feel so bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make\nsuch a fool of myself and never say a word.\"\n\nThis was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had\nseemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked\nmean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything\nto say for a moment. Then he said:\n\n\"Auntie, I wish I hadn't done it--but I didn't think.\"\n\n\"Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your own\nselfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from\nJackson's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could\nthink to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn't ever think\nto pity us and save us from sorrow.\"\n\n\"Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean. I\ndidn't, honest. And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh at you\nthat night.\"\n\n\"What did you come for, then?\"\n\n\"It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn't got\ndrownded.\"\n\n\"Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could\nbelieve you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never\ndid--and I know it, Tom.\"\n\n\"Indeed and 'deed I did, auntie--I wish I may never stir if I didn't.\"\n\n\"Oh, Tom, don't lie--don't do it. It only makes things a hundred times\nworse.\"\n\n\"It ain't a lie, auntie; it's the truth. I wanted to keep you from\ngrieving--that was all that made me come.\"\n\n\"I'd give the whole world to believe that--it would cover up a power\nof sins, Tom. I'd 'most be glad you'd run off and acted so bad. But it\nain't reasonable; because, why didn't you tell me, child?\"\n\n\"Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got\nall full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I\ncouldn't somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my\npocket and kept mum.\"\n\n\"What bark?\"\n\n\"The bark I had wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirating. I wish, now,\nyou'd waked up when I kissed you--I do, honest.\"\n\nThe hard lines in his aunt's face relaxed and a sudden tenderness\ndawned in her eyes.\n\n\"DID you kiss me, Tom?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, I did.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you did, Tom?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, I did, auntie--certain sure.\"\n\n\"What did you kiss me for, Tom?\"\n\n\"Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.\"\n\nThe words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in\nher voice when she said:\n\n\"Kiss me again, Tom!--and be off with you to school, now, and don't\nbother me any more.\"\n\nThe moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a\njacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her\nhand, and said to herself:\n\n\"No, I don't dare. Poor boy, I reckon he's lied about it--but it's a\nblessed, blessed lie, there's such a comfort come from it. I hope the\nLord--I KNOW the Lord will forgive him, because it was such\ngoodheartedness in him to tell it. But I don't want to find out it's a\nlie. I won't look.\"\n\nShe put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put\nout her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once\nmore she ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the\nthought: \"It's a good lie--it's a good lie--I won't let it grieve me.\"\nSo she sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom's\npiece of bark through flowing tears and saying: \"I could forgive the\nboy, now, if he'd committed a million sins!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHERE was something about Aunt Polly's manner, when she kissed Tom,\nthat swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy\nagain. He started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky\nThatcher at the head of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his\nmanner. Without a moment's hesitation he ran to her and said:\n\n\"I acted mighty mean to-day, Becky, and I'm so sorry. I won't ever,\never do that way again, as long as ever I live--please make up, won't\nyou?\"\n\nThe girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:\n\n\"I'll thank you to keep yourself TO yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I'll\nnever speak to you again.\"\n\nShe tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not\neven presence of mind enough to say \"Who cares, Miss Smarty?\" until the\nright time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a\nfine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were\na boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently\nencountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She\nhurled one in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to\nBecky, in her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to\n\"take in,\" she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured\nspelling-book. If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred\nTemple, Tom's offensive fling had driven it entirely away.\n\nPoor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.\nThe master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied\nambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but poverty\nhad decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village\nschoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and\nabsorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept\nthat book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was\nperishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy\nand girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two\ntheories were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in\nthe case. Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the\ndoor, she noticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious\nmoment. She glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant\nshe had the book in her hands. The title-page--Professor Somebody's\nANATOMY--carried no information to her mind; so she began to turn the\nleaves. She came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored\nfrontispiece--a human figure, stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell\non the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse\nof the picture. Becky snatched at the book to close it, and had the\nhard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle. She thrust\nthe volume into the desk, turned the key, and burst out crying with\nshame and vexation.\n\n\"Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a\nperson and look at what they're looking at.\"\n\n\"How could I know you was looking at anything?\"\n\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you're\ngoing to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I'll be\nwhipped, and I never was whipped in school.\"\n\nThen she stamped her little foot and said:\n\n\"BE so mean if you want to! I know something that's going to happen.\nYou just wait and you'll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!\"--and she\nflung out of the house with a new explosion of crying.\n\nTom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said\nto himself:\n\n\"What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in school!\nShucks! What's a licking! That's just like a girl--they're so\nthin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain't going to tell\nold Dobbins on this little fool, because there's other ways of getting\neven on her, that ain't so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask\nwho it was tore his book. Nobody'll answer. Then he'll do just the way\nhe always does--ask first one and then t'other, and when he comes to the\nright girl he'll know it, without any telling. Girls' faces always tell\non them. They ain't got any backbone. She'll get licked. Well, it's a\nkind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain't any way\nout of it.\" Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: \"All\nright, though; she'd like to see me in just such a fix--let her sweat it\nout!\"\n\nTom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments\nthe master arrived and school \"took in.\" Tom did not feel a strong\ninterest in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls'\nside of the room Becky's face troubled him. Considering all things, he\ndid not want to pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He\ncould get up no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently\nthe spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom's mind was entirely full\nof his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her\nlethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She\ndid not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he\nspilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only\nseemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be\nglad of that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she\nfound she was not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an\nimpulse to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and\nforced herself to keep still--because, said she to herself, \"he'll tell\nabout me tearing the picture sure. I wouldn't say a word, not to save\nhis life!\"\n\nTom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all\nbroken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly\nupset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout--he\nhad denied it for form's sake and because it was custom, and had stuck\nto the denial from principle.\n\nA whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air\nwas drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened\nhimself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book,\nbut seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the\npupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched\nhis movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently\nfor a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!\nTom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit\nlook as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot\nhis quarrel with her. Quick--something must be done! done in a flash,\ntoo! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.\nGood!--he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring\nthrough the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little\ninstant, and the chance was lost--the master opened the volume. If Tom\nonly had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help\nfor Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.\nEvery eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even\nthe innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten\n--the master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: \"Who tore this book?\"\n\nThere was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness\ncontinued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.\n\n\"Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?\"\n\nA denial. Another pause.\n\n\"Joseph Harper, did you?\"\n\nAnother denial. Tom's uneasiness grew more and more intense under the\nslow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of\nboys--considered a while, then turned to the girls:\n\n\"Amy Lawrence?\"\n\nA shake of the head.\n\n\"Gracie Miller?\"\n\nThe same sign.\n\n\"Susan Harper, did you do this?\"\n\nAnother negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling\nfrom head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of\nthe situation.\n\n\"Rebecca Thatcher\" [Tom glanced at her face--it was white with terror]\n--\"did you tear--no, look me in the face\" [her hands rose in appeal]\n--\"did you tear this book?\"\n\nA thought shot like lightning through Tom's brain. He sprang to his\nfeet and shouted--\"I done it!\"\n\nThe school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a\nmoment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped\nforward to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the\nadoration that shone upon him out of poor Becky's eyes seemed pay\nenough for a hundred floggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own\nact, he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr.\nDobbins had ever administered; and also received with indifference the\nadded cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be\ndismissed--for he knew who would wait for him outside till his\ncaptivity was done, and not count the tedious time as loss, either.\n\nTom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple;\nfor with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting\nher own treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way,\nsoon, to pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky's\nlatest words lingering dreamily in his ear--\n\n\"Tom, how COULD you be so noble!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nVACATION was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew\nseverer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a\ngood showing on \"Examination\" day. His rod and his ferule were seldom\nidle now--at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and\nyoung ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins'\nlashings were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under\nhis wig, a perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle\nage, and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great\nday approached, all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he\nseemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least\nshortcomings. The consequence was, that the smaller boys spent their\ndays in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge. They\nthrew away no opportunity to do the master a mischief. But he kept\nahead all the time. The retribution that followed every vengeful\nsuccess was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from\nthe field badly worsted. At last they conspired together and hit upon a\nplan that promised a dazzling victory. They swore in the sign-painter's\nboy, told him the scheme, and asked his help. He had his own reasons\nfor being delighted, for the master boarded in his father's family and\nhad given the boy ample cause to hate him. The master's wife would go\non a visit to the country in a few days, and there would be nothing to\ninterfere with the plan; the master always prepared himself for great\noccasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and the sign-painter's boy\nsaid that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on\nExamination Evening he would \"manage the thing\" while he napped in his\nchair; then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried\naway to school.\n\nIn the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in\nthe evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with\nwreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in\nhis great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.\nHe was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and\nsix rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town\nand by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of\ncitizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the\nscholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of\nsmall boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;\nrows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in\nlawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their\ngrandmothers' ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and\nthe flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with\nnon-participating scholars.\n\nThe exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly\nrecited, \"You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the\nstage,\" etc.--accompanying himself with the painfully exact and\nspasmodic gestures which a machine might have used--supposing the\nmachine to be a trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though\ncruelly scared, and got a fine round of applause when he made his\nmanufactured bow and retired.\n\nA little shamefaced girl lisped, \"Mary had a little lamb,\" etc.,\nperformed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and\nsat down flushed and happy.\n\nTom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into\nthe unquenchable and indestructible \"Give me liberty or give me death\"\nspeech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the\nmiddle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under\nhim and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the\nhouse but he had the house's silence, too, which was even worse than\nits sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom\nstruggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak\nattempt at applause, but it died early.\n\n\"The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck\" followed; also \"The Assyrian Came\nDown,\" and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises,\nand a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The\nprime feature of the evening was in order, now--original \"compositions\"\nby the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of\nthe platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with\ndainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to\n\"expression\" and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been\nilluminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their\ngrandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line\nclear back to the Crusades. \"Friendship\" was one; \"Memories of Other\nDays\"; \"Religion in History\"; \"Dream Land\"; \"The Advantages of\nCulture\"; \"Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted\";\n\"Melancholy\"; \"Filial Love\"; \"Heart Longings,\" etc., etc.\n\nA prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted\nmelancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of \"fine language\";\nanother was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words\nand phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that\nconspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable\nsermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one\nof them. No matter what the subject might be, a brain-racking effort\nwas made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and\nreligious mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring\ninsincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the\nbanishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient\nto-day; it never will be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps.\nThere is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel\nobliged to close their compositions with a sermon; and you will find\nthat the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in\nthe school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious. But\nenough of this. Homely truth is unpalatable.\n\nLet us return to the \"Examination.\" The first composition that was\nread was one entitled \"Is this, then, Life?\" Perhaps the reader can\nendure an extract from it:\n\n  \"In the common walks of life, with what delightful\n   emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some\n   anticipated scene of festivity! Imagination is busy\n   sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the\n   voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the\n   festive throng, 'the observed of all observers.' Her\n   graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling\n   through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is\n   brightest, her step is lightest in the gay assembly.\n\n  \"In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by,\n   and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into\n   the Elysian world, of which she has had such bright\n   dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to\n   her enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming\n   than the last. But after a while she finds that\n   beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the\n   flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates\n   harshly upon her ear; the ball-room has lost its\n   charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart,\n   she turns away with the conviction that earthly\n   pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!\"\n\nAnd so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to\ntime during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of \"How\nsweet!\" \"How eloquent!\" \"So true!\" etc., and after the thing had closed\nwith a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.\n\nThen arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the \"interesting\"\npaleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a \"poem.\" Two\nstanzas of it will do:\n\n   \"A MISSOURI MAIDEN'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA\n\n   \"Alabama, good-bye! I love thee well!\n      But yet for a while do I leave thee now!\n    Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,\n      And burning recollections throng my brow!\n    For I have wandered through thy flowery woods;\n      Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa's stream;\n    Have listened to Tallassee's warring floods,\n      And wooed on Coosa's side Aurora's beam.\n\n   \"Yet shame I not to bear an o'er-full heart,\n      Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;\n    'Tis from no stranger land I now must part,\n      'Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.\n    Welcome and home were mine within this State,\n      Whose vales I leave--whose spires fade fast from me\n    And cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete,\n      When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!\"\n\nThere were very few there who knew what \"tete\" meant, but the poem was\nvery satisfactory, nevertheless.\n\nNext appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young\nlady, who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and\nbegan to read in a measured, solemn tone:\n\n  \"A VISION\n\n   \"Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the\n   throne on high not a single star quivered; but\n   the deep intonations of the heavy thunder\n   constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the\n   terrific lightning revelled in angry mood\n   through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming\n   to scorn the power exerted over its terror by\n   the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous\n   winds unanimously came forth from their mystic\n   homes, and blustered about as if to enhance by\n   their aid the wildness of the scene.\n\n   \"At such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human\n   sympathy my very spirit sighed; but instead thereof,\n\n   \"'My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter\n   and guide--My joy in grief, my second bliss\n   in joy,' came to my side. She moved like one of\n   those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks\n   of fancy's Eden by the romantic and young, a\n   queen of beauty unadorned save by her own\n   transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it\n   failed to make even a sound, and but for the\n   magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as\n   other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided\n   away un-perceived--unsought. A strange sadness\n   rested upon her features, like icy tears upon\n   the robe of December, as she pointed to the\n   contending elements without, and bade me contemplate\n   the two beings presented.\"\n\nThis nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with\na sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took\nthe first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest\neffort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the\nprize to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it\nwas by far the most \"eloquent\" thing he had ever listened to, and that\nDaniel Webster himself might well be proud of it.\n\nIt may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in\nwhich the word \"beauteous\" was over-fondled, and human experience\nreferred to as \"life's page,\" was up to the usual average.\n\nNow the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair\naside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of\nAmerica on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he\nmade a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered\ntitter rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set\nhimself to right it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only\ndistorted them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced.\nHe threw his entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not\nto be put down by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon\nhim; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it\neven manifestly increased. And well it might. There was a garret above,\npierced with a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle\ncame a cat, suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag\ntied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly\ndescended she curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung\ndownward and clawed at the intangible air. The tittering rose higher\nand higher--the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher's\nhead--down, down, a little lower, and she grabbed his wig with her\ndesperate claws, clung to it, and was snatched up into the garret in an\ninstant with her trophy still in her possession! And how the light did\nblaze abroad from the master's bald pate--for the sign-painter's boy\nhad GILDED it!\n\nThat broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.\n\n   NOTE:--The pretended \"compositions\" quoted in\n   this chapter are taken without alteration from a\n   volume entitled \"Prose and Poetry, by a Western\n   Lady\"--but they are exactly and precisely after\n   the schoolgirl pattern, and hence are much\n   happier than any mere imitations could be.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by\nthe showy character of their \"regalia.\" He promised to abstain from\nsmoking, chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he\nfound out a new thing--namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the\nsurest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very\nthing. Tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and\nswear; the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a\nchance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing\nfrom the order. Fourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that up\n--gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours--and\nfixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was\napparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral, since\nhe was so high an official. During three days Tom was deeply concerned\nabout the Judge's condition and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his\nhopes ran high--so high that he would venture to get out his regalia\nand practise before the looking-glass. But the Judge had a most\ndiscouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was pronounced upon the\nmend--and then convalescent. Tom was disgusted; and felt a sense of\ninjury, too. He handed in his resignation at once--and that night the\nJudge suffered a relapse and died. Tom resolved that he would never\ntrust a man like that again.\n\nThe funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated\nto kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again, however\n--there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now--but found\nto his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he could,\ntook the desire away, and the charm of it.\n\nTom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning\nto hang a little heavily on his hands.\n\nHe attempted a diary--but nothing happened during three days, and so\nhe abandoned it.\n\nThe first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a\nsensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were\nhappy for two days.\n\nEven the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained\nhard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man in\nthe world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States\nSenator, proved an overwhelming disappointment--for he was not\ntwenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.\n\nA circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in\ntents made of rag carpeting--admission, three pins for boys, two for\ngirls--and then circusing was abandoned.\n\nA phrenologist and a mesmerizer came--and went again and left the\nvillage duller and drearier than ever.\n\nThere were some boys-and-girls' parties, but they were so few and so\ndelightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.\n\nBecky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her\nparents during vacation--so there was no bright side to life anywhere.\n\nThe dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very\ncancer for permanency and pain.\n\nThen came the measles.\n\nDuring two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its\nhappenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got\nupon his feet at last and moved feebly down-town, a melancholy change\nhad come over everything and every creature. There had been a\n\"revival,\" and everybody had \"got religion,\" not only the adults, but\neven the boys and girls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the\nsight of one blessed sinful face, but disappointment crossed him\neverywhere. He found Joe Harper studying a Testament, and turned sadly\naway from the depressing spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him\nvisiting the poor with a basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who\ncalled his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a\nwarning. Every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression;\nand when, in desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of\nHuckleberry Finn and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his\nheart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all\nthe town was lost, forever and forever.\n\nAnd that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain,\nawful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his\nhead with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his\ndoom; for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was\nabout him. He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above\nto the extremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might\nhave seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a\nbattery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the\ngetting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf\nfrom under an insect like himself.\n\nBy and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its\nobject. The boy's first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His\nsecond was to wait--for there might not be any more storms.\n\nThe next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks\nhe spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad\nat last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how\nlonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted\nlistlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a\njuvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her\nvictim, a bird. He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a\nstolen melon. Poor lads! they--like Tom--had suffered a relapse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

There is not one public; there are many\npublics--as many, in fact, as there are different kinds of taste; and\nthe extent of an author\u2019s popularity is in proportion to the number of\nthese separate publics he may chance to please. Scott, for example,\nappealed not only to those who relished romance and enjoyed excitement,\nbut also to those who appreciated his honest portrayal of sturdy\ncharacters. Thackeray is preferred by ambitious youth who are\ninsidiously flattered by his tacit compliments to their knowledge of the\nworld, by the disenchanted who cannot help seeing the petty meannesses\nof society, and by the less sophisticated in whom sentiment has not gone\nto seed in sentimentality. Dickens in his own day bid for the approval\nof those who liked broad caricature (and were therefore pleased with\nStiggins and Chadband), of those who fed greedily on plentiful pathos\n(and were therefore delighted with the deathbeds of Smike and Paul\nDombey and Little Nell) and also of those who asked for unexpected\nadventure (and were therefore glad to disentangle the melodramatic\nintrigues of Ralph Nickleby).\n\nIn like manner the American author who has chosen to call himself Mark\nTwain has attained to an immense popularity because the qualities he\npossesses in a high degree appeal to so many and so widely varied\npublics--first of all, no doubt, to the public that revels in hearty and\nrobust fun, but also to the public which is glad to be swept along by\nthe full current of adventure, which is sincerely touched by manly\npathos, which is satisfied by vigorous and exact portrayal of character,\nand which respects shrewdness and wisdom and sanity and a healthy hatred\nof pretense and affectation and sham. Perhaps no one book of Mark\nTwain\u2019s--with the possible exception of _Huckleberry Finn_--is equally a\nfavorite with all his readers; and perhaps some of his best\ncharacteristics are absent from his earlier books or but doubtfully\nlatent in them. Mark Twain is many sided; and he has ripened in\nknowledge and in power since he first attracted attention as a wild\nWestern funny man. As he has grown older he has reflected more; he has\nboth broadened and deepened. The writer of \u201ccomic copy\u201d for a\nmining-camp newspaper has developed into a liberal humorist, handling\nlife seriously and making his readers think as he makes them laugh,\nuntil to-day Mark Twain has perhaps the largest audience of any author\nnow using the English language. To trace the stages of this evolution\nand to count the steps whereby the sagebrush reporter has risen to the\nrank of a writer of world-wide celebrity, is as interesting as it is\ninstructive.\n\n                                   I\n\nSamuel Langhorne Clemens was born November 30, 1835, at Florida,\nMissouri. His father was a merchant who had come from Tennessee and who\nremoved soon after his son\u2019s birth to Hannibal, a little town on the\nMississippi. What Hannibal was like and what were the circumstances of\nMr. Clemen\u2019s boyhood we can see for ourselves in the convincing pages of\n_Tom Sawyer_. Mr. Howells has called Hannibal \u201ca loafing, out-at-elbows,\ndown-at-the-heels, slave-holding Mississippi town\u201d; and Mr. Clemens, who\nsilently abhorred slavery, was of a slave-owning family.\n\nWhen the future author was but twelve his father died, and the son had\nto get his education as best he could. Of actual schooling he got little\nand of book learning still less, but life itself is not a bad teacher\nfor a boy who wants to study, and young Clemens did not waste his\nchances. He spent six years in the printing office of the little local\npaper,--for, like not a few others on the list of American authors that\nstretches from Benjamin Franklin to William Dean Howells, he began his\nconnection with literature by setting type. As a journeyman printer the\nlad wandered from town to town and rambled even as far east as New York.\n\nWhen he was nineteen he went back to the home of his boyhood and\npresently resolved to become a pilot on the Mississippi. How he learned\nthe river he has told us in _Life on the Mississippi_, wherein his\nadventures, his experiences, and his impressions while he was a cub\npilot are recorded with a combination of precise veracity and abundant\nhumor which makes the earlier chapters of that marvelous book a most\nmasterly fragment of autobiography. The life of a pilot was full of\ninterest and excitement and opportunity, and what young Clemens saw and\nheard and divined during the years when he was going up and down the\nmighty river we may read in the pages of _Huckleberry Finn_ and\n_Pudd\u2019nhead Wilson_. But toward the end of the \u2019fifties the railroads\nbegan to rob the river of its supremacy as a carrier; and in the\nbeginning of the \u2019sixties the Civil War broke out and the Mississippi no\nlonger went unvexed to the sea. The skill, slowly and laboriously\nacquired, was suddenly rendered useless, and at twenty-five the young\nman found himself bereft of his calling. As a border state, Missouri was\nsending her sons into the armies of the Union and into the armies of the\nConfederacy, while many a man stood doubting, not knowing which way to\nturn. The ex-pilot has given us the record of his very brief and\ninglorious service as a soldier of the South. When this escapade was\nswiftly ended, he went to the Northwest with his brother, who had been\nappointed Territorial Secretary of Nevada. Thus the man who had been\nborn on the borderland of North and South, who had gone East as a\njour-printer, who had been again and again up and down the Mississippi,\nnow went West while he was still plastic and impressionable; and he had\nthus another chance to increase that intimate knowledge of American life\nand American character which is one of the most precious of his\npossessions.\n\nWhile still on the river he had written a satiric letter or two which\nfound their way into print. In Nevada he went to the mines and lived the\nlife he has described in _Roughing It_, but when he failed to \u201cstrike it\nrich,\u201d he naturally drifted into journalism and back into a newspaper\noffice again. The _Virginia City Enterprise_ was not overmanned, and the\nnewcomer did all sorts of odd jobs, finding time now and then to write a\nsketch which seemed important enough to permit of his signature. He now\nbegan to sign himself Mark Twain, taking the name from a call of the man\nwho heaves the lead on a Mississippi River steamboat, and who cries, \u201cBy\nthe mark, three,\u201d \u201cMark Twain,\u201d and so on. The name of Mark Twain soon\nbegan to be known to those who were curious in newspaper humor. After a\nwhile he was drawn across the mountains to San Francisco, where he found\ncasual employment on the _Morning Call_, and where he joined himself to\na little group of aspiring _literators_ which included Mr. Bret Harte,\nMr. Noah Brooks, Mr. Charles Henry Webb, and Mr. Charles Warren\nStoddard.\n\nIt was in 1867 that Mr. Webb published Mark Twain\u2019s first book, _The\nCelebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras_; and it was in 1867 that the\nproprietors of the _Alta California_ supplied him with the funds\nnecessary to enable him to become one of the passengers on the steamer\n_Quaker City_, which had been chartered to take a select party on what\nis now known as the Mediterranean trip. The weekly letters, in which he\nset forth what befell him on this journey, were printed in the _Alta_\nSunday after Sunday, and were copied freely by the other Californian\npapers. These letters served as the foundation of a book published in\n1869 and called _The Innocents Abroad_, a book which instantly brought\nto the author celebrity and cash.\n\nBoth of these valuable aids to ambition were increased by his next step,\nhis appearance on the lecture platform. Mr. Noah Brooks, who was present\nat his first attempt, has recorded that Mark Twain\u2019s \u201cmethod as a\nlecturer was distinctly unique and novel. His slow, deliberate drawl,\nthe anxious and perturbed expression of his visage, the apparently\npainful effort with which he framed his sentences, the surprise that\nspread over his face when the audience roared with delight or\nrapturously applauded the finer passages of his word painting, were\nunlike anything of the kind they had ever known.\u201d In the thirty years\nsince that first appearance the method has not changed, although it has\nprobably matured. Mark Twain is one of the most effective of platform\nspeakers and one of the most artistic, with an art of his own which is\nvery individual and very elaborate in spite of its seeming simplicity.\n\nAlthough he succeeded abundantly as a lecturer, and although he was the\nauthor of the most widely circulated book of the decade, Mark Twain\nstill thought of himself only as a journalist; and when he gave up the\nWest for the East he became an editor of the Buffalo _Express_, in which\nhe had bought an interest. In 1870 he married; and it is perhaps not\nindiscreet to remark that his was another of those happy unions of which\nthere have been so many in the annals of American authorship. In 1871 he\nremoved to Hartford, where his home has been ever since; and at the same\ntime he gave up newspaper work.\n\nIn 1872 he wrote _Roughing It_, and in the following year came his first\nsustained attempt at fiction, _The Gilded Age_, written in collaboration\nwith Mr. Charles Dudley Warner. The character of \u201cColonel Mulberry\nSellers\u201d Mark Twain soon took out of this book to make it the central\nfigure of a play which the late John T. Raymond acted hundreds of times\nthroughout the United States, the playgoing public pardoning the\ninexpertness of the dramatist in favor of the delicious humor and the\ncompelling veracity with which the chief character was presented. So\nuniversal was this type and so broadly recognizable its traits that\nthere were few towns wherein the play was presented in which some one\ndid not accost the actor who impersonated the ever-hopeful schemer to\ndeclare: \u201cI\u2019m the original of Sellers! Didn\u2019t Mark ever tell you? Well,\nhe took the Colonel from me!\u201d\n\nEncouraged by the welcome accorded to this first attempt at fiction,\nMark Twain turned to the days of his boyhood and wrote _Tom Sawyer_,\npublished in 1875. He also collected his sketches, scattered here and\nthere in newspapers and magazines. Toward the end of the \u2019seventies he\nwent to Europe again with his family; and the result of this journey is\nrecorded in _A Tramp Abroad_, published in 1880. Another volume of\nsketches, _The Stolen White Elephant_, was put forth in 1882; and in the\nsame year Mark Twain first came forward as a historical novelist--if\n_The Prince and the Pauper_ can fairly be called a historical novel. The\nyear after, he sent forth the volume describing his _Life on the\nMississippi_; and in 1884 he followed this with the story in which that\nlife has been crystallized forever, _Huckleberry Finn_, the finest of\nhis books, the deepest in its insight, and the widest in its appeal.\n\nThis Odyssey of the Mississippi was published by a new firm, in which\nthe author was a chief partner, just as Sir Walter Scott had been an\nassociate of Ballantyne and Constable. There was at first a period of\nprosperity in which the house issued the _Personal Memoirs_ of Grant,\ngiving his widow checks for $350,000 in 1886, and in which Mark Twain\nhimself published _A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur\u2019s Court_, a\nvolume of _Merry Tales_, and a story called _The American Claimant_,\nwherein \u201cColonel Sellers\u201d reappears. Then there came a succession of\nhard years; and at last the publishing house in which Mark Twain was a\npartner failed, as the publishing house in which Walter Scott was a\npartner had formerly failed. The author of _Huckleberry Finn_ at sixty\nfound himself suddenly saddled with a load of debt, just as the author\nof _Waverley_ had been burdened full threescore years earlier; and Mark\nTwain stood up stoutly under it, as Scott had done before him. More\nfortunate than the Scotchman, the American has lived to pay the debt in\nfull.\n\nSince the disheartening crash came, he has given to the public a third\nMississippi River tale, _Pudd\u2019nhead Wilson_, issued in 1894; and a third\nhistorical novel _Joan of Arc_, a reverent and sympathetic study of the\nbravest figure in all French history, printed anonymously in _Harper\u2019s\nMagazine_ and then in a volume acknowledged by the author in 1896. As\none of the results of a lecturing tour around the world he prepared\nanother volume of travels, _Following the Equator_, published toward the\nend of 1897. Mention must also be made of a fantastic tale called _Tom\nSawyer Abroad_, sent forth in 1894, of a volume of sketches, _The\nMillion Pound Bank-Note_, assembled in 1893, and also of a collection of\nliterary essays, _How to Tell a Story_, published in 1897.\n\nThis is but the barest outline of Mark Twain\u2019s life--such a brief\nsummary as we must have before us if we wish to consider the conditions\nunder which the author has developed and the stages of his growth. It\nwill serve, however, to show how various have been his forms of\nactivity--printer, pilot, miner, journalist, traveler, lecturer,\nnovelist, publisher--and to suggest the width of his experience of life.\n\n                                   II\n\nA humorist is often without honor in his own country. Perhaps this is\npartly because humor is likely to be familiar, and familiarity breeds\ncontempt. Perhaps it is partly because (for some strange reason) we tend\nto despise those who make us laugh, while we respect those who make us\nweep--forgetting that there are formulas for forcing tears quite as\nfacile as the formulas for forcing smiles. Whatever the reason, the fact\nis indisputable that the humorist must pay the penalty of his humor; he\nmust run the risk of being tolerated as a mere fun maker, not to be\ntaken seriously, and unworthy of critical consideration. This penalty\nhas been paid by Mark Twain. In many of the discussions of American\nliterature he is dismissed as though he were only a competitor of his\npredecessors, Artemus Ward and John Ph\u0153nix, instead of being, what he is\nreally, a writer who is to be classed--at whatever interval only time\nmay decide--rather with Cervantes and Moli\u00e8re.\n\nLike the heroines of the problem plays of the modern theater, Mark Twain\nhas had to live down his past. His earlier writing gave but little\npromise of the enduring qualities obvious enough in his later works. Mr.\nNoah Brooks has told us how he was advised, if he wished to \u201csee genuine\nspecimens of American humor, frolicsome, extravagant, and audacious,\u201d to\nlook up the sketches which the then almost unknown Mark Twain was\nprinting in a Nevada newspaper. The humor of Mark Twain is still\nAmerican, still frolicsome, extravagant, and audacious; but it is riper\nnow and richer, and it has taken unto itself other qualities existing\nonly in germ in these firstlings of his muse. The sketches in _The\nJumping Frog_ and the letters which made up _The Innocents Abroad_ are\n\u201ccomic copy,\u201d as the phrase is in newspaper offices--comic copy not\naltogether unlike what John Ph\u0153nix had written and Artemus Ward, better\nindeed than the work of these newspaper humorists (for Mark Twain had it\nin him to develop as they did not), but not essentially dissimilar.\n\nAnd in the eyes of many who do not think for themselves, Mark Twain is\nonly the author of these genuine specimens of American humor. For when\nthe public has once made up its mind about any man\u2019s work, it does not\nrelish any attempt to force it to unmake this opinion and to remake it.\nLike other juries, it does not like to be ordered to reconsider its\nverdict as contrary to the facts of the case. It is always sluggish in\nbeginning the necessary readjustment, and not only sluggish, but\nsomewhat grudging. Naturally it cannot help seeing the later works of a\npopular writer from the point of view it had to take to enjoy his\nearlier writings. And thus the author of _Huckleberry Finn_ and _Joan of\nArc_ is forced to pay a high price for the early and abundant popularity\nof _The Innocents Abroad_.\n\nNo doubt, a few of his earlier sketches were inexpensive in their\nelements; made of materials worn threadbare by generations of earlier\nfunny men, they were sometimes cut in the pattern of his predecessors.\nNo doubt, some of the earliest of all were crude and highly colored, and\nmay even be called forced, not to say violent. No doubt, also, they did\nnot suggest the seriousness and the melancholy which always must\nunderlie the deepest humor, as we find it in Cervantes and Moli\u00e8re, in\nSwift and in Lowell. But even a careless reader, skipping through the\nbook in idle amusement, ought to have been able to see in _The Innocents\nAbroad_ that the writer of that liveliest of books of travel was no mere\nmerry-andrew, grinning through a horse collar to make sport for the\ngroundlings; but a sincere observer of life, seeing through his own eyes\nand setting down what he saw with abundant humor, of course, but also\nwith profound respect for the eternal verities.\n\nGeorge Eliot in one of her essays calls those who parody lofty themes\n\u201cdebasers of the moral currency.\u201d Mark Twain is always an advocate of\nthe sterling ethical standard. He is ready to overwhelm an affectation\nwith irresistible laughter, but he never lacks reverence for the things\nthat really deserve reverence. It is not at the Old Masters that he\nscoffs in Italy, but rather at those who pay lip service to things which\nthey neither enjoy nor understand. For a ruin or a painting or a legend\nthat does not seem to him to deserve the appreciation in which it is\nheld he refuses to affect an admiration he does not feel; he cannot help\nbeing honest--he was born so. For meanness of all kinds he has a burning\ncontempt; and on Abelard he pours out the vials of his wrath. He has a\nquick eye for all humbugs and a scorching scorn for them; but there is\nno attempt at being funny in the manner of the cockney comedians when he\nstands in the awful presence of the Sphinx. He is not taken in by the\nglamour of Palestine; he does not lose his head there; he keeps his\nfeet: but he knows that he is standing on holy ground; and there is\nnever a hint of irreverence in his attitude.\n\n_A Tramp Abroad_ is a better book than _The Innocents Abroad_; it is\nquite as laughter-provoking, and its manner is far more restrained. Mark\nTwain was then master of his method, sure of himself, secure of his\npopularity; and he could do his best and spare no pains to be certain\nthat it was his best. Perhaps there is a slight falling off in\n_Following the Equator_; a trace of fatigue, of weariness, of\ndisenchantment. But the last book of travels has passages as broadly\nhumorous as any of the first; and it proves the author\u2019s possession of a\npithy shrewdness not to be suspected from a perusal of its earliest\npredecessor. The first book was the work of a young fellow rejoicing in\nhis own fun and resolved to make his readers laugh with him or at him;\nthe latest book is the work of an older man, who has found that life is\nnot all laughter, but whose eye is as clear as ever and whose tongue is\nas plain-spoken.\n\nThese three books of travel are like all other books of travel in that\nthey relate in the first person what the author went forth to see.\nAutobiographic also are _Roughing It_ and _Life on the Mississippi_, and\nthey have always seemed to me better books than the more widely\ncirculated travels. They are better because they are the result of a\nmore intimate knowledge of the material dealt with. Every traveler is of\nnecessity but a bird of passage; he is a mere carpetbagger; his\nacquaintance with the countries he visits is external only; and this\nacquaintanceship is made only when he is a full-grown man. But Mark\nTwain\u2019s knowledge of the Mississippi was acquired in his youth; it was\nnot purchased with a price; it was his birthright; and it was internal\nand complete. And his knowledge of the mining camp was achieved in early\nmanhood when the mind is open and sensitive to every new impression.\nThere is in both these books a fidelity to the inner truth, a certainty\nof touch, a sweep of vision, not to be found in the three books of\ntravels. For my own part I have long thought that Mark Twain could\nsecurely rest his right to survive as an author on those opening\nchapters in _Life on the Mississippi_ in which he makes clear the\ndifficulties, the seeming impossibilities, that fronted those who wished\nto learn the river. These chapters are bold and brilliant, and they\npicture for us forever a period and a set of conditions, singularly\ninteresting and splendidly varied, that otherwise would have had to\nforego all adequate record.\n\n                                  III\n\nIt is highly probable that when an author reveals the power of evoking\nviews of places and of calling up portraits of people such as Mark Twain\nshowed in _Life on the Mississippi_, and when he has the masculine grasp\nof reality Mark Twain made evident in _Roughing It_, he must needs\nsooner or later turn from mere fact to avowed fiction and become a\nstory-teller. The long stories which Mark Twain has written fall into\ntwo divisions--first, those of which the scene is laid in the present,\nin reality, and mostly in the Mississippi Valley, and second, those of\nwhich the scene is laid in the past, in fantasy mostly, and in Europe.\n\nAs my own liking is a little less for the latter group, there is no need\nfor me now to linger over them. In writing these tales of the past Mark\nTwain was making up stories in his head; personally I prefer the tales\nof his in which he has his foot firm on reality. _The Prince and the\nPauper_ has the essence of boyhood in it; it has variety and vigor; it\nhas abundant humor and plentiful pathos; and yet I for one would give\nthe whole of it for the single chapter in which Tom Sawyer lets the\ncontract for whitewashing his aunt\u2019s fence.\n\nMr. Howells has declared that there are two kinds of fiction he likes\nalmost equally well--\u201ca real novel and a pure romance\u201d; and he joyfully\naccepts _A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur\u2019s Court_ as \u201cone of the\ngreatest romances ever imagined.\u201d It is a humorous romance overflowing\nwith stalwart fun; and it is not irreverent, but iconoclastic, in that\nit breaks not a few disestablished idols. It is intensely American and\nintensely nineteenth century and intensely democratic--in the best sense\nof that abused adjective. The British critics were greatly displeased\nwith the book;--and we are reminded of the fact that the Spanish still\nsomewhat resent _Don Quixote_ because it brings out too truthfully the\nfatal gap in the Spanish character between the ideal and the real. So\nmuch of the feudal still survives in British society that Mark Twain\u2019s\nmerry and elucidating assault on the past seemed to some almost an\ninsult to the present.\n\nBut no critic, British or American, has ventured to discover any\nirreverence in _Joan of Arc_, wherein, indeed, the tone is almost devout\nand the humor almost too much subdued. Perhaps it is my own distrust of\nthe so-called historical novel, my own disbelief that it can ever be\nanything but an inferior form of art, which makes me care less for this\nworthy effort to honor a noble figure. And elevated and dignified as is\nthe _Joan of Arc_, I do not think that it shows us Mark Twain at his\nbest; although it has many a passage that only he could have written, it\nis perhaps the least characteristic of his works. Yet it may well be\nthat the certain measure of success he has achieved in handling a\nsubject so lofty and so serious, will help to open the eyes of the\npublic to see the solid merits of his other stories, in which his humor\nhas fuller play and in which his natural gifts are more abundantly\ndisplayed.\n\nOf these other stories three are \u201creal novels,\u201d to use Mr. Howells\u2019s\nphrase; they are novels as real as any in any literature. _Tom Sawyer_\nand _Huckleberry Finn_ and _Pudd\u2019nhead Wilson_ are invaluable\ncontributions to American literature--for American literature is nothing\nif it is not a true picture of American life and if it does not help us\nto understand ourselves. _Huckleberry Finn_ is a very amusing volume,\nand a generation has read its pages and laughed over it immoderately;\nbut it is very much more than a funny book; it is a marvelously accurate\nportrayal of a whole civilization. Mr. Ormsby, in an essay which\naccompanies his translation of _Don Quixote_, has pointed out that for a\nfull century after its publication that greatest of novels was enjoyed\nchiefly as a tale of humorous misadventure, and that three generations\nhad laughed over it before anybody suspected that it was more than a\nmere funny book. It is perhaps rather with the picaresque romances of\nSpain that _Huckleberry Finn_ is to be compared than with the\nmasterpiece of Cervantes; but I do not think it will be a century or\ntake three generations before we Americans generally discover how great\na book _Huckleberry Finn_ really is, how keen its vision of character,\nhow close its observation of life, how sound its philosophy, and how it\nrecords for us once and for all certain phases of Southwestern society\nwhich it is most important for us to perceive and to understand. The\ninfluence of slavery, the prevalence of feuds, the conditions and the\ncircumstances that make lynching possible--all these things are set\nbefore us clearly and without comment. It is for us to draw our own\nmoral, each for himself, as we do when we see Shakespeare acted.\n\n_Huckleberry Finn_, in its art, for one thing, and also in its broader\nrange, is superior to _Tom Sawyer_ and to _Pudd\u2019nhead Wilson_, fine as\nboth these are in their several ways. In no book in our language, to my\nmind, has the boy, simply as a boy, been better realized than in _Tom\nSawyer_. In some respects _Pudd\u2019nhead Wilson_ is the most dramatic of\nMark Twain\u2019s longer stories, and also the most ingenious; like _Tom\nSawyer_ and _Huckleberry Finn_, it has the full flavor of the\nMississippi River, on which its author spent his own boyhood, and from\ncontact with the soil of which he always rises reinvigorated.\n\nIt is by these three stories, and especially by _Huckleberry Finn_, that\nMark Twain is likely to live longest. Nowhere else is the life of the\nMississippi Valley so truthfully recorded. Nowhere else can we find a\ngallery of Southwestern characters as varied and as veracious as those\nHuck Finn met in his wanderings. The histories of literature all praise\nthe _Gil Blas_ of Le Sage for its amusing adventures, its natural\ncharacters, its pleasant humor, and its insight into human frailty; and\nthe praise is deserved. But in everyone of these qualities _Huckleberry\nFinn_ is superior to _Gil Blas_. Le Sage set the model of the picaresque\nnovel, and Mark Twain followed his example; but the American book is\nricher than the French--deeper, finer, stronger. It would be hard to\nfind in any language better specimens of pure narrative, better examples\nof the power of telling a story and of calling up action so that the\nreader cannot help but see it, than Mark Twain\u2019s account of the\nShepherdson-Grangerford feud, and his description of the shooting of\nBoggs by Sherburn and of the foiled attempt to lynch Sherburn afterward.\n\nThese scenes, fine as they are, vivid, powerful, and most artistic in\ntheir restraint, can be matched in the two other books. In _Tom Sawyer_\nthey can be paralleled by the chapter in which the boy and the girl are\nlost in the cave, and Tom, seeing a gleam of light in the distance,\ndiscovers that it is a candle carried by Indian Joe, the one enemy he\nhas in the world. In _Pudd\u2019nhead Wilson_ the great passages of\n_Huckleberry Finn_ are rivaled by that most pathetic account of the weak\nson willing to sell his own mother as a slave \u201cdown the river.\u201d Although\nno one of the books is sustained throughout on this high level, and\nalthough, in truth, there are in each of them passages here and there\nthat we could wish away (because they are not worthy of the association\nin which we find them), I have no hesitation in expressing here my own\nconviction that the man who has given us four scenes like these is to be\ncompared with the masters of literature; and that he can abide the\ncomparison with equanimity.\n\n                                   IV\n\nPerhaps I myself prefer these three Mississippi Valley books above all\nMark Twain\u2019s other writings (although with no lack of affection for\nthose also) partly because these have the most of the flavor of the soil\nabout them. After veracity and the sense of the universal, what I best\nrelish in literature is this native aroma, pungent, homely, and abiding.\nYet I feel sure that I should not rate him so high if he were the author\nof these three books only. They are the best of him, but the others are\ngood also, and good in a different way. Other writers have given us this\nlocal color more or less artistically, more or less convincingly: one\nNew England and another New York, a third Virginia, and a fourth\nGeorgia, and a fifth Wisconsin; but who so well as Mark Twain has given\nus the full spectrum of the Union? With all his exactness in reproducing\nthe Mississippi Valley, Mark Twain is not sectional in his outlook; he\nis national always. He is not narrow; he is not Western or Eastern; he\nis American with a certain largeness and boldness and freedom and\ncertainty that we like to think of as befitting a country so vast as\nours and a people so independent.\n\nIn Mark Twain we have \u201cthe national spirit as seen with our own eyes,\u201d\ndeclared Mr. Howells; and, from more points of view than one, Mark Twain\nseems to me to be the very embodiment of Americanism. Self-educated in\nthe hard school of life, he has gone on broadening his outlook as he has\ngrown older. Spending many years abroad, he has come to understand other\nnationalities, without enfeebling his own native faith. Combining a\nmastery of the commonplace with an imaginative faculty, he is a\npractical idealist. No respecter of persons, he has a tender regard for\nhis fellow man. Irreverent toward all outworn superstitions, he has ever\nrevealed the deepest respect for all things truly worthy of reverence.\nUnwilling to take pay in words, he is impatient always to get at the\nroot of the matter, to pierce to the center, to see the thing as it is.\nHe has a habit of standing upright, of thinking for himself, and of\nhitting hard at whatsoever seems to him hateful and mean; but at the\ncore of him there is genuine gentleness and honest sympathy, brave\nhumanity and sweet kindliness. Perhaps it is boastful for us to think\nthat these characteristics which we see in Mark Twain are\ncharacteristics also of the American people as a whole; but it is\npleasant to think so.\n\nMark Twain has the very marrow of Americanism. He is as intensely and as\ntypically American as Franklin or Emerson or Hawthorne. He has not a\nlittle of the shrewd common sense and the homely and unliterary\ndirectness of Franklin. He is not without a share of the aspiration and\nthe elevation of Emerson; and he has a philosophy of his own as\noptimistic as Emerson\u2019s. He possesses also somewhat of Hawthorne\u2019s\ninterest in ethical problems, with something of the same power of\ngetting at the heart of them; he, too, has written his parables and\napologues wherein the moral is obvious and unobtruded. He is\nuncompromisingly honest; and his conscience is as rugged as his style\nsometimes is.\n\nNo American author has to-day at his command a style more nervous, more\nvaried, more flexible, or more various than Mark Twain\u2019s. His colloquial\nease should not hide from us his mastery of all the devices of rhetoric.\nHe may seem to disobey the letter of the law sometimes, but he is always\nobedient to the spirit. He never speaks unless he has something to say;\nand then he says it tersely, sharply, with a freshness of epithet and an\nindividuality of phrase, always accurate, however unacademic. His\nvocabulary is enormous, and it is deficient only in the dead words; his\nlanguage is alive always, and actually tingling with vitality. He\nrejoices in the daring noun and in the audacious adjective. His instinct\nfor the exact word is not always unerring, and now and again he has\nfailed to exercise it; but there is in his prose none of the flatting\nand sharping he censured in Fenimore Cooper\u2019s. His style has none of the\ncold perfection of an antique statue; it is too modern and too American\nfor that, and too completely the expression of the man himself, sincere\nand straightforward. It is not free from slang, although this is far\nless frequent than one might expect; but it does its work swiftly and\ncleanly. And it is capable of immense variety. Consider the tale of the\nBlue Jay in _A Tramp Abroad_, wherein the humor is sustained by unstated\npathos; what could be better told than this, with every word the right\nword and in the right place? And take Huck Finn\u2019s description of the\nstorm when he was alone on the island, which is in dialect, which will\nnot parse, which bristles with double negatives, but which none the less\nis one of the finest passages of descriptive prose in all American\nliterature.\n\n                                   V\n\nAfter all, it is as a humorist pure and simple that Mark Twain is best\nknown and best beloved. In the preceding pages I have tried to point out\nthe several ways in which he transcends humor, as the word is commonly\nrestricted, and to show that he is no mere fun maker. But he is a fun\nmaker beyond all question, and he has made millions laugh as no other\nman of our century has done. The laughter he has aroused is wholesome\nand self-respecting; it clears the atmosphere. For this we cannot but be\ngrateful. As Lowell said, \u201clet us not be ashamed to confess that, if we\nfind the tragedy a bore, we take the profoundest satisfaction in the\nfarce. It is a mark of sanity.\u201d There is no laughter in Don Quixote, the\nnoble enthusiast whose wits are unsettled; and there is little on the\nlips of Alceste the misanthrope of Moli\u00e8re; but for both of them life\nwould have been easier had they known how to laugh. Cervantes himself,\nand Moli\u00e8re also, found relief in laughter for their melancholy; and it\nwas the sense of humor which kept them tolerantly interested in the\nspectacle of humanity, although life had pressed hardly on them both. On\nMark Twain also life has left its scars; but he has bound up his wounds\nand battled forward with a stout heart, as Cervantes did, and Moli\u00e8re.\nIt was Moli\u00e8re who declared that it was a strange business to undertake\nto make people laugh; but even now, after two centuries, when the best\nof Moli\u00e8re\u2019s plays are acted, mirth breaks out again and laughter\noverflows.\n\nIt would be doing Mark Twain a disservice to liken him to Moli\u00e8re, the\ngreatest comic dramatist of all time; and yet there is more than one\npoint of similarity. Just as Mark Twain began by writing comic copy\nwhich contained no prophecy of a masterpiece like _Huckleberry Finn_, so\nMoli\u00e8re was at first the author only of semiacrobatic farces on the\nItalian model in no wise presaging _Tartuffe_ and _The Misanthrope_.\nJust as Moli\u00e8re succeeded first of all in pleasing the broad public that\nlikes robust fun, and then slowly and step by step developed into a\ndramatist who set on the stage enduring figures plucked out of the\nabounding life about him, so also has Mark Twain grown, ascending from\n_The Jumping Frog_ to _Huckleberry Finn_, as comic as its elder brother\nand as laughter-provoking, but charged also with meaning and with\nphilosophy. And like Moli\u00e8re again, Mark Twain has kept solid hold of\nthe material world; his doctrine is not of the earth earthy, but it is\nnever sublimated into sentimentality. He sympathizes with the spiritual\nside of humanity, while never ignoring the sensual. Like Moli\u00e8re, Mark\nTwain takes his stand on common sense and thinks scorn of affectation of\nevery sort. He understands sinners and strugglers and weaklings; and he\nis not harsh with them, reserving his scorching hatred for hypocrites\nand pretenders and frauds.\n\nAt how long an interval Mark Twain shall be rated after Moli\u00e8re and\nCervantes it is for the future to declare. All that we can see clearly\nnow is that it is with them that he is to be classed--with Moli\u00e8re and\nCervantes, with Chaucer and Fielding, humorists all of them, and all of\nthem manly men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              INTRODUCTION\n\n\nA number of articles in this volume, even the more important, have not\nheretofore appeared in print. Mark Twain was nearly always\nwriting--busily trying to keep up with his imagination and enthusiasm: A\ngood many of his literary undertakings remained unfinished or were held\nfor further consideration, in time to be quite forgotten. Few of these\npapers were unimportant, and a fresh interest attaches to them to-day in\nthe fact that they present some new detail of the author\u2019s devious\nwanderings, some new point of observation, some hitherto unexpressed\nangle of his indefatigable thought.\n\nThe present collection opens with a chapter from a book that was never\nwritten, a book about England, for which the author made some\npreparation, during his first visit to that country, in 1872. He filled\nseveral notebooks with brief comments, among which appears this single\ncomplete episode, the description of a visit to Westminster Abbey by\nnight. As an example of what the book might have been we may be sorry\nthat it went no farther.\n\nIt was not, however, quite in line with his proposed undertaking, which\nhad been to write a more or less satirical book on English manners and\ncustoms. Arriving there, he found that he liked the people and their\ncountry too well for that, besides he was so busy entertaining, and\nbeing entertained, that he had little time for critical observation. In\na letter home he wrote:\n\n  I came here to take notes for a book, but I haven\u2019t done much but\n  attend dinners and make speeches. I have had a jolly good time, and I\n  do hate to go away from these English folks; they make a stranger feel\n  entirely at home, and they laugh so easily that it is a comfort to\n  make after-dinner speeches here.\n\nEngland at this time gave Mark Twain an even fuller appreciation than he\nhad thus far received in his own country. To hunt out and hold up to\nridicule the foibles of hosts so hospitable would have been quite\nforeign to his nature. The notes he made had little satire in them,\nbeing mainly memoranda of the moment....\n\n\u201cDown the Rh\u00f4ne,\u201d written some twenty years later, is a chapter from\nanother book that failed of completion. Mark Twain, in Europe partly for\nhis health, partly for financial reasons, had agreed to write six\nletters for the New York _Sun_, two of which--those from Aix and\nMarienbad--appear in this volume. Six letters would not make a book of\nsufficient size and he thought he might supplement them by making a\ndrifting trip down the Rh\u00f4ne, the \u201criver of angels,\u201d as Stevenson called\nit, and turning it into literature.\n\nThe trip itself proved to be one of the most delightful excursions of\nhis life, and his account of it, so far as completed, has interest and\ncharm. But he was alone, with only his boatman (the \u201cAdmiral\u201d) and his\ncourier, Joseph Very, for company, a monotony of human material that was\nnot inspiring. He made some attempt to introduce fictitious characters,\nbut presently gave up the idea. As a whole the excursion was too drowsy\nand comfortable to stir him to continuous effort; neither the notes nor\nthe article, attempted somewhat later, ever came to conclusion.\n\nThree articles in this volume, beginning with \u201cTo the Person Sitting in\nDarkness,\u201d were published in the _North American Review_ during 1901-02,\nat a period when Mark Twain had pretty well made up his mind on most\nsubjects, and especially concerning the interference of one nation with\nanother on matters of religion and government. He had recently returned\nfrom a ten years\u2019 sojourn in Europe and his opinion was eagerly sought\non all public questions, especially upon those of international aspect.\nHe was no longer regarded merely as a humorist, but as a sort of Solon\npresiding over a court of final conclusions. A writer in the _Evening\nMail_ said of this later period:\n\n  Things have reached the point where, if Mark Twain is not at a public\n  meeting or banquet, he is expected to console it with one of his\n  inimitable letters of advice and encouragement.\n\nHis old friend, W. D. Howells, expressed an amused fear that Mark\nTwain\u2019s countrymen, who in former years had expected him to be merely a\nhumorist, should now, in the light of his wider acceptance abroad,\ndemand that he be mainly serious.\n\nHe was serious enough, and fiercely humorous as well, in his article \u201cTo\nthe Person Sitting in Darkness\u201d and in those which followed it. It\nseemed to him that the human race, always a doubtful quantity, was\nbehaving even worse than usual. On New Year\u2019s Eve, 1900-01, he wrote:\n\n                  A GREETING FROM THE NINETEENTH TO THE\n                            TWENTIETH CENTURY\n\n  I bring you the stately nation named Christendom, returning,\n  bedraggled, besmirched, and dishonored, from pirate raids in\n  Kiao-Chau, Manchuria, South Africa, and the Philippines, with her soul\n  full of meanness, her pocket full of boodle, and her mouth full of\n  pious hypocracies. Give her soap and a towel, but hide the\n  looking-glass.\n\nCertain missionary activities in China, in particular, invited his\nattention, and in the first of the _Review_ articles he unburdened\nhimself. A masterpiece of pitiless exposition and sarcasm, its\npublication stirred up a cyclone. Periodicals more or less orthodox\nheaped upon him denunciation and vituperation. \u201cTo My Missionary\nCritics,\u201d published in the _Review_ for April, was his answer. He did\nnot fight alone, but was upheld by a vast following of liberal-minded\nreaders, both in and out of the Church. Edward S. Martin wrote him:\n\n  How gratifying it is to feel that we have a man among us who\n  understands the rarity of plain truth, and who delights to utter it,\n  and has the gift of doing so without cant, and with not too much\n  seriousness.\n\nThe principals of the primal human drama, our biblical parents of Eden,\nplay a considerable part in Mark Twain\u2019s imaginative writings. He wrote\n\u201cDiaries\u201d of both Adam and Eve, that of the latter being among his\nchoicest works. He was generally planning something that would include\none or both of the traditional ancestors, and results of this tendency\nexpress themselves in the present volume. Satan, likewise, the\npicturesque angel of rebellion and defeat, the Satan of _Paradise Lost_,\nmade a strong appeal and in no less than three of the articles which\nfollow the prince of error variously appears. For the most part these\ninventions offer an aspect of humor; but again the figure of the outcast\nangel is presented to us in an attitude of sorrowful kinship with the\ngreat human tragedy.\n\n                                                ALBERT BIGELOW PAINE\n\n\n\n\n                          EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE\n\n\n\n\n                    A MEMORABLE MIDNIGHT EXPERIENCE\n                                 (1872)\n\n\n\u201cCome along--and hurry. Few people have got originality enough to think\nof the expedition I have been planning, and still fewer could carry it\nout, maybe, even if they _did_ think of it. Hurry, now. Cab at the\ndoor.\u201d\n\nIt was past eleven o\u2019clock and I was just going to bed. But this friend\nof mine was as reliable as he was eccentric, and so there was not a\ndoubt in my mind that his \u201cexpedition\u201d had merit in it. I put on my coat\nand boots again, and we drove away.\n\n\u201cWhere is it? Where are we going?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHe was not inclined to talk. So I thought this must be a weighty matter.\nMy curiosity grew with the minutes, but I kept it manfully under the\nsurface. I watched the lamps, the signs, the numbers, as we thundered\ndown the long streets, but it was of no use--I am always lost in London,\nday or night. It was very chilly--almost bleak. People leaned against\nthe gusty blasts as if it were the dead of winter. The crowds grew\nthinner and thinner and the noises waxed faint and seemed far away. The\nsky was overcast and threatening. We drove on, and still on, till I\nwondered if we were ever going to stop. At last we passed by a spacious\nbridge and a vast building with a lighted clock tower, and presently\nentered a gateway, passed through a sort of tunnel, and stopped in a\ncourt surrounded by the black outlines of a great edifice. Then we\nalighted, walked a dozen steps or so, and waited. In a little while\nfootsteps were heard and a man emerged from the darkness and we dropped\ninto his wake without saying anything. He led us under an archway of\nmasonry, and from that into a roomy tunnel, through a tall iron gate,\nwhich he locked behind us. We followed him down this tunnel, guided more\nby his footsteps on the stone flagging than by anything we could very\ndistinctly see. At the end of it we came to another iron gate, and our\nconductor stopped there and lit a little bull\u2019s-eye lantern. Then he\nunlocked the gate--and I wished he had oiled it first, it grated so\ndismally. The gate swung open and we stood on the threshold of what\nseemed a limitless domed and pillared cavern carved out of the solid\ndarkness. The conductor and my friend took off their hats reverently,\nand I did likewise. For the moment that we stood thus there was not a\nsound, and the silence seemed to add to the solemnity of the gloom. I\n_looked_ my inquiry!\n\n\u201cIt is the tomb of the great dead of England--_Westminster Abbey_.\u201d\n\n(One cannot express a start--in words.) Down among the columns--ever so\nfar away, it seemed--a light revealed itself like a star, and a voice\ncame echoing through the spacious emptiness:\n\n\u201cWho goes there!\u201d\n\n\u201cWright!\u201d\n\nThe star disappeared and the footsteps that accompanied it clanked out\nof hearing in the distance. Mr. Wright held up his lantern and the vague\nvastness took something of form to itself--the stately columns developed\nstronger outlines, and a dim pallor here and there marked the places of\nlofty windows. We were among the tombs; and on every hand dull shapes of\nmen, sitting, standing, or stooping, inspected us curiously out of the\ndarkness--reached out their hands toward us--some appealing, some\nbeckoning, some warning us away. Effigies, they were--statues over the\ngraves; but they looked human and natural in the murky shadows. Now a\nlittle half-grown black-and-white cat squeezed herself through the bars\nof the iron gate and came purring lovingly about us, unawed by the time\nor the place--unimpressed by the marble pomp that sepulchers a line of\nmighty dead that ends with a great author of yesterday and began with a\nsceptered monarch away back in the dawn of history more than twelve\nhundred years ago. And she followed us about and never left us while we\npursued our work. We wandered hither and thither, uncovered, speaking in\nlow voices, and stepping softly by instinct, for any little noise rang\nand echoed there in a way to make one shudder. Mr. Wright flashed his\nlantern first upon this object and then upon that, and kept up a running\ncommentary that showed that there was nothing about the venerable Abbey\nthat was trivial in his eyes or void of interest. He is a man in\nauthority--being superintendent of the works--and his daily business\nkeeps him familiar with every nook and corner of the great pile. Casting\na luminous ray now here, now yonder, he would say:\n\n\u201cObserve the height of the Abbey--one hundred and three feet to the base\nof the roof--I measured it myself the other day. Notice the base of this\ncolumn--old, very old--hundreds and hundreds of years; and how well they\nknew how to build in those old days. Notice it--every stone is laid\nhorizontally--that is to say, just as nature laid it originally in the\nquarry--not set up edgewise; in our day some people set them on edge,\nand then wonder why they split and flake. Architects cannot teach nature\nanything. Let me remove this matting--it is put there to preserve the\npavement; now, there is a bit of pavement that is seven hundred years\nold; you can see by these scattering clusters of colored mosaics how\nbeautiful it was before time and sacrilegious idlers marred it. Now\nthere, in the border, was an inscription once; see, follow the\ncircle--you can trace it by the ornaments that have been pulled\nout--here is an A, and there is an O, and yonder another A--all\nbeautiful old English capitals--there is no telling what the inscription\nwas--no record left, now. Now move along in this direction, if you\nplease. Yonder is where old King Sebert the Saxon, lies--his monument is\nthe oldest one in the Abbey; Sebert died in 616, and that\u2019s as much as\ntwelve hundred and fifty years ago--think of it!--twelve hundred and\nfifty years. Now yonder is the last one--Charles Dickens--there on the\nfloor with the brass letters on the slab--and to this day the people\ncome and put flowers on it. Why, along at first they almost had to\n_cart_ the flowers out, there were so many. Could not _leave_ them\nthere, you know, because it\u2019s where everybody walks--and a body wouldn\u2019t\nwant them trampled on, anyway. All this place about here, now, is the\nPoet\u2019s Corner. There is Garrick\u2019s monument, and Addison\u2019s, and\nThackeray\u2019s bust--and Macaulay lies there. And here, close to Dickens\nand Garrick, lie Sheridan and Doctor Johnson--and here is old\nParr--Thomas Parr--you can read the inscription:\n\n  \u201cTho: Par of Y Covnty of Sallop Borne A :1483. He Lived in Y Reignes\n  of Ten Princes, viz: K. Edw. 4 K. Ed. 5. K. Rich 3. K. Hen. 7. K. Hen.\n  8. Edw. 6. QVV. Ma. Q. Eliz. K. IA. and K. Charles, Aged 152 Yeares,\n  And Was Buryed Here Novemb. 15. 1635.\n\n\u201cVery old man indeed, and saw a deal of life. (Come off the grave,\nKitty, poor thing; she keeps the rats away from the office, and there\u2019s\nno harm in her--her and her mother.) And here--this is Shakespeare\u2019s\nstatue--leaning on his elbow and pointing with his finger at the lines\non the scroll:\n\n             \u201cThe cloud-capt towers, the gorgeous palaces,\n             The solemn temples, the great globe itself,\n             Yea, all which it inherit shall dissolve,\n             And, like the baseless fabric of a vision,\n             Leave not a wrack behind.\n\n\u201cThat stone there covers Campbell the poet. Here are names you know\npretty well--Milton, and Gray who wrote the \u2018Elegy,\u2019 and Butler who\nwrote \u2018Hudibras,\u2019 and Edmund Spencer, and Ben Jonson--there are three\ntablets to him scattered about the Abbey, and all got \u2018O Rare Ben\nJonson\u2019 cut on them--you were standing on one of them just now--he is\nburied standing up. There used to be a tradition here that explains it.\nThe story goes that he did not dare ask to be buried in the Abbey, so he\nasked King James if he would make him a present of eighteen inches of\nEnglish ground, and the king said yes, and asked him where he would have\nit, and he said in Westminster Abbey. Well, the king wouldn\u2019t go back on\nhis word, and so there he is sure enough--stood up on end. Years ago, in\nDean Buckland\u2019s time--before my day--they were digging a grave close to\nJonson and they uncovered him and his head fell off. Toward night the\nclerk of the works hid the head to keep it from being stolen, as the\nground was to remain open till next day. Presently the dean\u2019s son came\nalong and he found a head, and hid it away for Jonson\u2019s. And by and by\nalong comes a stranger, and _he_ found a head, too, and walked off with\nit under his cloak, and a month or so afterward he was heard to boast\nthat he had Ben Jonson\u2019s head. Then there was a deal of correspondence\nabout it, in the _Times_, and everybody distressed. But Mr. Frank\nBuckland came out and comforted everybody by telling how he saved the\ntrue head, and so the stranger must have got one that wasn\u2019t of any\nconsequence. And then up speaks the clerk of the works and tells how\n_he_ saved the right head, and so _Dean Buckland_ must have got a wrong\none. Well, it was all settled satisfactorily at last, because the clerk\nof the works _proved_ his head. And then I believe they got that head\nfrom the stranger--so now we have three. But it shows you what regiments\nof people you are walking over--been collecting here for twelve hundred\nyears--in some places, no doubt, the bones are fairly matted together.\n\n\u201cAnd here are some unfortunates. Under this place lies Anne, queen of\nRichard III, and daughter of the Kingmaker, the great Earl of\nWarwick--murdered she was--poisoned by her husband. And here is a slab\nwhich you see has once had the figure of a man in armor on it, in brass\nor copper, let into the stone. You can see the shape of it--but it is\nall worn away now by people\u2019s feet; the man has been dead five hundred\nyears that lies under it. He was a knight in Richard II\u2019s time. His\nenemies pressed him close and he fled and took sanctuary here in the\nAbbey. Generally a man was safe when he took sanctuary in those days,\nbut this man was not. The captain of the Tower and a band of men pursued\nhim and his friends and they had a bloody fight here on this floor; but\nthis poor fellow did not stand much of a chance, and they butchered him\nright before the altar.\u201d\n\nWe wandered over to another part of the Abbey, and came to a place where\nthe pavement was being repaired. Every paving stone has an inscription\non it and covers a grave. Mr. Wright continued:\n\n\u201cNow, you are standing on William Pitt\u2019s grave--you can read the name,\nthough it is a good deal worn--and you, sir, are standing on the grave\nof Charles James Fox. I found a very good place here the other\nday--nobody suspected it--been curiously overlooked, somehow--but--it is\na very nice place indeed, and very comfortable\u201d (holding his bull\u2019s eye\nto the pavement and searching around). \u201cAh, here it is--this is the\nstone--nothing under here--nothing at all--a very nice place indeed--and\nvery comfortable.\u201d\n\nMr. Wright spoke in a professional way, of course, and after the manner\nof a man who takes an interest in his business and is gratified at any\npiece of good luck that fortune favors him with; and yet with all that\nsilence and gloom and solemnity about me, there was something about his\nidea of a nice, comfortable place that made the cold chills creep up my\nback. Presently we began to come upon little chamberlike chapels, with\nsolemn figures ranged around the sides, lying apparently asleep, in\nsumptuous marble beds, with their hands placed together above their\nbreasts--the figures and all their surroundings black with age. Some\nwere dukes and earls, some where kings and queens, some were ancient\nabbots whose effigies had lain there so many centuries and suffered such\ndisfigurement that their faces were almost as smooth and featureless as\nthe stony pillows their heads reposed upon. At one time while I stood\nlooking at a distant part of the pavement, admiring the delicate tracery\nwhich the now flooding moonlight was casting upon it through a lofty\nwindow, the party moved on and I lost them. The first step I made in the\ndark, holding my hands before me, as one does under such circumstances,\nI touched a cold object, and stopped to feel its shape. I made out a\nthumb, and then delicate fingers. It was the clasped, appealing hands of\none of those reposing images--a lady, a queen. I touched the face--by\naccident, not design--and shuddered inwardly, if not outwardly; and then\nsomething rubbed against my leg, and I shuddered outwardly and inwardly\nboth. It was the cat. The friendly creature meant well, but, as the\nEnglish say, she gave me \u201csuch a turn.\u201d I took her in my arms for\ncompany and wandered among the grim sleepers till I caught the glimmer\nof the lantern again. Presently, in a little chapel, we were looking at\nthe sarcophagus, let into the wall, which contains the bones of the\ninfant princes who were smothered in the Tower. Behind us was the\nstately monument of Queen Elizabeth, with her effigy dressed in the\nroyal robes, lying as if at rest. When we turned around, the cat, with\nstupendous simplicity, was coiled up and sound asleep upon the feet of\nthe Great Queen! Truly this was reaching far toward the millennium when\nthe lion and the lamb shall lie down together. The murderer of Mary and\nEssex, the conqueror of the Armada, the imperious ruler of a turbulent\nempire, become a couch, at last, for a tired kitten! It was the most\neloquent sermon upon the vanity of human pride and human grandeur that\ninspired Westminster preached to us that night.\n\nWe would have turned puss out of the Abbey, but for the fact that her\nsmall body made light of railed gates and she would have come straight\nback again. We walked up a flight of half a dozen steps and, stopping\nupon a pavement laid down in 1260, stood in the core of English history,\nas it were--upon the holiest ground in the British Empire, if profusion\nof kingly bones and kingly names of old renown make holy ground. For\nhere in this little space were the ashes, the monuments and gilded\neffigies, of ten of the most illustrious personages who have worn crowns\nand borne scepters in this realm. This royal dust was the slow\naccumulation of hundreds of years. The latest comer entered into his\nrest four hundred years ago, and since the earliest was sepulchered,\nmore than eight centuries have drifted by. Edward the Confessor, Henry\nthe Fifth, Edward the First, Edward the Third, Richard the Second, Henry\nthe Third, Eleanor, Philippa, Margaret Woodville--it was like bringing\nthe colossal myths of history out of the forgotten ages and speaking to\nthem face to face. The gilded effigies were scarcely marred--the faces\nwere comely and majestic, old Edward the First looked the king--one had\nno impulse to be familiar with him. While we were contemplating the\nfigure of Queen Eleanor lying in state, and calling to mind how like an\nordinary human being the great king mourned for her six hundred years\nago, we saw the vast illuminated clock face of the Parliament House\ntower glowering at us through a window of the Abbey and pointing with\nboth hands to midnight. It was a derisive reminder that we were a part\nof this present sordid, plodding, commonplace time, and not august\nrelics of a bygone age and the comrades of kings--and then the booming\nof the great bell tolled twelve, and with the last stroke the mocking\nclock face vanished in sudden darkness and left us with the past and its\ngrandeurs again.\n\nWe descended, and entered the nave of the splendid Chapel of Henry VII.\nMr. Wright said:\n\n\u201cHere is where the order of knighthood was conferred for centuries; the\ncandidates sat in these seats; these brasses bear their coats of arms;\nthese are their banners overhead, torn and dusty, poor old things, for\nthey have hung there many and many a long year. In the floor you see\ninscriptions--kings and queens that lie in the vault below. When this\nvault was opened in our time they found them lying there in beautiful\norder--all quiet and comfortable--the red velvet on the coffins hardly\nfaded any. And the bodies were sound--I saw them myself. They were\nembalmed, and looked natural, although they had been there such an awful\ntime. Now in this place here, which is called the chantry, is a curious\nold group of statuary--the figures are mourning over George Villiers,\nDuke of Buckingham, who was assassinated by Felton in Charles I\u2019s time.\nYonder, Cromwell and his family used to lie. Now we come to the south\naisle and this is the grand monument to Mary Queen of Scots, and her\neffigy--you easily see they get all the portraits from this effigy. Here\nin the wall of the aisle is a bit of a curiosity pretty roughly carved:\n\n                             Wm. WEST TOOME\n                                 SHOWER\n                                  1698\n\n\u201cWilliam West, tomb shower, 1698. That fellow carved his name around in\nseveral places about the Abbey.\u201d\n\nThis was a sort of revelation to me. I had been wandering through the\nAbbey, never imagining but that its shows were created only for us--the\npeople of the nineteenth century. But here is a man (become a show\nhimself now, and a curiosity) to whom all these things were sights and\nwonders a hundred and seventy-five years ago. When curious idlers from\nthe country and from foreign lands came here to look, he showed them old\nSebert\u2019s tomb and those of the other old worthies I have been speaking\nof, and called them ancient and venerable; and he showed them Charles\nII\u2019s tomb as the newest and latest novelty he had; and he was doubtless\npresent at the funeral. Three hundred years before his time some\nancestor of his, perchance, used to point out the ancient marvels, in\nthe immemorial way and then say: \u201cThis, gentlemen, is the tomb of his\nlate Majesty Edward the Third--and I wish I could see him alive and\nhearty again, as I saw him twenty years ago; yonder is the tomb of\nSebert the Saxon king--he has been lying there well on to eight hundred\nyears, they say. And three hundred years before _this_ party,\nWestminster was still a show, and Edward the Confessor\u2019s grave was a\nnovelty of some thirty years\u2019 standing--but old \u201cSebert\u201d was hoary and\nancient still, and people who spoke of Alfred the Great as a\ncomparatively recent man pondered over Sebert\u2019s grave and tried to take\nin all the tremendous meaning of it when the \u201ctoome shower\u201d said, \u201cThis\nman has lain here well nigh five hundred years.\u201d It does seem as if all\nthe generations that have lived and died since the world was created\nhave visited Westminster to stare and wonder--and still found ancient\nthings there. And some day a curiously clad company may arrive here in a\nballoon ship from some remote corner of the globe, and as they follow\nthe verger among the monuments they may hear him say: \u201cThis is the tomb\nof Victoria the Good Queen; battered and uncouth as it looks, it once\nwas a wonder of magnificence--but twelve hundred years work a deal of\ndamage to these things.\u201d\n\nAs we turned toward the door the moonlight was beaming in at the\nwindows, and it gave to the sacred place such an air of restfulness and\npeace that Westminster was no longer a grisly museum of moldering\nvanities, but her better and worthier self--the deathless mentor of a\ngreat nation, the guide and encourager of right ambitions, the preserver\nof just fame, and the home and refuge for the nation\u2019s best and bravest\nwhen their work is done.\n\n\n\n\n                       TWO MARK TWAIN EDITORIALS\n\n  (Written 1869 and 1870, for the Buffalo _Express_, of which Mark Twain\n  became editor and part owner)\n\n                                   I\n                              \u201cSALUTATORY\u201d\n\nBeing a stranger, it would be immodest and unbecoming in me to suddenly\nand violently assume the associate editorship of the _Buffalo Express_\nwithout a single explanatory word of comfort or encouragement to the\nunoffending patrons of the paper, who are about to be exposed to\nconstant attacks of my wisdom and learning. But this explanatory word\nshall be as brief as possible. I only wish to assure parties having a\nfriendly interest in the prosperity of the journal, that I am not going\nto hurt the paper deliberately and intentionally at any time. I am not\ngoing to introduce any startling reforms, or in any way attempt to make\ntrouble. I am simply going to do my plain, unpretending duty, when I\ncannot get out of it; I shall work diligently and honestly and\nfaithfully at all times and upon all occasions, when privation and want\nshall compel me to do it; in writing, I shall always confine myself\nstrictly to the truth, except when it is attended with inconvenience; I\nshall witheringly rebuke all forms of crime and misconduct, except when\ncommitted by the party inhabiting my own vest; I shall not make use of\nslang or vulgarity upon any occasion or under any circumstances, and\nshall never use profanity except in discussing house rent and taxes.\nIndeed, upon second thought, I will not even use it then, for it is\nunchristian, inelegant, and degrading--though to speak truly I do not\nsee how house rent and taxes are going to be discussed worth a cent\nwithout it. I shall not often meddle with politics, because we have a\npolitical editor who is already excellent, and only needs to serve a\nterm in the penitentiary in order to be perfect. I shall not write any\npoetry, unless I conceive a spite against the subscribers.\n\nSuch is my platform. I do not see any earthly use in it, but custom is\nlaw, and custom must be obeyed, no matter how much violence it may do to\none\u2019s feelings. And this custom which I am slavishly following now is\nsurely one of the least necessary that ever came into vogue. In private\nlife a man does not go and trumpet his crime before he commits it, but\nyour new editor is such an important personage that he feels called upon\nto write a \u201csalutatory\u201d at once, and he puts into it all that he knows,\nand all that he don\u2019t know, and some things he thinks he knows but isn\u2019t\ncertain of. And he parades his list of wonders which he is going to\nperform; of reforms which he is going to introduce, and public evils\nwhich he is going to exterminate; and public blessings which he is going\nto create; and public nuisances which he is going to abate. He spreads\nthis all out with oppressive solemnity over a column and a half of large\nprint, and feels that the country is saved. His satisfaction over it,\nsomething enormous. He then settles down to his miracles and inflicts\nprofound platitudes and impenetrable wisdom upon a helpless public as\nlong as they can stand it, and then they send him off consul to some\nsavage island in the Pacific in the vague hope that the cannibals will\nlike him well enough to eat him. And with an inhumanity which is but a\nfitting climax to his career of persecution, instead of packing his\ntrunk at once he lingers to inflict upon his benefactors a\n\u201cvaledictory.\u201d If there is anything more uncalled for than a\n\u201csalutatory,\u201d it is one of those tearful, blubbering, long-winded\n\u201cvaledictories\u201d--wherein a man who has been annoying the public for ten\nyears cannot take leave of them without sitting down to cry a column and\na half. Still, it is the custom to write valedictories, and custom\nshould be respected. In my secret heart I admire my predecessor for\ndeclining to print a valedictory, though in public I say and shall\ncontinue to say sternly, it is custom and he ought to have printed one.\nPeople never read them any more than they do the \u201csalutatories,\u201d but\nnevertheless he ought to have honored the old fossil--he ought to have\nprinted a valedictory. I said as much to him, and he replied:\n\n\u201cI have resigned my place--I have departed this life--I am\njournalistically dead, at present, ain\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, wouldn\u2019t you consider it disgraceful in a corpse to sit up and\ncomment on the funeral?\u201d\n\nI record it here, and preserve it from oblivion, as the briefest and\nbest \u201cvaledictory\u201d that has yet come under my notice.\n\n                                                         MARK TWAIN.\n\nP. S.--I am grateful for the kindly way in which the press of the land\nhave taken notice of my irruption into regular journalistic life,\ntelegraphically or editorially, and am happy in this place to express\nthe feeling.\n\n                                   II\n                     A TRIBUTE TO ANSON BURLINGAME\n\n                            (February, 1870)\n\nOn Wednesday, in St. Petersburg, Mr. Burlingame died after a short\nillness. It is not easy to comprehend, at an instant\u2019s warning, the\nexceeding magnitude of the loss which mankind sustains in this\ndeath--the loss which all nations and all peoples sustain in it. For he\nhad outgrown the narrow citizenship of a state and become a citizen of\nthe world; and his charity was large enough and his great heart warm\nenough to feel for all its races and to labor for them. He was a true\nman, a brave man, an earnest man, a liberal man, a just man, a generous\nman, in all his ways and by all his instincts a noble man; he was a man\nof education and culture, a finished conversationalist, a ready, able,\nand graceful speaker, a man of great brain, a broad and deep and weighty\nthinker. He was a great man--a very, very great man. He was imperially\nendowed by nature; he was faithfully befriended by circumstances, and he\nwrought gallantly always, in whatever station he found himself.\n\nHe was a large, handsome man, with such a face as children instinctively\ntrust in, and homeless and friendless creatures appeal to without fear.\nHe was courteous at all times and to all people, and he had the rare and\nwinning faculty of being always _interested_ in whatever a man had to\nsay--a faculty which he possessed simply because nothing was trivial to\nhim which any man or woman or child had at heart. When others said harsh\nthings about even unconscionable and intrusive bores after they had\nretired from his presence, Mr. Burlingame often said a generous word in\ntheir favor, but never an unkind one.\n\nA chivalrous generosity was his most marked characteristic--a large\ncharity, a noble kindliness that could not comprehend narrowness or\nmeanness. It is this that shows out in his fervent abolitionism,\nmanifested at a time when it was neither very creditable nor very safe\nto hold such a creed; it was this that prompted him to hurl his famous\nBrooks-and-Sumner speech in the face of an astonished South at a time\nwhen all the North was smarting under the sneers and taunts and material\naggressions of admired and applauded Southerners. It was this that made\nhim so warmly espouse the cause of Italian liberty--an espousal so\npointed and so vigorous as to attract the attention of Austria, which\nempire afterward declined to receive him when he was appointed Austrian\nenvoy by Mr. Lincoln. It was this trait which prompted him to punish\nAmericans in China when they imposed upon the Chinese. It was this trait\nwhich moved him, in framing treaties, to frame them in the broad\ninterest of the world, instead of selfishly seeking to acquire\nadvantages for his own country alone and at the expense of the other\nparty to the treaty, as had always before been the recognized\n\u201cdiplomacy.\u201d It was this trait which was and is the soul of the crowning\nachievements of his career, the treaties with America and England in\nbehalf of China. In every labor of this man\u2019s life there was present a\ngood and noble motive; and in nothing that he ever did or said was there\nanything small or base. In real greatness, ability, grandeur of\ncharacter, and achievement, he stood head and shoulders above all the\nAmericans of to-day, save one or two.\n\nWithout any noise, or any show, or any flourish, Mr. Burlingame did a\nscore of things of shining mark during his official residence in China.\nThey were hardly heard of away here in America. When he first went to\nChina, he found that with all their kingly powers, American envoys were\nstill not of much consequence in the eyes of their countrymen of either\ncivil or official position. But he was a man who was always \u201cposted.\u201d He\nknew all about the state of things he would find in China before he\nsailed from America. And so he took care to demand and receive\nadditional powers before he turned his back upon Washington. When the\ncustomary consular irregularities placidly continued and he notified\nthose officials that such irregularities must instantly cease, and they\ninquired with insolent flippancy what the consequence might be in case\nthey did not cease, he answered blandly that he would _dismiss_ them,\nfrom the highest to the lowest! (He had quietly come armed with absolute\nauthority over their official lives.) The consular irregularities\nceased. A far healthier condition of American commercial interests\nensued there.\n\nTo punish a foreigner in China was an unheard-of thing. There was no way\nof accomplishing it. Each Embassy had its own private district or\ngrounds, forced from the imperial government, and into that sacred\ndistrict Chinese law officers could not intrude. All foreigners guilty\nof offenses against Chinamen were tried by their own countrymen, in\nthese holy places, and as no Chinese testimony was admitted, the culprit\nalmost always went free. One of the very first things Mr. Burlingame did\nwas to make a Chinaman\u2019s oath as good as a foreigner\u2019s; and in his\nministerial court, through Chinese and American testimony combined, he\nvery shortly convicted a noted American ruffian of murdering a Chinaman.\nAnd now a community accustomed to light sentences were naturally\nstartled when, under Mr. Burlingame\u2019s hand, and bearing the broad seal\nof the American Embassy, came an order to take him out and hang him!\n\nMr. Burlingame broke up the \u201cextra-territorial\u201d privileges (as they were\ncalled), as far as our country was concerned, and made justice as free\nto all and as untrammeled in the metes and bounds of its jurisdiction,\nin China, as ever it was in any land.\n\nMr. Burlingame was the leading spirit in the co-operative policy. He got\nthe Imperial College established. He procured permission for an American\nto open the coal mines of China. Through his efforts China was the first\ncountry to close her ports against the war vessels of the Southern\nConfederacy; and Prince Kung\u2019s order, in this matter, was singularly\nenergetic, comprehensive, and in earnest. The ports were closed then,\nand never opened to a Southern warship afterward.\n\nMr. Burlingame \u201cconstrued\u201d the treaties existing between China and the\nother nations. For many years the ablest diplomatists had vainly tried\nto come to a satisfactory understanding of certain obscure clauses of\nthese treaties, and more than once powder had been burned in\nconsequences of failure to come to such understandings. But the clear\nand comprehensive intellect of the American envoy reduced the wordy\ntangle of diplomatic phrases to a plain and honest handful of\nparagraphs, and these were unanimously and thankfully accepted by the\nother foreign envoys, and officially declared by them to be a thorough\nand satisfactory elucidation of all the uncertain clauses in the\ntreaties.\n\nMr. Burlingame did a mighty work, and made official intercourse with\nChina lucid, simple, and systematic, thenceforth for all time, when he\npersuaded that government to adopt and accept the code of international\nlaw by which the civilized nations of the earth are guided and\ncontrolled.\n\nIt is not possible to specify all the acts by which Mr. Burlingame made\nhimself largely useful to the world during his official residence in\nChina. At least it would not be possible to do it without making this\nsketch too lengthy and pretentious for a newspaper article.\n\nMr. Burlingame\u2019s short history--for he was only forty-seven--reads like\na fairy tale. Its successes, its surprises, its happy situations, occur\nall along, and each new episode is always an improvement upon the one\nwhich went before it.\n\nHe begins life an assistant in a surveying party away out on the Western\nfrontier; then enters a branch of a Western college; then passes through\nHarvard with the honors; becomes a Boston lawyer and looks back\ncomplacently from his high perch upon the old days when he was a\nsurveyor nobody in the woods; becomes a state senator, and makes laws;\nstill advancing, goes to the Constitutional Convention and makes\nregulations wherewith to rule the makers of laws; enters Congress and\nsmiles back upon the Legislature and the Boston lawyer, and from these\nsmiles still back upon the country surveyor, recognizes that he is known\nto fame in Massachusetts; challenges Brooks and is known to the nation;\nnext, with a long stride upward, he is clothed with ministerial dignity\nand journeys to the under side of the world to represent the youngest in\nthe court of the oldest of the nations; and finally, after years go by,\nwe see him moving serenely among the crowned heads of the Old World, a\nmagnate with secretaries and undersecretaries about him, a retinue of\nquaint, outlandish Orientals in his wake, and a long following of\nservants--and the world is aware that his salary is unbelievably\nenormous, not to say imperial, and likewise knows that he is invested\nwith power to make treaties with all the chief nations of the earth, and\nthat he bears the stately title of Ambassador, and in his person\nrepresents the mysterious and awful grandeur of that vague colossus, the\nEmperor of China, his mighty empire and his four hundred millions of\nsubjects! Down what a dreamy vista his backward glance must stretch,\nnow, to reach the insignificant surveyor in the Western woods!\n\nHe was a good man, and a very, very great man. America lost a son, and\nall the world a servant, when he died.\n\n\n\n\n                       THE TEMPERANCE CRUSADE AND\n                             WOMAN\u2019S RIGHTS\n                                 (1873)\n\n\nThe women\u2019s crusade against the rum sellers continues. It began in an\nOhio village early in the new year, and has now extended itself\neastwardly to the Atlantic seaboard, 600 miles, and westwardly (at a\nbound, without stopping by the way,) to San Francisco, about 2,500\nmiles. It has also scattered itself along down the Ohio and Mississippi\nrivers southwardly some ten or twelve hundred miles. Indeed, it promises\nto sweep, eventually, the whole United States, with the exception of the\nlittle cluster of commonwealths which we call New England. Puritan New\nEngland is sedate, reflective, conservative, and very hard to inflame.\n\nThe method of the crusaders is singular. They contemn the use of force\nin the breaking up of the whisky traffic. They only assemble before a\ndrinking shop, or within it, and sing hymns and pray, hour after\nhour--and day after day, if necessary--until the publican\u2019s business is\nbroken up and he surrenders. This is not force, at least they do not\nconsider it so. After the surrender the crusaders march back to\nheadquarters and proclaim the victory, and ascribe it to the powers\nabove. They rejoice together awhile, and then go forth again in their\nstrength and conquer another whisky shop with their prayers and hymns\nand their staying capacity (pardon the rudeness), and spread _that_\nvictory upon the battle flag of the powers above. In this generous way\nthe crusaders have parted with the credit of not less than three\nthousand splendid triumphs, which some carping people say they gained\ntheir own selves, without assistance from any quarter. If I am one of\nthese, I am the humblest. If I seem to doubt that prayer is the agent\nthat conquers these rum sellers, I do it honestly, and not in a flippant\nspirit. If the crusaders were to stay at home and pray for the rum\nseller and for his adoption of a better way of life, or if the crusaders\neven assembled together in a church and offered up such a prayer with a\nunited voice, and it accomplished a victory, I would then feel that it\nwas the praying that moved Heaven to do the miracle; for I believe that\nif the prayer is the agent that brings about the desired result, it\ncannot be necessary to pray the prayer in any particular place in order\nto get the ear, or move the grace, of the Deity. When the crusaders go\nand invest a whisky shop and fall to praying, one suspects that they are\npraying rather less to the Deity than _at_ the rum man. So I cannot help\nfeeling (after carefully reading the details of the rum sieges) that as\nmuch as nine tenths of the credit of each of the 3,000 victories\nachieved thus far belongs of right to the crusaders themselves, and it\ngrieves me to see them give it away with such spendthrift generosity.\n\nI will not afflict you with statistics, but I desire to say just a word\nor two about the character of this crusade. The crusaders are young\ngirls and women--not the inferior sort, but the very best in the village\ncommunities. The telegraph keeps the newspapers supplied with the\nprogress of the war, and thus the praying infection spreads from town to\ntown, day after day, week after week. When it attacks a community it\nseems to seize upon almost everybody in it at once. There is a meeting\nin a church, speeches are made, resolutions are passed, a purse for\nexpenses is made up, a \u201cpraying band\u201d is appointed; if it be a large\ntown, half a dozen praying bands, each numbering as many as a hundred\nwomen, are appointed, and the working district of each band marked out.\nThen comes a grand assault in force, all along the line. Every\nstronghold of rum is invested; first one and then another champion\nranges up before the proprietor and offers up a special petition for\nhim; he has to stand meekly there behind his bar, under the eyes of a\ngreat concourse of ladies who are better than he is and are aware of it,\nand hear all the secret iniquities of his business divulged to the\nangels above, accompanied by the sharp sting of wishes for his\nregeneration, which imply an amount of need for it which is in the last\ndegree uncomfortable to him. If he holds out bravely, the crusaders hold\nout more bravely still--or at least more persistently; though I doubt if\nthe grandeur of the performance would not be considerably heightened if\none solitary crusader were to try praying at a hundred rum sellers in a\nbody for a while, and see how it felt to have everybody against her\ninstead of for her. If the man holds out the crusaders camp before his\nplace and keep up the siege till they wear him out. In one case they\nbesieged a rum shop two whole weeks. They built a shed before it and\nkept up the praying all night and all day long every day of the\nfortnight, and this in the bitterest winter weather, too. They\nconquered.\n\nYou may ask if such an investment and such interference with a man\u2019s\nbusiness (in cases where he is \u201cprotected\u201d by a license) is lawful? By\nno means. But the whole community being with the crusaders, the\nauthorities have usually been overawed and afraid to execute the laws,\nthe authorities being, in too many cases, mere little politicians, and\nmore given to looking to chances of re-election than fearlessly\ndischarging their duty according to the terms of their official oaths.\n\nWould you consider the conduct of these crusaders justifiable? I\ndo--thoroughly justifiable. They find themselves voiceless in the making\nof laws and the election of officers to execute them. Born with brains,\nborn in the country, educated, having large interests at stake, they\nfind their tongues tied and their hands fettered, while every ignorant\nwhisky-drinking foreign-born savage in the land may hold office, help to\nmake the laws, degrade the dignity of the former and break the latter at\nhis own sweet will. They see their fathers, husbands, and brothers sit\ninanely at home and allow the scum of the country to assemble at the\n\u201cprimaries,\u201d name the candidates for office from their own vile ranks,\nand, unrebuked, elect them. They live in the midst of a country where\nthere is no end to the laws and no beginning to the execution of them.\nAnd when the laws intended to protect their sons from destruction by\nintemperance lie torpid and without sign of life year after year, they\nrecognize that here is a matter which interests them personally--a\nmatter which comes straight home to them. And since they are allowed to\nlift no legal voice against the outrageous state of things they suffer\nunder in this regard, I think it is no wonder that their patience has\nbroken down at last, and they have contrived to persuade themselves that\nthey are justifiable in breaking the law of trespass when the laws that\nshould make the trespass needless are allowed by the voters to lie dead\nand inoperative.\n\nI cannot help glorying in the pluck of these women, sad as it is to see\nthem displaying themselves in these unwomanly ways; sad as it is to see\nthem carrying their grace and their purity into places which should\nnever know their presence; and sadder still as it is to see them trying\nto save a set of men who, it seems to me, there can be no reasonable\nobject in saving. It does not become us to scoff at the crusaders,\nremembering what it is they have borne all these years, but it does\nbecome us to admire their heroism--a heroism that boldly faces jeers,\ncurses, ribald language, obloquy of every kind and degree--in a word,\nevery manner of thing that pure-hearted, pure-minded women such as these\nare naturally dread and shrink from, and remains steadfast through it\nall, undismayed, patient, hopeful, giving no quarter, asking none,\ndetermined to conquer and succeeding. It is the same old superb spirit\nthat animated that other devoted, magnificent, mistaken crusade of six\nhundred years ago. The sons of such women as these must surely be worth\nsaving from the destroying power of rum.\n\nThe present crusade will doubtless do but little work against\nintemperance that will be really permanent, but it will do what is as\nmuch, or even more, to the purpose, I think. I think it will suggest to\nmore than one man that if women could vote they would vote on the side\nof morality, even if they did vote and speak rather frantically and\nfuriously; and it will also suggest that when the women once made up\ntheir minds that it was not good to leave the all-powerful \u201cprimaries\u201d\nin the hands of loafers, thieves, and pernicious little politicians,\nthey would not sit indolently at home as their husbands and brothers do\nnow, but would hoist their praying banners, take the field in force,\npray the assembled political scum back to the holes and slums where they\nbelong, and set up some candidates fit for decent human beings to vote\nfor.\n\nI dearly want the women to be raised to the political altitude of the\nnegro, the imported savage, and the pardoned thief, and allowed to vote.\nIt is our last chance, I think. The women will be voting before long,\nand then if a B. F. Butler can still continue to lord it in Congress; if\nthe highest offices in the land can still continue to be occupied by\nperjurers and robbers; if another Congress (like the forty-second)\nconsisting of 15 honest men and 296 of the other kind can once more be\ncreated, it will at last be time, I fear, to give over trying to save\nthe country by human means, and appeal to Providence. Both the great\nparties have failed. I wish we might have a woman\u2019s party now, and see\nhow that would work. I feel persuaded that in extending the suffrage to\nwomen this country could lose absolutely nothing and might gain a great\ndeal. For thirty centuries history has been iterating and reiterating\nthat in a moral fight woman is simply dauntless, and we all know, even\nwith our eyes shut upon Congress and our voters, that from the day that\nAdam ate of the apple and told on Eve down to the present day, man, in a\nmoral fight, has pretty uniformly shown himself to be an arrant coward.\n\nI will mention casually that while I cannot bring myself to find fault\nwith the women whom we call the crusaders, since I feel that they, being\npolitically fettered, have the natural right of the oppressed to rebel,\nI have a very different opinion about the clergymen who have in a\nmultitude of instances attached themselves to the movement, and by voice\nand act have countenanced and upheld the women in unlawfully trespassing\nupon whisky mills and interrupting the rum sellers\u2019 business. It seems\nto me that it would better become clergymen to teach their flocks to\nrespect the laws of the land, and urge them to refrain from breaking\nthem. But it is not a new thing for a thoroughly good and well-meaning\npreacher\u2019s soft heart to run away with his soft head.\n\n\n\n\n                                 O\u2019SHAH\n\n     (A series of news letters describing a visit to England by the\n                            Shah of Persia)\n\n                                   I\n                         THE ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND\n\n                                            LONDON, _June 18, 1873_.\n\n\u201cWould you like to go over to Belgium and help bring the Shah to\nEngland?\u201d\n\nI said I was willing.\n\n\u201cVery well, then; here is an order from the Admiralty which will admit\nyou on board Her Majesty\u2019s ship _Lively_, now lying at Ostend, and you\ncan return in her day after to-morrow.\u201d\n\nThat was all. That was the end of it. Without stopping to think, I had\nin a manner taken upon myself to bring the Shah of Persia to England. I\ncould not otherwise regard the conversation I had just held with the\nLondon representative of the New York _Herald_. The amount of discomfort\nI endured for the next two or three hours cannot be set down in words. I\ncould not eat, sleep, talk, smoke with any satisfaction. The more I\nthought the thing over the more oppressed I felt. What was the Shah to\nme, that I should go to all this worry and trouble on his account? Where\nwas there the least occasion for taking upon myself such a\nresponsibility? If I got him over all right, well. But if I lost him? if\nhe died on my hands? if he got drowned? It was depressing, any way I\nlooked at it. In the end I said to myself, \u201cIf I get this Shah over here\nsafe and sound I never will take charge of another one.\u201d And yet, at the\nsame time I kept thinking: \u201cThis country has treated me well, stranger\nas I am, and this foreigner is the country\u2019s guest--that is enough, I\nwill help him out; I will fetch him over; I will land him in London, and\nsay to the British people, \u2018Here is your Shah; give me a receipt.\u2019\u201d\n\nI felt easy in my mind now, and was about to go to bed, but something\noccurred to me. I took a cab and drove downtown and routed out that\n_Herald_ representative.\n\n\u201cWhere is Belgium?\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cWhere is Belgium? I never heard such a question!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any difference to me. If I have got to fetch this\nShah I don\u2019t wish to go to the wrong place. Where is Belgium? Is it a\nshilling fare in a cab?\u201d\n\nHe explained that it was in foreign parts--the first place I have heard\nof lately which a body could not go to in a cab for a shilling.\n\nI said I could not go alone, because I could not speak foreign languages\nwell, could not get up in time for the early train without help, and\ncould not find my way. I said it was enough to have the Shah on my\nhands; I did not wish to have everything piled on me. Mr. Blank was then\nordered to go with me. I do like to have somebody along to talk to when\nI go abroad.\n\nWhen I got home I sat down and thought the thing all over. I wanted to\ngo into this enterprise understandingly. What was the main thing? That\nwas the question. A little reflection informed me. For two weeks the\nLondon papers had sung just one continual song to just one continual\ntune, and the idea of it all was \u201chow to impress the Shah.\u201d These papers\nhad told all about the St. Petersburg splendors, and had said at the end\nthat splendors would no longer answer; that England could not outdo\nRussia in that respect; therefore some other way of impressing the Shah\nmust be contrived. And these papers had also told all about the Shahstic\nreception in Prussia and its attendant military pageantry. England could\nnot improve on that sort of thing--she could not impress the Shah with\nsoldiers; something else must be tried. And so on. Column after column,\npage after page of agony about how to \u201cimpress the Shah.\u201d At last they\nhad hit upon a happy idea--a grand naval exhibition. That was it! A man\nbrought up in Oriental seclusion and simplicity, a man who had never\nseen anything but camels and such things, could not help being surprised\nand delighted with the strange novelty of ships. The distress was at an\nend. England heaved a great sigh of relief; she knew at last how to\nimpress the Shah.\n\nMy course was very plain, now, after that bit of reflection. All I had\nto do was to go over to Belgium and impress the Shah. I failed to form\nany definite plan as to the process, but I made up my mind to manage it\nsomehow. I said to myself, \u201cI will impress this Shah or there shall be a\nfuneral that will be worth contemplating.\u201d\n\nI went to bed then, but did not sleep a great deal, for the\nresponsibilities were weighing pretty heavily upon me. At six o\u2019clock in\nthe morning Mr. Blank came and turned me out. I was surprised at this,\nand not gratified, for I detest early rising. I never like to say severe\nthings, but I was a good deal tried this time. I said I did not mind\ngetting up moderately early, but I hated to be called day before\nyesterday. However, as I was acting in a national capacity and for a\ncountry that I liked, I stopped grumbling and we set out. A grand naval\nreview is a good thing to impress a Shah with, but if he would try\ngetting up at six o\u2019clock in the morning--but no matter; we started.\n\nWe took the Dover train and went whistling along over the housetops at\nthe rate of fifty miles an hour, and just as smoothly and pleasantly,\ntoo, as if we were in a sleigh. One never can have anything but a very\nvague idea of what speed is until he travels over an English railway.\nOur \u201clightning\u201d expresses are sleepy and indolent by comparison. We\nlooked into the back windows of the endless ranks of houses abreast and\nbelow us, and saw many a homelike little family of early birds sitting\nat their breakfasts. New views and new aspects of London were about me;\nthe mighty city seemed to spread farther and wider in the clear morning\nair than it had ever done before. There is something awe-inspiring about\nthe mere look of the figures that express the population of London when\none comes to set them down in a good large hand--4,000,000! It takes a\nbody\u2019s breath away, almost.\n\nWe presently left the city behind. We had started drowsy, but we did not\nstay so. How could we, with the brilliant sunshine pouring down, the\nbalmy wind blowing through the open windows, and the Garden of Eden\nspread all abroad? We swept along through rolling expanses of growing\ngrain--not a stone or a stump to mar their comeliness, not an unsightly\nfence or an ill-kept hedge; through broad meadows covered with fresh\ngreen grass as clean swept as if a broom had been at work there--little\nbrooks wandering up and down them, noble trees here and there, cows in\nthe shade, groves in the distance and church spires projecting out of\nthem; and there were the quaintest old-fashioned houses set in the midst\nof smooth lawns or partly hiding themselves among fine old forest trees;\nand there was one steep-roofed ancient cottage whose walls all around,\nand whose roof, and whose chimneys, were clothed in a shining mail of\nivy leaves!--so thoroughly, indeed, that only one little patch of roof\nwas visible to prove that the house was not a mere house of leaves, with\nglass windows in it. Imagine those dainty little homes surrounded by\nflowering shrubs and bright green grass and all sorts of old trees--and\nthen go on and try to imagine something more bewitching.\n\nBy and by we passed Rochester, and, sure enough, right there, on the\nhighest ground in the town and rising imposingly up from among\nclustering roofs, was the gray old castle--roofless, ruined, ragged, the\nsky beyond showing clear and blue through the glassless windows, the\nwalls partly clad with ivy--a time-scarred, weather-beaten old pile, but\never so picturesque and ever so majestic, too. There it was, a whole\nbook of English history. I had read of Rochester Castle a thousand\ntimes, but I had never really believed there was any such building\nbefore.\n\nPresently we reached the sea and came to a stand far out on a pier; and\nhere was Dover and more history. The chalk cliffs of England towered up\nfrom the shore and the French coast was visible. On the tallest hill sat\nDover Castle, stately and spacious and superb, looking just as it has\nalways looked any time these ten or fifteen thousand years--I do not\nknow its exact age, and it does not matter, anyway.\n\nWe stepped aboard the little packet and steamed away. The sea was\nperfectly smooth, and painfully brilliant in the sunshine. There were no\ncuriosities in the vessel except the passengers and a placard in French\nsetting forth the transportation fares for various kinds of people. The\nlithographer probably considered that placard a triumph. It was printed\nin green, blue, red, black, and yellow; no individual line in one color,\neven the individual letters were separately colored. For instance, the\nfirst letter of a word would be blue, the next red, the next green, and\nso on. The placard looked as if it had the smallpox or something. I\ninquired the artist\u2019s name and place of business, intending to hunt him\nup and kill him when I had time; but no one could tell me. In the list\nof prices first-class passengers were set down at fifteen shillings and\nfour pence, and dead bodies at one pound ten shillings and eight\npence--just double price! That is Belgian morals, I suppose. I never say\na harsh thing unless I am greatly stirred; but in my opinion the man who\nwould take advantage of a dead person would do almost any odious thing.\nI publish this scandalous discrimination against the most helpless class\namong us in order that people intending to die abroad may come back by\nsome other line.\n\nWe skimmed over to Ostend in four hours and went ashore. The first\ngentleman we saw happened to be the flag lieutenant of the fleet, and he\ntold me where the _Lively_ lay, and said she would sail about six in the\nmorning. Heavens and earth. He said he would give my letter to the\nproper authority, and so we thanked him and bore away for the hotel.\nBore away is good sailor phraseology, and I have been at sea portions of\ntwo days now. I easily pick up a foreign language.\n\nOstend is a curious, comfortable-looking, massively built town, where\nthe people speak both the French and the Flemish with exceeding fluency,\nand yet I could not understand them in either tongue. But I will write\nthe rest about Ostend in to-morrow\u2019s letter.\n\nWe idled about this curious Ostend the remainder of the afternoon and\nfar into the long-lived twilight, apparently to amuse ourselves, but\nsecretly I had a deeper motive. I wanted to see if there was anything\nhere that might \u201cimpress the Shah.\u201d In the end I was reassured and\ncontent. If Ostend could impress him, England could amaze the head clear\noff his shoulders and have marvels left that not even the trunk could be\nindifferent to.\n\nThese citizens of Flanders--Flounders, I think they call them, though I\nfeel sure I have eaten a creature of that name or seen it in an aquarium\nor a menagerie, or in a picture or somewhere--are a thrifty, industrious\nrace, and are as commercially wise and farsighted as they were in Edward\nthe Third\u2019s time, and as enduring and patient under adversity as they\nwere in Charles the Bold\u2019s. They are prolific in the matter of children;\nin some of the narrow streets every house seemed to have had a freshet\nof children, which had burst through and overflowed into the roadway.\nOne could hardly get along for the pack of juveniles, and they were all\nsoiled and all healthy. They all wore wooden shoes, which clattered\nnoisily on the stone pavements. All the women were hard at work; there\nwere no idlers about the houses. The men were away at labor, no doubt.\nIn nearly every door women sat at needlework or something of that\nmarketable nature--they were knitting principally. Many groups of women\nsat in the street, in the shade of walls, making point lace. The lace\nmaker holds a sort of pillow on her knees with a strip of cardboard\nfastened on it, on which the lace pattern has been punctured. She sticks\nbunches of pins in the punctures and about them weaves her web of\nthreads. The numberless threads diverge from the bunch of pins like the\nspokes of a wheel, and the spools from which the threads are being\nunwound form the outer circle of the wheel. The woman throws these\nspools about her with flying fingers, in and out, over and under one\nanother, and so fast that you can hardly follow the evolutions with your\neyes. In the chaos and confusion of skipping spools you wonder how she\ncan possibly pick up the right one every time, and especially how she\ncan go on gossiping with her friends all the time and yet never seem to\nmiss a stitch. The laces these ingenious Flounders were making were very\ndainty and delicate in texture and very beautiful in design.\n\nMost of the shops in Ostend seemed devoted to the sale of sea shells.\nAll sorts of figures of men and women were made of shells; one sort was\ncomposed of grotesque and ingenious combinations of lobster claws in the\nhuman form. And they had other figures made of stuffed frogs--some\nfencing, some barbering each other, and some were not to be described at\nall without indecent language. It must require a barbarian nature to be\nable to find humor in such nauseating horrors as these last. These\nthings were exposed in the public windows where young girls and little\nchildren could see them, and in the shops sat the usual hairy-lipped\nyoung woman waiting to sell them.\n\nThere was a contrivance attached to the better class of houses which I\nhad heard of before, but never seen. It was an arrangement of mirrors\noutside the window, so contrived that the people within could see who\nwas coming either up or down the street--see all that might be going on,\nin fact--without opening the window or twisting themselves into\nuncomfortable positions in order to look.\n\nA capital thing to watch for unwelcome (or welcome) visitors with, or to\nobserve pageants in cold or rainy weather. People in second and third\nstories had, also, another mirror which showed who was passing\nunderneath.\n\nThe dining room at our hotel was very spacious and rather gorgeous. One\nend of it was composed almost entirely of a single pane of plate glass,\nsome two inches thick--for this is the plate-glass manufacturing region,\nyou remember. It was very clear and fine. If one were to enter the place\nin such a way as not to catch the sheen of the glass, he would suppose\nthat the end of the house was wide open to the sun and the storms. A\nstrange boyhood instinct came strongly upon me, and I could not really\nenjoy my dinner, I wanted to break that glass so badly. I have no doubt\nthat every man feels so, and I know that such a glass must be simply\ntorture to a boy.\n\nThis dining room\u2019s walls were almost completely covered with large oil\npaintings in frames.\n\nIt was an excellent hotel; the utmost care was taken that everything\nshould go right. I went to bed at ten and was called at eleven to \u201ctake\nthe early train.\u201d I said I was not the one, so the servant stirred up\nthe next door and he was not the one; then the next door and the\nnext--no success--and so on till the reverberations of the knocking were\nlost in the distance down the hall, and I fell asleep again. They called\nme at twelve to take another early train, but I said I was not the one\nagain, and asked as a favor that they would be particular to call the\nrest next time, but never mind me. However, they could not understand my\nEnglish; they only said something in reply to signify that, and then\nwent on banging up the boarders, none of whom desired to take the early\ntrain.\n\nWhen they called me at one, it made my rest seem very broken, and I said\nif they would skip me at two I would call myself--not really intending\nto do it, but hoping to beguile the porter and deceive him. He probably\nsuspected that and was afraid to trust me, because when he made his\nrounds at that hour he did not take any chances on me, but routed me out\nalong with the others. I got some more sleep after that, but when the\nporter called me at three I felt depressed and jaded and greatly\ndiscouraged. So I gave it up and dressed myself. The porter got me a cup\nof coffee and kept me awake while I drank it. He was a good,\nwell-meaning sort of Flounder, but really a drawback to the hotel, I\nshould think.\n\nPoor Mr. Blank came in then, looking worn and old. He had been called\nfor all the different trains, too, just as I had. He said it was a good\nenough hotel, but they took too much pains. While we sat there talking\nwe fell asleep and were called again at four. Then we went out and dozed\nabout town till six, and then drifted aboard the _Lively_.\n\nShe was trim and bright, and clean and smart; she was as handsome as a\npicture. The sailors were in brand-new man-of-war costume, and plenty of\nofficers were about the decks in the state uniform of the\nservice--cocked hats, huge epaulettes, claw-hammer coats lined with\nwhite silk--hats and coats and trousers all splendid with gold lace. I\njudged that these were all admirals, and so got afraid and went ashore\nagain. Our vessel was to carry the Shah\u2019s brother, also the Grand\nVizier, several Persian princes, who were uncles to the Shah, and other\ndignitaries of more or less consequence. A vessel alongside was to carry\nthe luggage, and a vessel just ahead (the _Vigilant_) was to carry\nnobody but just the Shah and certain Ministers of State and servants and\nthe Queen\u2019s special ambassador, Sir Henry Rawlinson, who is a Persian\nscholar and talks to the Shah in his own tongue.\n\nI was very glad, for several reasons, to find that I was not to go in\nthe same ship with the Shah. First, with him not immediately under my\neye I would feel less responsibility for him; and, secondly, as I was\nanxious to impress him, I wanted to practice on his brother first.\n\n                          THE SHAH\u2019S QUARTERS\n\nOn the afterdeck of the _Vigilant_--very handsome ship--a temporary\ncabin had been constructed for the sole and special use of the Shah,\ntemporary but charmingly substantial and graceful and pretty. It was\nabout thirty feet long and twelve wide, beautifully gilded, decorated\nand painted within and without. Among its colors was a shade of light\ngreen, which reminds me of an anecdote about the Persian party, which I\nwill speak of in to-morrow\u2019s letter.\n\nIt was getting along toward the time for the Shah to arrive from\nBrussels, so I ranged up alongside my own ship. I do not know when I\never felt so ill at ease and undecided. It was a sealed letter which I\nhad brought from the Admiralty, and I could not guess what the purport\nof it might be. I supposed I was intended to command the ship--that is,\nI had supposed it at first, but, after seeing all those splendid\nofficers, I had discarded that idea. I cogitated a good deal, but to no\npurpose. Presently a regiment of Belgian troops arrived and formed in\nline along the pier. Then a number of people began to spread down\ncarpets for fifty yards along the pier, by the railway track, and other\ncarpets were laid from these to the ships. The gangway leading on board\nmy ship was now carpeted and its railings were draped with\nbright-colored signal flags. It began to look as if I was expected; so I\nwalked on board. A sailor immediately ran and stopped me, and made\nanother sailor bring a mop for me to wipe my feet on, lest I might soil\nthe deck, which was wonderfully clean and nice. Evidently I was not the\nperson expected, after all. I pointed to the group of officers and asked\nthe sailor what the naval law would do to a man if he were to go and\nspeak to some of those admirals--for there was an awful air of etiquette\nand punctilio about the premises; but just then one of those officers\ncame forward and said that if his instinct was correct an Admiralty\norder had been received giving me a passage in the ship; and he also\nsaid that he was the first lieutenant, and that I was very welcome and\nhe would take pains to make me feel at home, and furthermore there was\nchampagne and soda waiting down below; and furthermore still, all the\nLondon correspondents, to the number of six or seven, would arrive from\nBrussels with the Shah, and would go in our ship, and if our passage\nwere not a lively one, and a jolly and enjoyable one, it would be a very\nstrange thing indeed. I could have jumped for joy if I had not been\nafraid of breaking some rule of naval etiquette and getting hanged for\nit.\n\nNow the train was signaled, and everybody got ready for the great event.\nThe Belgian regiment straightened itself up, and some two hundred\nFlounders arrived and took conspicuous position on a little mound. I was\na little afraid that this would impress the Shah; but I was soon\noccupied with other interests. The train of thirteen cars came tearing\nin, and stopped abreast the ships. Music and guns began an uproar.\nOdd-looking Persian faces and felt hats (brimless stovepipes) appeared\nat the car windows.\n\nSome gorgeous English officials fled down the carpet from the\n_Vigilant_. They stopped at a long car with the royal arms upon it,\nuncovered their heads, and unlocked the car door. Then the Shah stood up\nin it and gave us a good view. He was a handsome, strong-featured man,\nwith a rather European fairness of complexion; had a mustache, wore\nspectacles, seemed of a good height and graceful build and carriage, and\nlooked about forty or a shade less. He was very simply dressed--brimless\nstovepipe and close-buttoned dark-green military suit, without ornament.\nNo, not wholly without ornament, for he had a band two inches wide worn\nover his shoulder and down across his breast, scarf fashion, which band\nwas one solid glory of fine diamonds.\n\nA Persian official appeared in the Shah\u2019s rear and enveloped him in an\nample quilt--or cloak, if you please--which was lined with fur. The\noutside of it was of a whitish color and elaborately needle-worked in\nPersian patterns like an India shawl. The Shah stepped out and the\nofficial procession formed about him and marched him down the carpet and\non board the _Vigilant_ to slow music. Not a Flounder raised a cheer.\nAll the small fry swarmed out of the train now.\n\nThe Shah walked back alongside his fine cabin, looking at the assemblage\nof silent, solemn Flounders; the correspondent of the London _Telegraph_\nwas hurrying along the pier and took off his hat and bowed to the \u201cKing\nof Kings,\u201d and the King of Kings gave a polite military salute in\nreturn. This was the commencement of the excitement. The success of the\nbreathless _Telegraph_ man made all the other London correspondents mad,\nevery man of whom flourished his stovepipe recklessly and cheered\nlustily, some of the more enthusiastic varying the exercise by lowering\ntheir heads and elevating their coat tails. Seeing all this, and feeling\nthat if I was to \u201cimpress the Shah\u201d at all, now was my time, I ventured\na little squeaky yell, quite distinct from the other shouts, but just as\nhearty. His Shahship heard and saw and saluted me in a manner that was,\nI considered, an acknowledgment of my superior importance. I do not know\nthat I ever felt so ostentatious and absurd before. All the\ncorrespondents came aboard, and then the Persian baggage came also, and\nwas carried across to the ship alongside of ours. When she could hold no\nmore we took somewhere about a hundred trunks and boxes on board our\nvessel. Two boxes fell into the water, and several sailors jumped in and\nsaved one, but the other was lost. However, it probably contained\nnothing but a few hundred pounds of diamonds and things.\n\nAt last we got under way and steamed out through a long slip, the piers\non either side being crowded with Flounders; but never a cheer. A\nbattery of three guns on the starboard pier boomed a royal salute, and\nwe swept out to sea, the _Vigilant_ in the lead, we right in her wake,\nand the baggage ship in ours. Within fifteen minutes everybody was well\nacquainted; a general jollification set in, and I was thoroughly glad I\nhad come over to fetch the Shah.\n\n                                   II\n             MARK TWAIN EXECUTES HIS CONTRACT AND DELIVERS\n                           THE SHAH IN LONDON\n\n                        LONDON, _June 19, 1873_.\n\n                          SOME PERSIAN FINERY\n\nLeaving Ostend, we went out to sea under a clear sky and upon smooth\nwater--so smooth, indeed, that its surface was scarcely rippled. I say\nthe sky was clear, and so it was, clear and sunny; but a rich haze lay\nupon the water in the distance--a soft, mellow mist, through which a\nscattering sail or two loomed vaguely. One may call such a morning\nperfect.\n\nThe corps of correspondents were well jaded with their railway journey,\nbut after champagne and soda downstairs with the officers, everybody\ncame up refreshed and cheery and exceedingly well acquainted all around.\nThe Persian grandees had meantime taken up a position in a glass house\non the afterdeck, and were sipping coffee in a grave, Oriental way. They\nall had much lighter complexions and a more European cast of features\nthan I was prepared for, and several of them were exceedingly handsome,\nfine-looking men.\n\nThey all sat in a circle on a sofa (the deckhouse being circular), and\nthey made a right gaudy spectacle. Their breasts were completely crusted\nwith gold bullion embroidery of a pattern resembling frayed and\ninterlacing ferns, and they had large jeweled ornaments on their breasts\nalso. The Grand Vizier came out to have a look around. In addition to\nthe sumptuous gold fernery on his breast he wore a jeweled star as large\nas the palm of my hand, and about his neck hung the Shah\u2019s miniature,\nreposing in a bed of diamonds, that gleamed and flashed in a wonderful\nway when touched by the sunlight. It was said that to receive the Shah\u2019s\nportrait from the Shah was the highest compliment that could be\nconferred upon a Persian subject. I did not care so much about the\ndiamonds, but I would have liked to have the portrait very much. The\nGrand Vizier\u2019s sword hilt and the whole back of the sheath from end to\nend were composed of a neat and simple combination of some twelve or\nfifteen thousand emeralds and diamonds.\n\n                     \u201cIMPRESSING\u201d A PERSIAN GENERAL\n\nSeveral of the Persians talked French and English. One of them, who was\nsaid to be a general, came up on the bridge where some of us were\nstanding, pointed to a sailor, and asked me if I could tell him what\nthat sailor was doing?\n\nI said he was communicating with the other ships by means of the optical\ntelegraph--that by using the three sticks the whole alphabet could be\nexpressed. I showed him how A, B and C were made, and so forth. Good!\nThis Persian was \u201cimpressed\u201d! He showed it by his eyes, by his gestures,\nby his manifest surprise and delight. I said to myself, if the Shah were\nonly here now, the grand desire of Great Britain could be accomplished.\nThe general immediately called the other grandees and told them about\nthis telegraphic wonder. Then he said:\n\n\u201cNow does everyone on board acquire this knowledge?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, only the officers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this sailor?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is only the signalman. Two or three sailors on board are detailed\nfor this service, and by order and direction of the officers they\ncommunicate with the other ships.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good! very fine! Very great indeed!\u201d\n\nThese men were unquestionably impressed. I got the sailor to bring the\nsignal book, and the matter was fully explained, to their high\nastonishment; also the flag signals, and likewise the lamp signals for\nnight telegraphing. Of course, the idea came into my head, in the first\nplace, to ask one of the officers to conduct this bit of instruction,\nbut I at once dismissed it. I judged that this would all go to the Shah,\nsooner or later. I had come over on purpose to \u201cimpress the Shah,\u201d and I\nwas not going to throw away my opportunity. I wished the Queen had been\nthere; I would have been knighted, sure. You see, they knight people\nhere for all sorts of things--knight them, or put them into the peerage\nand make great personages of them. Now, for instance, a king comes over\nhere on a visit; the Lord Mayor and sheriffs do him becoming honors in\nthe city, and straightway the former is created a baronet and the latter\nare knighted. When the Prince of Wales recovered from his illness one of\nhis chief physicians was made a baronet and the other was knighted.\nCharles II made duchesses of one or two female acquaintances of his for\nsomething or other--I have forgotten now what it was. A London\nshoe-maker\u2019s apprentice became a great soldier--indeed, a\nWellington--won prodigious victories in many climes and covered the\nBritish arms with glory all through a long life; and when he was 187\nyears old they knighted him and made him Constable of the Tower. But he\ndied next year and they buried him in Westminster Abbey. There is no\ntelling what that man might have become if he had lived. So you see what\na chance I had; for I have no doubt in the world that I have been the\nhumble instrument, under Providence, of \u201cimpressing the Shah.\u201d And I\nreally believe that if the Queen comes to hear of it I shall be made a\nduke.\n\nFriends intending to write will not need to be reminded that a duke is\naddressed as \u201cYour Grace\u201d; it is considered a great offense to leave\nthat off.\n\n                     A PICTURESQUE NAVAL SPECTACLE\n\nWhen we were a mile or so out from Ostend conversation ceased, an\nexpectant look came into all faces, and opera glasses began to stand out\nfrom above all noses. This impressive hush lasted a few minutes, and\nthen some one said:\n\n\u201cThere they are!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cAway yonder ahead--straight ahead.\u201d\n\nWhich was true. Three huge shapes smothered in the haze--the _Vanguard_,\nthe _Audacious_, and the _Devastation_--all great ironclads. They were\nto do escort duty. The officers and correspondents gathered on the\nforecastle and waited for the next act. A red spout of fire issued from\nthe _Vanguard\u2019s_ side, another flashed from the _Audacious_. Beautiful\nthese red tongues were against the dark haze. Then there was a long\npause--ever so long a pause and not a sound, not the suspicion of a\nsound; and now, out of the stillness, came a deep, solemn \u201cboom! boom!\u201d\nIt had not occurred to me that at so great a distance I would not hear\nthe report as soon as I saw the flash. The two crimson jets were very\nbeautiful, but not more so than the rolling volumes of white smoke that\nplunged after them, rested a moment over the water, and then went\nwreathing and curling up among the webbed rigging and the tall masts,\nand left only glimpses of these things visible, high up in the air,\nprojecting as if from a fog.\n\nNow the flashes came thick and fast from the black sides of both\nvessels. The muffled thunders of the guns mingled together in one\ncontinued roll, the two ships were lost to sight, and in their places\ntwo mountains of tumbled smoke rested upon the motionless water, their\nbases in the hazy twilight and their summits shining in the sun. It was\ngood to be there and see so fine a spectacle as that.\n\n                            THE NAVAL SALUTE\n\nWe closed up fast upon the ironclads. They fell apart to let our\nflotilla come between, and as the _Vigilant_ ranged up the rigging of\nthe ironclads was manned to salute the Shah. And, indeed, that was\nsomething to see. The shrouds, from the decks clear to the trucks, away\nup toward the sky, were black with men. On the lower rounds of these\nrope ladders they stood five abreast, holding each other\u2019s hands, and so\nthe tapering shrouds formed attenuated pyramids of humanity, six\npyramids of them towering into the upper air, and clear up on the top of\neach dizzy mast stood a little creature like a clothes pin--a mere black\npeg against the sky--and that mite was a sailor waving a flag like a\npostage stamp. All at once the pyramids of men burst into a cheer, and\nfollowed it with two more, given with a will; and if the Shah was not\nimpressed he must be the offspring of a mummy.\n\nAnd just at this moment, while we all stood there gazing---\n\nHowever breakfast was announced and I did not wait to see.\n\n                     THE THIRTY-FOUR-TON GUNS SPEAK\n\nIf there is one thing that is pleasanter than another it is to take\nbreakfast in the wardroom with a dozen naval officers. Of course, that\nawe-inspiring monarch, the captain, is aft, keeping frozen state with\nthe Grand Viziers when there are any on board, and so there is nobody in\nthe wardroom to maintain naval etiquette. As a consequence none is\nmaintained. One officer, in a splendid uniform, snatches a champagne\nbottle from a steward and opens it himself; another keeps the servants\nmoving; another opens soda; everybody eats, drinks, shouts, laughs in\nthe most unconstrained way, and it does seem a pity that ever the thing\nshould come to an end. No individual present seemed sorry he was not in\nthe ship with the Shah. When the festivities had been going on about an\nhour, some tremendous booming was heard outside. Now here was a question\nbetween duty and broiled chicken. What might that booming mean? Anguish\nsat upon the faces of the correspondents. I watched to see what they\nwould do, and the precious moments were flying. Somebody cried down a\ncompanionway:\n\n\u201cThe _Devastation_ is saluting!\u201d\n\nThe correspondents tumbled over one another, over chairs, over\neverything in their frenzy to get on deck, and the last gun reverberated\nas the last heel disappeared on the stairs. The _Devastation_, the pride\nof England, the mightiest war vessel afloat, carrying guns that outweigh\nany metal in any service, it is said (thirty-five tons each), and these\nboys had missed that spectacle--at least I knew that some of them had. I\ndid not go. Age has taught me wisdom. If a spectacle is going to be\nparticularly imposing I prefer to see it through somebody else\u2019s eyes,\nbecause that man will always exaggerate. Then I can exaggerate his\nexaggeration, and my account of the thing will be the most impressive.\n\nBut I felt that I had missed my figure this time, because I was not sure\nwhich of these gentlemen reached the deck in time for a glimpse and\nwhich didn\u2019t. And this morning I cannot tell by the London papers. They\nall have imposing descriptions of that thing, and no one of them\nresembles another. Mr. X\u2019s is perhaps the finest, but he was singing a\nsong about \u201cSpring, Spring, Gentle Spring,\u201d all through the bombardment,\nand was overexcited, I fear.\n\nThe next best was Mr. Y\u2019s; but he was telling about how he took a\nRussian battery, along with another man, during the Crimean War, and he\nwas not fairly through the story till the salute was over, though I\nremember he went up and saw the smoke. I will not frame a description of\nthe _Devastation\u2019s_ salute, for I have no material that I can feel sure\nis reliable.\n\n                      THE GRAND SPECTACULAR CLIMAX\n\nWhen we first sailed away from Ostend I found myself in a dilemma; I had\nno notebook. But \u201cany port in a storm,\u201d as the sailors say. I found a\nfair, full pack of ordinary playing cards in my overcoat pocket--one\nalways likes to have something along to amuse children with--and really\nthey proved excellent to take notes on, although bystanders were a bit\ninclined to poke fun at them and ask facetious questions. But I was\ncontent; I made all the notes I needed. The aces and low \u201cspot\u201d cards\nare very good indeed to write memoranda on, but I will not recommend the\nKings and Jacks.\n\n                         SPEAKING BY THE CARDS\n\nReferring to the seven of hearts, I find that this naval exhibition and\njourney from Ostend to Dover is going to cost the government \u00a3500,000.\nGot it from a correspondent. It is a round sum.\n\nReferring to the ace of diamonds, I find that along in the afternoon we\nsighted a fresh fleet of men-of-war coming to meet us. The rest of the\ndiamonds, down to the eight spot (nines and tens are no good for notes)\nare taken up with details of that spectacle. Most of the clubs and\nhearts refer to matters immediately following that, but I really can\nhardly do anything with them because I have forgotten what was trumps.\n\n                             THE SPECTACLE\n\nBut never mind. The sea scene grew little by little, until presently it\nwas very imposing. We drew up into the midst of a waiting host of\nvessels. Enormous five-masted men-of-war, great turret ships, steam\npackets, pleasure yachts--every sort of craft, indeed--the sea was thick\nwith them; the yards and riggings of the warships loaded with men, the\npackets crowded with people, the pleasure ships rainbowed with brilliant\nflags all over and over--some with flags strung thick on lines\nstretching from bowsprit to foremast, thence to mainmast, thence to\nmizzenmast, and thence to stern. All the ships were in motion--gliding\nhither and thither, in and out, mingling and parting--a bewildering\nwhirl of flash and color. Our leader, the vast, black, ugly, but very\nformidable _Devastation_, plowed straight through the gay throng, our\nShah-ships following, the lines of big men-of-war saluting, the booming\nof the guns drowning the cheering, stately islands of smoke towering\neverywhere. And so, in this condition of unspeakable grandeur, we swept\ninto the harbor of Dover, and saw the English princes and the long ranks\nof red-coated soldiers waiting on the pier, civilian multitudes behind\nthem, the lofty hill front by the castle swarming with spectators, and\nthere was the crash of cannon and a general hurrah all through the air.\nIt was rather a contrast to silent Ostend and the unimpressible\nFlanders.\n\n                      THE SHAH \u201cIMPRESSED\u201d AT LAST\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Arthur received the Shah in state, and\nthen all of us--princes, Shahs, ambassadors, Grand Viziers and newspaper\ncorrespondents--climbed aboard the train and started off to London just\nlike so many brothers.\n\nFrom Dover to London it was a sight to see. Seventy miles of human\nbeings in a jam--the gaps were not worth mentioning--and every man,\nwoman, and child waving hat or handkerchief and cheering. I\nwondered--could not tell--could not be sure--could only wonder--would\nthis \u201cimpress the Shah\u201d? I would have given anything to know. But--well,\nit ought--but--still one could not tell.\n\nAnd by and by we burst into the London Railway station--a very large\nstation it is--and found it wonderfully decorated and all the\nneighboring streets packed with cheering citizens. Would this impress\nthe Shah? I--I--well, I could not yet feel certain.\n\nThe Prince of Wales received the Shah--ah, you should have seen how\ngorgeously the Shah was dressed now--he was like the sun in a total\neclipse of rainbows--yes, the Prince received him, put him in a grand\nopen carriage, got in and made him sit over further and not \u201ccrowd,\u201d the\ncarriage clattered out of the station, all London fell apart on either\nside and lifted a perfectly national cheer, and just at that instant the\nbottom fell out of the sky and forty deluges came pouring down at once!\n\nThe great strain was over, the crushing suspense at an end. I said,\n\u201cThank God, this will impress the Shah.\u201d\n\nNow came the long files of Horse Guards in silver armor. We took the\ngreat Persian to Buckingham Palace. I never stirred till I saw the gates\nopen and close upon him with my own eyes and knew he was there. Then I\nsaid:\n\n\u201cEngland, here is your Shah; take him and be happy, but don\u2019t ever ask\nme to fetch over another one.\u201d\n\nThis contract has been pretty straining on me.\n\n                                  III\n                       THE SHAH AS A SOCIAL STAR\n\n                        LONDON, _June 21, 1873_.\n\n\nAfter delivering the Shah at the gates of that unsightly pile of dreary\ngrandeur known as Buckingham Palace I cast all responsibility for him\naside for the time being, and experienced a sense of relief and likewise\nan honest pride in my success, such as no man can feel who has not had a\nShah at nurse (so to speak) for three days.\n\nIt is said by those who ought to know that when Buckingham Palace was\nbeing fitted up as a home for the Shah one of the chief rooms was\nadorned with a rich carpet which had been designed and manufactured\nespecially to charm the eye of His Majesty. The story goes on to say\nthat a couple of the Persian suite came here a week ago to see that all\nthings were in readiness and nothing overlooked, and that when they\nreached that particular room and glanced at the lovely combination of\ngreen figures and white ones in that carpet they gathered their robes\ncarefully up about their knees and then went elaborately tiptoeing about\nthe floor with the aspect and anxiety of a couple of cats hunting for\ndry ground in a wet country, and they stepped only on the white figures\nand almost fainted whenever they came near touching a green one. It is\nsaid that the explanation is that these visiting Persians are all\nMohammedans, and green being a color sacred to the descendants of the\nProphet, and none of these people being so descended, it would be\ndreadful profanation for them to defile the holy color with their feet.\nAnd the general result of it all was that carpet had to be taken up and\nis a dead loss.\n\nMan is a singular sort of human being, after all, and his religion does\nnot always adorn him. Now, our religion is the right one, and has fewer\nodd and striking features than any other; and yet my ancestors used to\nroast Catholics and witches and warm their hands by the fire; but they\nwould be blanched with horror at the bare thought of breaking the\nSabbath, and here is a Persian monarch who never sees any impropriety in\nchopping a subject\u2019s head off for the mere misdemeanor of calling him\ntoo early for breakfast, and yet would be consumed with pious remorse if\nunheeding foot were to chance to step upon anything so green as you or\nI, my reader.\n\nOriental peoples say that women have no souls to save and, almost\nwithout my memory, many American Protestants said the same of babies. I\nthought there was a wide gulf between the Persians and ourselves, but I\nbegin to feel that they are really our brothers after all.\n\nAfter a day\u2019s rest the Shah went to Windsor Castle and called on the\nQueen. What that suggests to the reader\u2019s mind is this:--That the Shah\ntook a hand satchel and an umbrella, called a cab and said he wanted to\ngo to the Paddington station; that when he arrived there the driver\ncharged him sixpence too much, and he paid it rather than have trouble;\nthat he tried now to buy a ticket, and was answered by a ticket seller\nas surly as a hotel clerk that he was not selling tickets for that train\nyet; that he finally got his ticket, and was beguiled of his satchel by\na railway porter at once, who put it into a first-class carriage and got\na sixpence, which the company forbids him to receive; that presently\nwhen the guard (or conductor) of the train came along the Shah slipped a\nshilling into his hand and said he wanted to smoke, and straightway the\nguard signified that it was all right; that when the Shah arrived at\nWindsor Castle he rang the bell, and when the girl came to the door\nasked her if the Queen was at home, and she left him standing in the\nhall and went to see; that by and by she returned and said would he\nplease sit down in the front room and Mrs. Guelph would be down\ndirectly; that he hung his hat on the hatrack, stood his umbrella up in\nthe corner, entered the front room and sat down on a haircloth chair;\nthat he waited and waited and got tired; that he got up and examined the\nold piano, the depressing lithographs on the walls and the album of\nphotographs of faded country relatives on the center table, and was just\nabout to fall back on the family Bible when the Queen entered briskly\nand begged him to sit down and apologized for keeping him waiting, but\nshe had just got a new girl and everything was upside down, and so forth\nand so on; but how are the family, and when did he arrive, and how long\nshould he stay and why didn\u2019t he bring his wife. I knew that that was\nthe picture which would spring up in the American reader\u2019s mind when it\nwas said the Shah went to visit the Queen, because that was the picture\nwhich the announcement suggested to my own mind.\n\nBut it was far from the facts, very far. Nothing could be farther. In\ntruth, these people made as much of a to do over a mere friendly call as\nanybody else would over a conflagration. There were special railway\ntrains for the occasion; there was a general muster of princes and dukes\nto go along, each one occupying room 40; there were regiments of cavalry\nto clear the way; railway stations were turned into flower gardens,\nsheltered with flags and all manner of gaudy splendor; there were\nmultitudes of people to look on over the heads of interminable ranks of\npolicemen standing shoulder to shoulder and facing front; there was\nbraying of music and booming of cannon. All that fuss, in sober truth,\nover a mere off-hand friendly call. Imagine what it would have been if\nhe had brought another shirt and was going to stay a month.\n\n                            AT THE GUILDHALL\n\nTruly, I am like to suffocate with astonishment at the things that are\ngoing on around me here. It is all odd, it is all queer enough, I can\ntell you; but last night\u2019s work transcends anything I ever heard of in\nthe way of--well, how shall I express it? how can I word it? I find it\nawkward to get at it. But to say it in a word--and it is a true one,\ntoo, as hundreds and hundreds of people will testify--last night the\nCorporation of the City of London, with a simplicity and ignorance which\nalmost rise to sublimity, actually gave a ball to a Shah who does not\ndance. If I would allow myself to laugh at a cruel mistake, this would\nstart me. It is the oddest thing that has happened since I have had\ncharge of the Shah. There is some excuse for it in the fact that the\nAldermen of London are simply great and opulent merchants, and cannot be\nexpected to know much about the ways of high life--but then they could\nhave asked some of us who have been with the Shah.\n\nThe ball was a marvel in its way. The historical Guildhall was a scene\nof great magnificence. There was a high dais at one end, on which were\nthree state chairs under a sumptuous canopy; upon the middle one sat the\nShah, who was almost a Chicago conflagration of precious stones and gold\nbullion lace. Among other gems upon his breast were a number of emeralds\nof marvelous size, and from a loop hung an historical diamond of great\nsize and wonderful beauty. On the right of the Shah sat the Princess of\nWales, and on his left the wife of the Crown Prince of Russia. Grouped\nabout the three stood a full jury of minor princes, princesses, and\nambassadors hailing from many countries.\n\n                            THE TWO CORRALS\n\nThe immense hall was divided in the middle by a red rope. The Shah\u2019s\ndivision was sacred to blue blood, and there was breathing room there;\nbut the other corral was but a crush of struggling and perspiring\nhumanity. The place was brilliant with gas and was a rare spectacle in\nthe matter of splendid costumes and rich coloring. The lofty\nstained-glass windows, pictured with celebrated episodes in the history\nof the ancient city, were lighted from the outside, and one may imagine\nthe beauty of the effect. The great giants, Gog and Magog (whose origin\nand history, curiously enough, are unknown even to tradition), looked\ndown from the lofty gallery, but made no observation. Down the long\nsides of the hall, with but brief spaces between, were imposing groups\nof marble statuary; and, contrasted with the masses of life and color\nabout them, they made a picturesque effect. The groups were statues (in\nvarious attitudes) of the Duke of Wellington. I do not say this\nknowingly, but only supposingly; but I never have seen a statue in\nEngland yet that represented anybody but the Duke of Wellington, and, as\nfor the streets and terraces and courts and squares that are named after\nhim or after selections from his 797 titles, they are simply beyond the\ngrasp of arithmetic. This reminds me that, having named everything after\nWellington that there was left to name in England (even down to\nWellington boots), our British brothers, still unsatisfied, still\noppressed with adulation, blandly crossed over and named our Californian\nbig trees Wellington, and put it in Latin at that. They did that, calmly\nignoring the fact that we, the discoverers and owners of the trees, had\nlong ago named them after a larger man. However, if the ghost of\nWellington enjoys such a proceeding, possibly the ghost of Washington\nwill not greatly trouble itself about the matter. But what really\ndisturbs me is that, while Wellington is justly still in the fashion\nhere, Washington is fading out of the fashion with us. It is not a good\nsign. The idols we have raised in his stead are not to our honor.\n\nSome little dancing was done in the sacred corral in front of the Shah\nby grandees belonging mainly to \u201cgrace-of-God\u201d families, but he himself\nnever agitated a foot. The several thousand commoner people on the other\nside of the rope could not dance any more than sardines in a box.\nChances to view the Guildhall spectacle were so hungered for that people\noffered \u00a35 for the privilege of standing three minutes in the musicians\u2019\ngallery and were refused. I cannot convey to you an idea of the\ninordinate desire which prevails here to see the Shah better than by\nremarking that speculators who held four-seat opera boxes at Covent\nGarden Theater to-night were able to get $250 for them. Had all the\nseats been sold at auction the opera this evening would have produced\nnot less than one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars in gold! I am\nbelow the figures rather than above them. The greatest house (for money)\nthat America ever saw was gathered together upon the occasion of Jenny\nLind\u2019s first concert at Castle Garden. The seats were sold at auction\nand produced something over twenty thousand dollars.\n\nI am by no means trying to describe the Guildhall affair of last night.\nSuch a crush of titled swells; such a bewildering array of jeweled\nuniforms and brilliant feminine costumes; such solemn and awful\nreception ceremonies in the library; such grim and stately imposing\naddresses and Persian replies; such imposing processional pageantry\nlater on; such depressing dancing before the apathetic Shah; such ornate\ntables and imperial good cheer at the banquet--it makes a body tired to\nmerely think of trying to put all that on paper. Perhaps you, sir, will\nbe good enough to imagine it, and thus save one who respects you and\nhonors you five columns of solid writing.\n\n              THE LUNATIC ASYLUM IS BLESSED WITH A GLIMPSE\n\nAs regards the momentous occasion of the opera, this evening, I found\nmyself in a grievous predicament, for a republican. The tickets were all\nsold long ago, so I must either go as a member of the royal family or\nnot at all. After a good deal of reflection it seemed best not to mix up\nwith that class lest a political significance might be put upon it. But\na queer arrangement had been devised whereby I might have a glimpse of\nthe show, and I took advantage of that. There is an immense barn-like\nglass house attached to the rear of the theater, and that was fitted up\nwith seats, carpets, mirrors, gas, columns, flowers, garlands, and a\nmeager row of shrubs strung down the sides on brackets--to create an\nimposing forest effect, I suppose. The place would seat ten or twelve\nhundred people. All but a hundred paid a dollar and a quarter a\nseat--for what? To look at the Shah three quarters of a minute, while he\nwalked through to enter the theater. The remaining hundred paid $11 a\nseat for the same privilege, with the added luxury of rushing on the\nstage and glancing at the opera audience for one single minute\nafterward, while the chorus sung \u201cGod Save the Queen!\u201d We are all gone\nmad, I do believe. Eleven hundred five-shilling lunatics and a hundred\ntwo-guinea maniacs. The _Herald_ purchased a ticket and created me one\nof the latter, along with two or three more of the staff.\n\nOur cab was about No. 17,342 in the string that worked its slow way\nthrough London and past the theater. The Shah was not to come till nine\no\u2019clock, and yet we had to be at the theater by half past six, or we\nwould not get into the glass house at all, they said. We were there on\ntime, and seated in a small gallery which overlooked a very brilliantly\ndressed throng of people. Every seat was occupied. We sat there two\nhours and a half gazing and melting. The wide, red-carpeted central\naisle below offered good display ground for officials in fine uniforms,\nand they made good use of it.\n\n                            ROYALTY ARRIVES\n\nBy and by a band in showy uniform came in and stood opposite the\nentrance. At the end of a tedious interval of waiting trumpets sounded\noutside, there was some shouting, the band played half of \u201cGod Save the\nQueen,\u201d and then the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and a dozen gorgeous\nPersian officials entered. After a little the young Prince Arthur came,\nin a blue uniform, with a whole broadside of gold and silver medals on\nhis breast--for good behavior, punctuality, accurate spelling,\npenmanship, etc., I suppose, but I could not see the inscriptions. The\nband gave him some bars of \u201cGod Save the Queen,\u201d too, while he stood\nunder us talking, with altogether unroyal animation, with the\nPersians--the crowd of people staring hungrily at him the while--country\ncousins, maybe, who will go home and say, \u201cI was as close to him as I am\nto that chair this minute.\u201d\n\nThen came the Duke of Teck and the Princess Mary, and the band\nGod-Save-the-Queen\u2019d them also. Now came the Prince of Wales and the\nRussian Tsarina--the royal anthem again, with an extra blast at the end\nof it. After them came a young, handsome, mighty giant, in showy\nuniform, his breast covered with glittering orders, and a general\u2019s\nchapeau, with a flowing white plume, in his hand--the heir to all the\nthrone of all the Russias. The band greeted him with the Russian\nnational anthem, and played it clear through. And they did right; for\nperhaps it is not risking too much to say that this is the only national\nair in existence that is really worthy of a great nation.\n\nAnd at last came the long-expected millennium himself, His Imperial\nMajesty the Shah, with the charming Princess of Wales on his arm. He had\nall his jewels on, and his diamond shaving brush in his hat front. He\nshone like a window with the westering sun on it.\n\n                          WHAT THE ASYLUM SAW\n\nThe small space below us was full now--it could accommodate no more\nroyalty. The august procession filed down the aisle in double rank, the\nShah and the Princess of Wales in the lead, and cheers broke forth and a\nwaving of handkerchiefs as the Princess passed--all said this\ndemonstration was meant for her. As the procession disappeared through\nthe farther door, the hundred eleven-dollar maniacs rushed through a\nsmall aperture, then through an anteroom, and gathered in a flock on the\nstage, the chorus striking up \u201cGod Save the Queen\u201d at the same moment.\n\nWe stood in a mighty bandbox, or a Roman coliseum, with a sea of faces\nstretching far away over the ground floor, and above them rose five\ncurving tiers of gaudy humanity, the dizzy upper tier in the far\ndistance rising sharply up against the roof, like a flower garden trying\nto hold an earthquake down and not succeeding. It was a magnificent\nspectacle, and what with the roaring of the chorus, the waving of\nhandkerchiefs, the cheering of the people, the blazing gas, and the\nawful splendor of the long file of royalty, standing breast to breast in\nthe royal box, it was wonderfully exhilarating, not to say exciting.\n\nThe chorus sang only three-quarters of a minute--one stanza--and down\ncame the huge curtain and shut out the fairyland. And then all those\neleven-dollar people hunted their way out again.\n\n                           A NATION DEMENTED\n\nWe are certainly gone mad. We scarcely look at the young colossus who is\nto reign over 70,000,000 of people and the mightiest empire in extent\nwhich exists to-day. We have no eyes but for this splendid barbarian,\nwho is lord over a few deserts and a modest ten million of\nragamuffins--a man who has never done anything to win our gratitude or\nexcite our admiration, except that he managed to starve a million of his\nsubjects to death in twelve months. If he had starved the rest I suppose\nwe would set up a monument to him now.\n\nThe London theaters are almost absolutely empty these nights. Nobody\ngoes, hardly. The managers are being ruined. The streets for miles are\ncrammed with people waiting whole long hours for a chance glimpse of the\nShah. I never saw any man \u201cdraw\u201d like this one.\n\nIs there any truth in the report that your bureaus are trying to get the\nShah to go over there and lecture? He could get $100,000 a night here\nand choose his own subject.\n\nI know a showman who has got a pill that belonged to him, and which for\nsome reason he did not take. That showman will not take any money for\nthat pill. He is going to travel with it. And let me tell you he will\nget more engagements than he can fill in a year.\n\n                                   IV\n                  MARK TWAIN HOOKS THE PERSIAN OUT OF\n                          THE ENGLISH CHANNEL\n\n                        LONDON, _June 26, 1873_.\n\nI suppose I am the only member of the Shah\u2019s family who is not wholly\nbroken down and worn out; and, to tell the truth, there is not much of\nme left. If you have ever been limited to four days in Paris or Rome or\nJerusalem and been \u201crushed\u201d by a guide you can form a vague, far-away\nsort of conception of what the Shah and the rest of us have endured\nduring these late momentous days. If this goes on we may as well get\nready for the imperial inquest.\n\nWhen I was called at five o\u2019clock the other morning to go to Portsmouth,\nand remembered that the Shah\u2019s incessant movements had left me only\nthree hours\u2019 sleep that night, nothing but a sense of duty drove me\nforth. A cab could not be found, nor a carriage in all London. I lost an\nhour and a half waiting and trying, then started on foot and lost my\nway; consequently I missed one train by a good while, another one by\nthree minutes, and then had more than half an hour to spare before\nanother would go. Most people had had a similar experience, and there\nwas comfort in that. We started at last, and were more than three hours\ngoing seventy-two miles. We stopped at no stations, hardly, but we\nhalted every fifteen minutes out in the woods and fields for no purpose\nthat we could discover. Never was such an opportunity to look at\nscenery. There were five strangers in our car, or carriage, as the\nEnglish call it, and by degrees their English reserve thawed out and\nthey passed around their sherry and sandwiches and grew sociable.\n\nOne of them had met the Russian General of Police in St. Petersburg, and\nfound him a queer old simple-hearted soldier, proud of his past and\ndevoted to his master, the present Tsar, and to the memory of his\npredecessor, Nicholas. The English gentleman gave an instance of the old\nman\u2019s simplicity which one would not expect in a chief of police. The\ngeneral had been visiting London and been greatly impressed by two\nthings there--the admirable police discipline and the museum. It\ntranspired that the museum he referred to was not that mighty collection\nof marvels known to all the world as the British Museum, but Mme.\nToussaud\u2019s Waxworks Show; and in this waxwork show he had seen a figure\nof the Emperor Nicholas. And did it please him? Yes, as to the likeness;\nfor it was a good likeness and a commanding figure; but--\u201c_Mon Dieu!_\ntry to fancy it, m\u2019sieu--dressed in the uniform of a simple colonel of\ninfantry!--the great Nicholas of Russia, my august late master, dressed\nin a colonel\u2019s uniform!\u201d\n\nThe old general could not abide that. He went to the proprietor and\nremonstrated against this wanton indignity. The proprietor was grieved;\nbut it was the only Russian uniform he could get, and----\n\n\u201cSay no more!\u201d said the general. \u201cMay I get you one?\u201d\n\nThe proprietor would be most happy. The general lost not a moment; he\nwrote at once to the Emperor Alexander, describing with anguish the\ndegradation which the late great Nicholas was suffering day by day\nthrough his infamously clothed waxen representative, and imploring His\nMajesty to send suitable raiment for the imperial dummy, and also a\nletter to authenticate the raiment. And out of regard for the old\nservant and respect for his outraged feelings the Emperor of all the\nRussias descended from his Alpine altitude to send to the Toussaud\nwaxwork the general\u2019s uniform worn last by his father, and to write with\nhis own hand an authenticating letter to go with it. So the\nsimple-hearted police chief was happy once more, and never once thought\nof charging the \u201cmuseum\u201d $10,000 for these valuable additions to the\nshow, which he might easily have done, and collected the money, too. How\nlike our own chiefs of police this good old soul is!\n\nAnother of these English gentlemen told an anecdote, which, he said, was\nold, but which I had not heard before. He said that one day St. Peter\nand the devil chanced to be thrown together, and found it pretty dull\ntrying to pass the time. Finally they got to throwing dice for a lawyer.\nThe devil threw sixes. Then St. Peter threw sixes. The devil threw sixes\nagain. St. Peter threw sixes again. The devil threw sixes once more.\nThen St. Peter threw sevens, and the devil said, \u201cOh, come now, Your\nHonor, cheat fair. None of your playing miracles here!\u201d I thought there\nwas a nice bit of humor in that suggestion to \u201ccheat fair.\u201d\n\n                     A SMALL PRIVATE NAUTICAL RACE\n\nI am getting to Portsmouth about as fast in this letter as I did in that\ntrain. The Right Honorable the Mayor of Portsmouth had had a steamer\nplaced at his disposal by the Admiralty, and he had invited the Lord\nMayor of London and other guests to go in her. This was the ship I was\nto sail in, and she was to leave her pier at 9 A.M. sharp. I arrived at\nthat pier at ten minutes to eleven exactly. There was one chance left,\nhowever. The ship had stopped for something and was floating at ease\nabout a mile away.\n\nA rusty, decayed, little two-oared skiff, the size of a bathtub, came\nfloating by, with a fisherman and his wife and child in it. I entreated\nthe man to come in and take me to the ship. Presently he consented and\nstarted toward me. I stood impatient and all ready to jump the moment he\nshould get within thirty yards of me; he halted at the distance of\nthirty-five and said it would be a long pull; did I think I could pay\nhim two shillings for it, seeing it was a holiday? All this palaver and\nI in such a state of mind! I jumped aboard and told him to rush, which\nhe did; at least he threw his whole heart into his little, useless oars,\nand we moved off at the rate of a mile a week. This was solid misery.\nWhen we had gone a hundred and nine feet and were gaining on the tenth a\nlong, trim, graceful man-of-war\u2019s boat came flying by, bound for the\nflagship. Without expecting even the courtesy of a response, I hailed\nand asked the coxswain to take me to the mayor\u2019s vessel. He said,\n\u201cCertainly, sir!--ease her, boys!\u201d I could not have been more astonished\nat anything in the world. I quickly gave my man his two shillings, and\nhe started to pull me to the boat. Then there was a movement of\ndiscontent among the sailors, and they seemed about to move on. I\nthought--well, you are not such generous fellows, after all, as I took\nyou to be, or so polite, either; but just then the coxswain hailed and\nsaid:\n\n\u201cThe boys don\u2019t mind the pull, and they\u2019re perfectly willing to take\nyou, but they say they ain\u2019t willing to take the fisherman\u2019s job away\nfrom him.\u201d\n\nNow that was genuine manliness and right conduct. I shall always\nremember that honorable act. I told them the fisherman was already paid,\nand I was in their boat the next moment. Then ensued the real fun of the\nday, as far as I was personally concerned. The boys glanced over their\nshoulders to measure the distance, and then at the order to \u201cGive way!\u201d\nthey bent to it and the boat sped through the water like an arrow. We\npassed all kinds of craft and steadily shortened the distance that lay\nbetween us and the ship. Presently the coxswain said:\n\n\u201cNo use! Her wheels have begun to turn over. Lively now, lively!\u201d\n\nThen we flew. We watched the ship\u2019s movement with a sharp interest and\ncalculated our chances.\n\n\u201cCan you steer?\u201d said the coxswain.\n\n\u201cCan a duck swim?\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cGood--we\u2019ll make her yet!\u201d\n\nI took the helm and he the stroke oar, and that one oar did appear to\nadd a deal to that boat\u2019s speed. The ship was turning around to go out\nto sea, and she did seem to turn unnecessarily fast, too; but just as\nshe was pointed right and both her wheels began to go ahead our boat\u2019s\nbow touched her companionway and I was aboard. It was a handsome race,\nand very exciting. If I could have had that dainty boat and those eight\nwhite-shirted, blue-trousered sailors for the day I would not have gone\nin any ship, but would have gone about in vast naval style and\nexperienced the feelings of an admiral.\n\n                       OLD HISTORICAL MEN-OF-WAR\n\nOur ship sailed out through a narrow way, bordered by piers that swarmed\nwith people, and likewise by prodigious men-of-war of the fashion of a\nhundred years ago. There were, perhaps, a dozen of the stately veterans,\nthese relics of an historic past; and not looking aged and seedy,\neither, but as bright and fresh as if they had been launched and painted\nyesterday. They were the noblest creatures to look upon; hulls of huge\nproportion and great length; four long tiers of cannon grinning from\ntheir tall sides; vast sterns that towered into the air like the gable\nend of a church; graceful bows and figureheads; masts as trim and lofty\nas spires--surely no spectacle could be so imposing as a sea fight in\nthe old times, when such beautiful and such lordly ships as these ruled\nthe seas. And how it must have stirred the heart of England when a fleet\nof them used to come sailing in from victory, with ruined sides and\ntattered spars and sails, while bells and cannon pealed a welcome!\n\nOne of the grandest of these veterans was the very one upon whose deck\nNelson himself fell in the moment of triumph. I suppose England would\nrather part with ten colonies than with that illustrious old ship. We\npassed along within thirty steps of her, and I was just trying to\npicture in my mind the tremendous scenes that had transpired upon her\ndeck upon that day, the proudest in England\u2019s naval history, when the\nvenerable craft, stirred by the boom of saluting cannon, perhaps, woke\nup out of her long sleep and began to vomit smoke and thunder herself,\nand then she looked her own natural self again, and no doubt the spirit\nof Nelson was near. Still it would have been pleasanter to be on her\ndecks than in front of her guns; for, as the white volumes of smoke\nburst in our faces, one could not help feeling that a ball might by\naccident have got mixed up with a blank cartridge, and might chip just\nenough off the upper end of a man to disfigure him for life; and,\nbesides, the powder they use in cannon is in grains as large as billiard\nchalks, and it does not all explode--suppose a few should enter one\u2019s\nsystem? The crash and roar of these great guns was as unsettling a sound\nas I have ever heard at short range. I took off my hat and acknowledged\nthe salute, of course, though it seemed to me that it would have been\nbetter manners if they had saluted the Lord Mayor, inasmuch as he was on\nboard.\n\n                   THE WORLD\u2019S GREATEST NAVY ON VIEW\n\nWe went out to the Spithead and sailed up and down there for four hours\nthrough four long ranks of stately men-of-war--formidable ironclads they\nwere--the most insignificant of which would make a breakfast of a whole\nfleet of Nelson\u2019s prodigious ships and still be hungry. The show was\nvery fine, for there were forty-nine of the finest ironclads the world\ncan show, and many gunboats besides. Indeed, here in its full strength\nwas the finest navy in the world, and this the only time in history that\njust such a spectacle has been seen, and none who saw it that day is\nlikely to live long enough to see its like again. The vessels were all\ndressed out with flags, and all about them frolicked a bewildering host\nof bannered yachts, steamers, and every imaginable sort of craft. It\nwould be hard to contrive a gayer scene. One of the royal yachts came\nflying along presently and put the Shah on board one of the ironclads,\nand then the yards of the whole fleet were manned simultaneously, and\nsuch another booming and bellowing of great guns ensued as I cannot\npossibly describe. Within two minutes the huge fleet was swallowed up in\nsmoke, with angry red tongues of fire darting through it here and there.\nIt was wonderful to look upon. Every time the _Devastation_ let off one\nof her thirty-five-ton guns it seemed as if an entire London fog issued\nfrom her side, and the report was so long coming that if she were to\nshoot a man he would be dead before he heard it, and would probably go\naround wondering through all eternity what it was that happened to him.\nI returned to London in a great hurry by a train that was in no way\nexcited by it, but failed in the end and object I had in view after all,\nwhich was to go to the grand concert at Albert Hall in honor of the\nShah. I had a strong desire to see that building filled with people\nonce. Albert Hall is one of the many monuments erected to the memory of\nthe late Prince Albert. It is a huge and costly edifice, but the\narchitectural design is old, not to say in some sense a plagiarism; for\nthere is but little originality in putting a dome on a gasometer. It is\nsaid to seat 13,000 people, and surely that is a thing worth seeing--at\nleast to a man who was not at the Boston Jubilee. But no tickets were to\nbe had--every seat was full, they said. It was no particular matter, but\nwhat made me mad was to come so extremely close and then miss. Indeed, I\nwas madder than I can express, to think that if the architect had only\nplanned the place to hold 13,001 I could have got in. But, after all, I\nwas not the only person who had occasion to feel vexed. Colonel X, a\nnoted man in America, bought a seat some days ago for $10 and a little\nafterward met a knowing person who said the Shah would be physically\nworn out before that concert night and would not be there, and\nconsequently nobody else; so the seat was immediately sold for $5. Then\ncame another knowing one, who said the Shah would unquestionably be at\nthe concert, so the colonel went straight and bought his ticket back\nagain. The temporary holder of it only charged him $250 for carrying it\naround for him during the interval! The colonel was at the concert, and\ntook the Shah\u2019s head clerk for the Shah all the evening. Vexation could\ngo no further than that.\n\n                                   V\n                   MARK TWAIN GIVES THE ROYAL PERSIAN\n                              A \u201cSEND-OFF\u201d\n\n                        LONDON, _June 30, 1873_.\n\nFor the present we are done with the Shah in London. He is gone to the\ncountry to be further \u201cimpressed.\u201d After all, it would seem that he was\nmore moved and more genuinely entertained by the military day at Windsor\nthan by even the naval show at Portsmouth. It is not to be wondered at,\nsince he is a good deal of a soldier himself and not much of a sailor.\nIt has been estimated that there were 300,000 people assembled at\nWindsor--some say 500,000. That was a show in itself. The Queen of\nEngland was there; so was Windsor Castle; also an imposing array of\ncavalry, artillery, and infantry. And the accessories to these several\nshows were the matchless rural charms of England--a vast expanse of\ngreen sward, walled in by venerable forest trees, and beyond them\nglimpses of hills clothed in Summer vegetation. Upon such a theater a\nbloodless battle was fought and an honorable victory won by trained\nsoldiers who have not always been carpet knights, but whose banners bear\nthe names of many historic fights.\n\nEngland is now practically done with the Shah. True, his engagement is\nnot yet completed, for he is still billed to perform at one or two\nplaces; but curiosity is becoming sated, and he will hardly draw as good\nhouses as heretofore. Whenever a star has to go to the provinces it is a\nbad sign. The poor man is well nigh worn out with hard work. The other\nday he was to have performed before the Duke of Buccleuch and was\nobliged to send an excuse. Since then he failed of his engagement at the\nBank of England. He does not take rest even when he might. He has a\ntelegraphic apparatus in his apartments in Buckingham Palace, and it is\nsaid that he sits up late, talking with his capital of Persia by\ntelegraph. He is so fascinated with the wonderful contrivance that he\ncannot keep away from it. No doubt it is the only homelike thing the\nexile finds in the hard, practical West, for it is the next of kin to\nthe enchanted carpets that figure in the romance and traditions of his\nown land, and which carry the wanderer whither he will about the earth,\ncircumscribing the globe in the twinkling of an eye, propelled by only\nthe force of an unspoken wish.\n\n                         GOSSIP ABOUT THE SHAH\n\nThis must be a dreary, unsatisfactory country to him, where one\u2019s\ndesires are thwarted at every turn. Last week he woke up at three in the\nmorning and demanded of the Vizier on watch by his bedside that the\nballet dancers be summoned to dance before him. The Vizier prostrated\nhimself upon the floor and said:\n\n\u201cO king of kings, light of the world, source of human peace and\ncontentment, the glory and admiration of the age, turn away thy sublime\ncountenance, let not thy fateful frown wither thy slave; for behold the\ndancers dwell wide asunder in the desert wastes of London, and not in\nmany hours could they be gathered together.\u201d\n\nThe Shah could not even speak, he was so astounded with the novelty of\ngiving a command that could not be obeyed. He sat still a moment,\nsuffering, then wrote in his tablets these words:\n\n\u201cMEM.--Upon arrival in Teheran, let the Vizier have the coffin which has\njust been finished for the late general of the household troops--it will\nsave time.\u201d\n\nHe then got up and set his boots outside the door to be blacked and went\nback to bed, calm and comfortable, making no more to-do about giving\naway that costly coffin than I would about spending a couple of\nshillings.\n\n                       THE LESSON OF HIS JOURNEY\n\nIf the mountains of money spent by civilized Europe in entertaining the\nShah shall win him to adopt some of the mild and merciful ways that\nprevail in Christian realms it will have been money well and wisely laid\nout. If he learns that a throne may rest as firmly upon the affections\nof a people as upon their fears; that charity and justice may go hand in\nhand without detriment to the authority of the sovereign; that an\nenlarged liberty granted to the subject need not impair the power of the\nmonarch; if he learns these things Persia will be the gainer by his\njourney, and the money which Europe has expended in entertaining him\nwill have been profitably invested. That the Shah needs a hint or two in\nthese directions is shown by the language of the following petition,\nwhich has just reached him from certain Parsees residing here and in\nIndia:\n\n                              THE PETITION\n\n  1. A heavy and oppressive poll tax, called the Juzia, is imposed upon\n  the remnant of the ancient Zoroastrian race now residing in Persia. A\n  hundred years ago, when the Zoroastrian population was 30,000\n  families, and comparatively well-to-do, the tax was only 250 toomans;\n  now, when there are scarcely six thousand souls altogether, and\n  stricken with poverty, they have to pay 800 toomans. In addition to\n  the crushing effect of this tax, the government officials oppress\n  these poor people in enforcing the tax.\n\n  2. A Parsee desirous of buying landed property is obliged to pay\n  twenty per cent. on the value of the property as fee to the Kazee and\n  other authorities.\n\n  3. When a Parsee dies any member of his family, no matter however\n  distant, who may have previously been converted to Mohammedanism,\n  claims and obtains the whole property of the deceased, to the\n  exclusion of all the rightful heirs. In enforcing this claim the\n  convert is backed and supported by government functionaries.\n\n  4. When a Parsee returns to Persia from a foreign country he is\n  harassed with all sorts of exactions at the various places he has to\n  pass through in Persia.\n\n  5. When any dispute arises, whether civil or criminal, between a\n  Mohammedan and a Parsee, the officials invariably side with the\n  former, and the testimony of one Mohammedan--no matter how false on\n  its very face--receives more credit than that of a dozen or any number\n  of Parsee witnesses. If a Mohammedan kills a Parsee he is only fined\n  about eight toomans, or four pounds sterling; but on the contrary, if\n  a Parsee wounds or murders a Mohammedan he is not only cut to pieces\n  himself, but all his family and children are put to the sword, and\n  sometimes all the Parsees living in the same street are harassed in a\n  variety of ways. The Parsees are prevented from dressing themselves\n  well and from riding a horse or donkey. No matter, even if he were ill\n  and obliged to ride, he is compelled to dismount in the presence of a\n  Mohammedan rider, and is forced to walk to the place of his\n  destination. The Parsees are not allowed to trade in European\n  articles, nor are they allowed to deal in domestic produce, as\n  grocers, dyers, or oilmen, tailors, dairymen, &c., on the ground that\n  their touch would pollute the articles and supplies and make them\n  unfit for the use of Mohammedans.\n\n  6. The Parsees are often insulted and abused in every way by the\n  Mohammedans, and their children are stolen or forcibly taken away from\n  them by the Mohammedans. These children are concealed in Mohammedan\n  houses, their names are changed, and they are forced to become\n  Mohammedans, and when they refuse to embrace the Mohammedan faith they\n  are maltreated in various ways. When a man is forcibly converted, his\n  wife and family are also forced to join him as Mohammedans. The\n  Mohammedans desecrate the sacred places of worship of the Zoroastrians\n  and the places for the disposal of their dead.\n\n  7. In general the Parsees are heavily taxed in various ways, and are\n  subjected to great oppression. In consequence of such persecution the\n  Parsee population of Persia has, during this century, considerably\n  decreased and is now so small that it consists of a few thousand\n  families only. It is possible that these persecutions are practiced on\n  the Zoroastrian inhabitants of Persia without the knowledge of His\n  Majesty the Shah.\n\n                       THE INGENIOUS BARON REUTER\n\nIt is whispered that the Shah\u2019s European trip was not suggested by the\nShah himself, but by the noted telegraphic newsman, Baron Reuter. People\nwho pretend to know say that Reuter began life very poor; that he was an\nenergetic spirit and improved such opportunities as fell in his way;\nthat he learned several languages, and finally became a European guide,\nor courier, and employed himself in conducting all sorts of foreigners\nthrough all sorts of countries and wearing them out with the usual\nfrantic system of sight-seeing. That was a good education for him; it\nalso gave him an intimate knowledge of all the routes of travel and\ntaught him how certain long ones might be shortened. By and by he got\nsome carrier pigeons and established a news express, which necessarily\nprospered, since it furnished journals and commercial people with all\nmatters of importance considerably in advance of the mails. When\nrailways came into vogue he obtained concessions which enlarged his\nfacilities and still enabled him to defy competition. He was ready for\nthe telegraph and seized that, too; and now for years\n\n                          \u201cREUTER\u2019S TELEGRAMS\u201d\n\nhas stood in brackets at the head of the telegraphic column of all\nEuropean journals. He became rich; he bought telegraph lines and built\nothers, purchased a second-hand German baronetcy, and finally sold out\nhis telegraphic property to his government for $3,000,000 and was out of\nbusiness for once. But he could not stay out.\n\nAfter building himself a sort of a palace, he looked around for fresh\ngame, singled out the Shah of Persia and \u201cwent for him,\u201d as the\nhistorian Josephus phrases it. He got an enormous \u201cconcession\u201d from him\nand then conceived the admirable idea of exhibiting a Shah of Persia in\nthe capitals of Europe and thus advertising his concession before\nneedful capitalists. It was a sublimer idea than any that any showman\u2019s\nbrain has ever given birth to. No Shah had ever voluntarily traveled in\nEurope before; but then no Shah had ever fallen into the hands of a\nEuropean guide before.\n\n                          THE FAT \u201cCONCESSION\u201d\n\nThe baron\u2019s \u201cconcession\u201d is a financial curiosity. It allows him the\nsole right to build railways in Persia for the next seventy years; also\nstreet railroads; gives all the land necessary, free of charge, for\ndouble tracks and fifty or sixty yards on each side; all importations of\n_material_, etc., free of duty; all the baron\u2019s exports free of duty\nalso. The baron may appropriate and work all mines (except those of the\nprecious metals) free of charge, the Shah to have 15 per cent of the\nprofits. Any private mine may be \u201cgobbled\u201d (the Persian word is\n_akbamarish_) by the baron if it has not been worked during five years\npreviously. The baron has the exclusive privilege of making the most of\nall government forests, he giving the Shah 15 per cent of the profits\nfrom the wood sold. After a forest is removed, the baron is to be\npreferred before all other purchasers if he wants to buy the land. The\nbaron alone may dig wells and construct canals, and he is to own all the\nland made productive by such works. The baron is empowered to raise\n$30,000,000 on the capital stock for working purposes, and the Shah\nagrees to pay 7 per cent interest on it; and Persia is wholly\nunencumbered with debt. The Shah hands over to the baron the management\nof his customs for twenty years, and the baron engages to pay for this\nprivilege $100,000 a year more than the Shah now receives, so the baron\nmeans to wake up that sleepy Persian commerce. After the fifth year the\nbaron is to pay the Shah an additional 60 per cent of the profits, if\nhis head is still a portion of his person then. The baron is to have\nfirst preference in the establishment of a bank. The baron has\npreference in establishing gas, road, telegraph, mill, manufacturing,\nforge, pavement, and all such enterprises. The Shah is to have 20 per\ncent of the profits arising from the railways. Finally, the baron may\nsell out whenever he wants to.\n\nIt is a good \u201cconcession\u201d in its way. It seems to make the Shah say:\n\u201cRun Persia at my expense and give me a fifth of the profits.\u201d\n\nOne\u2019s first impulse is to envy the baron; but, after all, I do not know.\nSome day, if things do not go to suit the Shah, he may say, \u201cThere is no\nhead I admire so much as this baron\u2019s; bring it to me on a plate.\u201d\n\n                   DEPARTURE OF THE IMPERIAL CIRCUS.\n\nWe are all sorry to see the Shah leave us, and yet are glad on his\naccount. We have had all the fun and he all the fatigue. He would not\nhave lasted much longer here. I am just here reminded that the only way\nwhereby you may pronounce the Shah\u2019s title correctly is by taking a\npinch of snuff. The result will be \u201ct-Shah!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                      A WONDERFUL PAIR OF SLIPPERS\n\n                (WITH LETTERS CONCERNING THEM FROM MARK\n                      TWAIN AND ELSIE LESLIE LYDE)\n\n                          MARK TWAIN\u2019S LETTER\n\n                                            HARTFORD, _Oct. 5, \u201989_.\n\nDEAR ELSIE: The way of it was this. Away last spring, Gillette[1] and I\npooled intellects on this proposition: to get up a pleasant surprise of\nsome kind for you against your next visit--the surprise to take the form\nof a tasteful and beautiful testimonial of some sort or other, which\nshould express somewhat of the love we felt for you. Together we hit\nupon just the right thing--a pair of slippers. Either one of us could\nhave thought of a single slipper, but it took both of us to think of two\nslippers. In fact, one of us did think of one slipper, and then, quick\nas a flash, the other thought of the other one. It shows how wonderful\nthe human mind is. It is really paleontological; you give one mind a\nbone, and the other one instantly divines the rest of the animal.\n\nGillette embroidered his slipper with astonishing facility and splendor,\nbut I have been a long time pulling through with mine. You see, it was\nmy very first attempt at art, and I couldn\u2019t rightly get the hang of it\nalong at first. And then I was so busy that I couldn\u2019t get a chance to\nwork at it at home, and they wouldn\u2019t let me embroider on the cars; they\nsaid it made the other passengers afraid. They didn\u2019t like the light\nthat flared into my eye when I had an inspiration. And even the most\nfair-minded people doubted me when I explained what it was I was\nmaking--especially brakemen. Brakemen always swore at it, and carried\non, the way ignorant people do, about art. They wouldn\u2019t take my word\nthat it was a slipper; they said they believed it was a snowshoe that\nhad some kind of a disease.\n\nBut I have pulled through, and within twenty-four hours of the time I\ntold you I would--day before yesterday. There ought to be a key to the\ndesigns, but I haven\u2019t had time to get one up. However, if you will lay\nthe work before you with the forecastle pointing north, I will begin at\nthat end and explain the whole thing, layer by layer, so that you can\nunderstand it.\n\nI began with that first red bar, and without ulterior design, or plan of\nany sort--just as I would begin a Prince and Pauper, or any other tale.\nAnd mind you it is the easiest and surest way; because if you invent two\nor three people and turn them loose in your manuscript, something is\nbound to happen to them--you can\u2019t help it; and then it will take you\nthe rest of the book to get them out of the natural consequences of that\noccurrence, and so, first thing you know, there\u2019s your book all finished\nup and never cost you an idea. Well, the red stripe, with a bias stitch,\nnaturally suggested a blue one with a perpendicular stitch, and I\nslammed it in, though when it came daylight I saw it was green--which\ndidn\u2019t make any difference, because green and blue are much the same,\nanyway, and in fact from a purely moral point of view are regarded by\nthe best authorities as identical. Well, if you will notice, a blue\nperpendicular stitch always suggests a ropy red involved stitch, like a\nfamily of angle-worms trying to climb in under each other to keep\nwarm--it would suggest that, every time, without the author of the\nslipper ever having to think about it at all.\n\nNow at that point, young Dr. Root came in, and, of course, he was\ninterested in the slipper right away, because he has always had a\npassion for art himself, but has never had a chance to try, because his\nfolks are opposed to it and superstitious about it, and have done all\nthey could to keep him back; and so he was eager to take a hand and see\nwhat he could do. And it was beautiful to see him sit there and tell\nMrs. Clemens what had been happening while we were off on summer\nvacation, and hold the slipper up toward the end of his nose, and forget\nthe sordid world, and imagine the canvas was a \u201csubject\u201d with a scalp\nwound, and nimbly whirl in that lovely surgical stitch which you see\nthere--and never hesitating a moment in his talk except to say \u201cOuch\u201d\nwhen he stuck himself, and then going right on again as smooth and easy\nas nothing. Yes, it was a charming spectacle. And it was real art,\ntoo--realistic, just native untaught genius; you can see the very scalp\nitself, showing through between the stitches.\n\nWell, next I threw in that sheaf of green rods which the lictors used to\ncarry before the Roman consuls to lick them with when they didn\u2019t\nbehave--they turned blue in the morning, but that is the way green\nalways acts.\n\nThe next week, after a good rest, I snowed in that sea of frothy waves,\nand set that yellow thing afloat in it and those two things that are\nskewered through it. It isn\u2019t a home plate, and it isn\u2019t a papal tiara\nwith the keys of St. Peter; no, it is a heart--my heart--with two arrows\nstuck through it--arrows that go in blue and come out crimson--crimson\nwith the best drops in that heart, and gladly shed for love of you,\ndear.\n\nNow then, as you strike to the south\u2019ard and drift along down the\nstarboard side, abaft the main-to\u2019-gallant scuppers, you come to that\nblue quarter-deck which runs the rest of the way aft to the jumping-off\nplace. In the midst of that blue you will see some big red letters--M.\nT.; and west\u2019ard, over on the port side, you will see some more red\nletters--TO E. L. Aggregated, these several groups of letters signify,\nMark Twain to Elsie Leslie. And you will notice that you have a gift for\nart yourself, for the southern half of the L, embroidered by yourself,\nis as good as anything I can do, after all my experience.\n\nThere, now you understand the whole work. From a professional point of\nview I consider the Heart and Arrows by all odds the greatest triumph\nof the whole thing; in fact, one of the ablest examples of civil\nengineering in a beginner I ever saw--for it was all inspiration, just\nthe lightninglike inspiration of the moment. I couldn\u2019t do it again in\na hundred years--even if I recover this time and get just as well and\nstrong as I was before. You notice what fire there is in it--what\nrapture, enthusiasm, frenzy--what blinding explosions of color. It is\njust a \u201cTurner\u201d--that is what it is. It is just like his \u201cSlave Ship,\u201d\nthat immortal work. What you see in the \u201cSlave Ship\u201d is a terrific\nexplosion of radiating rags and fragments of flaming crimson flying\nfrom a common center of intense yellow which is in violent\ncommotion--insomuch that a Boston reporter said it reminded him of a\nyellow cat dying in a platter of tomatoes.\n\nTake the slippers and wear them next your heart, Elsie dear; for every\nstitch in them is a testimony of the affection which two of your\nloyalest friends bear you. Every single stitch cost us blood. I\u2019ve got\ntwice as many pores in me now as I used to have; and you would never\nbelieve how many places you can stick a needle into yourself until you\ngo into the embroidery line and devote yourself to art.\n\nDo not wear these slippers in public, dear; it would only excite envy;\nand, as like as not, somebody would try to shoot you.\n\nMerely use them to assist you in remembering that among the many, many\npeople who think all the world of you is your friend,\n\n                                                         MARK TWAIN.\n\n\n                             ELSIE\u2019S REPLY.\n\n                                        NEW YORK, _October g, 1889_.\n\nMY DEAR MR. CLEMENS: The slipper the long letter and all the rest came\nthis afternoon, I think they are splendid and shall have them framed and\nkeep them among my very most prechus things. I have had a great many\nnice things given to me and people often say very pleasant things but I\nam not quite shure they always mean it or that they are as trustable as\nyou and \u201cLeo\u201d and I am very shure thay would not spend their prechus\ntime and shed their blood for me so you see that is one reason why I\nwill think so much of it and then it was all so funny to think of two\ngreat big men like you and \u201clittle Willie\u201d (that is what \u201cLeo\u201d calls\nhimself to me) imbroidering a pair of slippers for a little girl like me\nof corse you have a great many large words in your letter that I do not\nquite understand. One word comencing with P. has fifteen letters in it\nand I do not know what you mean by pooled unless you mean you and Leo\nput your two minds together to make the slippers which was very nice of\nyou both I think you are just right about the angle worms thay did look\nlike that this summer when I used to dig them for bate to fish with\nplease tell Dr. Root I will think of him when I look at the part he did\nthe Surgicle Stich I mean I hope you will be quite well and strong by\nthe time you get this letter as you were before you made my slipper it\nwould make me very sad if you were to be ill. Give my love to Mrs.\nClemens Susie Clara Gene I-know and you-know and Vix and all of my\nHartford friends tell Gene I wish I was with her and we would have a\nnice jump in the hay loft. When you come to New York you must call and\nsee me then we will see about those big words my address is up in the\ntop left corner of this letter.\n\n                  To my loyal friend\n                                 Mark Twain\n                             From his little friend\n                                                  ELSIE LESLIE LYDE.\n\n[Not Little Lord Fauntleroy now, but Tom Canty of Offal Court and Little\nEdward of Wales.][2]\n\n-----\n\nFootnote 1:\n\n  William Gillette, the distinguished actor and playwright.\n\nFootnote 2:\n\n  Elsie Leslie, then a little girl, played Little Lord Fauntleroy and\n  the double part of Tom Canty and the Little Prince, with great\n  success.\n\n\n\n\n                        AIX, THE PARADISE OF THE\n                               RHEUMATICS\n               (Contributed to the New York _Sun_, 1891)\n\n\nAix-les-Bains. Certainly this is an enchanting place. It is a strong\nword, but I think the facts justify it. True, there is a rabble of\nnobilities, big and little, here all the time, and often a king or two;\nbut as these behave quite nicely and also keep mainly to themselves,\nthey are little or no annoyance. And then a king makes the best\nadvertisement there is, and the cheapest. All he costs is a reception at\nthe station by the mayor and the police in their Sunday uniforms,\nshop-front decorations along the route from station to hotel, brass band\nat the hotel, fireworks in the evening, free bath in the morning. This\nis the whole expense; and in return for it he goes away from here with\nthe broad of his back metaphorically stenciled over with display ads.,\nwhich shout to all nations of the world, assisted by the telegraph:\n\n  Rheumatism routed at Aix-les-Bains!\n\n  Gout admonished, Nerves braced up!\n\n  All diseases welcomed, and satisfaction given or the money returned at\n  the door!\n\nWe leave nature\u2019s noble cliffs and crags undefiled and uninsulted by the\nadvertiser\u2019s paint brush. We use the back of a king, which is better and\nproperer and more effective, too, for the cliffs stay still and few see\nit, but the king moves across the fields of the world and is visible\nfrom all points, like a constellation. We are out for kings this week,\nbut one will be along soon--possibly His Satanic Majesty of Russia.\nThere\u2019s a colossus for you! A mysterious and terrible form that towers\nup into unsearchable space and casts a shadow across the universe like a\nplanet in eclipse. There will be but one absorbing spectacle in this\nworld when we stencil him and start him out.\n\nThis is an old valley, this of Aix, both in the history of man and in\nthe geological records of its rocks. Its little lake of Bourget carries\nthe human history back to the lake dwellers, furnishing seven groups of\ntheir habitations, and Dr. William Wakefield says in his interesting\nlocal guide that the mountains round about furnish \u201cGeographically, a\nveritable epitome of the globe.\u201d The stratified chapters of the earth\u2019s\nhistory are clearly and permanently written on the sides of the roaring\nbulk of the Dent du Chat, but many of the layers of race, religion, and\ngovernment which in turn have flourished and perished here between the\nlake dweller of several thousand years ago and the French republican of\nto-day, are ill defined and uninforming by comparison. There are several\nvarieties of pagans. They went their way, one after the other, down into\nnight and oblivion, leaving no account of themselves, no memorials. The\nRomans arrived 2,300 years ago, other parts of France are rich with\nremembrances of their eight centuries of occupation, but not many are\nhere. Other pagans followed the Romans. By and by Christianity arrived,\nsome 400 years after the time of Christ. The long procession of races,\nlanguages, religions, and dynasties demolished one another\u2019s records--it\nis man\u2019s way always.\n\nAs a result, nothing is left of the handiwork of the remoter inhabitants\nof the region except the constructions of the lake dwellers and some\nRoman odds and ends. There is part of a small Roman temple, there is\npart of a Roman bath, there is a graceful and battered Roman arch. It\nstands on a turfy level over the way from the present great bath house,\nis surrounded by magnolia trees, and is both a picturesque and\nsuggestive object. It has stood there some 1,600 years. Its nearest\nneighbor, not twenty steps away, is a Catholic church. They are symbols\nof the two chief eras in the history of Aix. Yes, and of the European\nworld. I judge that the venerable arch is held in reverent esteem by\neverybody, and that this esteem is its sufficient protection from\ninsult, for it is the only public structure I have yet seen in France\nwhich lacks the sign, \u201cIt is forbidden to post bills here.\u201d Its neighbor\nthe church has that sign on more than one of its sides, and other signs,\ntoo, forbidding certain other sorts of desecration.\n\nThe arch\u2019s nearest neighbor--just at its elbow, like the church--is the\ntelegraph office. So there you have the three great eras bunched\ntogether--the era of War, the era of Theology, the era of Business. You\npass under the arch, and the buried C\u00e6sars seem to rise from the dust of\nthe centuries and flit before you; you pass by that old battered church,\nand are in touch with the Middle Ages, and with another step you can put\ndown ten francs and shake hands with Oshkosh under the Atlantic.\n\nIt is curious to think what changes the last of the three symbols stand\nfor; changes in men\u2019s ways and thoughts, changes in material\ncivilization, changes in the Deity--or in men\u2019s conception of the Deity,\nif that is an exacter way of putting it. The second of the symbols\narrived in the earth at a time when the Deity\u2019s possessions consisted of\na small sky freckled with mustard-seed stars, and under it a patch of\nlanded estate not so big as the holdings of the Tsar to-day, and all His\ntime was taken up in trying to keep a handful of Jews in some sort of\norder--exactly the same number of them that the Tsar has lately been\ndealing with in a more abrupt and far less loving and long-suffering\nway. At a later time--a time within all old men\u2019s memories--the Deity\nwas otherwise engaged. He was dreaming His eternities away on His Great\nWhite Throne, steeped in the soft bliss of hymns of praise wafted aloft\nwithout ceasing from choirs of ransomed souls, Presbyterians and the\nrest. This was a Deity proper enough to the size and conditions of\nthings, no doubt a provincial Deity with provincial tastes. The change\nsince has been inconceivably vast. His empire has been unimaginably\nenlarged. To-day He is a Master of a universe made up of myriads upon\nmyriads of gigantic suns, and among them, lost in that limitless sea of\nlight, floats that atom. His earth, which once seemed so good and\nsatisfactory and cost so many days of patient labor to build, is a mere\ncork adrift in the waters of a shoreless Atlantic. This is a business\nera, and no doubt he is governing His huge empire now, not by dreaming\nthe time away in the buzz of hymning choirs, with occasional explosions\nof arbitrary power disproportioned to the size of the annoyance, but by\napplying laws of a sort proper and necessary to the sane and successful\nmanagement of a complex and prodigious establishment, and by seeing to\nit that the exact and constant operation of these laws is not interfered\nwith for the accommodation of any individual or political or religious\nfaction or nation.\n\nMighty has been the advance of the nations and the liberalization of\nthought. A result of it is a changed Deity, a Deity of a dignity and\nsublimity proportioned to the majesty of His office and the magnitude of\nHis empire, a Deity who has been freed from a hundred fretting chains\nand will in time be freed from the rest by the several ecclesiastical\nbodies who have these matters in charge. It was, without doubt, a\nmistake and a step backward when the Presbyterian Synods of America\nlately decided, by vote, to leave Him still embarrassed with the dogma\nof infant damnation. Situated as we are, we cannot at present know with\nhow much of anxiety He watched the balloting, nor with how much of\ngrieved disappointment He observed the result.\n\nWell, all these eras above spoken of are modern, they are of last week,\nthey are of yesterday, they are of this morning, so to speak. The\nsprings, the healing waters that gush up from under this hillside\nvillage, indeed are ancient. They, indeed, are a genuine antiquity; they\nantedate all those fresh human matters by processions of centuries; they\nwere born with the fossils of the Dent du Chat, and they have been\nalways abundant. They furnished a million gallons a day to wash the lake\ndwellers with, the same to wash the C\u00e6sars with, no less to wash Balzac\nwith, and have not diminished on my account. A million gallons a day for\nhow many days? Figures cannot set forth the number. The delivery, in the\naggregate, has amounted to an Atlantic. And there is still an Atlantic\ndown in there. By Doctor Wakefield\u2019s calculation the Atlantic is\nthree-quarters of a mile down in the earth. The calculation is based\nupon the temperature of the water, which is 114 degrees to 117 degrees\nFahrenheit, the natural law being that below a certain depth heat\naugments at the rate of one degree for every sixty feet of descent.\n\nAix is handsome, and is handsomely situated, too, on its hill slope,\nwith its stately prospect of mountain range and plain spread out before\nit and about it. The streets are mainly narrow, and steep and crooked\nand interesting, and offer considerable variety in the way of names; on\nthe corner of one of them you read this: \u201cRue du Puits d\u2019Enfer\u201d (\u201cPit of\nHell Street\u201d). Some of the sidewalks are only eighteen inches wide; they\nare for the cats, probably. There is a pleasant park, and there are\nspacious and beautiful grounds connected with the two great pleasure\nresorts, the Cercle and the Villa des Fleurs. The town consists of big\nhotels, little hotels, and _pensions_. The season lasts about six\nmonths, beginning with May. When it is at its height there are thousands\nof visitors here, and in the course of the season as many as 20,000 in\nthe aggregate come and go.\n\nThese are not all here for the baths; some come for the gambling\nfacilities and some for the climate. It is a climate where the field\nstrawberry flourishes through the spring, summer, and fall. It is hot in\nthe summer, and hot in earnest; but this is only in the daytime; it is\nnot hot at night. The English season is May and June; they get a good\ndeal of rain then, and they like that. The Americans take July, and the\nFrench take August. By the 1st of July the open-air music and the\nevening concerts and operas and plays are fairly under way, and from\nthat time onward the rush of pleasure has a steadily increasing boom. It\nis said that in August the great grounds and the gambling rooms are\ncrowded all the time and no end of ostensible fun going on.\n\nIt is a good place for rest and sleep and general recuperation of\nforces. The book of Doctor Wakefield says there is something about this\natmosphere which is the deadly enemy of insomnia, and I think this must\nbe true, for if I am any judge, this town is at times the noisiest one\nin Europe, and yet a body gets more sleep here than he would at home, I\ndon\u2019t care where his home is. Now, we are living at a most comfortable\nand satisfactory _pension_, with a garden of shade trees and flowers and\nshrubs, and a convincing air of quiet and repose. But just across the\nnarrow street is the little market square, and at the corner of that is\nthe church that is neighbor to the Roman arch, and that narrow street,\nand that billiard table of a market place, and that church are able, on\na bet, to turn out more noise to a cubic yard at the wrong time than any\nother similar combination in the earth or out of it. In the street you\nhave the skull-bursting thunder of the passing hack, a volume of sound\nnot producible by six hacks anywhere else; on the hack is a lunatic with\na whip which he cracks to notify the public to get out of his way. This\ncrack is as keen and sharp and penetrating and ear-splitting as a pistol\nshot at close range, and the lunatic delivers it in volleys, not single\nshots. You think you will not be able to live till he gets by, and when\nhe does get by he leaves only a vacancy for the bandit who sells _Le\nPetit Journal_ to fill with his strange and awful yell. He arrives with\nthe early morning and the market people, and there is a dog that arrives\nat about the same time and barks steadily at nothing till he dies, and\nthey fetch another dog just like him. The bark of this breed is the twin\nof the whip volley, and stabs like a knife. By and by, what is left of\nyou the church bell gets. There are many bells, and apparently six or\nseven thousand town clocks, and as they are all five minutes\napart--probably by law--there are no intervals. Some of them are\nstriking all the time--at least, after you go to bed they are. There is\none clock that strikes the hour and then strikes it over again to see if\nit was right. Then for evenings and Sundays there is a chime--a chime\nthat starts in pleasantly and musically, then suddenly breaks into a\nfrantic roar, and boom, and crash of warring sounds that makes you think\nParis is up and the Revolution come again. And yet, as I have said, one\nsleeps here--sleeps like the dead. Once he gets his grip on his sleep,\nneither hack, nor whip, nor news fiend, nor dog, nor bell cyclone, nor\nall of them together, can wrench it loose or mar its deep and tranquil\ncontinuity. Yes, there is indeed something in this air that is death to\ninsomnia.\n\nThe buildings of the Cercle and the Villa des Fleurs are huge in size,\nand each has a theater in it, and a great restaurant, also conveniences\nfor gambling and general and variegated entertainment. They stand in\nornamental grounds of great extent and beauty. The multitudes of\nfashionable folk sit at refreshment tables in the open air, afternoons,\nand listen to the music, and it is there that they mainly go to break\nthe Sabbath.\n\nTo get the privilege of entering these grounds and buildings you buy a\nticket for a few francs, which is good for the whole season. You are\nthen free to go and come at all hours, attend the plays and concerts\nfree, except on special occasions, gamble, buy refreshments, and make\nyourself symmetrically comfortable.\n\nNothing could be handier than those two little theaters. The curtain\ndoesn\u2019t rise until 8.30; then between the acts one can idle for half an\nhour in the other departments of the building, damaging his appetite in\nthe restaurants or his pocketbook in the baccarat room. The singers and\nactors are from Paris, and their performance is beyond praise.\n\nI was never in a fashionable gambling hell until I came here. I had read\nseveral millions of descriptions of such places, but the reality was new\nto me. I very much wanted to see this animal, especially the new\nhistoric game of baccarat, and this was a good place, for Aix ranks next\nto Monte Carlo for high play and plenty of it. But the result was what I\nmight have expected--the interest of the looker-on perishes with the\nnovelty of the spectacle; that is to say, in a few minutes. A permanent\nand intense interest is acquirable in baccarat, or in any other game,\nbut you have to buy it. You don\u2019t get it by standing around and looking\non.\n\nThe baccarat table is covered with green cloth and is marked off in\ndivisions with chalk or something. The banker sits in the middle, the\ncroupier opposite. The customers fill all the chairs at the table, and\nthe rest of the crowd are massed at their back and leaning over them to\ndeposit chips or gold coins. Constantly money and chips are flung upon\nthe table, and the game seems to consist in the croupier\u2019s reaching for\nthese things with a flexible sculling oar, and raking them home. It\nappeared to be a rational enough game for him, and if I could have\nborrowed his oar I would have stayed, but I didn\u2019t see where the\nentertainment of the others came in. This was because I saw without\nperceiving, and observed without understanding. For the widow and the\norphan and the others do win money there. Once an old gray mother in\nIsrael or elsewhere pulled out, and I heard her say to her daughter or\nher granddaughter as they passed me, \u201cThere, I\u2019ve won six louis, and I\u2019m\ngoing to quit while I\u2019m ahead.\u201d Also there was this statistic. A friend\npointed to a young man with the dead stub of a cigar in his mouth, which\nhe kept munching nervously all the time and pitching hundred-dollar\nchips on the board while two sweet young girls reached down over his\nshoulders to deposit modest little gold pieces, and said: \u201cHe\u2019s only\nfunning, now; wasting a few hundred to pass the time--waiting for the\ngold room to open, you know, which won\u2019t be till after midnight--then\nyou\u2019ll see him bet! He won \u00a314,000 there last night. They don\u2019t bet\nanything there but big money.\u201d\n\nThe thing I chiefly missed was the haggard people with the intense eye,\nthe hunted look, the desperate mien, candidates for suicide and the\npauper\u2019s grave. They are in the description, as a rule, but they were\noff duty that night. All the gamblers, male and female, old and young,\nlooked abnormally cheerful and prosperous.\n\nHowever, all the nations were there, clothed richly and speaking all the\nlanguages. Some of the women were painted, and were evidently shaky as\nto character. These items tallied with the descriptions well enough.\n\nThe etiquette of the place was difficult to master. In the brilliant and\npopulous halls and corridors you don\u2019t smoke, and you wear your hat, no\nmatter how many ladies are in the thick throng of drifting humanity, but\nthe moment you cross the sacred threshold and enter the gambling hell,\noff the hat must come, and everybody lights his cigar and goes to\nsuffocating the ladies.\n\nBut what I came here for five weeks ago was the baths. My right arm was\ndisabled with rheumatism. To sit at home in America and guess out the\nEuropean bath best fitted for a particular ailment or combination of\nailments, it is not possible, and it would not be a good idea to\nexperiment in that way, anyhow. There are a great many curative baths on\nthe Continent, and some are good for one disease and bad for another. So\nit is necessary to let your physician name a bath for you. As a rule,\nAmericans go to Europe to get this advice, and South Americans go to\nParis for it. Now and then an economist chooses his bath himself and\ndoes a thousand miles of railroading to get to it, and then the local\nphysicians tell him he has come to the wrong place. He sees that he has\nlost time and money and strength, and almost the minute he realizes this\nhe loses his temper. I had the rheumatism and was advised to go to Aix,\nnot so much because I had that disease as because I had the promise of\ncertain others. What they were was not explained to me, but they are\neither in the following menu or I have been sent to the wrong place.\nDoctor Wakefield\u2019s book says:\n\n  We know that the class of maladies benefited by the water and baths at\n  Aix are those due to defect of nourishment, debility of the nervous\n  system, or to a gouty, rheumatic, herpetic, or scrofulous\n  diathesis--all diseases extremely debilitating, and requiring a tonic,\n  and not depressing action of the remedy. This it seems to find here,\n  as recorded experience and daily action can testify. According to the\n  line of treatment followed particularly with due regard to the\n  temperature, the action of the Aix waters can be made sedative,\n  exciting, derivative, or alterative and tonic.\n\nThe \u201cEstablishment\u201d is the property of France, and all the officers and\nservants are employees of the French government. The bathhouse is a huge\nand massive pile of white marble masonry, and looks more like a temple\nthan anything else. It has several floors and each is full of bath\ncabinets. There is every kind of bath--for the nose, the ears, the\nthroat, vapor baths, swimming baths, and all people\u2019s favorite, the\ndouche. It is a good building to get lost in, when you are not familiar\nwith it. From early morning until nearly noon people are streaming in\nand streaming out without halt. The majority come afoot, but great\nnumbers are brought in sedan chairs, a sufficiently ugly contrivance\nwhose cover is a steep little tent made of striped canvas. You see\nnothing of the patient in this diving bell as the bearers tramp along,\nexcept a glimpse of his ankles bound together and swathed around with\nblankets or towels to that generous degree that the result suggests a\nsore piano leg. By attention and practice the pallbearers have got so\nthat they can keep out of step all the time--and they do it. As a\nconsequence their veiled churn goes rocking, tilting, swaying along like\na bell buoy in a ground swell. It makes the oldest sailor homesick to\nlook at that spectacle.\n\nThe \u201ccourse\u201d is usually fifteen douche baths and five tub baths. You\ntake the douche three days in succession, then knock off and take a tub.\nYou keep up this distribution through the course. If one course does not\ncure you, you take another one after an interval. You seek a local\nphysician and he examines your case and prescribes the kind of bath\nrequired for it, with various other particulars; then you buy your\ncourse tickets and pay for them in advance--nine dollars. With the\ntickets you get a memorandum book with your dates and hours all set down\non it. The doctor takes you into the bath the first morning and gives\nsome instructions to the two _doucheurs_ who are to handle you through\nthe course. The _pourboires_ are about ten cents to each of the men for\neach bath, payable at the end of the course. Also at the end of the\ncourse you pay three or four francs to the superintendent of your\ndepartment of the bathhouse. These are useful particulars to know, and\nare not to be found in the books. A servant of your hotel carries your\ntowels and sheet to the bath daily and brings them away again. They are\nthe property of the hotel; the French government doesn\u2019t furnish these\nthings.\n\nYou meet all kinds of people at a place like this, and if you give them\na chance they will submerge you under their circumstances, for they are\neither very glad or very sorry they came, and they want to spread their\nfeelings out and enjoy them. One of these said to me:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great, these baths. I didn\u2019t come here for my health; I only came\nto find out if there was anything the matter with me. The doctor told me\nif there was the symptoms would soon appear. After the first douche I\nhad sharp pains in all my muscles. The doctor said it was different\nvarieties of rheumatism, and the best varieties there were, too. After\nmy second bath I had aches in my bones, and skull and around. The doctor\nsaid it was different varieties of neuralgia, and the best in the\nmarket, anybody would tell me so. I got many new kinds of pains out of\nmy third douche. These were in my joints. The doctor said it was gout,\ncomplicated with heart disease, and encouraged me to go on. Then we had\nthe fourth douche, and I came out on a stretcher that time, and fetched\nwith me one vast, diversified undulating continental kind of pain, with\nhorizons to it, and zones, and parallels of latitude, and meridians of\nlongitude, and isothermal belts, and variations of the compass--oh,\neverything tidy, and right up to the latest developments, you know. The\ndoctor said it was inflammation of the soul, and just the very thing.\nWell, I went right on gathering them in, toothache, liver complaint,\nsoftening of the brain, nostalgia, bronchitis, osteology, fits,\nColeoptera, hydrangea, Cyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, delirium tremens, and a\nlot of other things that I\u2019ve got down on my list that I\u2019ll show you,\nand you can keep it if you like and tally off the bric-\u00e0-brac as you lay\nit in.\n\nThe doctor said I was a grand proof of what these baths could do; said I\nhad come here as innocent of disease as a grindstone, and inside of\nthree weeks these baths had sluiced out of me every important ailment\nknown to medical science, along with considerable more that were\nentirely new and patentable. Why, he wanted to exhibit me in his bay\nwindow!\u201d\n\nThere seem to be a good many liars this year. I began to take the baths\nand found them most enjoyable; so enjoyable that if I hadn\u2019t had a\ndisease I would have borrowed one, just to have a pretext for going on.\nThey took me into a stone-floored basin about fourteen feet square,\nwhich had enough strange-looking pipes and things in it to make it look\nlike a torture chamber. The two half-naked men seated me on a pine stool\nand kept a couple of warm-water jets as thick as one\u2019s wrist playing\nupon me while they kneaded me, stroked me, twisted me, and applied all\nthe other details of the scientific massage to me for seven or eight\nminutes. Then they stood me up and played a powerful jet upon me all\naround for another minute. The cool shower bath came next, and the thing\nwas over. I came out of the bathhouse a few minutes later feeling\nyounger and fresher and finer than I have felt since I was a boy. The\nspring and cheer and delight of this exaltation lasted three hours, and\nthe same uplifting effect has followed the twenty douches which I have\ntaken since.\n\nAfter my first douche I went to the chemist\u2019s on the corner, as per\ninstructions, and asked for half a glass of Challe water. It comes from\na spring sixteen miles from here. It was furnished to me, but,\nperceiving that there was something the matter with it, I offered to\nwait till they could get some that was fresh, but they said it always\nsmelled that way. They said that the reason that this was so much ranker\nthan the sulphur water of the bath was that this contained thirty-two\ntimes as much sulphur as that. It is true, but in my opinion that water\ncomes from a cemetery, and not a fresh cemetery, either. History says\nthat one of the early Roman generals lost an army down there somewhere.\nIf he could come back now I think this water would help him find it\nagain. However, I drank the Challe, and have drunk it once or twice\nevery day since. I suppose it is all right, but I wish I knew what was\nthe matter with those Romans.\n\nMy first baths developed plenty of pain, but the subsequent ones removed\nalmost all of it. I have got back the use of my arm these last few days,\nand I am going away now.\n\nThere are many beautiful drives about Aix, many interesting places to\nvisit, and much pleasure to be found in paddling around the little Lake\nBourget on the small steamers, but the excursion which satisfied me best\nwas a trip to Annecy and its neighborhood. You go to Annecy in an hour\nby rail, through a garden land that has not had its equal for beauty\nperhaps since Eden; and certainly not Eden was cultivated as this garden\nis. The charm and loveliness of the whole region are bewildering.\nPicturesque rocks, forest-clothed hills, slopes richly bright in the\ncleanest and greenest grass, fields of grain without freck or flaw,\ndainty of color and as shiny and shimmery as silk, old gray mansions and\ntowers, half buried in foliage and sunny eminences, deep chasms with\nprecipitous walls, and a swift stream of pale-blue water between, with\nnow and then a tumbling cascade, and always noble mountains in view,\nwith vagrant white clouds curling about their summits.\n\nThen at the end of an hour you come to Annecy and rattle through its old\ncrooked lanes, built solidly up with curious old houses that are a dream\nof the Middle Ages, and presently you come to the main object of your\ntrip--Lake Annecy. It is a revelation; it is a miracle. It brings the\ntears to a body\u2019s eyes, it affects you just as all things that you\ninstantly recognize as perfect affect you--perfect music, perfect\neloquence, perfect art, perfect joy, perfect grief. It stretches itself\nout there in a caressing sunlight, and away toward its border of\nmajestic mountains, a crisped and radiant plain of water of the divinest\nblue that can be imagined. All the blues are there, from the faintest\nshoal-water suggestion of the color, detectable only in the shadow of\nsome overhanging object, all the way through, a little blue and a little\nbluer still, and again a shade bluer, till you strike the deep, rich\nMediterranean splendor which breaks the heart in your bosom, it is so\nbeautiful.\n\nAnd the mountains, as you skim along on the steamboat, how stately their\nforms, how noble their proportions, how green their velvet slopes, how\nsoft the mottlings of the sun and shadow that play about the rocky\nramparts that crown them, how opaline the vast upheavals of snow banked\nagainst the sky in the remotenesses beyond--Mont Blanc and the\nothers--how shall anybody describe? Why, not even the painter can quite\ndo it, and the most the pen can do is to suggest.\n\nUp the lake there is an old abbey--Tallories--relic of the Middle Ages.\nWe stopped there; stepped from the sparkling water and the rush and boom\nand fret and fever of the nineteenth century into the solemnity and the\nsilence and the soft gloom and the brooding mystery of a remote\nantiquity. The stone step at the water\u2019s edge had the traces of a\nworn-out inscription on it; the wide flight of stone steps that led up\nto the front door was polished smooth by the passing feet of forgotten\ncenturies, and there was not an unbroken stone among them all. Within\nthe pile was the old square cloister with covered arcade all around it\nwhere the monks of the ancient times used to sit and meditate, and now\nand then welcome to their hospitalities the wandering knight with his\ntin breeches on, and in the middle of the square court (open to the sky)\nwas a stone well curb, cracked and slick with age and use, and all about\nit were weeds, and among the weeds moldy brickbats that the Crusaders\nused to throw at one another. A passage at the further side of the\ncloister led to another weedy and roofless little inclosure beyond where\nthere was a ruined wall clothed to the top with masses of ivy, and\nflanking it was a battered and picturesque arch. All over the building\nthere were comfortable rooms and comfortable beds and clean plank floors\nwith no carpets on them. In one room upstairs were half a dozen\nportraits, dimming relics of the vanished centuries--portraits of abbots\nwho used to be as grand as princes in their old day, and very rich, and\nmuch worshiped and very bold; and in the next room there were a howling\nchromo and an electric bell. Downstairs there was an ancient wood\ncarving with a Latin word commanding silence, and there was a spang-new\npiano close by. Two elderly French women, with the kindest and honestest\nand sincerest faces, have the abbey now, and they board and lodge people\nwho are tired of the roar of cities and want to be where the dead\nsilence and serenity and peace of this old nest will heal their\nblistered spirits and patch up their ragged minds. They fed us well,\nthey slept us well, and I wish I could have stayed there a few years and\ngot a solid rest.\n\n\n\n\nMARIENBAD--A HEALTH FACTORY\n\n                                -------\n\nTHE SIMPLE BUT SUFFICIENT REGIMEN IMPOSED ON PATIENTS IN AN AUSTRIAN\n    RESORT--OBSERVATIONS ON DIGESTION.\n\n                                -------\n\n               (Contributed to the New York _Sun_, 1891)\n\nThis place is the village of Marienbad, Bohemia. It seems no very great\ndistance from Annecy, in Haute-Savoie, to this place--you make it in\nless than thirty hours by these continental express trains--but the\nchanges in the scenery are great; they are quite out of proportion to\nthe distance covered. From Annecy by Aix to Geneva, you have blue lakes,\nwith bold mountains springing from their borders, and far glimpses of\nsnowy wastes lifted against the horizon beyond, while all about you is a\ngarden cultivated to the last possibility of grace and beauty--a\ncultivation which doesn\u2019t stop with the handy lower levels, but is\ncarried right up the sheer steeps and propped there with ribs of\nmasonry, and made to stay there in spite of Newton\u2019s law. Beyond\nGeneva--beyond Lausanne, at any rate--you have for a while a country\nwhich noticeably resembles New England, and seems out of place and like\nan intruder--an intruder who is wearing his every-day clothes at a\nfancy-dress ball. But presently on your right, huge green mountain\nramparts rise up, and after that for hours you are absorbed in watching\nthe rich shadow effects which they furnish, and are only dully aware\nthat New England is gone and that you are flying past quaint and\nunspeakable old towns and towers. Next day you have the lake of Zurich,\nand presently the Rhine is swinging by you. How clean it is! How clear\nit is! How blue it is! How green it is! How swift and rollicking and\ninsolent are its gait and style! How vivid and splendid its\ncolors--beautiful wreck and chaos of all the soap bubbles in the\nuniverse! A person born on the Rhine must worship it.\n\n     I saw the blue Rhine sweep along; I heard, or seemed to hear,\n     The German songs we used to sing in chorus sweet and clear.\n\nYes, that is where his heart would be, that is where his last thoughts\nwould be, the \u201csoldier of the legion\u201d who \u201clay dying in Algiers.\u201d\n\nAnd by and by you are in a German region, which you discover to be quite\ndifferent from the recent Swiss lands behind you. You have a sea before\nyou, that is to say; the green land goes rolling away, in ocean swells,\nto the horizon. And there is another new feature. Here and there at wide\nintervals you have islands, hills two hundred and three hundred feet\nhigh, of a haystack form, that rise abruptly out of the green plain, and\nare wooded solidly to the top. On the top there is just room for a\nruined castle, and there it is, every time; above the summit you see the\ncrumbling arches and broken towers projecting.\n\nBeyond Stuttgart, next day, you find other changes still. By and by,\napproaching and leaving Nuremberg and down by Newhaus, your landscape is\nhumped everywhere with scattered knobs of rock, unsociable crags of a\nrude, towerlike look, and thatched with grass and vines and bushes. And\nnow and then you have gorges, too, of a modest pattern as to size, with\nprecipice walls curiously carved and honeycombed by--I don\u2019t know\nwhat--but water, no doubt.\n\nThe changes are not done yet, for the instant the country finds it is\nout of W\u00fcrttemberg and into Bavaria it discards one more thickness of\nsoil to go with previous disrobings, and then nothing remains over the\nbones but the shift. There may be a poorer soil somewhere, but it is not\nlikely.\n\nA couple of hours from Bayreuth you cross into Bohemia, and before long\nyou reach this Marienbad, and recognize another sharp change, the change\nfrom the long ago to to-day; that is to say from the very old to the\nspick and span new; from an architecture totally without shapeliness or\nornament to an architecture attractively equipped with both; from\nuniversal dismalness as to color to universal brightness and beauty as\nto tint; from a town which seems made up of prisons to a town which is\nmade up of gracious and graceful mansions proper to the light of heart\nand crimeless. It is like jumping out of Jerusalem into Chicago.\n\nThe more I think of these many changes, the more surprising the thing\nseems. I have never made so picturesque a journey before, and there\ncannot be another trip of like length in the world that can furnish so\nmuch variety and of so charming and interesting a sort.\n\nThere are only two or three streets here in this snug pocket in the\nhemlock hills, but they are handsome. When you stand at the foot of a\nstreet and look up at the slant of it you see only block fronts of\ngraceful pattern, with happily broken lines and the pleasant accent of\nbay projections and balconies in orderly disorder and harmonious\nconfusion, and always the color is fresh and cheery, various shades of\ncream, with softly contrasting trimmings of white, and now and then a\ntouch of dim red. These blocks are all thick walled, solid, massive,\ntall for this Europe; but it is the brightest and newest looking town on\nthe Continent, and as pretty as anybody could require. The steep hills\nspring high aloft from their very back doors and are clothed densely to\ntheir tops with hemlocks.\n\nIn Bavaria everybody is in uniform, and you wonder where the private\ncitizens are, but here in Bohemia the uniforms are very rare.\nOccasionally one catches a glimpse of an Austrian officer, but it is\nonly occasionally. Uniforms are so scarce that we seem to be in a\nrepublic. Almost the only striking figure is the Polish Jew. He is very\nfrequent. He is tall and of grave countenance and wears a coat that\nreaches to his ankle bones, and he has a little wee curl or two in front\nof each ear. He has a prosperous look, and seems to be as much respected\nas anybody.\n\nThe crowds that drift along the promenade at music time twice a day are\nfashionably dressed after the Parisian pattern, and they look a good\ndeal alike, but they speak a lot of languages which you have not\nencountered before, and no ignorant person can spell their names, and\nthey can\u2019t pronounce them themselves.\n\nMarienbad--Mary\u2019s Bath. The Mary is the Virgin. She is the patroness of\nthese curative springs. They try to cure everything--gout, rheumatism,\nleanness, fatness, dyspepsia, and all the rest. The whole thing is the\nproperty of a convent, and has been for six or seven hundred years.\nHowever, there was never a boom here until a quarter of a century ago.\n\nIf a person has the gout, this is what they do with him: they have him\nout at 5.30 in the morning, and give him an egg and let him look at a\ncup of tea. At six he must be at his particular spring, with his tumbler\nhanging at his belt--and he will have plenty of company there. At the\nfirst note of the orchestra he must lift his tumbler and begin to sip\nhis dreadful water with the rest. He must sip slowly and be a long time\nat it. Then he must tramp about the hills for an hour or so, and get all\nthe exercise and fresh air possible. Then he takes his tub or wallows in\nhis mud, if mud baths are his sort. By noon he has a fine appetite, and\nthe rules allow him to turn himself loose and satisfy it, so long as he\nis careful and eats only such things as he doesn\u2019t want. He puts in the\nafternoon walking the hills and filling up with fresh air. At night he\nis allowed to take three ounces of any kind of food he doesn\u2019t like and\ndrink one glass of any kind of liquor that he has a prejudice against;\nhe may also smoke one pipe if he isn\u2019t used to it. At half past nine\nsharp he must be in bed and his candle out. Repeat the whole thing the\nnext day. I don\u2019t see any advantage in this over having the gout.\n\nIn the case of most diseases that is about what one is required to\nundergo, and if you have any pleasant habit that you value, they want\nthat. They want that the first thing. They make you drop everything that\ngives an interest to life. Their idea is to reverse your whole system of\nexistence and make a regenerating revolution. If you are a Republican,\nthey make you talk free trade. If you are a Democrat they make you talk\nprotection; if you are a Prohibitionist, you have got to go to bed drunk\nevery night till you get well. They spare nothing, they spare nobody.\nReform, reform, that is the whole song. If a person is an orator, they\ngag him; if he likes to read, they won\u2019t let him; if he wants to sing,\nthey make him whistle. They say they can cure any ailment, and they do\nseem to do it; but why should a patient come all the way here? Why\nshouldn\u2019t he do these things at home and save the money? No disease\nwould stay with a person who treated it like that.\n\nI didn\u2019t come here to take baths, I only came to look around. But first\none person, then another began to throw out hints, and pretty soon I was\na good deal concerned about myself. One of these goutees here said I had\na gouty look about the eye; next a person who has catarrh of the\nintestines asked me if I didn\u2019t notice a dim sort of stomach ache when I\nsneezed. I hadn\u2019t before, but I did seem to notice it then. A man that\u2019s\nhere for heart disease said he wouldn\u2019t come downstairs so fast if he\nhad my build and aspect. A person with an old-gold complexion said a man\ndied here in the mud bath last week that had a petrified liver--good\ndeal such a looking man as I am, and the same initials, and so on, and\nso on.\n\nOf course, there was nothing to be uneasy about, and I wasn\u2019t what you\nmay call really uneasy; but I was not feeling very well--that is, not\nbrisk--and I went to bed. I suppose that that was not a good idea,\nbecause then they had me. I started in at the supper end of the mill and\nwent through. I am said to be all right now, and free from disease, but\nthis does not surprise me. What I have been through in these two weeks\nwould free a person of pretty much everything in him that wasn\u2019t nailed\nthere--any loose thing, any unattached fragment of bone, or meat or\nmorals, or disease, or propensities or accomplishments, or what not. And\nI don\u2019t say but that I feel well enough, I feel better than I would if I\nwas dead, I reckon. And, besides, they say I am going to build up now\nand come right along and be all right. I am not saying anything, but I\nwish I had enough of my diseases back to make me aware of myself, and\nenough of my habits to make it worth while to live. To have nothing the\nmatter with you and no habits is pretty tame, pretty colorless. It is\njust the way a saint feels, I reckon; it is at least the way he looks. I\nnever could stand a saint. That reminds me that you see very few priests\naround here, and yet, as I have already said, this whole big enterprise\nis owned and managed by a convent. The few priests one does see here are\ndressed like human beings, and so there may be more of them than I\nimagine. Fifteen priests dressed like these could not attract as much of\nyour attention as would one priest at Aix-les-Bains. You cannot pull\nyour eye loose from the French priest as long as he is in sight, his\ndress is so fascinatingly ugly. I seem to be wandering from the subject,\nbut I am not. This is about the coldest place I ever saw, and the\nwettest, too. This August seems like an English November to me. Rain?\nWhy, it seems to like to rain here. It seems to rain every time there is\na chance. You are strictly required to be out airing and exercising\nwhenever the sun is shining, so I hate to see the sun shining because I\nhate air and exercise--duty air and duty exercise taken for medicine. It\nseems ungenuine, out of season, degraded to sordid utilities, a subtle\nspiritual something gone from it which one can\u2019t describe in words,\nbut--don\u2019t you understand? With that gone what is left but canned air,\ncanned exercise, and you don\u2019t want it.\n\nWhen the sun does shine for a few moments or a few hours these people\nswarm out and flock through the streets and over the hills and through\nthe pine woods, and make the most of the chance, and I have flocked out,\ntoo, on some of these occasions, but as a rule I stay in and try to get\nwarm.\n\nAnd what is there for means, besides heavy clothing and rugs, and the\npolished white tomb that stands lofty and heartless in the corner and\nthinks it is a stove? Of all the creations of human insanity this thing\nis the most forbidding. Whether it is heating the room or isn\u2019t, the\nimpression is the same--cold indifference. You can\u2019t tell which it is\ndoing without going and putting your hand on it. They burn little\nhandfuls of kindlings in it, no substantial wood, and no coal.\n\nThe fire burns out every fifteen minutes, and there is no way to tell\nwhen this has happened. On these dismal days, with the rain steadily\nfalling, it is no better company than a corpse. A roaring hickory fire,\nwith the cordial flames leaping up the chimney--But I must not think of\nsuch things, they make a person homesick. This is a most strange place\nto come to get rid of disease.\n\nThat is what you think most of the time. But in the intervals, when the\nsun shines and you are tramping the hills and are comparatively warm,\nyou get to be neutral, maybe even friendly. I went up to the\nAussichtthurm the other day. This is a tower which stands on the summit\nof a steep hemlock mountain here; a tower which there isn\u2019t the least\nuse for, because the view is as good at the base of it as it is at the\ntop of it. But Germanic people are just mad for views--they never get\nenough of a view--if they owned Mount Blanc, they would build a tower on\ntop of it.\n\nThe roads up that mountain through that hemlock forest are hard packed\nand smooth, and the grades are easy and comfortable. They are for\nwalkers, not for carriages. You move through steep silence and twilight,\nand you seem to be in a million-columned temple; whether you look up the\nhill or down it you catch glimpses of distant figures flitting without\nsound, appearing and disappearing in the dim distances, among the stems\nof the trees, and it is all very spectral, and solemn and impressive.\nNow and then the gloom is accented and sized up to your comprehension in\na striking way; a ray of sunshine finds its way down through and\nsuddenly calls your attention, for where it falls, far up the hillslope\nin the brown duskiness, it lays a stripe that has a glare like\nlightning. The utter stillness of the forest depths, the soundless hush,\nthe total absence of stir or motion of any kind in leaf or branch, are\nthings which we have no experience of at home, and consequently no name\nfor in our language. At home there would be the plaint of insects and\nthe twittering of birds and vagrant breezes would quiver the foliage.\nHere it is the stillness of death. This is what the Germans are forever\ntalking about, dreaming about, and despairingly trying to catch and\nimprison in a poem, or a picture, or a song--they adored Waldeinsamkeit,\nloneliness of the woods. But how catch it? It has not a body; it is a\nspirit. We don\u2019t talk about it in America, or dream of it, or sing about\nit, because we haven\u2019t it. Certainly there is something wonderfully\nalluring about it, beguiling, dreamy, unworldly. Where the gloom is\nsoftest and richest, and the peace and stillness deepest, far up on the\nside of that hemlock mountain, a spot where Goethe used to sit and\ndream, is marked by a granite obelisk, and on its side is carved this\nfamous poem, which is the master\u2019s idea of Waldeinsamkeit:\n\n                    Ueber allen Wipfeln ist Ruh,\n                    In allen Wipfeln sp\u00fcrest du\n                        Kaum einen Hauch:\n                    Die Vogel in schweigen in Walde.\n                    Warte nur--Balde\n                        Ruhest du auch.\n\nIt is raining again now. However, it was doing that before. I have been\nover to the establishment and had a tub bath with two kinds of pine\njuice in it. These fill the room with a pungent and most pleasant\nperfume; they also turn the water to a color of ink and cover it with a\nsnowy suds, two or three inches deep. The bath is cool--about 75\u00b0 or 80\u00b0\nF., and there is a cooler shower bath after it. While waiting in the\nreception room all by myself two men came in and began to talk.\nPolitics, literature, religion? No, their ailments. There is no other\nsubject here, apparently. Wherever two or three of these people are\ngathered together, there you have it, every time. The first that can get\nhis mouth open contributes his disease and the condition of it, and the\nothers follow with theirs. The two men just referred to were\nacquaintances, and they followed the custom. One of them was built like\na gasometer and is here to reduce his girth; the other was built like a\nderrick and is here to fat up, as they express it, at this resort. They\nwere well satisfied with the progress they were making. The gasometer\nhad lost a quarter of a ton in ten days, and showed the record on his\nbelt with pride, and he walked briskly across the room, smiling in a\nvast and luminous way, like a harvest moon, and said he couldn\u2019t have\ndone that when he arrived here. He buttoned his coat around his equator\nand showed how loose it was. It was pretty to see his happiness, it was\nso childlike and honest. He set his feet together and leaned out over\nhis person and proved that he could see them. He said he hadn\u2019t seen\nthem from that point before for fifteen years. He had a hand like a\nboxing glove. And on one of his fingers he had just found a diamond ring\nwhich he had missed eleven years ago.\n\nThe minute the derrick got a chance he broke in and began to tell how he\nwas piling on blubber right along--three-quarters of an ounce every four\ndays; and he was still piping away when I was sent for. I left the fat\nman standing there panting and blowing, and swelling and collapsing like\na balloon, his next speech all ready and urgent for delivery.\n\nThe patients are always at that sort of thing, trying to talk one\nanother to death. The fat ones and the lean ones are nearly the worse at\nit, but not quite; the dyspeptics are the worst. They are at it all day\nand all night, and all along. They have more symptoms than all the\nothers put together and so there is more variety of experience, more\nchange of condition, more adventure, and consequently more play for the\nimagination, more scope for lying, and in every way a bigger field to\ntalk. Go where you will, hide where you may, you cannot escape that word\nliver; you overhear it constantly--in the street, in the shop, in the\ntheater, in the music grounds. Wherever you see two or a dozen people of\nordinary bulk talking together, you know they are talking about their\nlivers. When you first arrive here your new acquaintances seem sad and\nhard to talk to, but pretty soon you get the lay of the land and the\nhand of things, and after that you haven\u2019t any more trouble. You look\ninto the dreary dull eye and softly say:\n\n\u201cWell, how\u2019s your liver?\u201d\n\nYou will see that dim eye flash up with a grateful flame, and you will\nsee that jaw begin to work, and you will recognize that nothing is\nrequired of you from this out but to listen as long as you remain\nconscious. After a few days you will begin to notice that out of these\npeople\u2019s talk a gospel is framing itself and next you will find yourself\nbelieving it. It is this--that a man is not what his rearing, his\nschooling, his beliefs, his principles make him, he is what his liver\nmakes him; that with a healthy liver he will have the clear-seeing eye,\nthe honest heart, the sincere mind, the loving spirit, the loyal soul,\nthe truth and trust and faith that are based as Gibraltar is based, and\nthat with an unhealthy liver he must and will have the opposite of all\nthese, he will see nothing as it really is, he cannot trust anybody, or\nbelieve in anything, his moral foundations are gone from under him. Now,\nisn\u2019t that interesting? I think it is.\n\nOne of the most curious things in these countries is the street manners\nof the men and women. In meeting you they come straight on without\nswerving a hair\u2019s breadth from the direct line and wholly ignoring your\nright to any part of the road. At the last moment you must yield up your\nshare of it and step aside, or there will be a collision. I noticed this\nstrange barbarism first in Geneva twelve years ago.\n\nIn Aix-les-Bains, where sidewalks are scarce and everybody walks in the\nstreets, there is plenty of room, but that is no matter; you are always\nescaping collisions by mere quarter inches. A man or woman who is headed\nin such a way as to cross your course presently without a collision will\nactually alter his direction shade by shade and compel a collision\nunless at the last instant you jump out of the way. Those folks are not\ndressed as ladies and gentlemen. And they do not seem to be consciously\ncrowding you out of the road; they seem to be innocently and stupidly\nunaware that they are doing it. But not so in Geneva. There this class,\nespecially the men, crowd out men, women, and girls of all rank and\nraiment consciously and intentionally--crowd them off the sidewalk and\ninto the gutter.\n\nThere was nothing of this sort in Bayreuth. But here--well, here the\nthing is astonishing. Collisions are unavoidable unless you do all the\nyielding yourself. Another odd thing--here this savagery is confined to\nthe folk who wear the fine clothes; the others are courteous and\nconsiderate. A big burly Comanche, with all the signs about him of\nwealth and education, will tranquilly force young ladies to step off\ninto the gutter to avoid being run down by him. It is a mistake that\nthere is no bath that will cure people\u2019s manners. But drowning would\nhelp.\n\nHowever, perhaps one can\u2019t look for any real showy amount of delicacy of\nfeeling in a country where a person is brought up to contemplate without\na shudder the spectacle of women harnessed up with dogs and hauling\ncarts. The woman is on one side of the pole, the dog on the other, and\nthey bend to the work and tug and pant and strain--and the man tramps\nleisurely alongside and smokes his pipe. Often the woman is old and\ngray, and the man is her grandson. The Austrian national ornithological\ndevice ought to be replaced by a grandmother harnessed to a slush cart\nwith a dog. This merely in the interest of fact. Heraldic fancy has been\na little too much overworked in these countries, anyway.\n\nLately one of those curious things happened here which justify the\nfelicitous extravagances of the stage and help us to accept them. A\ndespondent man, bankrupt, friendless, and desperate, dropped a dose of\nstrychnia into a bottle of whisky and went out in the dusk to find a\nhandy place for his purpose, which was suicide. In a lonely spot he was\nstopped by a tramp, who said he would kill him if he didn\u2019t give up his\nmoney. Instead of jumping at the chance of getting himself killed and\nthus saving himself the impropriety and annoyance of suicide, he forgot\nall about his late project and attacked the tramp in a most sturdy and\nvaliant fashion. He made a good fight, but failed to win. The night\npassed, the morning came, and he woke out of unconsciousness to find\nthat he had been clubbed half to death and left to perish at his\nleisure. Then he reached for his bottle to add the finishing touch, but\nit was gone. He pulled himself together and went limping away, and\npresently came upon the tramp stretched out stone dead with the empty\nbottle beside him. He had drunk the whisky and committed suicide\ninnocently. Now, while the man who had been cheated out of his suicide\nstood there bemoaning his hard luck and wondering how he might manage to\nraise money enough to buy some more whisky and poison, some people of\nthe neighborhood came by and he told them about his curious adventure.\nThey said that this tramp had been the scourge of the neighborhood and\nthe dread of the constabulary. The inquest passed off quietly and to\neverybody\u2019s satisfaction, and then the people, to testify their\ngratitude to the hero of the occasion, put him on the police, on a\ngood-enough salary, and he is all right now and is not meditating\nsuicide any more. Here are all the elements of the na\u00efvest Arabian tale;\na man who resists robbery when he hasn\u2019t anything to be robbed of does\nthe very best to save his life when he has come out purposely to throw\nit away; and finally is victorious in defeat, killing his adversary in\nan effectual and poetic fashion after being already hors du combat\nhimself. Now if you let him rise in the service and marry the chief of\npolice\u2019s daughter it has the requisite elements of the Oriental romance,\nlacking not a detail so far as I can see.\n\n\n\n\n                             DOWN THE RH\u00d4NE\n                                 (1891)\n\n\nIn old times a summer sail down the Rh\u00f4ne was a favorite trip with\ntravelers. But that day is long gone by. The conveniences for the sail\ndisappeared many years ago--driven out of existence by the railway.\n\nIn August, 1891, I made this long-neglected voyage with a boatman and a\ncourier. The following account of it is part diary and part comment. The\nmain idea of the voyage was, not to see sights, but to rest up from\nsight-seeing. There was little or nothing on the Rh\u00f4ne to examine or\nstudy or write didactically about; consequently, to glide down the\nstream in an open boat, moved by the current only, would afford many\ndays of lazy repose, with opportunity to smoke, read, doze, talk,\naccumulate comfort, get fat, and all the while be out of reach of the\nnews and remote from the world and its concerns.\n\nOur point of departure was to be the Castle of Ch\u00e2tillon on Lake\nBourget, not very far from Aix-les-Bains. I went down from Geneva by\nrail on a Saturday afternoon, and reached the station nearest the castle\nduring the evening. I found the courier waiting for me. He had been down\nin the lake region several days, hunting for a boat, engaging the\nboatman, etc.\n\n_From my log._--The luggage was given to the porters--a couple of\npeasant girls of seventeen or eighteen years, and a couple of younger\nones--children, one might say, of twelve or thirteen. It consisted of\nheavy satchels and holdalls, but they gathered it up and trudged away,\nnot seeming to mind the weight. The road was through woods and\nuphill--dark and steep and long. I tried to take the heavy valise from\nthe smallest one, telling her I would carry it myself. She did not\nunderstand, of course, and resisted. I tried, then, to take the bag by\ngentle force. This alarmed her. The courier came and explained that she\nwas afraid she was going to lose the trifle of money she was earning.\n\nThe courier told her this was not the case, but she looked doubtful and\nconcluded to hang on to a sure thing.\n\n\u201cHow much is it she\u2019s going to get?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will charge about half a franc.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen pay her _now_, and she\u2019ll give up the bag.\u201d\n\nBut that scheme failed, too. The child hung to the bag and seemed\ndistressed. No explanation could be got out of her, but one of the other\ngirls said the child was afraid that if she gave it up, the fact would\nbe used against her with tourists as proof that she was not strong\nenough to carry their luggage for them, and so she would lose chances to\nget work.\n\nBy and by the winding road carried us by an open space where we could\nsee very well--see the ruins of a burned-out little hamlet of the\nhumblest sort--stone walls with empty window holes, narrow alleys\ncluttered with wreckage and fallen thatch, etc. Our girls were eager to\nhave us stop and view this wonder, the result of the only conflagration\nthey had ever seen, the only large event that had ever accented their\nmonotonous lives. It had happened a couple of months before, and the\nvillagers had lost everything, even to their stockings of savings, and\nwere too poor to rebuild their houses. A young woman, an old one, and\nall the horses had been burned to death; the young girls said they could\ntake us among the ruins and show us the very spot.\n\nWe finally came out on the top of the hill, and there stood the castle,\na rather picturesque old stack of masonry with a walled yard about it\nand an odd old stumpy tower in a corner of the yard handsomely clothed\nin vines. The castle is a private residence, whose owner leaves it in\ncharge of his housekeeper and some menservants, and lives in Lyons\nexcept when he wants to fish or shoot.\n\nThe courier had engaged rooms, but the fact had probably been forgotten,\nfor we had trouble in rousing the garrison. It was getting late and they\nwere asleep. Eventually a man unlocked and unbarred the door and led us\nup a winding stair of heavy and very plain stonework. My bed was higher\nfrom the floor than necessary. This is apparently the rule in old French\nhouses of the interior. But there is a stepladder.\n\nIn the morning I looked out of my window and saw the tops of trees below\nme, thick and beautiful foliage, and below the trees was the bright blue\nwater of the lake shining in the sun. The window seemed to be about two\nhundred feet above the water. An airy and inspiring situation, indeed. A\npope was born in that room a couple of centuries ago. I forget his name.\n\nIn that old day they built for utility, this was evident.\nEverything--floors, sashes, shutters, beams, joists--were cheap, coarse,\nornamentless, but everlastingly solid and substantial. On the wall hung\nan indication of the politics of the present owner. This was a small\nphotograph with \u201cPhilippe Comte de Paris\u201d written under it.\n\nThe castle was ancient, in its way, but over the door of one of its\nrooms there was a picture set in a frame whose profound antiquity made\nall its surroundings seem modern and fresh. This frame was of good firm\noak, as black as a coal, and had once been part of a lake-dweller\u2019s\nhouse. It was already a thing of antiquity when the Romans were planting\ncolonies in France before the time of Christ. The remains of a number of\nlake villages have been dug out of the mud of Lake Bourget.\n\nBreakfast was served in the open air on a precipice in a little arbor\nsheltered by vines, with glimpses through the tree tops of the blue\nwater far below, and with also a wide prospect of mountain scenery. The\ncoffee was the best I ever drank in Europe.\n\nPresently there was a bugle blast from somewhere about the\nbattlements--a fine Middle Age effect--and after a moment it was\nanswered from the further shore of the lake, and we saw a boat put out\nfrom that shore. It was ours. We were soon on board and away.\n\nIt was a roomy, long flatboat, very light and easy to manage--easy to\nmanage because its sides tapered a little toward both ends, and both\nends curved up free from the water and made the steering prompt and\neasy. The rear half was sheltered from sun and rain by a temporary (and\nremovable) canopy stretched over hoop-pole arches, after the fashion of\nthe old-time wagon covers of the emigrants to California. We at once\nrolled the sides of the canopy high up, so that we might have the breeze\nand a free view on every hand.\n\nOn the other side of the lake we entered a narrow canal, and here we had\nour last glimpse of that picturesque Ch\u00e2tillon perched on its high\npromontory. The sides of the canal were walled with vines heavily laden\nwith black grapes. The vine leaves were white with the stuff which is\nsquirted on them from a thing like a fire extinguisher to kill the\ncalamitous phylloxera. We saw only one living creature for the first\nlonely mile--a man with his extinguisher strapped on his back and hard\nat his deadly work. I asked our admiral, Joseph Rougier, of the village\nof Chanaz, if it would be a good idea to offer to sell this Sabbath\nbreaker a few choice samples of foreign phylloxera, and he said yes, if\none wanted to play the star part in an inquest.\n\nAt last two women and a man strolling churchward in their Sunday best\ngave us a courteous hail and walked briskly along abreast of us, plying\nthe courier and the sailor with eager questions about our curious and\nunaccountable project, and by the time they had got their fill and\ndropped astern to digest the matter and finish wondering over it, we\nwere serene again and busy discussing the scenery; for now there was\nreally some scenery to look at, of a mild but pleasant type--low\nprecipices, a country road shaded by large trees, a few cozy thatched\ncabins scattered along, and now and then an irruption of joyous children\nwho flocked to inspect us and admire, followed by friendly dogs who\nstood and barked at us, but wagged their tails to say no offense was\nintended.\n\nSoon the precipice grew bolder, and presently Chanaz came in sight and\nthe canal bore us along its front--along its street, for it had only\none. We stepped ashore. There was a roll of distant drums, and soon a\ncompany or two of French infantry came marching by. All the citizens\nwere out, and every male took off his hat politely as the soldiers moved\npast him, and this salute was always returned by the officers.\n\nI wanted envelopes, wine, grapes, and postage stamps, and was directed\nto a stone stairway and told to go up one flight. Up there I found a\nsmall well-smoked kitchen paved with worn-out bricks, with pots and pans\nhanging about the walls, and a bent and humped woman of seventy cooking\na very frugal dinner. The tiredest dog I have seen this year lay asleep\nunder the stove, in a roasting heat, an incredible heat, a heat that\nwould have pulled a remark of the Hebrew children; but the dog slept\nalong with perfect serenity and did not seem to know that there was\nanything the matter with the weather. The old woman set off her coffee\npot. Next she removed her pork chop to the table; it seemed to me that\nthis was premature--the dog was better done.\n\nWe asked for the envelopes and things; she motioned us to the left with\nher ladle. We passed through a door and found ourselves in the smallest\nwholesale and retail commercial house in the world, I suppose. The place\nwas not more than nine feet square. The proprietor was polite and\ncheerful enough for a place five or six times as large. He was weighing\nout two ounces of parched coffee for a little girl, and when the\nbalances came level at last he took off a light bean and put on a\nheavier one in the handsomest way and then tied up the purchase in a\npiece of paper and handed it to the child with as nice a bow as one\nwould see anywhere. In that shop he had a couple of bushels of wooden\nshoes--a dollar\u2019s worth, altogether, perhaps--but he had no other\narticles in such lavish profusion. Yet he had a pound or so or a\ndipperful of any kind of thing a person might want. You couldn\u2019t buy two\nthings of a kind there, but you could buy one of any and every kind. It\nwas a useful shop, and a sufficient one, no doubt, yet its contents\ncould not have cost more than ten dollars. Here was home on a small\nscale, but everything comfortable, no haggard looks visible, no\nfinancial distress apparent. I got all the things I came for except\ndouble-postage stamps for foreign service; I had to take domestic stamps\ninstead. The merchant said he kept a double-stamp in stock a couple of\nyears, but there was no market for it, so he sent it back to Paris,\nbecause it was eating up its insurance. A careful man and thrifty; and\nof such is the commonwealth of France.\n\nWe got some hot fried fish in Chanaz and took them aboard and cleared\nout. With grapes and claret and bread they made a satisfactory luncheon.\nWe paddled a hundred yards, turned a rock corner, and here was the\nfurious gray current of the Rh\u00f4ne just a-whistling by! We crept into it\nfrom the narrow canal, and laid in the oars. The floating was begun. One\nneeds no oar-help in a current like that. The shore seemed to fairly\nspin past. Where the current assaults the heavy stone barriers thrown\nout from the shores to protect the banks, it makes a break like the\nbreak of a steamboat, and you can hear the roar a couple of hundred\nyards off.\n\nThe river where we entered it was about a hundred yards wide, and very\ndeep. The water was at medium stage. The Rh\u00f4ne is not a very long\nriver--six hundred miles--but it carries a bigger mass of water to the\nsea than any other French stream.\n\nFor the first few miles we had lonely shores--hardly ever a house. On\nthe left bank we had high precipices and domed hills; right bank low and\nwooded.\n\nAt one point in the face of a precipice we saw a great cross (carved out\nof the living rock, the Admiral said) forty feet above the carriage\nroad, where a doctor has had his tomb scooped in the rock and lies in\nthere safe from his surviving patients--if any.\n\nAt 1.25 P.M. we passed the slumbrous village of Massigneux de Rive on\nthe right and the ditto village of Huissier on the left (in Savoie). We\nhad to take all names by sound from the Admiral; he said nobody could\nspell them. There was a ferry at the former village. A wire is stretched\nacross the river high overhead; along this runs a wheel which has ropes\nleading down and made fast to the ferryboat in such a way that the\nboat\u2019s head is held farther upstream than its stern. This angle enables\nthe current to drive the boat across, and no other motive force is\nneeded. This would be a good thing on minor rivers in America.\n\n2.10 P.M.--It is delightfully cool, breezy, shady (under the canopy),\nand still. Much smoking and lazy reflecting. There is no sound but the\nrippling of the current and the moaning of far-off breaks, except that\nnow and then the Admiral dips a screechy oar to change the course half a\npoint. In the distance one catches the faint singing and laughter of\nplaying children or the softened note of a church bell or town clock.\nBut the reposeful stillness--that is the charm--and the smooth swift\ngliding--and the fresh, clear, lively, gray-green water. There was such\na rush, and boom, and life, and confusion, and activity in Geneva\nyesterday--how remote all that seems now, how wholly vanished away and\ngone out of this world!\n\n2.15.--Village of Yenne. Iron suspension bridge. On the heights back of\nthe town a chapel with a tower like a thimble, and a very tall white\nVirgin standing on it.\n\n2.25.--Precipices on both sides now. River narrow--sixty yards.\n\n2.30.--Immense precipice on right bank, with groups of buildings (Pierre\nCh\u00e2tel) planted on the very edge of it. In its near neighborhood a\nmassive and picturesque fortification.\n\nAll this narrow gut from the bridge down to the next bridge--a mile or\ntwo--is picturesque with its frowning high walls of rock.\n\nIn the face of the precipice above the second bridge sits a painted\nhouse on a rock bench--a chapel, we think, but the Admiral says it is\nfor the storage of wine.\n\nMore fortifications at the corner where the river turns--no cannon, but\nnarrow slits for musketry commanding the river. Also narrow slits in the\nsolid (hollowed-out) precipice. Perhaps there is no need of cannon here\nwhere you can throw a biscuit across from precipice to precipice.\n\n2.45.--Below that second bridge. On top of the bluffs more\nfortifications. Low banks on both sides here.\n\n2.50.--Now both sets of fortifications show up, look huge and\nformidable, and are finely grouped. Through the glass they seem deserted\nand falling to ruin. Out of date, perhaps.\n\nOne will observe, by these paragraphs, that the Rh\u00f4ne is swift enough to\nkeep one\u2019s view changing with a very pleasant alacrity.\n\nAt midafternoon we passed a steep and lofty bluff--right bank--which was\ncrowned with the moldering ruins of a castle overgrown with trees. A\nrelic of Roman times, the Admiral said. Name? No, he didn\u2019t know any\nname for it. Had it a history? Perhaps; he didn\u2019t know. Wasn\u2019t there\neven a legend connected with it? He didn\u2019t know of any.\n\nNot even a legend. One\u2019s first impulse was to be irritated; whereas one\nshould be merely thankful; for if there is one sort of invention in this\nworld that is flatter than another, it is the average folklore legend.\nIt could probably be proven that even the adventures of the saints in\nthe Roman calendar are not of a lower grade as works of the inventor\u2019s\nart.\n\nThe dreamy repose, the infinite peace of these tranquil shores, this\nSabbath stillness, this noiseless motion, this strange absence of the\nsense of sin, and the stranger absence of the desire to commit it--this\nwas the perfectest day the year had brought! Now and then we slipped\npast low shores with grassy banks. A solitary thatched cottage close to\nthe edge, one or two big trees with dense foliage sheltering the\ncottage, and the family in their Sunday, clothes grouped in the deep\nshade, chatting, smoking, knitting, the dogs asleep about their feet,\nthe kittens helping with the knitting, and all hands content and\npraising God without knowing it. We always got a friendly word of\ngreeting and returned it. One of these families contained eighteen sons,\nand all were present. The Admiral was acquainted with everybody along\nthe banks, and with all the domestic histories, notwithstanding he was\nso ineffectual on old Roman matters.\n\n4.20.--Bronze statue of the Virgin on a sterile hill slope.\n\n4.45.--Ruined Roman tower on a bluff. Belongs to the no-name series.\n\n5.--Some more Roman ruins in the distance.\n\nAt 6 o\u2019clock we rounded to. We stepped ashore in a woodsy and lonely\nplace and walked a short mile through a country lane to the sizable and\nrather modern-looking village of St.-Genix. Part of the way we followed\nanother pleasure party--six or eight little children riding aloft on a\nmountain of fragrant hay. This is the earliest form of the human\npleasure excursion, and for utter joy and perfect contentment it stands\nalone in a man\u2019s threescore years and ten; all that come after it have\nflaws, but this has none.\n\nWe put up at the H\u00f4tel Labully, in the little square where the church\nstands. Satisfactory dinner. Later I took a twilight tramp along the\nhigh banks of a moist ditch called the Guires River. If it was my river\nI wouldn\u2019t leave it outdoors nights, in this careless way, where any dog\ncan come along and lap it up. It is a tributary of the Rh\u00f4ne when it is\nin better health.\n\nIt became dark while we were on our way back, and then the bicyclers\ngave us many a sudden chill. They never furnished us an early warning,\nbut delivered the paralyzing shock of their rubber-horn hoot right at\nour shoulder blades and then flashed spectrally by on their soundless\nwheels and floated into the depths of the darkness and vanished from\nsight before a body could collect his remark and get it out. Sometimes\nthey get shot. This is right.\n\nI went to my room, No. 16. The floor was bare, which is the rule down\nthe Rh\u00f4ne. Its planks were light colored, and had been smoothed by use\nrather than art; they had conspicuous black knots in them. The usual\nhigh and narrow bed was there, with the usual little marble-topped\ncommode by the head of it and the usual strip of foot carpet alongside,\nwhere you climb in. The wall paper was dark--which is usual on the\nContinent; even in the northern regions of Germany, where the daylight\nin winter is of such poor quality that they don\u2019t even tax it now.\n\nWhen I woke in the morning it was eight o\u2019clock and raining hard, so I\nstayed in bed and had my breakfast and a ripe old Paris paper of last\nweek brought up. It was a good breakfast--one often gets that; and a\nliberal one--one seldom gets that. There was a big bowl for the coffee\ninstead of a stingy cup which has to be refilled just as you are getting\ninterested in it; there was a quart of coffee in the pot instead of a\nscant half pint; instead of the usual hollow curl of brittle butter\nwhich evades you when you try to scoop it on to the knife and crumbles\nwhen you try to carve it, there was a solid cream-colored lump as big as\na brick; there was abundance of hot milk, and there was also the usual\nostensible cream of Europe. There _must_ be cream in Europe somewhere,\nbut it is not in the cows; they have been examined.\n\nThe rain continued to pour until noon, then the sun burst out and we\nwere soon up and filing through the village. By the time we had tramped\nour mile and pushed out into the stream, the watches marked 1.10 and the\nday was brilliant and perfect.\n\nOver on the right were ruins of two castles, one of them of some size.\n\nWe passed under a suspension bridge; alongside of it was an iron bridge\nof a later pattern. Near by was a little steamer lying at the bank with\nno signs of life about her--the first boat, except ferryboats,\nencountered since we had entered the Rh\u00f4ne. A lonely river, truly.\n\nWe drifted past lofty highlands, but there was nothing inspiring about\nthem. In Switzerland the velvet heights are sprinkled with homes clear\nto the clouds, but these hills were sterile, desolate, gray, melancholy,\nand so thin was the skin on them that the rocky bones showed through in\nplaces.\n\n1.30.--We seem lost in the intricate channels of an archipelago of flat\nislands covered with bushes.\n\n1.50.--We whirl around a corner into open river again, and observe that\na vast bank of leaden clouds is piling itself up on the horizon; the\ntint thrown upon the distant stretches of water is rich and fine.\n\nThe river is wide now--a hundred and fifty yards--and without islands.\nSuddenly it has become nearly currentless and is like a lake. The\nAdmiral explains that from this point for nine miles it is called L\u2019Eau\nMorte--Dead Water.\n\nThe region is not entirely barren of life, it seems--solitary woman\npaddling a punt across the wide still pool.\n\nThe boat moved, but that is about all one could say. It was indolent\nprogress; still, it was comfortable. There were flaming sunshine behind\nand that rich thunder gloom ahead, and now and then the fitful fanning\nof a pleasant breeze.\n\nA woman paddled across--a rather young woman with a face like the \u201cMona\nLisa.\u201d I had seen the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d only a little while before, and stood\ntwo hours in front of that painting, repeating to myself: \u201cPeople come\nfrom around the globe to stand here and worship. What is it they find in\nit?\u201d To me it was merely a serene and subdued face, and there an end.\nThere might be more in it, but I could not find it. The complexion was\nbad; in fact, it was not even human; there are no people of that color.\nI finally concluded that maybe others still saw in the picture faded and\nvanished marvels which _had_ been there once and were now forever\nvanished.\n\nThen I remembered something told me once by Noel Flagg,[3] the artist.\nThere was a time, he said, when he wasn\u2019t yet an artist but thought he\nwas. His pictures sold, and gave satisfaction, and that seemed a\ngood-enough verdict. One day he was daubing away in his studio and\nfeeling good and inspired, when Dr. Horace Bushnell, that noble old\nRoman, straggled in there without an invitation and fastened that deep\neye of his on the canvas. The youth was proud enough of such a call, and\nglad there was something on the easel that was worthy of it. After a\nlong look the great divine said:\n\n\u201cYou have talent, boy.\u201d (That sounded good.) \u201cWhat you want is\nteaching.\u201d\n\nTeaching--he, an accepted and competent artist! He didn\u2019t like that.\nAfter another long look:\n\n\u201cDo you know the higher mathematics?\u201d\n\n\u201cI? No, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must acquire them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a proper part of an artist\u2019s training?\u201d This with veiled irony.\n\n\u201cAs an _essential_ part of it. Do you know anatomy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must learn how to dissect a body. What are you studying,\nnow--principally?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, I believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the time flying, the time flying! Where are your books? What do you\nread?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere they are, on the shelves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see. Poetry and romance. They must wait. Get to your mathematics and\nyour anatomy right away. Another point: you must train your eye--you\nmust teach yourself to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeach myself to see? I believe I was born with that ability.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut nobody is born with a _trained_ ability--nobody. A cow sees--she\nsees all the outsides of things, no doubt, but it is only the trained\neye that sees deeper, sees the soul of them, the meaning of them, the\nspiritual essence. Are you sure that you see more than the cow sees? You\nmust go to Paris. You will never learn to see here. There they\u2019ll teach\nyou; there they\u2019ll train you; there they\u2019ll work you like a slave; there\nthey\u2019ll bring out the talent that\u2019s in you. Be off! Don\u2019t twaddle here\nany longer!\u201d\n\nFlagg thought it over and resolved that the advice was worth taking. He\nand his brother cleared for Paris. They put in their first afternoon\nthere scoffing at the works of the old masters in the Louvre. They\nlaughed at themselves for crossing a wide ocean to learn what masterly\npainting might be by staring at these odious things. As for the \u201cMona\nLisa,\u201d they exhausted their treasure of wit in making fun of it.\n\nNext day they put themselves into the hands of the Beaux Arts people,\nand that was the end of play. They had to start at the very bottom of\ntheir trade and learn it over again, detail by detail, and learn it\n_right_, this time. They slaved away, night and day for three months,\nand wore themselves to shadows. Then they had a day off, and drifted\ninto the Louvre. Neither said a word for some time; each disliked to\nbegin; but at last, in front of the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d after standing mute\nawhile one of them said:\n\n\u201cSpeak out. Say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay it yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, we _were_ cows before!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes--it\u2019s the right name for it. That is what we were. It is\nunbelievable, the change that has come over these pictures in three\nmonths. It is the difference between a landscape in the twilight and the\nsame landscape in the daytime.\u201d Then they fell into each other\u2019s arms.\n\nThis all came back to me, now, as I saw this living \u201cMona Lisa\u201d punting\nacross L\u2019Eau Morte.\n\n2.40 P.M.--Made for a village on the right bank with all speed--Port de\nGroslee. Remains of Roman aqueduct on hilltop back of village.\nRain!--Deluges of it. Took refuge in an inn on the bank--H\u00f4tel des\nVoyageurs. The public room was full of voyageurs and tobacco smoke. The\nvoyageurs may have been river folk in the old times when the inn was\nbuilt, but this present crowd was made up of teamsters. They sat at bare\ntables, under their feet was the bare floor, about them were the four\nbare walls--a dreary place at any time, a heart-breaking place now in\nthe dark of the downpour. However, it was manifestly not dreary to the\nteamsters. They were sipping red wine and smoking; they all talked at\nonce, and with great energy and spirit, and every now and then they gave\ntheir thighs a sounding slap and burst into a general horse laugh. The\ncourier said that this was in response to rude wit and coarse anecdotes.\nThe brace of modest-looking girls who were waiting on the teamsters did\nnot seem troubled. The courier said that they were used to all kinds of\nlanguage and were not defiled by it; that they had probably seldom heard\na spade called anything but a spade, therefore the foulest words came\ninnocent to their ears.\n\nThis inn was built of stone--of course; everybody\u2019s house on the\nContinent, from palace to hovel, is built of that dismal material, and\nas a rule it is as square as a box and odiously plain and destitute of\nornament; it is formal, forbidding, and breeds melancholy thoughts in\npeople used to friendlier and more perishable materials of construction.\nThe frame house and the log house molder and pass away, even in the\nbuilder\u2019s time, and this makes a proper bond of sympathy and fellowship\nbetween the man and his home; but the stone house remains always the\nsame to the person born in it; in his old age it is still as hard, and\nindifferent, and unaffected by time as it was in the long-vanished days\nof his childhood. The other kind of house shows by many touching signs\nthat it has noted his griefs and misfortunes and has felt for them, but\nthe stone house doesn\u2019t--it is not of his evanescent race, it has no\nkinship with him, nor any interest in him.\n\nA professional letter writer happened along presently, and one of the\nyoung girls got him to write a letter for her. It seemed strange that\nshe could not write it herself. The courier said that the peasant women\nof the Rh\u00f4ne do not care for education, but only for religion; that they\nare all good Catholics, and that their main ambition in life is to see\nthe Rh\u00f4ne\u2019s long procession of stone and bronze Virgins added to, until\nthe river shall be staked out with them from end to end; and that their\nmain pleasure in life is to contribute from their scant centimes to this\ngracious and elevating work. He says it is a quite new caprice; that ten\nyears ago there was not a Virgin in this part of France at all, and\nnever had been. This may be true, and, of course, there is nothing\nunreasonable about it, but I have already found out that the courier\u2019s\nstatements are not always exact.\n\nI had a hot fried fish and coffee in a garden shed roofed with a mat of\nvines, but the rain came through in streams and I got drenched in spite\nof our umbrellas, for one cannot manage table implements and umbrellas\nall at the same time with anything like good success.\n\n_Mem._--Last evening, for economy\u2019s sake, proposed to be a Frenchman\nbecause Americans and English are always overcharged. Courier said it\nwouldn\u2019t deceive unless I played myself for a deaf-and-dumb\nFrenchman--which I did, and so the rooms were only a franc and a half\neach. But the Admiral must have let it out that I was only deaf and dumb\nin French, for prices were raised in the bill this morning.\n\n4.10 P.M.--Left Port de Groslee.\n\n4.50 P.M.--Ch\u00e2teau of the Count Cassiloa--or something like that--the\nAdmiral\u2019s pronunciation is elusive. Courier guesses the spelling at\n\u201cQuintionat.\u201d I don\u2019t quite see the resemblance. This courier\u2019s\nconfidence in himself is a valuable talent. He must be descended from\nthe idiot who taught our forefathers to spell tizzik with a _ph_ and a\n_th_.\n\nThe river here is as still and smooth and nearly as dead as a lake. The\nwater is swirly, though, and consequently makes uneasy steering.\n\nRiver seems to draw together and greatly narrow itself below the count\u2019s\nhouse. No doubt the current will smarten up there.\n\nThree new quarries along here. Dear me! how little there is in the way\nof sight-seeing, when a quarry is an event! Remarked upon with\ncontentment.\n\nSwept through the narrow canallike place with a good current.\n\nOn the left-hand point below, bush-grown ruins of an ancient convent\n(St. Alban\u2019s), picturesquely situated on a low bluff. There is a higher\nand handsomer bluff a trifle lower down. How did they overlook it? Those\npeople generally went for the best, not second best. Shapely hole in\nlatter bluff one hundred feet above the water--anchorite\u2019s nest?\nInteresting-looking hole, and would have cost but little time and\ntrouble to examine it, but it was not done. It is no matter; one can\nfind other holes.\n\nAt last, below bluffs, we find some greensward--not extensive, but a\npleasant novelty.\n\n5.30.--Lovely sunset. Mottled clouds richly painted by sinking sun, and\nfleecy shreds of clouds drifting along the fronts of neighboring blue\nmountains. Harrow in a field. Apparently harrow, but was distant and\ncould not tell; could have been a horse.\n\n5.35.--Very large gray broken-arched and unusually picturesque ruin\ncrowning a hilltop on right. Name unknown. This is a liberal mile above\nvillage of Briord (my spelling--the Admiral\u2019s pronunciation), on same\nside. Passed the village swiftly, and left it behind. The villagers came\nout and made fun of our strange tub. The dogs chased us and were more\nnoisy than necessary.\n\n6 P.M.--Another suspension bridge--this is the sixth one. They have\nceased to interest. There was nothing exciting about them, from the\nstart. Presently landed on left bank and shored the boat for the night.\nH\u00f4tel du Rh\u00f4ne Moine. Isolated. Situated right on the bank. Sort of a\nvillage--villagette, to be exact--a little back. H\u00f4tel is two stories\nhigh and not pretentious--family dwelling and cow stable all under one\nroof.\n\nI had been longing to have personal experience of peasant life--be \u201con\nthe inside\u201d and see it for myself, instead of at second hand in books.\nThis was an opportunity and I was excited about it and glad. The kitchen\nwas not clean, but it was a sociable place, and the family were kind and\nfull of good will. There were three little children, a young girl,\nfather, mother, grandparents, some dogs, and a plurality of cats. There\nwas no discord; perfect harmony prevailed.\n\nOur table was placed on the lawn on the river bank. One had no right to\nexpect any finer style here than he would find in the cheapest and\nshabbiest little tavern in America, for the H\u00f4tel du Rh\u00f4ne Moine was for\nfoot wanderers and laborers on the flatboats that convey stone and sand\nand wood to Lyons, yet the style _was_ superior--very much so. The\ntablecloth was white, and it and the table furniture were perfectly\nclean. We had a fish of a pretty coarse grain, but it was fresh from the\nriver and hot from the pan; the bread was good, there was abundance of\nexcellent butter, the milk was rich and pure, the sugar was white, the\ncoffee was considerably better than that which is furnished by the\nchoice hotels of the capitals of the Continent. Thus far, peasant life\nwas a disappointment, it was so much better than anything we were used\nto at home in some respects. Two of the dogs came out, presently, and\nsat down by the table and rested their chins on it, and so remained. It\nwas not to beg, for they showed no interest in the supper; they were\nmerely there to be friendly, it was the only idea they had. A squadron\nof cats came out by and by and sat down in the neighborhood and looked\nme over languidly, then wandered away without passion, in fact with what\nlooked like studied indifference. Even the cats and the dogs are well\nand sufficiently fed at the H\u00f4tel du Rh\u00f4ne Moine--their dumb testimony\nwas as good as speech.\n\nI went to bed early. It is inside the house, not outside, that one\nreally finds the peasant life. Our rooms were over the stable, and this\nwas not an advantage. The cows and horses were not very quiet, the smell\nwas extraordinary, the fleas were a disorderly lot, and these things\nhelped the coffee to keep one awake. The family went to bed at nine and\ngot up at two. The beds were very high; one could not climb into them\nwithout the help of a chair; and as they were narrow and arched, there\nwas danger of rolling out in case one drifted into dreams of an\nimprudent sort. These lofty bedsteads were not high from caprice, but\nfor a purpose--they contained chests of drawers, and the drawers were\nfull of clothing and other family property. On the table in my room were\nsome bright-colored, even gorgeous little waxen saints and a Virgin\nunder bell-glasses; also the treasures of the house--jewelry and a\nsilver watch. It was not costly jewelry, but it was jewelry, at any\nrate, and without doubt the family valued it. I judged that this\nhousehold were accustomed to having honest guests and neighbors or they\nwould have removed these things from the room when I entered it, for I\ndo not look honester than others.\n\nNot that I have always thought in this way about myself, for I haven\u2019t.\nI thought the reverse until the time I lost my overcoat, once, when I\nwas going down to New York to see the Water Color exhibition, and had a\nsort of adventure in consequence. The house had been robbed in the\nnight, and when I came downstairs to rush for the early train there was\nno overcoat. It was a raw day, and when I got to New York at noon I grew\ncolder and colder as I walked along down the Avenue. When I reached East\nThirty-fourth street I stopped on the corner and began to consider. It\nseemed to me that it must have been just about there that Smith,[4] the\nartist, took me one winter\u2019s night, with others, five years before, and\ncaroused us with roasted oysters and Southern stories and hilarity in\nhis fourth story until three or four in the morning; and now if I could\nonly call to mind which of those houses over the way was his, I could\nborrow an overcoat. All the time that I was thinking and standing there\nand trying to recollect, I was dimly conscious of a figure near me, but\nonly dimly, very dimly; but now as I came out of my reverie and found\nmyself gazing, rapt but totally unconscious, at one of the houses over\nthere, that figure solidified itself and became at once the most\nconspicuous thing in the landscape. It was a policeman. He was standing\nnot six feet away, and was gazing as intently at my face as I had been\ngazing at the house. I was embarrassed--it is always embarrassing to\ncome to yourself and find a stranger staring at you. You blush, even\nwhen you have not been doing any harm. So I blushed--a thing that does\nnot commend a person to a policeman; also I tried to smile a placating\nsmile, but it did not get any response, so then I tried to make it a\nkind of friendly smile, which was a mistake, because that only hardens a\npoliceman, and I saw at once that this smile had hardened this one and\nmade my situation more difficult than ever; and so, naturally, my\njudgment being greatly impaired by now, I spoke--which was an error,\nbecause in these circumstances one cannot arrange without reflection a\nremark which will not seem to have a kind of suspicious something about\nit to a policeman, and that was what happened this time; for I had\nfanned up that haggard smile again, which had been dying out when I\nwasn\u2019t noticing, and said:\n\n\u201cCould you tell me, please, if there\u2019s a Mr. Smith lives over there\nin----\u201d\n\n\u201c_What_ Smith?\u201d\n\nThat rude abruptness drove his other name out of my mind; and as I saw I\nnever should be able to think of it with the policeman standing there\ncowing me with his eye, that way, it seemed to me best to get out a name\nof some kind, so as to avert further suspicion, therefore I brought out\nthe first one which came into my mind, which was John--another error.\nThe policeman turned purple--apparently with a sense of injury and\ninsult--and said there were a million John Smiths in New York, and\n_which_ one was this? Also what did I want with Smith? I could not\nremember--the overcoat was gone out of my mind. So I told him he was a\npupil of mine and that I was giving him lessons in morals; moral\nculture--a new system.\n\nThat was a lucky hit, anyway. I was merely despicable, now, to the\npoliceman, but harmless--I could see it in his eye. He looked me over a\nmoment then said:\n\n\u201cYou give him lessons, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long have you been giving him lessons?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo years, next month.\u201d I was getting my wind again, and confidence.\n\n\u201cWhich house does he live in?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat one--the middle one in the block.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what did you ask _me_ for, a minute ago?\u201d\n\nI did not see my way out. He waited for an answer, but got tired before\nI could think of one that would fit the case and said:\n\n\u201cHow is it that you haven\u2019t an overcoat on, such a day as this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI--well, I never wear them. It doesn\u2019t seem cold to me.\u201d\n\nHe thought awhile, with his eye on me, then said, with a sort of sigh:\n\n\u201cWell, maybe you are all right--I don\u2019t know--but you want to walk\npretty straight while you are on my beat; for, morals or no morals,\nblamed if I take much stock in you. Move on, now.\u201d\n\nThen he turned away, swinging his club by its string. But his eye was\nover his shoulder, my way; so I had to cross to that house, though I\ndidn\u2019t want to, any more. I did not expect it to be Smith\u2019s house, now\nthat I was so out of luck, but I thought I would ring and ask, and if it\nproved to be some one else\u2019s house, then I would explain that I had come\nto examine the gas meter and thus get out the back way and be all right\nagain. The door was opened by a middle-aged matron with a gentle and\nfriendly face, and she had a sweet serenity about her that was a notable\ncontrast to my nervous flurry. I asked after Smith and if he lived\nthere, and to my surprise and gratitude she said that this was his home.\n\n\u201cCan I see him? Can I see him right away--immediately?\u201d\n\nNo; he was gone downtown. My rising hopes fell to ruin.\n\n\u201cThen can I see Mrs. Smith?\u201d\n\nBut alas and alas! she was gone downtown with him. In my distress I was\nsuddenly smitten by one of those ghastly hysterical inspirations, you\nknow, when you want to do an insane thing just to astonish and petrify\nsomebody; so I said, with a rather overdone pretense of playful ease and\nassurance:\n\n\u201cAh, this is a very handsome overcoat on the hat rack--be so good as to\nlend it to me for a day or two!\u201d\n\n\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d she said--and she had the coat on me before I knew what\nhad happened. It had been my idea to astonish and petrify her, but I was\nthe person astonished and petrified, myself. So astonished and so\npetrified, in fact, that I was out of the house and gone, without a\nthank-you or a question, before I came to my senses again. Then I\ndrifted slowly along, reflecting--reflecting pleasantly. I said to\nmyself, \u201cShe simply divined my character by my face--what a far clearer\nintuition she had than that policeman.\u201d The thought sent a glow of\nself-satisfaction through me.\n\nThen a hand was laid on my shoulder and I shrank together with a crash.\nIt was the policeman. He scanned me austerely and said:\n\n\u201cWhere did you get that overcoat?\u201d\n\nAlthough I had not been doing any harm, I had all the sense of being\ncaught--caught in something disreputable. The officer\u2019s accusing eye and\nunbelieving aspect heightened this effect. I told what had befallen me\nat the house in as straightforward a way as I could, but I was ashamed\nof the tale, and looked it, without doubt, for I knew and felt how\nimprobable it must necessarily sound to anybody, particularly a\npoliceman. Manifestly he did not believe me. He made me tell it all over\nagain, then he questioned me:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know the woman?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know her.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t the least idea who she is?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the least.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t ask for it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just asked her to lend you the overcoat, and she let you take it?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe put it on me herself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd didn\u2019t look frightened?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrightened? Of course not.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot even surprised?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in the slightest degree.\u201d\n\nHe paused. Presently he said:\n\n\u201cMy friend, I don\u2019t believe a word of it. Don\u2019t you see, yourself, it\u2019s\na tale that won\u2019t wash? Do _you_ believe it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I know it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you surprised?\u201d\n\n\u201cClear through to the marrow!\u201d\n\nHe had been edging me along back to the house. He had a deep design; he\nsprung it on me now. Said he:\n\n\u201cStop where you are. I\u2019ll mighty soon find out!\u201d\n\nHe walked to the door and up the steps, keeping a furtive eye out toward\nme and ready to jump for me if I ran. Then he pretended to pull the\nbell, and instantly faced about to observe the effect on me. But there\nwasn\u2019t any; I walked toward him instead of running away. That unsettled\nhim. He came down the steps, evidently perplexed, and said:\n\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t make it out. It may be all right, but it\u2019s too many for\nme. I don\u2019t like your looks and I won\u2019t have such characters around. Go\nalong, now, and look sharp. If I catch you prowling around here again\nI\u2019ll run you _in_.\u201d\n\nI found Smith at the Water Color dinner that night, and asked him if it\nwere merely my face that had enabled me to borrow the overcoat from a\nstranger, but he was surprised and said:\n\n\u201cNo! What an idea--and what intolerable conceit! She is my housekeeper,\nand remembered your drawling voice from overhearing it a moment that\nnight four or five years ago in my house; so she knew where to send the\npolice if you didn\u2019t bring the coat back!\u201d\n\nAfter all those years I was sitting here, now, at midnight in the\npeasant hotel, in my night clothes, and honoring womankind in my\nthoughts; for here was another woman, with the noble and delicate\nintuitions of her sex, trusting me, a total stranger, with all her\nmodest wealth. She entered the room, just then, and stood beaming upon\nme a moment with her sweet matronly eyes--then took away the jewelry.\n\n_Tuesday, September 22d._--Breakfast in open air. Extra canvas was now\nto be added to the boat\u2019s hood to keep the passengers and valises better\nprotected during rainstorms. I passed through the villagette and started\nto walk over the wooded hill, the boat to find us on the river bank\nsomewhere below, by and by. I soon got lost among the high bushes and\nturnip gardens. Plenty of paths, but none went to river. Reflection.\nDecision--that the path most traveled was the one leading in the right\ndirection. It was a poor conclusion. I got lost again; this time worse\nthan before. But a peasant of above eighty (as she said, and certainly\nshe was very old and wrinkled and gray and bent) found me presently and\nundertook to guide me safely. She was vigorous, physically, prompt and\ndecided of movement, and altogether soldierlike; and she had a hawk\u2019s\neye and beak, and a gypsy\u2019s complexion. She said that from her girlhood\nup to not so very many years ago she had done a man\u2019s work on a woman\u2019s\npay on the big keel boats that carry stone down the river, and was as\ngood a man as the best, in the matter of handling stone. Said she had\nseen the great Napoleon when she was a little child. Her face was so\nwrinkled and dark and so eaglelike that she reminded me of old Indians\none sees out on the Great Plains--the outside signs of age, but in the\neye an indestructible spirit. She had a couple of laden baskets with her\nwhich I had found heavy after three minutes\u2019 carrying, when she was\nfinding the way for me, but they seemed nothing to her. She impressed\none rather as a man than as a woman; and so, when she spoke of her child\nthat was drowned, and her voice broke a little and her lip quivered, it\nsurprised me; I was not expecting it. \u201cGrandchild?\u201d No--it was her own\nchild. \u201cIndeed? When?\u201d So then it came out that it was sixty years ago.\nIt seemed strange that she should mind it so long. But that was the\nwoman of it, no doubt. She had a fragment of newspaper--religious--with\nrude holy woodcuts in it and doubtful episodes in the lives of medi\u00e6val\nsaints and anchorites--and she could read these instructive matters in\nfine print without glasses; also, her eyes were as good at long\ndistances. She led hither and thither among the paths and finally\nbrought me out overlooking the river. There was a steep sandy frontage\nthere, where there had recently been a small landslide, and the faint\nnew path ran straight across it for forty feet, like a slight snow track\nalong the slant of a very steep roof. I halted and declined. I had no\nmind to try the crumbly path and creep and quake along it with the\nboiling river--and maybe some rocks--under my elbow thirty feet below.\nSuch places turn my stomach. The old woman took note of me, understood,\nand said what sounded like, \u201c_Lass\u2019 ma allez au premier_\u201d--then she\ntramped briskly and confidently across with her baskets, sending\nminiature avalanches of sand and gravel down into the river with each\nstep. One of her feet plowed from under her, about midway, but she\nsnatched it back and marched on, not seeming to mind it. My pride urged\nme to move along, and put me to shame. After a time the old woman came\nback and coaxed me to try, and did at last get me started in her wake\nand I got as far as midway all right; but then to hearten me still more\nand show me how easy and safe it was, she began to prance and dance her\nway along, with her knuckles in her hips, kicking a landslide loose with\nevery skip. The exhibition struck a cold panic through me and made my\nbrain swim. I leaned against the slope and said I would stay there until\nthe boat came and testified as to whether there were rocks under me or\nnot. For the third time in my life I was in that kind of a fix--in a\nplace where I could not go backward or forward, and mustn\u2019t stay where I\nwas. The boat was a good while coming, but it seemed longer than that.\nWhere I was, the slope was like a roof; where the slope ended the wall\nwas perpendicular thence to the water, and one could not see over and\ntell what the state of things might be down there. When the boat came\nalong, the courier said there was nothing down there but deep water--no\nrocks. I did not mind the water; so my fears disappeared, now, and I\nfinished my march without discomfort. I gave the old woman some money,\nwhich pleased her very much and she tried her grateful best to give us a\npartridge, newly killed, which she rummaged out of one of her baskets,\nand seemed disappointed when I would not take it. But I couldn\u2019t; it\nwould have been a shabby act. Then she went her way with her heavy\nbaskets and I got aboard and afloat once more, feeling a great respect\nfor her and very friendly toward her. She waved a good-by every now and\nthen till her figure faded out in the plain, joining that interminable\nprocession of friends made and lost in an hour that drifts past a man\u2019s\nlife from cradle to grave and returns on its course no more. The courier\nsaid she was probably a poacher and stole the partridge.\n\nThe courier was not able to understand why I had not nerve enough to\nwalk along a crumbling slope with a precipice only thirty feet high\nbelow me; but I had no difficulty in understanding it. It is\nconstitutional with me to get nervous and incapable under the\nprobability of getting myself dropped thirty feet on to a pile of rocks;\nit does not come from culture. Some people are made in one way, and some\nin another--and the above is my way. Some people who can skirt\nprecipices without a tremor have a strong dread of the dentist\u2019s chair,\nwhereas I was born without any prejudices against the dentist\u2019s chair;\nwhen in it I am interested, am not in a hurry, and do not greatly mind\nthe pain. Taken by and large, my style of make has advantages over the\nother, I think. Few of us are obliged to circumnavigate precipices, but\nwe all have to take a chance at the dental chair.\n\nPeople who early learn the right way to choose a dentist have their\nreward. Professional superiority is not everything; it is only part. All\ndentists talk while they work. They have inherited this from their\nprofessional ancestors, the barbers. The dentist who talks well--other\nthings being equal--is the one to choose. He tells anecdotes all the\nwhile and keeps his man so interested and entertained that he hardly\nnotices the flight of time. For he not only tells anecdotes that are\ngood in themselves, but he adds nice shadings to them with his\ninstruments as he goes along, and now and then brings out effects which\ncould not be produced with any other kind of tools at all. All the time\nthat such a dentist as this is plowing down into a cavity with that\nspinning gouge which he works with a treadle, it is observable that he\nhas found out where he has uncovered a nerve down in there, and that he\nonly visits it at intervals, according to the needs of his anecdote,\ntouching it lightly, very lightly and swiftly, now and then, to brighten\nup some happy conceit in his tale and call a delicate electric attention\nto it; and all the while he is working gradually and steadily up toward\nhis climax with veiled and consummate art--then at last the spindle\nstops whirling and thundering in the cavity, and you know that the grand\nsurprise is imminent, now--is hanging in the very air. You can hear your\nheart beat as the dentist bends over you with his grip on the spindle\nand his voice diminished to a murmur. The suspense grows\nbigger--bigger--bigger--your breath stops--then your heart. Then with\nlightning suddenness the \u201cnub\u201d is sprung and the spindle drives into the\nraw nerve! The most brilliant surprises of the stage are pale and\nartificial compared with this.\n\nIt is believed by people generally--or at least by many--that the\nexquisitely sharp sensation which results from plunging the steel point\ninto the raw nerve is pain, but I think that this is doubtful. It is so\nvivid and sudden that one has no time to examine properly into its\ncharacter. It is probably impossible, with our human limitations, to\ndetermine with certainty whether a sensation of so high and perfect an\norder as that is pain or whether it is pleasure. Its location brings it\nunder the disadvantage of a common prejudice; and so men mistake it for\npain when they might perceive that it is the opposite of that if it were\nanywhere but in a tooth. I may be in error, but I have experimented with\nit a great deal and I am satisfied in my own mind that it is not pain.\nIt is true that it always feels like pain, but that proves nothing--ice\nagainst a naked back always passes for fire. I have every confidence\nthat I can eventually prove to everyone\u2019s satisfaction that a nerve-stab\nproduces pleasure; and not only that, but the most exquisite pleasure,\nthe most perfect felicity which we are capable of feeling. I would not\nask more than to be remembered hereafter as the man who conferred this\npriceless benefaction upon his race.\n\n11.30.--Approaching the Falls of the Rh\u00f4ne. Canal to the left, walled\nwith compact and beautiful masonry. It is a cut-off. We could pass\nthrough it and avoid the Falls--are advised by the Admiral to do it, but\nall decline, preferring to have a dangerous adventure to talk about.\n\nHowever....\n\nThe truth is, the current began to grow ominously swift--and presently\npretty lumpy and perturbed; soon we seemed to be simply flying past the\nshores. Then all of a sudden three hundred yards of boiling and tossing\nriver burst upon our sight through the veiling tempest of rain! I did\nnot see how our flimsy ark could live through such a place. If we were\nwrecked, swimming could not save us; the packed multitude of tall humps\nof water meant a bristling chaos of big rocks underneath, and the first\nrock we hit would break our bones. If I had been fortified with\nignorance I might have wanted to stay in the boat and see the fun; but I\nhave had much professional familiarity with water, and I doubted if\nthere was going to be any fun there. So I said I would get out and walk,\nand I did. I need not tell anybody at home; I could leave out the Falls\nof the Rh\u00f4ne; they are not on the map, anyhow. If an adventure worth\nrecording resulted, the Admiral and the courier would have it, and that\nwould answer. I could see it from the bank--nothing could be better; it\nseemed even providential.\n\nI ran along the bank in the driving rain, and enjoyed the sight to the\nfull. I never saw a finer show than the passage of that boat was,\nthrough the fierce turmoil of water. Alternately she rose high and\nplunged deep, throwing up sheets of foaming spray and shaking them off\nlike a mane. Several times she seemed to fairly bury herself, and I\nthought she was gone for good, but always she sprang high aloft the next\nmoment, a gallant and stirring spectacle to see. The Admiral\u2019s steering\nwas great. I had not seen the equal of it before.\n\nThe boat waited for me down at the Villebois bridge, and I presently\ncaught up and went aboard. There was a stretch of a hundred yards of\noffensively rough water below the bridge, but it had no dangerous\nfeatures about it. Still, I was obliged to claim that it had, and that\nthese perils were much greater than the others.\n\nNoon.--A mile of perpendicular precipices--very handsome. On the left,\nat the termination of this stately wall, a darling little old tree-grown\nruin abreast a wooded islet with a large white mansion on it. Near that\nruin nature has gotten up a clever counterfeit of one, tree-grown and\nall that, and, as its most telling feature, has furnished it a battered\nmonolith that stands up out of the underbrush by itself and looks as if\nmen had shaped it and put it there and time had gnawed it and worn it.\n\nThis is the prettiest piece of river we have found. All its aspects are\ndainty and gracious and alluring.\n\n1 P.M.--Ch\u00e2teau de la Salette. This is the port of the Grotte de la\nBalme, \u201cone of the seven wonders of Dauphiny.\u201d It is across a plain in\nthe face of a bluff a mile from the river. A grotto is out of the common\norder, and I should have liked to see this one, but the rains have made\nthe mud very deep and it did not seem well to venture so long a trip\nthrough it.\n\n2.15 P.M.--St.-Etienne. On a distant ridge inland a tall openwork\nstructure commandingly situated, with a statue of the Virgin standing on\nit.\n\nImmense empty freight barges being towed upstream by teams of two and\nfour big horses--not on the bank, but under it; not on the land, but\nalways in the water--sometimes breast deep--and around the big flat\nbars.\n\nWe reached a not very promising-looking village about four o\u2019clock, and\nconcluded to land; munching fruit and filling the hood with pipe smoke\nhad grown monotonous. We could not have the hood furled, because the\nfloods of rain fell unceasingly. The tavern was on the river bank, as is\nthe custom. It was dull there, and melancholy--nothing to do but look\nout of the window into the drenching rain and shiver; one could do that,\nfor it was bleak and cold and windy, and there was no fire. Winter\novercoats were not sufficient; they had to be supplemented with rugs.\nThe raindrops were so large and struck the river with such force that\nthey knocked up the water like pebble splashes.\n\nWith the exception of a very occasional wooden-shod peasant, nobody was\nabroad in this bitter weather--I mean of our sex. But all weathers are\nalike to the women in these continental countries. To them and the other\nanimals life is serious; nothing interrupts their slavery. Three of them\nwere washing clothes in the river under the window when we arrived, and\nthey continued at it as long as there was light to work by. One was\napparently thirty; another--the mother?--above fifty; the\nthird--grandmother?--so old and worn and gray she could have passed for\neighty. They had no waterproofs or rubbers, of course; over their heads\nand shoulders they wore gunny sacks--simply conductors for rivers of\nwater; some of the volume reached ground, the rest soaked in on the way.\n\nAt last a vigorous fellow of thirty-five arrived, dry and comfortable,\nsmoking his pipe under his big umbrella in an open donkey cart--husband,\nson, and grandson of those women? He stood up in the cart, sheltering\nhimself, and began to superintend, issuing his orders in a masterly tone\nof command, and showing temper when they were not obeyed swiftly enough.\nWithout complaint or murmur the drowned women patiently carried out the\norders, lifting the immense baskets of soaked clothing into the cart and\nstowing them to the man\u2019s satisfaction. The cart being full now, he\ndescended, with his umbrella, entered the tavern, and the women went\ndrooping homeward in the wake of the cart, and soon were blended with\nthe deluge and lost to sight. We would tar and feather that fellow in\nAmerica, and ride him on a rail.\n\nWhen we came down into the public room he had his bottle of wine and\nplate of food on a bare table black with grease, and was chomping like a\nhorse. He had the little religious paper which is in everybody\u2019s hands\non the Rh\u00f4ne borders, and was enlightening himself with the histories of\nFrench saints who used to flee to the desert in the Middle Ages to\nescape the contamination of women.\n\nWednesday.--After breakfast, got under way. Still storming as hard as\never. The whole land looks defeated and discouraged. And very lonely;\nhere and there a woman in the fields. They merely accent the loneliness.\n\n  NOTE.--The record ends here. Luxurious enjoyment of the excursion\n  rendered the traveler indifferent to his notes. The drift continued to\n  Arles, whence Mark Twain returned to Geneva and Ouchy by rail. Ten\n  years later he set down another picture of this happy journey--\u201cThe\n  Lost Napoleon\u201d--which follows.--A. B. P.\n\n-----\n\nFootnote 3:\n\n  Of Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nFootnote 4:\n\n  _Note, 1904._ Hopkinson Smith, now a distinguished man in literature,\n  art, and architecture. S. L. C.\n\n\n\n\n                           THE LOST NAPOLEON\n\n\nThe lost Napoleon is a part of a mountain range. Several miles of\nit--say six. When you stand at the right viewpoint and look across the\nplain, there, miles away, stretched out on his back under the sky, you\nsee the great Napoleon, sleeping, with his arm folded upon his breast.\nYou recognize him at once and you catch your breath and a thrill goes\nthrough you from head to foot--a most natural thing to happen, for you\nhave never been so superbly astonished in your life before, and you\nrealize, if you live a century, it is not likely that you will ever\nencounter the like of that tremendous surprise again. You see, it is\nunique. You have seen mountain ridges before that looked like men lying\ndown, but there was always some one to pilot you to the right viewpoint,\nand prepare you for the show, and then tell you which is the head and\nwhich the feet and which the stomach, and at last you get the idea and\nsay, \u201cYes, now I see it, now I make it out--it is a man, and wonderful,\ntoo.\u201d But all this has damaged the surprise and there is not much\nthrill; moreover, the man is only a third-rate celebrity or no celebrity\nat all--he is no Napoleon the Great. But I discovered this stupendous\nNapoleon myself and was caught wholly by surprise, hence the splendid\nemotion, the uplifting astonishment.\n\nWe have all seen mountains that looked like whales, elephants, recumbent\nlions--correctly figured, too, and a pleasure to look upon--but we did\nnot discover them, somebody pointed them out to us, and in the same\ncircumstances we have seen and enjoyed stately crags and summits known\nto the people thereabouts as \u201cThe Old Man\u2019s Head,\u201d \u201cThe Elephant\u2019s\nHead,\u201d \u201cAnthony\u2019s Nose,\u201d \u201cThe Lady\u2019s Head,\u201d etc., and we have seen\nothers that were named \u201cShakespeare\u2019s Head,\u201d and \u201cSatan\u2019s Head,\u201d but\nstill the fine element of surprise was in almost all cases wanting.\n\nThe Lost Napoleon is easily the most colossal and impressive statue in\nthe world. It is several miles long; in form and proportions it is\nperfect. It represents Napoleon himself and not another; and there is\nsomething about the dignity and repose of the great figure that stirs\nthe imagination and half persuades it that this is not an unsentient\nartifice of nature, but the master of the world sentient and\ndreaming--dreaming of battle, conquest, empire. I call it the Lost\nNapoleon because I cannot remember just where I was when I saw it. My\nhope, in writing this, is that I may move some wandering tourist or\nartist to go over my track and seek for it--seek for it, find it, locate\nit exactly, describe it, paint it, and so preserve it against loss\nagain.\n\nMy track was down the Rh\u00f4ne; I made the excursion ten or eleven years\nago in the pleasantest season of the year. I took a courier with me and\nwent from Geneva a couple of hours by rail to the blue little Lake\nBourget, and spent the night in a medi\u00e6val castle on an island in that\nlittle lake. In the early morning our boat came for us. It was a roomy\nopen boat fifteen or twenty feet long, with a single pair of long oars,\nand with it came its former owner, a sturdy big boatman. The boat was\nmine now; I think I paid five dollars for it. I was to pay the boatman a\ntrifling daily wage and his keep, and he was to take us all the way down\nthe Rh\u00f4ne to Marseilles. It was warm weather and very sunny, but we\nbuilt a canvas arch, like a wagon cover, over the aftermost third of the\nboat, with a curtain at its rear which could be rolled up to let the\nbreeze blow through, and I occupied that tent and was always\ncomfortable. The sailor sat amidships and manned the oars, and the\ncourier had the front third of the boat to himself. We crossed the lake\nand went winding down a narrow canal bordered by peasant houses and\nvineyards, and after about a league of this navigation we came in sight\nof the Rh\u00f4ne, a troubled gray stream which went tearing past the mouth\nof the peaceful canal at a racing gait. We emerged into it and laid in\nthe oars. We could go fast enough in that current without artificial\naid. During the first days we slipped along down the curving bends at a\nspeed of about five miles an hour, but it slackened later.\n\nOur days were all about alike. About four in the afternoon we tied up at\na village and I dined on the greensward in front of the inn by the\nwater\u2019s edge, on the choicest chickens, vegetables, fruit, butter, and\nbread, prepared in French perfection and served upon the whitest linen;\nand as a rule I had the friendly house cat and dog for guests and\ncompany and willing and able helpers. I slept in the inn; often in clean\nand satisfactory quarters, sometimes in the same room with the cows and\nthe fleas. I breakfasted on the lawn in the morning with cat and dog\nagain; then laid in a stock of grapes and other fruits gathered fresh\nfrom the garden and some bottles of red wine made on the premises, and\nat eight or nine we went floating down the river again. At noon we went\nashore at a village, bought a freshly caught fish or two, had them\nbroiled, got some bread and vegetables, and set sail again at once. We\nalways lunched on board as we floated along. I spent my days reading\nbooks, making notes, smoking, and in other lazy and enchanting ways, and\nhad the delightfulest ten-day voyage I have ever experienced.\n\nIt took us ten days to float to Arles. There the current gave out and I\nclosed the excursion and returned to Geneva by rail. It was twenty-eight\nmiles to Marseilles, and we should have been obliged to row. That would\nnot have been pleasure; it would have meant work for the sailor, and I\ndo not like work even when another person does it.\n\nI think it was about the eighth day that I discovered Napoleon. My notes\ncover four or five days; there they stop; the charm of the trip had\ntaken possession of me, and I had no energy left. It was getting toward\nfour in the afternoon--time to tie up for the day. Down ahead on the\nright bank I saw a compact jumble of yellowy-browny cubes stacked\ntogether, some on top of the others, and no visible cracks in the mass,\nand knew it for a village--a village common to that region down there; a\nvillage jammed together without streets or alleys, substantially--where\nyour progress is mainly _through_ the houses, not _by_ them, and where\nprivacy is a thing practically unknown; a village which probably hadn\u2019t\nhad a house added to the jumble for five hundred years. We were anywhere\nfrom half a mile to a mile above the village when I gave the order to\nproceed to that place and tie up. Just then I glanced to my left toward\nthe distant mountain range, and got that soul-stirring shock which I\nhave said so much about. I pointed out the grand figure to the courier,\nand said:\n\n\u201cName it. Who is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNapoleon!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it is Napoleon. Show it to the sailor and ask him to name it.\u201d\n\nThe sailor said, \u201cNapoleon.\u201d We watched the figure all the time then\nuntil we reached the village. We walked up the river bank in the morning\nto see how far one might have to go before the shape would materially\nchange, but I do not now remember the result. We watched it afterward as\nwe floated away from the village, but I cannot remember at what point\nthe shape began to be marred. However, the mountains being some miles\naway, I think that the figure would be recognizable as Napoleon along a\nstretch of as much as a mile above and a mile below the village, though\nI think that the likeness would be strongest at the point where I first\nsaw it--that is, half a mile or more above the village.\n\nWe talked the grand apparition over at great length and with a strong\ninterest. I said I believed that if its presence were known to the world\nsuch shoals of tourists would come flocking there to see it that all the\nspare ground would soon be covered with hotels; and I think so yet. I\nthink it would soon be the most celebrated natural curiosity on the\nplanet, that it would be more visited than Niagara or the Alps, and that\nall the other famous natural curiosities of the globe would fall to a\nrank away below it. I think so still.\n\nThere is a line of lumbering and thundering great freight steamers on\nthe Rh\u00f4ne, and I think that if some man will board one of them at Arles\nand make a trip of some hours upstream--say from three to six--and keep\nan eye out to the right and watch that mountain range he will be certain\nto find the Lost Napoleon and have no difficulty in rediscovering the\nmighty statue when he comes to the right point. It will cost nothing to\nmake the experiment, and I hope it will be done.\n\n  NOTE.--Mark Twain\u2019s biographer rediscovered it in 1913. It is some\n  miles below Valence, opposite the village of Beauchastel.\n\n\n\n\n                       SOME NATIONAL STUPIDITIES\n                              (1891-1892)\n\n\nThe slowness of one section of the world about adopting the valuable\nideas of another section of it is a curious thing and unaccountable.\nThis form of stupidity is confined to no community, to no nation; it is\nuniversal. The fact is the human race is not only slow about borrowing\nvaluable ideas--it sometimes persists in not borrowing them at all.\n\nTake the German stove, for instance--the huge white porcelain monument\nthat towers toward the ceiling in the corner of the room, solemn,\nunsympathetic, and suggestive of death and the grave--where can you find\nit outside of the German countries? I am sure I have never seen it where\nGerman was not the language of the region. Yet it is by long odds the\nbest stove and the most convenient and economical that has yet been\ninvented.[5]\n\nTo the uninstructed stranger it promises nothing; but he will soon find\nthat it is a masterly performer, for all that. It has a little bit of a\ndoor which you couldn\u2019t get your head into--a door which seems foolishly\nout of proportion to the rest of the edifice; yet the door is right, for\nit is not necessary that bulky fuel shall enter it. Small-sized fuel is\nused, and marvelously little of that. The door opens into a tiny cavern\nwhich would not hold more fuel than a baby could fetch in its arms. The\nprocess of firing is quick and simple. At half past seven on a cold\nmorning the servant brings a small basketful of slender pine sticks--say\na modified armful--and puts half of these in, lights them with a match,\nand closes the door. They burn out in ten or twelve minutes. He then\nputs in the rest and _locks_ the door, and carries off the key. The work\nis done. He will not come again until next morning. All day long and\nuntil past midnight all parts of the room will be delightfully warm and\ncomfortable, and there will be no headaches and no sense of closeness or\noppression. In an American room, whether heated by steam, hot water, or\nopen fires, the neighborhood of the register or the fireplace is\nwarmest--the heat is not equally diffused through the room; but in a\nGerman room one is as comfortable in one part of it as in another.\nNothing is gained or lost by being near the stove. Its surface is not\nhot; you can put your hand on it anywhere and not get burnt. Consider\nthese things. One firing is enough for the day; the cost is next to\nnothing; the heat produced is the same all day, instead of too hot and\ntoo cold by turns; one may absorb himself in his business in peace; he\ndoes not need to feel any anxieties or solicitudes about his fire; his\nwhole day is a realized dream of bodily comfort.\n\nThe German stove is not restricted to wood; peat is used in it, and coal\nbricks also. These coal bricks are made of waste coal dust pressed in a\nmold. In effect they are dirt and in fact are dirt cheap. The brick is\nabout as big as your two fists; the stove will burn up twenty of them in\nhalf an hour, then it will need no more fuel for that day.\n\nThis noble stove is at its very best when its front has a big square\nopening in it for a _visible_ wood fire. The real heating is done in the\nhidden regions of the great structure, of course--the open fire is\nmerely to rejoice your eye and gladden your heart.\n\nAmerica could adopt this stove, but does America do it? No, she sticks\nplacidly to her own fearful and wonderful inventions in the stove line.\nShe has fifty kinds, and not a rational one in the lot. The American\nwood stove, of whatsoever breed, is a terror. There can be no\ntranquillity of mind where it is. It requires more attention than a\nbaby. It has to be fed every little while, it has to be watched all the\ntime; and for all reward you are roasted half your time and frozen the\nother half. It warms no part of the room but its own part; it breeds\nheadaches and suffocation, and makes one\u2019s skin feel dry and feverish;\nand when your wood bill comes in you think you have been supporting a\nvolcano.\n\nWe have in America many and many a breed of coal stoves, also--fiendish\nthings, everyone of them. The base-burner sort are handy and require but\nlittle attention; but none of them, of whatsoever kind, distributes its\nheat uniformly through the room, or keeps it at an unvarying\ntemperature, or fails to take the life out of the atmosphere and leave\nit stuffy and smothery and stupefying.\n\nIt seems to me that the ideal of comfort would be a German stove to heat\none\u2019s room, and an open wood fire to make it cheerful; then have\nfurnace-heat in the halls. We could easily find some way to make the\nGerman stove beautiful, and that is all it needs at present. Still, even\nas it is to-day, it is lovely, it is a darling, compared with any\n\u201cradiator\u201d that has yet been intruded upon the world. That odious gilded\nskeleton! It makes all places ugly that it inhabits--just by contagion.\n\nIt is certainly strange that useful customs and devices do not spread\nfrom country to country with more facility and promptness than they do.\nYou step across the German border almost anywhere, and suddenly the\nGerman stove has disappeared. In Italy you find a foolish and\nineffectual modification of it, in Paris you find an unprepossessing\n\u201cadaptation\u201d of our base-burner on a reduced pattern.\n\nFifteen years ago Paris had a cheap and cunning little fire kindler\nconsisting of a pine shaving, curled as it came from the carpenter\u2019s\nplane, and gummed over with an inflammable substance which would burn\nseveral minutes and set fire to the most obdurate wood. It was cheap and\nhandy, but no stranger carried the idea home with him. Paris has another\nswift and victorious kindler, now, in the form of a small black cake\nmade of I don\u2019t know what; but you shove it under the wood and touch a\nmatch to it and your fire is made. No one will think to carry that\ndevice to America, or elsewhere. In America we prefer to kindle the fire\nwith the kerosene can and chance the inquest. I have been in a multitude\nof places where pine cones were abundant, but only in the French Riviera\nand in one place in Italy have I seen them in the wood box to kindle the\nfires with.\n\nFor perfect adaptation to the service required, look at the American gum\nshoe and the American arctic. Their virtues ought to have carried them\nto all wet and snowy lands; but they haven\u2019t done anything of the kind.\nThere are few places on the continent of Europe where one can buy them.\n\nAnd observe how slowly our typewriting machine makes its way. In the\ngreat city of Florence I was able to find only one place where I could\nget typewriting done; and then it was not done by a native, but by an\nAmerican girl. In the great city of Munich I found one typewriting\nestablishment, but the operator was sick and that suspended the\nbusiness. I was told that there was no opposition house. In the\nprodigious city of Berlin I was not able to find a typewriter at all.\nThere was not even one in our Embassy or its branches. Our\nrepresentative there sent to London for the best one to be had in that\ncapital, and got an incapable, who would have been tarred and feathered\nin Mud Springs, Arizona. Four years ago a typewritten page was a seldom\nsight in Europe, and when you saw it it made you heartsick, it was so\ninartistic, and so blurred and shabby and slovenly. It was because the\nEuropeans made the machines themselves, and the making of nice machinery\nis not one of their gifts. England imports ours, now. This is wise; she\nwill have her reward.\n\nIn all these years the American fountain pen has hardly got a start in\nEurope. There is no market for it. It is too handy, too inspiring, too\ncapable, too much of a time saver. The dismal steel pen and the\ncompass-jawed quill are preferred. And semi-liquid mud is preferred to\nink, apparently, everywhere in Europe. This in face of the fact that\nthere is ink to be had in America--and at club rates, too.\n\nThen there is the elevator, lift, _ascenseur_. America has had the\nbenefit of this invaluable contrivance for a generation and a half, and\nit is now used in all our cities and villages, in all hotels, in all\nlofty business buildings and factories, and in many private dwellings.\nBut we can\u2019t spread it, we can\u2019t beguile Europe with it. In Europe an\nelevator is even to this day a rarity and a curiosity. Especially a\ncuriosity. As a rule it seats but three or four persons--often only\ntwo--and it travels so slowly and cautiously and timorously and piously\nand solemnly that it makes a person feel creepy and crawly and scary and\ndismal and repentant. Anybody with sound legs can give the continental\nelevator two flights the start and beat it to the sixth floor. Every\ntime these nations merely import an American idea, instead of importing\nthe concreted thing itself, the result is a failure. They tried to make\nthe sewing machine, and couldn\u2019t; they are trying to make fountain pens\nand typewriters and can\u2019t; they are making these dreary elevators,\nnow--and patenting them! Satire can no further go.\n\nI think that as a rule we develop a borrowed European idea forward, and\nthat Europe develops a borrowed American idea backward. We borrowed gas\nlighting and the railroad from England, and the arc light from France,\nand these things have improved under our culture. We have lent Europe\nour tramway, telegraph, sewing machine, phonograph, telephone, and\nkodak, and while we may not claim that in these particular instances she\nhas developed them backward, we are justified in claiming that she has\nadded no notable improvements to them. We have added the improvements\nourselves and she has accepted them. Why she has not accepted and\nuniversally adopted the improved elevator is a surprising and puzzling\nthing. Its rightful place is among the great ideas of our great age. It\nis an epoch maker. It is a concentrator of population, and economizer of\nroom. It is going to build our cities skyward instead of out toward the\nhorizons.[6] It is going to enable five millions of people to live\ncomfortably on the same ground space that one million uncomfortably\nlives on now. It is going to make cheap quarters for Tom, Dick, and\nHarry near their work, in place of three miles from it, as is the rule\nto-day. It is going to save them the necessity of adding a six-flight\nclimb to the already sufficient fatigue of their day\u2019s labor.\n\nWe imitate some of the good things which we find in Europe, and we ought\nto imitate more of them. At the same time Europe ought to imitate us\nsomewhat more than she does. The crusty, ill-mannered and in every way\ndetestable Parisian cabman ought to imitate our courteous and friendly\nBoston cabman--and stop there. He can\u2019t learn anything from the guild in\nNew York. And it would morally help the Parisian shopkeeper if he would\nimitate the fair dealing of his American cousin. With us it is not\nnecessary to ask the price of small articles before we buy them, but in\nParis the person who fails to take that precaution will get scorched. In\nbusiness we are prompt, fair, and trustworthy in all our small trade\nmatters. It is the rule. In the friendliest spirit I would recommend\nFrance to imitate these humble virtues. Particularly in the kodak\nbusiness. Pray get no kodak pictures developed in France--and especially\nin Nice. They will send you your bill to Rome or Jericho, or\nwhithersoever you have gone, but that is all you will get. You will\nnever see your negatives again, or the developed pictures, either. And\nby and by the head house in Paris will demand payment once more, and\nconstructively threaten you with \u201cproceedings.\u201d If you inquire if they\nmailed your package across the frontier without registering it, they are\ncoldly silent. If you inquire how they expected to trace and recover a\nlost package without a post-office receipt, they are dumb again. A\nlittle intelligence inserted into the kodak business in those regions\nwould be helpful, if it could be done without shock.\n\nBut the worst of all is, that Europe cannot be persuaded to imitate our\nrailway methods. Two or three years ago I liked the European methods,\nbut experience has dislodged that superstition. All over the Continent\nthe system--to call it by an extravagant term--is sufficiently poor and\nslow and clumsy, or unintelligent; but in these regards Italy and France\nare entitled to the chromo. In Italy it takes more than half an hour to\nbuy a through ticket to Paris at Cook & Sons\u2019 offices, there is such a\nformidable amount of red tape and recording connected with the vast\ntransaction. Every little detail of the matter must be written down in a\nset of books--your name, condition, nationality, religion, date, hour,\nnumber of the train, and all that; and at last you get your ticket and\nthink you are done, but you are not; it must be carried to the station\nand stamped; and even that is not the end, for if you stop over at any\npoint it must be stamped again or it is forfeited. And yet you save time\nand trouble by going to Cook instead of to the station. Buying your\nticket does not finish your job. Your trunks must be weighed, and paid\nfor at about human-being rates. This takes another quarter of an hour of\nyour time--perhaps half an hour if you are at the tail of the\nprocession. You get paper checks, which are twice as easy to lose as\nbrass ones. You cannot secure a seat beforehand, but must take your\nchances with the general rush to the train. If you have your family with\nyou, you may have to distribute them among several cars. There is one\nannoying feature which is common all over the Continent, and that is,\nthat if you want to make a short journey you cannot buy your ticket\nwhenever you find the ticket office open, but must wait until it is\ndoing business for your particular train; and that only begins, as a\nrule, a quarter of an hour before the train\u2019s time of starting. The cars\nare most ingeniously inconvenient, cramped, and uncomfortable, and in\nItaly they are phenomenally dirty. The European \u201csystem\u201d was devised\neither by a maniac or by a person whose idea was to hamper, bother, and\nexasperate the traveler in all conceivable ways and sedulously and\npainstakingly discourage custom. In Italy, as far as my experience goes,\nit is the custom to use the sleeping cars on the day trains and take\nthem off when the sun goes down. One thing is sure, anyway: if that is\nnot the case, it will be, presently, when they think of it. They can be\ndepended upon to snap up as darling an idea as that with joy.\n\nNo, we are bad enough about not importing valuable European ideas, but\nEurope is still slower about introducing ours. Europe has always--from\naway back--been neglectful in this regard. Take our admirable postal and\nexpress system, for instance. We had it perfectly developed and running\nsmoothly and beautifully more than three hundred years ago; and Europe\ncame over and admired it and eloquently praised it--but didn\u2019t adopt it.\nWe Americans.... But let Prescott tell about it. I quote from the\n_Conquest of Peru_, chapter 2, vol. 1:\n\n  As the distance each courier had to perform was small, they ran over\n  the ground with great swiftness, and messages were carried through the\n  whole extent of the long routes at the rate of a hundred and fifty\n  miles a day. Their office was not limited to carrying dispatches. They\n  brought various articles. Fish from the distant ocean, fruits, game,\n  and different commodities from the hot regions of the coast were taken\n  to the capital in good condition. It is remarkable that this important\n  institution should have been found among two barbarian nations of the\n  New World long before it was introduced among the civilized nations of\n  Europe. By these wise contrivances of the Incas, the most distant\n  parts of the long-extended empire of Peru were brought into intimate\n  relations with each other. And while the capitals of Christendom, but\n  a few hundred miles apart, remained as far asunder as if seas had\n  rolled between them, the great capitals Cuzco and Quito were placed in\n  immediate correspondence. Intelligence from the numerous provinces was\n  transmitted on the wings of the wind to the Peruvian metropolis, the\n  great focus to which all the lines of communication converged.\n\nThere--that is what we had, three hundred and twenty-five years before\nEurope had anything that could be called a businesslike and effective\npostal and express service. We are a great people. We have always been a\ngreat people, from the start: always alive, alert, up early in the\nmorning, and ready to teach. But Europe has been a slow and discouraging\npupil from the start; always, from the very start. It seems to me that\nsomething ought to be done about this.\n\n-----\n\nFootnote 5:\n\n  Compare with his remarks on the same subject, in \u201cMarienbad--A Health\n  Factory,\u201d written about a year earlier.\n\nFootnote 6:\n\n  This was good prophecy. There were no skyscrapers in New York City\n  when it was written.\n\n\n\n\n                    THE CHOLERA EPIDEMIC IN HAMBURG\n                                 (1892)\n\n\nI believe I have never been so badly situated before as I have been\nduring these last four weeks. To begin with, the time-hallowed and\nbusiness-worn thunderbolt out of the clear sky fell about the 18th of\nAugust--people in Hamburg dying like flies of something resembling\ncholera! A normal death rate of forty a day suddenly transformed into a\nterrific daily slaughter without notice to anybody to prepare for such a\nsurprise! Certainly that was recognizable as that kind of a thunderbolt.\n\nIt was at this point that the oddity of the situation above referred to\nbegan. For you will grant that it is odd to live four weeks a\ntwelve-hour journey from a devastating plague nest and remain baffled\nand defeated all that time in all your efforts to get at the state of\nthe case there. Naturally one flies to the newspapers when a pestilence\nbreaks out in his neighborhood. He feels sure of one thing, at any rate:\nthat the paper will cast all other interests into the background and\ndevote itself to the one supreme interest of the day; that it will throw\nwide its columns and cram them with information, valuable and otherwise,\nconcerning that great event; and that it will even leave out the idle\njaunts of little dukes and kinglets to make room for the latest plague\nitem. I sought the newspapers, and was disappointed. I know now that\nnothing that can happen in this world can stir the German daily journal\nout of its eternal lethargy. When the Last Day comes it will note the\ndestruction of the world in a three-line paragraph and turn over and go\nto sleep again.\n\nThis sort of journalism furnishes plenty of wonders. I have seen\nostensible telegrams from Hamburg four days old, gravely put forth as\nnews, and no apology offered. I have tracked a news item from one paper\nto another day after day until it died of old age and fatigue--and yet\neverybody treated it with respect, nobody laughed. Is it believable that\nthese antiquities are forwarded by telegraph? It would be more rational\nto send them by slow freight, because less expensive and more speedy.\n\nThen, the meagerness of the news meal is another marvel. That department\nof the paper is not headed \u201cPoverty Column,\u201d nobody knows why. We know\nthat multitudes of people are being swept away daily in Hamburg, yet the\ndaily telegrams from there could be copied on a half page of note paper,\nas a rule. If any newspaper has sent a special reporter thither he has\nnot arrived yet.\n\nThe final miracle of all is the character of this daily dribble of\nso-called news. The wisest man in the world can get no information out\nof it. It is an Irish stew made up of unrelated odds and ends, a mere\nchaotic confusion and worthless. What can one make out of statistics\nlike these:\n\nUp to noon, 655 cases, 333 deaths. Of these 189 were previously\nreported.\n\nThe report that 650 bodies are lying unburied is not true. There are\nonly 340, and the most of these will be buried to-night.\n\nThere are 2,062 cases in the hospitals, 215 deaths.\n\nThe figures are never given in such a way as to afford one an\nopportunity to compare the death list of one day with that of another;\nconsequently there is no way of finding out whether the pest abates or\nincreases. Sometimes a report uses the expression \u201cto-day\u201d and does not\nsay when the day began or ended; sometimes the deaths for several days\nare bunched together in a divisionless lump; sometimes the figures make\nyou think the deaths are five or six hundred a day, while other figures\nin the same paragraph seem to indicate that the rate is below two\nhundred.\n\nA day or two ago the word cholera was not discoverable at all in that\nday\u2019s issue of one of our principal dailies; in to-day\u2019s issue of the\nsame paper there is no cholera report from Hamburg. Yet a private letter\nfrom there says the raging pestilence is actually increasing.\n\nOne might imagine that the papers are forbidden to publish cholera news.\nI had that impression myself. It seemed the only explanation of the\nabsence of special Hamburg correspondence. But it appears now, that the\nHamburg papers are crammed with matter pertaining to the cholera,\ntherefore that idea was an error. How does one find this out? In this\namazing way: that a daily newspaper located ten or twelve hours from\nHamburg describes with owl-eyed wonder the stirring contents of a\nHamburg daily journal _six days old_, and yet gets from it the only\ninforming matter, the only matter worth reading, which it has yet\npublished from that smitten city concerning the pestilence.\n\nYou see, it did not even occur to that petrified editor to bail his\ncolumns dry of their customary chloroform and copy that Hamburg journal\nentire. He is so used to shoveling gravel that he doesn\u2019t know a diamond\nwhen he sees it. I would trust that man with untold bushels of precious\nnews, and nobody to watch him. Among other things which he notes in the\nHamburg paper is the fact that its supplements contained one hundred of\nthe customary elaborate and formal German death notices. That\nmeans--what nobody has had reason to suppose before--that the slaughter\nis not confined to the poor and friendless. I think so, because that\nsort of death notice occupies a formidable amount of space in an\nadvertising page, and must cost a good deal of money.\n\nI wander from my proper subject to observe that one hundred of these\nnotices in a single journal must make that journal a sorrow to the eye\nand a shock to the taste, even among the Germans themselves, who are\nbred to endure and perhaps enjoy a style of \u201cdisplay ads\u201d which far\nsurpasses even the vilest American attempts, for insane and outrageous\nugliness. Sometimes a death notice is as large as a foolscap page, has\nbig black display lines, and is bordered all around with a coarse\nmourning border as thick as your finger. The notices are of all sizes\nfrom foolscap down to a humble two-inch square, and they suggest\nlamentation of all degrees, from the hundred-dollar hurricane of grief\nto the two-shilling sigh of a composed and modest regret. A newspaper\npage blocked out with mourning compartments of fifty different sizes\nflung together without regard to order or system or size must be a\nspectacle to see.\n\n  +--------------------------------------------------------+\n  ||\n  |Todes-Anzeige.|\n  |-------------|\n  ||\n  |TheilnehmendenFreundenundBekanntenhierdurch|\n  |dieschmerzlicheNachricht,da\u00dfmeinlieberFreund|\n  |undlangj\u00e4hriger,treuerMitarbeiter       |\n  ||\n  | RudolfBeck|\n  ||\n  |gesternAbendaneinemHerzschlagpl\u00f6tzlichverschieden|\n  |ist.|\n  ||\n  |=Langen=,den5.September1892.|\n  ||\n  | OttoSteingoetter|\n  ||\n  | Firma=Beck&Steingoetter=.|\n  ||\n  |DieBeerdigungfindetDienstag,den6.Sept.,|\n  |Nachmittags3\u00bdUhr,statt.|\n  |25958|\n  +--------------------------------------------------------+\n\nThe notice copied above is modest and straightforward. The advertiser\ninforms sympathizing friends and acquaintances that his dear friend and\nold and faithful fellow laborer has been suddenly smitten with death;\nthen signs his name and adds \u201cof the firm of Beck & Steingoetter,\u201d which\nis perhaps another way of saying that the business will be continued as\nusual at the old stand. The average notice is often refreshed with a\nwhiff of business at the end.\n\nThe 100 formal notices in the Hamburg paper did not mean merely 100\ndeaths; each told of one death, but many of them told of more--in some\ncases they told of four and five. In the same issue there were 132\none-line death notices. If the dates of these deaths were all stated,\nthe 232 notices together could be made the basis of a better guess at\nthe current mortality in Hamburg than the \u201cofficial\u201d reports furnished,\nperhaps. You would know that a certain number died on a certain day who\nleft behind them people able to publish the fact and pay for it. Then\nyou could correctly assume that the vast bulk of that day\u2019s harvest were\npeople who were penniless and left penniless friends behind. You could\nadd your facts to your assumption and get _some_ sort of idea of the\ndeath rate, and this would be strikingly better than the official\nreports, since they give you no idea at all.\n\nTo-day a physician was speaking of a private letter received here\nyesterday from a physician in Hamburg which stated that every day\nnumbers of poor people are snatched from their homes to the pest houses,\nand that that is the last that is heard of a good many of them. No\nintelligible record is kept; they die unknown and are buried so. That no\nintelligible record is kept seems proven by the fact that the public\ncannot get hold of a burial list for one day that is not made impossible\nby the record of the day preceding and the one following it.\n\nWhat I am trying to make the reader understand is, the strangeness of\nthe situation here--a mighty tragedy being played upon a stage that is\nclose to us, and yet we are as ignorant of its details as we should be\nif the stage were in China. We sit \u201cin front,\u201d and the audience is in\nfact the world; but the curtain is down and from behind it we hear only\nan inarticulate murmur. The Hamburg disaster must go into history as the\ndisaster without a history. And yet a well-trained newspaper staff would\nfind a way to secure an accurate list of the new hospital cases and the\nburials daily, and would do it, and not take it out in complaining of\nthe foolishness and futility of the official reports. Every day we know\nexactly what is going on in the two cholera-stricken ships in the harbor\nof New York. That is all the cholera news we get that is worth printing\nor believing.\n\nAll along we have heard rumors that the force of workers at Hamburg was\ntoo small to cope with the pestilence; that more help was impossible to\nget; and we have seen statements which confirmed these sorrowful facts;\nstatements which furnished the pitiful spectacle of brave workers dying\nat their posts from exhaustion; of corpses lying in the halls of the\nhospitals, waiting there because there was no worker idle; and now comes\nanother confirmatory item; it is in the physician\u2019s letter above\nreferred to--an item which shows you how hard pressed the authorities\nare by their colossal burden--an item which gives you a sudden and\nterrific sense of the situation there; for in a line it flashes before\nyou this ghastly picture, a thing seen by the physician: a wagon going\nalong the street with five sick people in it, and with them four\ncorpses!\n\n\n\n\n                        QUEEN VICTORIA\u2019S JUBILEE\n                                 (1897)\n\n\nSo far as I can see, a procession has value in but two ways--as a show\nand as a symbol; its minor function being to delight the eye, its major\none to compel thought, exalt the spirit, stir the heart, and inflame the\nimagination. As a mere show, and meaningless--like a Mardi-Gras march--a\nmagnificent procession is a sight worth a long journey to see; as a\nsymbol, the most colorless and unpicturesque procession, if it have a\nmoving history back of it, is worth a thousand of it.\n\nAfter the Civil War ten regiments of bronzed New York veterans marched\nup Broadway in faded uniforms and bearing faded battle flags that were\nmere shot-riddled rags--and in each battalion as it swung by, one noted\na great gap, an eloquent vacancy where had marched the comrades who had\nfallen and would march no more! Always, as this procession advanced\nbetween the massed multitudes, its approach was welcomed by each block\nof people with a burst of proud and grateful enthusiasm--then the head\nof it passed, and suddenly revealed those pathetic gaps, and silence\nfell upon that block; for every man in it had choked up, and could not\nget command of his voice and add it to the storm again for many minutes.\nThat was the most moving and tremendous effect that I have ever\nwitnessed--those affecting silences falling between those hurricanes of\nworshiping enthusiasm.\n\nThere was no costumery in that procession, no color, no tinsel, no\nbrilliancy, yet it was the greatest spectacle and the most gracious and\nexalting and beautiful that has come within my experience. It was\nbecause it had history back of it, and because it was a symbol, and\nstood for something, and because one viewed it with the spiritual\nvision, not the physical. There was not much for the physical eye to\nsee, but it revealed continental areas, limitless horizons, to the eye\nof the imagination and the spirit.\n\nA procession, to be valuable, must do one thing or the other--clothe\nitself in splendors and charm the eye, or symbolize something sublime\nand uplifting, and so appeal to the imagination. As a mere spectacle to\nlook at, I suppose that the Queen\u2019s procession will not be as showy as\nthe Tsar\u2019s late pageant; it will probably fall much short of the one in\nTannh\u00e4user in the matter of rich and adorable costumery; in the number\nof renowned personages on view in it, it will probably fall short of\nsome that have been seen in England before this. And yet in its major\nfunction, its symbolic function, I think that if all the people in it\nwore their everyday clothes and marched without flags or music, it would\nstill be incomparably the most memorable and most important procession\nthat ever moved through the streets of London.\n\nFor it will stand for English history, English growth, English\nachievement, the accumulated power and renown and dignity of twenty\ncenturies of strenuous effort. Many things about it will set one to\nreflecting upon what a large feature of this world England is to-day,\nand this will in turn move one, even the least imaginative, to cast a\nglance down her long perspective and note the steps of her progress and\nthe insignificance of her first estate. In this matter London is itself\na suggestive object lesson.\n\nI suppose that London has always existed. One cannot easily imagine an\nEngland that had no London. No doubt there was a village here 5,000\nyears ago. It was on the river somewhere west of where the Tower is now;\nit was built of thatched mud huts close to a couple of limpid brooks,\nand on every hand for miles and miles stretched rolling plains of fresh\ngreen grass, and here and there were groups and groves of trees. The\ntribes wore skins--sometimes merely their own, sometimes those of other\nanimals. The chief was monarch, and helped out his complexion with blue\npaint. His industry was the chase; his relaxation was war. Some of the\nEnglishmen who will view the procession to-day are carrying his ancient\nblood in their veins.\n\nIt may be that that village remained about as it began, away down to the\nRoman occupation, a couple of thousand years ago. It was still not much\nof a town when Alfred burned the cakes. Even when the Conqueror first\nsaw it, it did not amount to much. I think it must have been short of\ndistinguished architecture or he would not have traveled down into the\ncountry to the village of Westminster to get crowned. If you skip down\n350 years further you will find a London of some little consequence, but\nI believe that that is as much as you can say for it. Still, I am\ninterested in that London, for it saw the first two processions which\nwill live longer than any other in English history, I think; the date of\nthe one is 1415, that of the other is 1897.\n\nThe compactly built part of the London of 1415 was a narrow strip not a\nmile long, which stretched east and west through the middle of what is\nnow called \u201cthe City.\u201d The houses were densest in the region of\nCheapside. South of the strip were scattering residences which stood in\nturfy lawns which sloped to the river. North of the strip, fields and\ncountry homes extended to the walls. Let us represent that London by\nthree checker-board squares placed in a row; then open out a New York\nnewspaper like a book, and the space which it covers will properly\nrepresent the London of to-day by comparison. It is the difference\nbetween your hand and a blanket. It is possible that that ancient London\nhad 100,000 inhabitants, and that 100,000 outsiders came to town to see\nthe procession. The present London contains five or six million\ninhabitants, and it has been calculated that the population has jumped\nto 10,000,000 to-day.\n\nThe pageant of 1415 was to celebrate the gigantic victory of Agincourt,\nthen and still the most colossal in England\u2019s history.\n\nFrom that day to this there has been nothing that even approached it but\nPlassey. It was the third and greatest in the series of monster\nvictories won by the English over the French in the Hundred Years\u2019\nWar--Crecy, Poitiers, Agincourt. At Agincourt, according to history,\n15,000 English, under Henry V, defeated and routed an army of 100,000\nFrench. Sometimes history makes it 8,000 English and 60,000 French; but\nno matter, in both cases the proportions are preserved. Eight thousand\nof the French nobility were slain and the rest of the order taken\nprisoners--1,500 in number--among them the Dukes of Orl\u00e9ans and Bourbon\nand Marshal Boucicaut; and the victory left the whole northern half of\nFrance an English possession. This wholesale depletion of the\naristocracy made such a stringent scarcity in its ranks that when the\nyoung peasant girl, Joan of Arc, came to undo Henry\u2019s mighty work\nfourteen years later she could hardly gather together nobles enough to\nman her staff.\n\nThe battle of Agincourt was fought on the 25th of October, and a few\ndays later the tremendous news was percolating through England.\nPresently it was sweeping the country like a tidal wave, like a cyclone,\nlike a conflagration. Choose your own figure, there is no metaphor known\nto the language that can exaggerate the tempest of joy and pride and\nexultation that burst everywhere along the progress of that great news.\n\nThe king came home and brought his soldiers with him--he and they the\nidols of the nation, now. He brought his 1,500 captive knights and\nnobles, too--we shall not see any such output of blue blood as that\nto-day, bond or free. The king rested three weeks in his palace, the\nTower of London, while the people made preparations and prepared the\nwelcome due him. On the 22d of December all was ready.\n\nThere were no cables, no correspondents, no newspapers then--a\nregrettable defect, but not irremediable. A young man who would have\nbeen a correspondent if he had been born 500 years later was in London\nat the time, and he remembers the details. He has communicated them to\nme through a competent spirit medium, phrased in a troublesome mixture\nof obsolete English and moldy French, and I have thoroughly modernized\nhis story and put it into straight English, and will here record it. I\nwill explain that his Sir John Oldcastle is a person whom we do not know\nvery well by that name, nor much care for; but we know him well and\nadore him, too, under his other name--Sir John Falstaff. Also, I will\nremark that two miles of the Queen\u2019s progress to-day will be over ground\ntraversed by the procession of Henry V; all solid bricks and mortar,\nnow, but open country in Henry\u2019s day, and clothed in that unapproachable\nbeauty which has been the monopoly of sylvan England since the creation.\nAh, where now are those long-vanished forms, those unreturning feet! Let\nus not inquire too closely. Translated, this is the narrative of the\nspirit-correspondent, who is looking down upon me at this moment from\nhis high home, and admiring to see how the art and mystery of spelling\nhas improved since his time!\n\nNARRATIVE OF THE SPIRIT CORRESPONDENT\n\nI was commanded by my lord the Lord Mayor to make a report for the\narchives, and was furnished with a fleet horse, and with a paper\npermitting me to go anywhere at my will, without let or hindrance, even\nup and down the processional route, though no other person not of the\nprocession itself was allowed this unique privilege during the whole of\nthe 21st and the 22d.\n\nOn the morning of the 22d, toward noon, I rode from the Tower into the\ncity, and through it as far as St. Paul\u2019s. All the way, on both sides,\nall the windows, balconies, and roofs were crowded with people, and\nwherever there was a vacancy it had been built up in high tiers of seats\ncovered with red cloth, and these seats were also filled with people--in\nall cases in bright holiday attire--the woman of fashion barring the\nview from all in the rear with those tiresome extinguisher hats, which\nof late have grown to be a cloth-yard high. From every balcony depended\nsilken stuffs of splendid and various colors, and figured and pictured\nrich tapestries. It was brisk, sharp weather, but a rare one for sun,\nand when one looked down this swinging double wall of beautiful fabrics,\nglowing and flashing and changing color like prisms in the flooding\nlight, it was a most fair sight to see. And there were frequent May\npoles, garlanded to their tops, and from the tops swung sheaves of\nsilken long ribbons of all bright colors, which in the light breeze\nwrithed and twisted and prettily mingled themselves together.\n\nI rode solitary--in state, as it might be--and was envied, as I could\nsee, and did not escape comment, but had a plenty of it; for the\nconduits were running gratis wine, and the results were accumulating. I\ngot many ribald compliments on my riding, on my clothes, on my office.\nEverybody was happy, so it was best to seem so myself, which I did--for\nthose people\u2019s aim was better than their eggs.\n\nA place had been reserved for me on a fine and fanciful erection in St.\nPaul\u2019s Churchyard, and there I waited for the procession. It seemed a\nlong time, but at last a dull booming sound arose in the distance, and\nafter a while we saw the banners and the head of the procession come\ninto view, and heard the muffled roar of voices that welcomed it. The\nroar moved continuously toward us, growing steadily louder and louder,\nand stronger and stronger, and with it the bray and crash of music; and\npresently it was right with us, and seemed to roll over us and submerge\nus, and stun us, and deafen us--and behold, there was the hero of\nAgincourt passing by!\n\nAll the multitude was standing up, red-faced, frantic, bellowing,\nshouting, the tears running down their faces; and through the storm of\nwaving hats and handkerchiefs one glimpsed the battle banners and the\ndrifting host of marching men as through a dimming flurry of snow.\n\nThe king, tall, slender, handsome, rode with his visor up, that all\nmight see his face. He was clad in his silver armor from head to heel,\nand had his great two-handed sword at his side, his battle-ax at his\npommel, his shield upon his arm, and about his helmet waved and tossed a\nwhite mass of fluffy plumes. On either side of him rode the captive\ndukes, plumed like himself, but wearing long crimson satin gowns over\ntheir armor; after these came the French marshal similarly habited;\nafter him followed the fifteen hundred French knights, with robes of\nvarious colors over their armor, and with each two rode two English\nknights, sometimes robed in various colors, sometimes in white with a\nred cross on the shoulder, these white-clad ones being Knights Templars.\nEvery man of the three thousand bore his shield upon his left arm, newly\npolished and burnished, and on it was his device.\n\nAs the king passed the church he bowed his head and lifted his shield,\nand by one impulse all the knights did the same; and so as far down the\nline as the eye could reach one saw the lifted shields simultaneously\ncatch the sun, and it was like a sudden mile-long shaft of flashing\nlight; and, Lord! it lit up that dappled sea of color with a glory like\n\u201cthe golden vortex in the west over the foundered sun\u201d! (The\nintroduction of this quotation is very interesting, for it shows that\nour literature of to-day has a circulation in heaven--pirated editions,\nno doubt.--M.T.)\n\nThe knights were a long time in passing; then came 5,000 Agincourt\nmen-at-arms, and they were a long time; and at the very end, last of\nall, came that intolerable old tun of sack and godless ruffler, Sir John\nOldcastle (now risen from the dead for the third time), fat-faced,\npurple with the spirit of bygone and lamented drink, smiling his\nhospitable, wide smile upon all the world, leering at the women,\nwallowing about in his saddle, proclaiming his valorous deeds as fast as\nhe could lie, taking the whole glory of Agincourt to his single self,\nmeasuring off the miles of his slain and then multiplying them by 5, 7,\n10, 15, as inspiration after inspiration came to his help--the most\ninhuman spectacle in England, a living, breathing outrage, a slander\nupon the human race; and after him came, mumming and blethering, his\ninfamous lieutenants; and after them his \u201cpaladins,\u201d as he calls them,\nthe mangiest lot of starvelings and cowards that was ever littered, the\ndisgrace of the noblest pageant that England has ever seen. God rest\ntheir souls in the place appointed for all such!\n\nThere was a moment of prayer at the Temple, the procession moved down\nthe country road, its way walled on both sides by welcoming multitudes,\nand so, by Charing Cross, and at last to the Abbey for the great\nceremonies. It was a grand day, and will remain in men\u2019s memories.\n\n\nThat was as much of it as the spirit correspondent could let me have; he\nwas obliged to stop there because he had an engagement to sing in the\nchoir, and was already late.\n\nThe contrast between that old England and the present England is one of\nthe things which will make the pageant of the present day impressive and\nthought-breeding. The contrast between the England of the Queen\u2019s reign\nand the England of any previous British reign is also an impressive\nthing. British history is two thousand years old, and yet in a good many\nways the world has moved further ahead since the Queen was born than it\nmoved in all the rest of the two thousand put together. A large part of\nthis progress has been moral, but naturally the material part of it is\nthe most striking and the easiest to measure. Since the Queen first saw\nthe light she has seen invented and brought into use (with the exception\nof the cotton gin, the spinning frames, and the steamboat) every one of\nthe myriad of strictly modern inventions which, by their united powers,\nhave created the bulk of the modern civilization and made life under it\neasy and difficult, convenient and awkward, happy and horrible, soothing\nand irritating, grand and trivial, an indispensable blessing and an\nunimaginable curse--she has seen all these miracles, these wonders,\nthese marvels piled up in her time, and yet she is but seventy-eight\nyears old. That is to say, she has seen more things invented than any\nother monarch that ever lived; and more than the oldest old-time English\ncommoner that ever lived, including Old Parr; and more than Methuselah\nhimself--five times over.\n\nSome of the details of the moral advancement which she has seen are also\nvery striking and easily graspable.\n\nShe has seen the English criminal laws prodigiously modified, and 200\ncapital crimes swept from the statute book.\n\nShe has seen English liberty greatly broadened--the governing and\nlawmaking powers, formerly the possession of the few, extended to the\nbody of the people, and purchase in the army abolished.\n\nShe has seen the public educator--the newspaper--created, and its\nteachings placed within the reach of the leanest purse. There was\nnothing properly describable as a newspaper until long after she was\nborn.\n\nShe has seen the world\u2019s literature set free, through the institution of\ninternational copyright.\n\nShe has seen America invent arbitration, the eventual substitute for\nthat enslaver of nations, the standing army; and she has seen England\npay the first bill under it, and America shirk the second--but only\ntemporarily; of this we may be sure.\n\nShe has seen a Hartford American (Doctor Wells) apply an\u00e6sthetics in\nsurgery for the first time in history, and for all time banish the\nterrors of the surgeon\u2019s knife; and she has seen the rest of the world\nignore the discoverer and a Boston doctor steal the credit of his work.\n\nShe has seen medical science and scientific sanitation cut down the\ndeath rate of civilized cities by more than half, and she has seen these\nagencies set bounds to the European march of the cholera and imprison\nthe Black Death in its own home.\n\nShe has seen woman freed from the oppression of many burdensome and\nunjust laws; colleges established for her; privileged to earn degrees in\nmen\u2019s colleges--but not get them; in some regions rights accorded to her\nwhich lifted her near to political equality with man, and a hundred\nbread-winning occupations found for her where hardly one existed\nbefore--among them medicine, the law, and professional nursing. The\nQueen has herself recognized merit in her sex; of the 501 lordships\nwhich she has conferred in sixty years, one was upon a woman.\n\nThe Queen has seen the right to organize trade unions extended to the\nworkman, after that right had been the monopoly of guilds of masters for\nsix hundred years.\n\nShe has seen the workman rise into political notice, then into political\nforce, then (in some parts of the world) into the chief and commanding\npolitical force; she has seen the day\u2019s labor of twelve, fourteen, and\neighteen hours reduced to eight, a reform which has made labor a means\nof extending life instead of a means of committing salaried suicide.\n\nBut it is useless to continue the list--it has no end.\n\nThere will be complexions in the procession to-day which will suggest\nthe vast distances to which the British dominion has extended itself\naround the fat rotundity of the globe since Britain was a remote unknown\nback settlement of savages with tin for sale, two or three thousand\nyears ago; and also how great a part of this extension is comparatively\nrecent; also, how surprisingly speakers of the English tongue have\nincreased within the Queen\u2019s time.\n\nWhen the Queen was born there were not more than 25,000,000\nEnglish-speaking people in the world; there are about 120,000,000 now.\nThe other long-reign queen, Elizabeth, ruled over a short 100,000 square\nmiles of territory and perhaps 5,000,000 subjects; Victoria reigns over\nmore territory than any other sovereign in the world\u2019s history ever\nreigned over; her estate covers a fourth part of the habitable area of\nthe globe, and her subjects number about 400,000,000.\n\nIt is indeed a mighty estate, and I perceive now that the English are\nmentioned in the Bible:\n\n\u201cBlessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.\u201d\n\nThe Long-Reign Pageant will be a memorable thing to see, for it stands\nfor the grandeur of England, and is full of suggestion as to how it had\nits beginning and what have been the forces that have built it up.\n\nI got to my seat in the Strand just in time--five minutes past ten--for\na glance around before the show began. The houses opposite, as far as\nthe eye could reach in both directions, suggested boxes in a theater\nsnugly packed. The gentleman next to me likened the groups to beds of\nflowers, and said he had never seen such a massed and multitudinous\narray of bright colors and fine clothes.\n\nThese displays rose up and up, story by story, all balconies and windows\nbeing packed, and also the battlements stretching along the roofs. The\nsidewalks were filled with standing people, but were not uncomfortably\ncrowded. They were fenced from the roadway by red-coated soldiers, a\ndouble stripe of vivid color which extended throughout the six miles\nwhich the procession would traverse.\n\nFive minutes later the head of the column came into view and was\npresently filing by, led by Captain Ames, the tallest man in the British\narmy. And then the cheering began. It took me but a little while to\ndetermine that this procession could not be described. There was going\nto be too much of it, and too much variety in it, so I gave up the idea.\nIt was to be a spectacle for the kodak, not the pen.\n\nPresently the procession was without visible beginning or end, but\nstretched to the limit of sight in both directions--bodies of soldiery\nin blue, followed by a block of soldiers in buff, then a block of red, a\nblock of buff, a block of yellow, and so on, an interminable drift of\nswaying and swinging splotches of strong color sparkling and flashing\nwith shifty light reflected from bayonets, lance heads, brazen helmets,\nand burnished breastplates. For varied and beautiful uniforms and\nunceasing surprises in the way of new and unexpected splendors, it much\nsurpassed any pageant that I have ever seen.\n\nI was not dreaming of so stunning a show. All the nations seemed to be\nfiling by. They all seemed to be represented. It was a sort of\nallegorical suggestion of the Last Day, and some who live to see that\nday will probably recall this one if they are not too much disturbed in\nmind at the time.\n\nThere were five bodies of Oriental soldiers of five different\nnationalities, with complexions differentiated by five distinct shades\nof yellow. There were about a dozen bodies of black soldiers from\nvarious parts of Africa, whose complexions covered as many shades of\nblack, and some of these were the very blackest people I have ever seen\nyet.\n\nThen there was an exhaustive exhibition of the hundred separate brown\nraces of India, the most beautiful and satisfying of all the complexions\nthat have been vouchsafed to man, and the one which best sets off\ncolored clothes and best harmonizes with all tints.\n\nThe Chinese, the Japanese, the Koreans, the Africans, the Indians, the\nPacific Islanders--they were all there, and with them samples of all the\nwhites that inhabit the wide reach of the Queen\u2019s dominions.\n\nThe procession was the human race on exhibition, a spectacle curious and\ninteresting and worth traveling far to see. The most splendid of the\ncostumes were those worn by the Indian princes, and they were also the\nmost beautiful and richest. They were men of stately build and princely\ncarriage, and wherever they passed the applause burst forth.\n\nSoldiers, soldiers, soldiers, and still more and more soldiers and\ncannon and muskets and lances--there seemed to be no end to this\nfeature. There are 50,000 soldiers in London, and they all seemed to be\non hand. I have not seen so many except in the theater, when thirty-five\nprivates and a general march across the stage and behind the scenes and\nacross the front again and keep it up till they have represented\n300,000.\n\nIn the early part of the procession the colonial premiers drove by, and\nby and by after a long time there was a grand output of foreign princes,\nthirty-one in the invoice.\n\nThe feature of high romance was not wanting, for among them rode Prince\nRupert of Bavaria, who would be Prince of Wales now and future king of\nEngland and emperor of India if his Stuart ancestors had conducted their\nroyal affairs more wisely than they did. He came as a peaceful guest to\nrepresent his mother, Princess Ludwig, heiress of the house of Stuart,\nto whom English Jacobites still pay unavailing homage as the rightful\nqueen of England.\n\nThe house of Stuart was formally and officially shelved nearly two\ncenturies ago, but the microbe of Jacobite loyalty is a thing which is\nnot exterminable by time, force, or argument.\n\nAt last, when the procession had been on view an hour and a half,\ncarriages began to appear. In the first came a detachment of two-horse\nones containing ambassadors extraordinary, in one of them Whitelaw Reid,\nrepresenting the United States; then six containing minor foreign and\ndomestic princes and princesses; then five four-horse carriages\nfreighted with offshoots of the family.\n\nThe excitement was growing now; interest was rising toward the boiling\npoint. Finally a landau driven by eight cream-colored horses, most\nlavishly upholstered in gold stuffs, with postilions and no drivers, and\npreceded by Lord Wolseley, came bowling along, followed by the Prince of\nWales, and all the world rose to its feet and uncovered.\n\nThe Queen Empress was come. She was received with great enthusiasm. It\nwas realizable that she was the procession herself; that all the rest of\nit was mere embroidery; that in her the public saw the British Empire\nitself. She was a symbol, an allegory of England\u2019s grandeur and the\nmight of the British name.\n\nIt is over now; the British Empire has marched past under review and\ninspection. The procession stood for sixty years of progress and\naccumulation, moral, material, and political. It was made up rather of\nthe beneficiaries of these prosperities than of the creators of them.\n\nAs far as mere glory goes, the foreign trade of Great Britain has grown\nin a wonderful way since the Queen ascended the throne. Last year it\nreached the enormous figure of \u00a3620,000,000, but the capitalist, the\nmanufacturer, the merchant, and the workingmen were not officially in\nthe procession to get their large share of the resulting glory.\n\nGreat Britain has added to her real estate an average of 165 miles of\nterritory per day for the past sixty years, which is to say she has\nadded more than the bulk of an England proper per year, or an aggregate\nof seventy Englands in the sixty years.\n\nBut Cecil Rhodes was not in the procession; the Chartered Company was\nabsent from it. Nobody was there to collect his share of the glory due\nfor his formidable contributions to the imperial estate. Even Doctor\nJameson was out, and yet he had tried so hard to accumulate territory.\n\nEleven colonial premiers were in the procession, but the dean of the\norder, the imperial Premier, was not, nor the Lord Chief Justice of\nEngland, nor the Speaker of the House. The bulk of the religious\nstrength of England dissent was not officially represented in the\nreligious ceremonials. At the Cathedral that immense new industry,\nspeculative expansion, was not represented unless the pathetic shade of\nBarnato rode invisible in the pageant.\n\nIt was a memorable display and must live in history. It suggested the\nmaterial glories of the reign finely and adequately. The absence of the\nchief creators of them was perhaps not a serious disadvantage. One could\nsupply the vacancies by imagination, and thus fill out the procession\nvery effectively. One can enjoy a rainbow without necessarily forgetting\nthe forces that made it.\n\n\n\n\n                            LETTERS TO SATAN\n                                 (1897)\n\n                             SWISS GLIMPSES\n\n                                   I\n\nIf Your Grace would prepay your postage it would be a pleasant change. I\nam not meaning to speak harshly, but only sorrowfully. My remark applies\nto all my outland correspondents, and to everybody\u2019s. None of them puts\non the full postage, and that is just the same as putting on none at\nall: the foreign governments ignore the half postage, and we who are\nabroad have to pay full postage on those half-paid letters. And as for\nwriting on thin paper, none of my friends ever think of it; they all use\npasteboard, or sole leather, or things like that. But enough of that\nsubject; it is painful.\n\nI believe you have set me a hard task; for if it is true that you have\nnot been in the world for three hundred years, and have not received\ninto your establishment an educated person in all that time, I shall be\nobliged to talk to you as if you had just been born and knew nothing at\nall about the things I speak of. However, I will do the best I can, and\nwill faithfully try to put in all the particulars, trivial ones as well\nas the other sorts. If my report shall induce Your Grace to come out of\nyour age-long seclusion and make a pleasure tour through the world in\nperson, instead of doing it by proxy through me, I shall feel that I\nhave labored to good purpose. You have many friends in the world; more\nthan you think. You would have a vast welcome in Paris, London, New\nYork, Chicago, Washington, and the other capitals of the world; if you\nwould go on the lecture platform you could charge what you pleased. You\nwould be the most formidable attraction on the planet. The curiosity to\nsee you would be so great that no place of amusement would contain the\nmultitude that would come. In London many devoted people who have seen\nthe Prince of Wales only fifteen hundred or two thousand times would be\nwilling to miss one chance of seeing him again for the sake of seeing\nyou. In Paris, even with the Tsar on view, you could do a fairly good\nbusiness; and in Chicago--Oh, but you ought to go to Chicago, you know.\nBut further of this anon. I will to my report, now, and tell you about\nLucerne, and how I journeyed hither; for doubtless you will travel by\nthe same route when you come.\n\nI kept house a few months in London, with my family, while I arranged\nthe matters which you were good enough to intrust me with. There were no\nadventures, except that we saw the Jubilee. Afterward I was invited to\none of the Queen\u2019s functions, which was a royal garden party. A garden\nis a green and bloomy countrified stretch of land which--But you\nremember the Garden of Eden; well, it is like that. The invitation\nprescribed the costume that must be worn: \u201cMorning dress with trousers.\u201d\nI was intending to wear mine, for I always wear something at garden\nparties where ladies are to be present; but I was hurt by this arbitrary\nnote of compulsion, and did not go. All the European courts are\nparticular about dress, and you are not allowed to choose for yourself\nin any case; you are always told exactly what you must wear; and whether\nit is going to become you or not, you are not allowed to make any\nchanges. Yet the court taste is often bad, and sometimes even\nindelicate. I was once invited to dine with an emperor when I was living\nawhile in Germany, and the invitation card named the dress I must wear:\n\u201cFrock coat and black cravat.\u201d To put it in English, that meant\nswallow-tail and black cravat. It was cold weather, too, the middle of\nwinter; and not only that, but ladies were to be present. That was five\nyears ago. By this time the coat has gone out, I suppose, and you would\nfeel at home there if you still remember the old Eden styles.\n\nAs soon as the Jubilee was fairly over we broke up housekeeping and went\nfor a few days to what is called in England \u201can hotel.\u201d If we could have\nafforded an horse and an hackney cab we could have had an heavenly good\ntime flitting around on our preparation errands, and could have finished\nthem up briskly; but the buses are slow and they wasted many precious\nhours for us. A bus is a sort of great cage on four wheels, and is six\ntimes as strong and eleven times as heavy as the service required of it\ndemands--but that is the English of it. The bus aptly symbolizes the\nnational character. The Englishman requires that everything about him\nshall be stable, strong, and permanent, except the house which he builds\nto rent. His own private house is as strong as a fort. The rod which\nholds up the lace curtains could hold up an hippopotamus. The three-foot\nflagstaff on his bus, which supports a Union Jack the size of a\nhandkerchief, would still support it if it were one of the gates of\nGaza. Everything he constructs is a deal heavier and stronger than it\nneeds to be. He built ten miles of terraced benches to view the Jubilee\nprocession from, and put timber enough in them to make them a permanent\ncontribution to the solidities of the world--yet they were intended for\nonly two days\u2019 service.\n\nWhen they were being removed an American said, \u201cDon\u2019t do it--save them\nfor the Resurrection.\u201d If anything gets in the way of the Englishman\u2019s\nbus it must get out of it or be bowled down--and that is English. It is\nthe serene self-sufficient spirit which has carried his flag so far. He\nought to put his aggressive bus in his coat of arms, and take the gentle\nunicorn out.\n\nWe made our preparations for Switzerland as fast as we could; then\nbought the tickets. Bought them of Thomas Cook & Sons, of\ncourse--nowadays shortened to \u201cCook\u2019s,\u201d to save time and words. Things\nhave changed in thirty years. I can remember when to be a \u201cCook\u2019s\ntourist\u201d was a thing to be ashamed of, and when everybody felt\nprivileged to make fun of Cook\u2019s \u201cpersonally conducted\u201d gangs of\neconomical provincials. But that has all gone by, now. All sorts and\nconditions of men fly to Cook in our days. In the bygone times travel in\nEurope was made hateful and humiliating by the wanton difficulties,\nhindrances, annoyances, and vexations put upon it by ignorant, stupid,\nand disobliging transportation officials, and one had to travel with a\ncourier or risk going mad. You could not buy a railway ticket on one day\nwhich you purposed to use next day--it was not permitted. You could not\nbuy a ticket for _any_ train until fifteen minutes before that train was\ndue to leave. Though you had twenty trunks, you must manage somehow to\nget them weighed and the extra weight paid for within that fifteen\nminutes; if the time was not sufficient you would have to leave behind\nsuch trunks as failed to pass the scales. If you missed your train, your\nticket was no longer good. As a rule, you could make neither head nor\ntail of the railway guide, and if your intended journey was a long one\nyou would find that the officials could tell you little about which way\nto go; consequently you often bought the wrong ticket and got yourself\nlost. But Cook has remedied all these things and made travel simple,\neasy, and a pleasure. He will sell you a ticket to any place on the\nglobe, or all the places, and give you all the time you need, and as\nmuch more besides; and it is good for all trains of its class, and its\nbaggage is weighable at all hours. It provides hotels for you\neverywhere, if you so desire; and you cannot be overcharged, for the\ncoupons show just how much you must pay. Cook\u2019s servants at the great\nstations will attend to your baggage, get you a cab, tell you how much\nto pay cabmen and porters, procure guides for you, or horses, donkeys,\ncamels, bicycles, or anything else you want, and make life a comfort and\na satisfaction to you. And if you get tired of traveling and want to\nstop, Cook will take back the remains of your ticket, with 10 per cent\noff. Cook is your banker everywhere, and his establishment your shelter\nwhen you get caught out in the rain. His clerks will answer all the\nquestions you ask, and do it courteously. I recommend Your Grace to\ntravel on Cook\u2019s tickets when you come; and I do this without\nembarrassment, for I get no commission. I do not know Cook. (But if you\nwould rather travel with a courier, let me recommend Joseph Very. I\nemployed him twenty years ago, and spoke of him very highly in a book,\nfor he was an excellent courier--then. I employed him again, six or\nseven years ago--for a while. Try him. And when you go home, take him\nwith you.)\n\nThat London hotel was a disappointment. It was up a back alley, and we\nsupposed it would be cheap. But, no, it was built for the moneyed races.\nIt was all costliness and show. It had a brass band for dinner--and\nlittle else--and it even had a telephone and a lift. A telephone is a\nwire stretched on poles or underground, and has a thing at each end of\nit. These things are to speak into and to listen at. The wire carries\nthe words; it can carry them several hundred miles. It is a time-saving,\nprofanity-breeding, useful invention, and in America is to be found in\nall houses except parsonages. It is dear in America, but cheap in\nEngland; yet in England telephones are as rare as are icebergs in your\nplace. I know of no way to account for this; I only know that it is\nextraordinary. The English take kindly to the other modern conveniences,\nbut for some puzzling reason or other they will not use the telephone.\nThere are 44,000,000 people there who have never even seen one.\n\nThe lift is an elevator. Like the telephone, it also is an American\ninvention. Its office is to hoist people to the upper stories and save\nthem the fatigue and delay of climbing. That London hotel could\naccommodate several hundred people, and it had just one lift--a lift\nwhich would hold four persons. In America such an hotel would have from\ntwo to six lifts. When I was last in Paris, three years ago, they were\nusing there what they thought was a lift. It held two persons, and\ntraveled at such a slow gait that a spectator could not tell which way\nit was going. If the passengers were going to the sixth floor, they took\nalong something to eat; and at night, bedding. Old people did not use\nit; except such as were on their way to the good place, anyhow. Often\npeople that had been lost for days were found in those lifts, jogging\nalong, jogging along, frequently still alive. The French took great\npride in their ostensible lift, and called it by a grand\nname--_ascenseur_. An hotel that had a lift did not keep it secret, but\nadvertised it in immense letters, _\u201cIl y a une ascenseur,\u201d_ with three\nexclamation points after it.\n\nIn that London hotel--But never mind that hotel; it was a cruelly\nexpensive and tawdry and ill-conditioned place, and I wish I could do it\na damage. I will think up a way some time. We went to Queenboro by the\nrailroad. A railroad is a--well, a railroad is a railroad. I will\ndescribe it more explicitly another time.\n\nThen we went by steamer to Flushing--eight hours. If you sit at home you\ncan make the trip in less time, because then you can travel by the\nsteamer company\u2019s advertisement, and that will take you across the\nChannel five hours quicker than their boats can do it. Almost everywhere\nin Europe the advertisements can give the facts several hours\u2019 odd in\nthe twenty-four and get in first.\n\n                                   II\n\nWe tarried overnight at a summer hotel on the seashore near\nFlushing--the Grand H\u00f4tel des Bains. The word Grand means nothing in\nthis connection; it has no descriptive value. On the Continent, all\nhotels, inns, taverns, hash houses and slop troughs employ it. It is\ntiresome. This one was a good-enough hotel, and comfortable, but there\nwas nothing grand about it but the bill, and even that was not\nextravagant enough to make the title entirely justifiable. Except in the\ncase of one item--Scotch whisky. I ordered a sup of that, for I always\ntake it at night as a preventive of toothache. I have never had the\ntoothache; and what is more, I never intend to have it. They charged me\na dollar and a half for it. A dollar and a half for half a pint; a\ndollar and a half for that wee little mite--really hardly enough to\nbreak a pledge with. It will be a kindness to me if Your Grace will show\nthe landlord some special attentions when he arrives. Not merely on\naccount of that piece of extortion, but because he got us back to town\nand the station next day, more than an hour before train time.\n\nThere were no books or newspapers for sale there, and nothing to look at\nbut a map. Fortunately it was an interesting one. It was a railway map\nof the Low Countries, and was of a new sort to me, for it was made of\ntiles--the ground white, the lines black. It could be washed if it got\nsoiled, and if no accident happens to it it will last ten thousand years\nand still be as bright and fine and new and beautiful then as it is\nto-day. It occupied a great area of the wall, and one could study it in\ncomfort halfway across the house. It would be a valuable thing if our\nown railway companies would adorn their waiting rooms with maps like\nthat.\n\nWe left at five in the afternoon. The Dutch road was admirably rough; we\nwent bumping and bouncing and swaying and sprawling along in a most\nvindictive and disorderly way; then passed the frontier into Germany,\nand straightway quieted down and went gliding as smoothly through the\nlandscape as if we had been on runners. We reached Cologne after\nmidnight.\n\nBut this letter is already too long. I will close it by saying that I\nwas charmed with England and sorry to leave it. It is easy to do\nbusiness there. I carried out all of Your Grace\u2019s instructions, and did\nit without difficulty. I doubted if it was needful to grease Mr. Cecil\nRhodes\u2019s palm any further, for I think he would serve you just for the\nlove of it; still, I obeyed your orders in the matter. I made him\nPermanent General Agent for South Africa, got him and his South Africa\nCompany whitewashed by the Committee of Inquiry, and promised him a\ndukedom. I also continued the European Concert in office, without making\nany change in its material. In my opinion this is the best material for\nthe purpose that exists outside of Your Grace\u2019s own personal Cabinet. It\ncoddles the Sultan, it has defiled and degraded Greece, it has massacred\na hundred thousand Christians in Armenia and a splendid multitude of\nthem in Turkey, and has covered civilization and the Christian name with\nimperishable shame. If Your Grace would instruct me to add the Concert\nto the list of your publicly acknowledged servants, I think it would\nhave a good effect. The Foreign Offices of the whole European world are\nnow under your sovereignty, and little attentions like this would keep\nthem so.\n\n\n\n\n                    A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT FOR OUR\n\n\nBLUSHING EXILES | (1898)\n\n\n  ... Well, what do you think of our country _now_? And what do you\n  think of the figure she is cutting before the eyes of the world? For\n  one, I am ashamed--(Extract from a long and heated letter from a\n  Voluntary Exile, Member of the American Colony, Paris.)\n\nAnd so you are ashamed. I am trying to think out what it can have been\nthat has produced this large attitude of mind and this fine flow of\nsarcasm. Apparently you are ashamed to look Europe in the face; ashamed\nof the American name; temporarily ashamed of your nationality. By the\nlight of remarks made to me by an American here in Vienna, I judge that\nyou are ashamed because:\n\n1. We are meddling where we have no business and no right; meddling with\nthe private family matters of a sister nation; intruding upon her sacred\nright to do as she pleases with her own, unquestioned by anybody.\n\n2. We are doing this under a sham humanitarian pretext.\n\n3. Doing it in order to filch Cuba, the formal and distinct disclaimer\nin the ultimatum being very, very thin humbug, and easily detectable as\nsuch by you and virtuous Europe.\n\n4. And finally you are ashamed of all this because it is new, and base,\nand brutal, and dishonest; and because Europe, having had no previous\nexperience of such things, is horrified by it and can never respect us\nnor associate with us any more.\n\nBrutal, base, dishonest? We? Land thieves? Shedders of innocent blood?\nWe? Traitors to our official word? We? Are we going to lose Europe\u2019s\nrespect because of this new and dreadful conduct? Russia\u2019s, for\ninstance? Is she lying stretched out on her back in Manchuria, with her\nhead among her Siberian prisons and her feet in Port Arthur, trying to\nread over the fairy tales she told Lord Salisbury, and not able to do it\nfor crying because we are maneuvering to treacherously smouch Cuba from\nfeeble Spain, and because we are ungently shedding innocent Spanish\nblood?\n\nIs it France\u2019s respect that we are going to lose? Is our unchivalric\nconduct troubling a nation which exists to-day because a brave young\ngirl saved it when its poltroons had lost it--a nation which deserted\nher as one man when her day of peril came? Is our treacherous assault\nupon a weak people distressing a nation which contributed Bartholomew\u2019s\nDay to human history? Is our ruthless spirit offending the sensibilities\nof the nation which gave us the Reign of Terror to read about? Is our\nunmanly intrusion into the private affairs of a sister nation shocking\nthe feelings of the people who sent Maximilian to Mexico? Are our shabby\nand pusillanimous ways outraging the fastidious people who have sent an\ninnocent man (Dreyfus) to a living hell, taken to their embraces the\nslimy guilty one, and submitted to a thousand indignities Emile\nZola--the manliest man in France?\n\nIs it Spain\u2019s respect that we are going to lose? Is she sitting sadly\nconning her great history and contrasting it with our meddling, cruel,\nperfidious one--our shameful history of foreign robberies, humanitarian\nshams, and annihilations of weak and unoffending nations? Is she\nremembering with pride how she sent Columbus home in chains; how she\nsent half of the harmless West Indians into slavery and the rest to the\ngrave, leaving not one alive; how she robbed and slaughtered the Inca\u2019s\ngentle race, then beguiled the Inca into her power with fair promises\nand burned him at the stake; how she drenched the New World in blood,\nand earned and got the name of The Nation with the Bloody Footprint; how\nshe drove all the Jews out of Spain in a day, allowing them to sell\ntheir property, but forbidding them to carry any money out of the\ncountry; how she roasted heretics by the thousands and thousands in her\npublic squares, generation after generation, her kings and her priests\nlooking on as at a holiday show; how her Holy Inquisition imported hell\ninto the earth; how she was the first to institute it and the last to\ngive it up--and then only under compulsion; how, with a spirit\nunmodified by time, she still tortures her prisoners to-day; how, with\nher ancient passion for pain and blood unchanged, she still crowds the\narena with ladies and gentlemen and priests to see with delight a bull\nharried and persecuted and a gored horse dragging his entrails on the\nground; and how, with this incredible character surviving all attempts\nto civilize it, her Duke of Alva rises again in the person of General\nWeyler--to-day the most idolized personage in Spain--and we see a\nhundred thousand women and children shut up in pens and pitilessly\nstarved to death?\n\nAre we indeed going to lose Spain\u2019s respect? Is there no way to avoid\nthis calamity--or this compliment? Are we going to lose her respect\nbecause we have made a promise in our ultimatum which she thinks we\nshall break? And meantime is she trying to recall some promise of her\nown which she has kept?\n\nIs the Professional Official Fibber of Europe really troubled with our\nmorals? Dear Parisian friend, are you taking seriously the daily remark\nof the newspaper and the orator about \u201cthis noble nation with an\nillustrious history\u201d? That is mere kindness, mere charity for a people\nin temporary hard luck. The newspaper and the orator do not mean it.\nThey wink when they say it.\n\nAnd so you are ashamed. Do not be ashamed; there is no occasion for it.\n\n\n\n\n                                DUELING\n                        (Vienna, Austria, 1898)\n\n\nThis pastime is as common in Austria to-day as it is in France. But with\nthis difference--that here in the Austrian states the duel is dangerous,\nwhile in France it is not. Here it is tragedy, in France it is comedy;\nhere it is a solemnity, there it is monkeyshines; here the duelist risks\nhis life, there he does not even risk his shirt. Here he fights with\npistol or saber, in France with a hairpin--a blunt one. Here the\ndesperately wounded man tries to walk to the hospital; there they paint\nthe scratch so that they can find it again, lay the sufferer on a\nstretcher, and conduct him off the field with a band of music.\n\nAt the end of a French duel the pair hug and kiss and cry, and praise\neach other\u2019s valor; then the surgeons make an examination and pick out\nthe scratched one, and the other one helps him on to the litter and pays\nhis fare; and in return the scratched one treats to champagne and\noysters in the evening, and then \u201cthe incident is closed,\u201d as the French\nsay. It is all polite, and gracious, and pretty, and impressive. At the\nend of an Austrian duel the antagonist that is alive gravely offers his\nhand to the other man, utters some phrases of courteous regret, then\nbids him good-by and goes his way, and that incident also is closed. The\nFrench duelist is painstakingly protected from danger, by the rules of\nthe game. His antagonist\u2019s weapon cannot reach so far as his body; if he\ngets a scratch it will not be above his elbow. But in Austria the rules\nof the game do not provide against danger, they carefully provide _for_\nit, usually. Commonly the combat must be kept up until one of the men is\ndisabled; a nondisabling slash or stab does not retire him.\n\nFor a matter of three months I watched the Viennese journals, and\nwhenever a duel was reported in their telegraphic columns I scrap-booked\nit. By this record I find that dueling in Austria is not confined to\njournalists and old maids, as in France, but is indulged in by military\nmen, journalists, students, physicians, lawyers, members of the\nlegislature, and even the Cabinet, the bench, and the police. Dueling is\nforbidden by law; and so it seems odd to see the makers and\nadministrators of the laws dancing on their work in this way. Some\nmonths ago Count Badeni, at that time chief of the government, fought a\npistol duel here in the capital city of the Empire with Representative\nWolf, and both of those distinguished Christians came near getting\nturned out of the Church--for the Church as well as the state forbids\ndueling.\n\nIn one case, lately, in Hungary, the police interfered and stopped a\nduel after the first innings. This was a saber duel between the chief of\npolice and the city attorney. Unkind things were said about it by the\nnewspapers. They said the police remembered their duty uncommonly well\nwhen their own officials were the parties concerned in duels. But I\nthink the underlings showed bread-and-butter judgment. If their\nsuperiors had carved each other well, the public would have asked,\n\u201cWhere were the police?\u201d and their place would have been endangered; but\ncustom does not require them to be around where mere unofficial citizens\nare explaining a thing with sabers.\n\nThere was another duel--a double duel--going on in the immediate\nneighborhood at the time, and in this case the police obeyed custom and\ndid not disturb it. Their bread and butter was not at stake there. In\nthis duel a physician fought a couple of surgeons, and wounded both--one\nof them lightly, the other seriously. An undertaker wanted to keep\npeople from interfering, but that was quite natural again.\n\nSelecting at random from my record, I next find a duel at Tranopol\nbetween military men. An officer of the Tenth Dragoons charged an\nofficer of the Ninth Dragoons with an offense against the laws of the\ncard table. There was a defect or a doubt somewhere in the matter, and\nthis had to be examined and passed upon by a court of honor. So the case\nwas sent up to Lemberg for this purpose. One would like to know what the\ndefect was, but the newspaper does not say. A man here who has fought\nmany duels and has a graveyard says that probably the matter in question\nwas as to whether the accusation was true or not; that if the charge was\na very grave one--cheating, for instance--proof of its truth would rule\nthe guilty officer out of the field of honor; the court would not allow\na gentleman to fight with such a person. You see what a solemn thing it\nis; you see how particular they are; any little careless speech can lose\nyou your privilege of getting yourself shot, here. The court seems to\nhave gone into the matter in a searching and careful fashion, for\nseveral months elapsed before it reached a decision. It then sanctioned\na duel and the accused killed his accuser.\n\nNext I find a duel between a prince and a major; first with pistols--no\nresult satisfactory to either party; then with sabers, and the major\nbadly hurt.\n\nNext, a saber duel between journalists--the one a strong man, the other\nfeeble and in poor health. It was brief; the strong one drove his sword\nthrough the weak one, and death was immediate.\n\nNext, a duel between a lieutenant and a student of medicine. According\nto the newspaper report, these are the details: The student was in a\nrestaurant one evening; passing along, he halted at a table to speak\nwith some friends; near by sat a dozen military men; the student\nconceived that one of these was \u201cstaring\u201d at him; he asked the officer\nto step outside and explain. This officer and another one gathered up\ntheir capes and sabers and went out with the student. Outside--this is\nthe student\u2019s account--the student introduced himself to the offending\nofficer and said, \u201cYou seemed to stare at me\u201d; for answer, the officer\nstruck the student with his fist; the student parried the blow; both\nofficers drew their sabers and attacked the young fellow, and one of\nthem gave him a wound on the left arm; then they withdrew. This was\nSaturday night. The duel followed on Monday, in the military riding\nschool--the customary dueling ground all over Austria, apparently. The\nweapons were pistols. The dueling terms were somewhat beyond custom in\nthe matter of severity, if I may gather that from the statement that the\ncombat was fought \u201cunter sehr schweren Bedingungen\u201d--to wit, \u201cdistance,\n15 steps--with 3 steps advance.\u201d There was but one exchange of shots.\nThe student was hit. \u201cHe put his hand on his breast, his body began to\nbend slowly forward, then collapsed in death and sank to the ground.\u201d\n\nIt is pathetic. There are other duels in my list, but I find in each and\nall of them one and the same ever-recurring defect--the _principals_ are\nnever present, but only by their sham representatives. The _real_\nprincipals in any duel are not the duelists themselves, but their\n_families_. They do the mourning, the suffering; theirs is the loss and\ntheirs the misery. They stake all that, the duelist stakes nothing but\nhis life, and that is a trivial thing compared with what his death must\ncost those whom he leaves behind him. Challenges should not mention the\nduelist; he has nothing much at stake, and the real vengeance cannot\nreach him. The challenge should summon the offender\u2019s old gray mother\nand his young wife and his little children--these, or any of whom he is\na dear and worshiped possession--and should say, \u201cYou have done me no\nharm, but I am the meek slave of a custom which requires me to crush the\nhappiness out of your hearts and condemn you to years of pain and grief,\nin order that I may wash clean with your tears a stain which has been\nput upon me by another person.\u201d\n\nThe logic of it is admirable; a person has robbed me of a penny; I must\nbeggar ten innocent persons to make good my loss. Surely nobody\u2019s\n\u201chonor\u201d is worth all that.\n\nSince the duelist\u2019s family are the real principals in a duel, the state\nought to compel them to be present at it. Custom, also, ought to be so\namended as to require it; and without it no duel ought to be allowed to\ngo on. If that student\u2019s unoffending mother had been present and\nwatching the officer through her tears as he raised his pistol, he--why,\nhe would have fired in the air! We know that. For we know how we are all\nmade. Laws ought to be based upon the ascertained facts of our nature.\nIt would be a simple thing to make a dueling law which would stop\ndueling.\n\nAs things are now, the mother is never invited. She submits to this; and\nwithout outward complaint, for she, too, is the vassal of custom, and\ncustom requires her to conceal her pain when she learns the disastrous\nnews that her son must go to the dueling field, and by the powerful\nforce that is lodged in habit and custom she is enabled to obey this\ntrying requirement--a requirement which exacts a miracle of her, and\ngets it. In January a neighbor of ours who has a young son in the army\nwas awakened by this youth at three o\u2019clock one morning, and she sat up\nin bed and listened to his message:\n\n\u201cI have come to tell you something, mother, which will distress you, but\nyou must be good and brave and bear it. I have been affronted by a\nfellow officer and we fight at three this afternoon. Lie down and sleep,\nnow, and think no more about it.\u201d\n\nShe kissed him good night and lay down paralyzed with grief and fear,\nbut said nothing. But she did not sleep; she prayed and mourned till the\nfirst streak of dawn, then fled to the nearest church and implored the\nVirgin for help; and from that church she went to another and another;\nchurch after church, and still church after church, and so spent all the\nday until three o\u2019clock on her knees in agony and tears; then dragged\nherself home and sat down, comfortless and desolate, to count the\nminutes, and wait, with an outward show of calm, for what had been\nordained for her--happiness, or endless misery. Presently she heard the\nclank of a saber--she had not known before what music was in that\nsound--and her son put his head in and said:\n\n\u201cX was in the wrong and he apologized.\u201d\n\nSo that incident was closed; and for the rest of her life the mother\nwill always find something pleasant about the clank of a saber, no\ndoubt.\n\nIn one of my listed duels--However, let it go, there is nothing\nparticularly striking about it except that the seconds interfered. And\nprematurely, too, for neither man was dead. This was certainly\nirregular. Neither of the men liked it. It was a duel with cavalry\nsabers, between an editor and a lieutenant. The editor walked to the\nhospital; the lieutenant was carried. In Austria an editor who can write\nwell is valuable, but he is not likely to remain so unless he can handle\na saber with charm.\n\nThe following very recent telegram shows that also in France duels are\nhumanely stopped as soon as they approach the (French) danger point:\n\n                          (Reuter\u2019s Telegram)\n\n                                                 PARIS, _March 5th_.\n\n  The duel between Colonels Henry and Picquart took place this morning\n  in the riding school of the \u00c9cole Militaire, the doors of which were\n  strictly guarded in order to prevent intrusion. The combatants, who\n  fought with swords, were in position at ten o\u2019clock.\n\n  At the first re-engagement Lieut.-Col. Henry was slightly scratched in\n  the forearm, and just at the same moment his own blade appeared to\n  touch his adversary\u2019s neck. Senator Ranc, who was Colonel Picquart\u2019s\n  second, stopped the fight, but as it was found that his principal had\n  not been touched, the combat continued. A very sharp encounter ensued,\n  in which Colonel Henry was wounded in the elbow, and the duel then\n  terminated.\n\nAfter which the stretcher and the band. In lurid contrast with this\ndelicate flirtation, we have an account of a deadly duel of day before\nyesterday in Italy, where the earnest Austrian duel is in vogue. I knew\none of the principals, Cavalotti, slightly, and this gives me a sort of\npersonal interest in his duel. I first saw him in Rome several years\nago. He was sitting on a block of stone in the Forum, and was writing\nsomething in his notebook--a poem or a challenge, or something like\nthat--and the friend who pointed him out to me said, \u201cThat is\nCavalotti--he has fought thirty duels; do not disturb him.\u201d I did not\ndisturb him.\n\n\n\n\n                      SKELETON PLAN OF A PROPOSED\n                           CASTING VOTE PARTY\n                                 (1901)\n\n  NOTE.--Mark Twain\u2019s effort was always for clean politics. In 1901 he\n  formulated what to him seemed a feasible plan to obtain this boon. It\n  is here first published.--A. B. P.\n\n                            ITS MAIN OBJECT\n\nTo compel the two Great Parties to nominate their _best man_ always.\n\n                         FOUNDATION PRINCIPLES\n\nWith the offices all filled by the best men of either of the two Great\nParties, we shall have good government. We hold that this is beyond\ndispute, and does not need to be argued.\n\n                                DETAILS\n\n1. The C. V. Party should be _organized_. This, in order to secure its\ncontinuance and permanency.\n\n2. Any of the following acts must sever the connection of a member with\nthe Casting Vote party:\n\n The seeking of any office, appointive or elective.\n The acceptance of a nomination to any such office.\n The acceptance of such an office.\n\n3. The organization should never vote for _any but a nominee of one or\nthe other of the two Great Parties_, and should then cast their _entire\nvote_ for that nominee.\n\n4. They should have no dealings with minor parties.\n\n5. There should be ward organizations, township, town, city,\ncongressional district, state and national organizations. The party\nshould work wherever there is an elective office, from the lowest up to\nthe Presidency.\n\n6. As a rule, none of the organizations will need to be large. In most\ncases they will be able to control the action of the two Great Parties\nwithout that. In the matter of membership, quality will be the main\nthing, rather than quantity.\n\nIn small constituencies, where a town constable or a justice of the\npeace is to be elected it will often be the case that a Casting Vote\nlodge of fifty members can elect the nominee it prefers. In every such\ncommunity the material for the fifty is present. It will be found among\nthe men who are disgusted with the prevailing political methods, the low\nambitions and ideals, of the politicians; dishonesty in office;\ncorruption; the frank distribution of appointments among characterless\nand incompetent men as pay for party service; the evasion and sometimes\nstraight-out violation of the civil-service laws. The fifty will be\nfound among the men who are ashamed of this condition of things and who\nhave despaired of seeing it bettered; _who stay away from the polls and\ndo not vote;_ who do not attend primaries, and would be insulted there\nif they did.\n\nThe fifty exist in every little community; they are not seen, not heard,\nnot regarded--but they are there. There, and deeply and sincerely\ndesirous of good and sound government, and ready to give the best help\nthey can if any will place before them a competent way. They are\nreserved and quiet merchants and shopkeepers, middle-aged; they are\nyoung men making their way in the offices of doctors and lawyers and\nbehind counters; they are journeyman high-class mechanics; they are\norganizers of, and workers for, the community\u2019s charities, art and other\nsocial-improvement clubs, university settlements, Young Men\u2019s Christian\nAssociation, circulating libraries; they are readers of books,\nfrequenters of the library. They have never seen a primary, and they\nhave an aversion for the polls.\n\n7. Men proposing to create a Casting Vote lodge should not advertise\ntheir purpose; conspiracies for good, like conspiracies for evil, are\nbest conducted privately until success is sure. The poll of the two\nGreat Parties should be examined, and the winning party\u2019s majority\nnoted. _It is this majority which the Casting Vote must overcome and\nnullify._ If the total vote cast was 1,000 and the majority vote fifty,\nthe proposers of a lodge should canvass privately until they have\nsecured 75 or 100 names; they can organize then, without solicitude; the\nbalance of power is in their hands, and this fact by itself will add\nnames to its membership. If the total vote is 10,000 and the majority\nvote 1,000, the procedure should be as before: the thousand-and-upward\nshould be secured by private canvass before public organization is\ninstituted. Where a total vote is 1,000,000 the majority vote is not\nlikely to exceed 30,000. Five or six canvassers can begin the listing;\neach man secured becomes a canvasser, ten know three apiece who will\njoin; the thirty know three apiece who will join; the ninety know three\nhundred, the three hundred know a thousand, the thousand know three\nthousand--and so on; the required thirty or forty thousand can be\nsecured in ten days, the lodge organized, and its casting vote be ready\nand self-pledged and competent to elect the best of the nominees the two\nGreat Parties may put up at that date or later.\n\n8. In every ward of every city there is enough of this material to hold\nthe balance of power over the two Great Parties in a ward election; in\nevery city there is enough of it to determine which of the two nominees\nshall be mayor; in every congressional district there is enough of it to\nelect the Governor; also to elect the legislature and choose the U. S.\nSenators; and in the United States there is enough of it to throw the\nCasting Vote for its choice between the nominees of the two Great\nParties and seat him in the presidential chair.\n\n9. From constable up to President there is no office for which the two\nGreat Parties cannot furnish able, clean, and acceptable men. Whenever\nthe balance of power shall be lodged in a permanent third party with no\ncandidates of its own and no function but to cast its _whole vote_ for\nthe best man put forward by the Republicans and Democrats, these two\nparties _will select the best men they have in their ranks_. Good and\nclean government will follow, let its party complexion be what it may;\nand the country will be quite content.\n\n                               THE LODGES\n\nThe primal lodge--call it A--should consist of 10 men only. It is enough\nand can meet in a dwelling house or a shop, and get well acquainted at\nonce. It has before it the names of the nominees of the two Great\nParties--Jones (Republican), Smith (Democrat). It fails of\nunanimity--both candidates perchance being good men and about equally\nacceptable--and casts seven votes, say, for Jones and three for Smith.\n\nIt elects one of its ten to meet similar delegates from any number of\nlocal A lodges and hand in its vote. This body--call it a B\nlodge--examines the aggregate vote; this time the majority may be with\nSmith. The members carry the result to the A lodges; and these, by the\nconditions of their membership, must vote for Smith.\n\nIn the case of a state election, bodies each consisting of a number of B\nlodges would elect a delegate to a state council, and the state council\nwould examine the aggregate vote and give its decision in favor of the\nRepublican or Democratic candidate receiving the majority of the Casting\nVote\u2019s suffrages.\n\nIn the case of a presidential contest, the state council would appoint\ndelegates to a national convention, and these would examine the\naggregate Casting Vote vote and determine and announce the choice of the\nCasting Vote organizations of the whole country.

The article\n  was not offered for publication, perhaps because the moment of\n  timeliness had passed. Its general timeliness, however, is perennial\n  and a word from \u201cAmerica\u2019s foremost private citizen\u201d on the subject is\n  worthy of preservation.--A. B. P.\n\n                                   I\n\nAnd so Missouri has fallen, that great state! Certain of her children\nhave joined the lynchers, and the smirch is upon the rest of us. That\nhandful of her children have given us a character and labeled us with a\nname, and to the dwellers in the four quarters of the earth we are\n\u201clynchers,\u201d now, and ever shall be. For the world will not stop and\nthink--it never does, it is not its way; its way is to generalize from a\nsingle sample. It will not say, \u201cThose Missourians have been busy eighty\nyears in building an honorable good name for themselves; these hundred\nlynchers down in the corner of the state are not real Missourians, they\nare renegades.\u201d No, that truth will not enter its mind; it will\ngeneralize from the one or two misleading samples and say, \u201cThe\nMissourians are lynchers.\u201d It has no reflection, no logic, no sense of\nproportion. With it, figures go for nothing; to it, figures reveal\nnothing, it cannot reason upon them rationally; it would say, for\ninstance, that China is being swiftly and surely Christianized, since\nnine Chinese Christians are being made every day; and it would fail,\nwith him, to notice that the fact that 33,000 pagans are _born_ there\nevery day, damages the argument. It would say, \u201cThere are a hundred\nlynchers there, therefore the Missourians are lynchers\u201d; the\nconsiderable fact that there are two and a half million Missourians who\nare _not_ lynchers would not affect their verdict.\n\n                                   II\n\nOh, Missouri!\n\nThe tragedy occurred near Pierce City, down in the southwestern corner\nof the state. On a Sunday afternoon a young white woman who had started\nalone from church was found murdered. For there are churches there; in\nmy time religion was more general, more pervasive, in the South than it\nwas in the North, and more virile and earnest, too, I think; I have some\nreason to believe that this is still the case. The young woman was found\nmurdered. Although it was a region of churches and schools the people\nrose, lynched three negroes--two of them very aged ones--burned out five\nnegro households, and drove thirty negro families into the woods.\n\nI do not dwell upon the provocation which moved the people to these\ncrimes, for that has nothing to do with the matter; the only question\nis, does the assassin _take the law into his own hands_? It is very\nsimple, and very just. If the assassin be proved to have usurped the\nlaw\u2019s prerogative in righting his wrongs, that ends the matter; a\nthousand provocations are no defense. The Pierce City people had bitter\nprovocation--indeed, as revealed by certain of the particulars, the\nbitterest of all provocations--but no matter, they took the law into\ntheir own hands, when by the terms of their statutes their victim would\ncertainly hang if the law had been allowed to take its course, for there\nare but few negroes in that region and they are without authority and\nwithout influence in overawing juries.\n\nWhy has lynching, with various barbaric accompaniments, become a\nfavorite regulator in cases of \u201cthe usual crime\u201d in several parts of the\ncountry? Is it because men think a lurid and terrible punishment a more\nforcible object lesson and a more effective deterrent than a sober and\ncolorless hanging done privately in a jail would be? Surely sane men do\nnot think that. Even the average child should know better. It should\nknow that any strange and much-talked-of event is always followed by\nimitations, the world being so well supplied with excitable people who\nonly need a little stirring up to make them lose what is left of their\nheads and do mad things which they would not have thought of ordinarily.\nIt should know that if a man jump off Brooklyn Bridge another will\nimitate him; that if a person venture down Niagara Whirlpool in a barrel\nanother will imitate him; that if a Jack the Ripper make notoriety by\nslaughtering women in dark alleys he will be imitated; that if a man\nattempt a king\u2019s life and the newspapers carry the noise of it around\nthe globe, regicides will crop up all around. The child should know that\none much-talked-of outrage and murder committed by a negro will upset\nthe disturbed intellects of several other negroes and produce a series\nof the very tragedies the community would so strenuously wish to\nprevent; that each of these crimes will produce another series, and year\nby year steadily increase the tale of these disasters instead of\ndiminishing it; that, in a word, the lynchers are themselves the worst\nenemies of their women. The child should also know that by a law of our\nmake, communities, as well as individuals, are imitators; and that a\nmuch-talked-of lynching will infallibly produce other lynchings here and\nthere and yonder, and that in time these will breed a mania, a fashion;\na fashion which will spread wide and wider, year by year, covering state\nafter state, as with an advancing disease. Lynching has reached\nColorado, it has reached California, it has reached Indiana--and now\nMissouri! I may live to see a negro burned in Union Square, New York,\nwith fifty thousand people present, and not a sheriff visible, not a\ngovernor, not a constable, not a colonel, not a clergyman, not a\nlaw-and-order representative of any sort.\n\n  _Increase in Lynching._--In 1900 there were eight more cases than in\n  1899, and probably this year there will be more than there were last\n  year. The year is little more than half gone, and yet there are\n  eighty-eight cases as compared with one hundred and fifteen for all of\n  last year. The four Southern states, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and\n  Mississippi are the worst offenders. Last year there were eight cases\n  in Alabama, sixteen in Georgia, twenty in Louisiana, and twenty in\n  Mississippi--over one-half the total. This year to date there have\n  been nine in Alabama, twelve in Georgia, eleven in Louisiana, and\n  thirteen in Mississippi--again more than one-half the total number in\n  the whole United States.--Chicago _Tribune_.\n\nIt must be that the increase comes of the inborn human instinct to\nimitate--that and man\u2019s commonest weakness, his aversion to being\nunpleasantly conspicuous, pointed at, shunned, as being on the unpopular\nside. Its other name is Moral Cowardice, and is the commanding feature\nof the make-up of 9,999 men in the 10,000. I am not offering this as a\ndiscovery; privately the dullest of us knows it to be true. History will\nnot allow us to forget or ignore this supreme trait of our character. It\npersistently and sardonically reminds us that from the beginning of the\nworld no revolt against a public infamy or oppression has ever been\nbegun but by the one daring man in the 10,000, the rest timidly waiting,\nand slowly and reluctantly joining, under the influence of that man and\nhis fellows from the other ten thousands. The abolitionists remember.\nPrivately the public feeling was with them early, but each man was\nafraid to speak out until he got some hint that his neighbor was\nprivately feeling as he privately felt himself. Then the boom followed.\nIt always does. It will occur in New York, some day; and even in\nPennsylvania.\n\nIt has been supposed--and said--that the people at a lynching enjoy the\nspectacle and are glad of a chance to see it. It cannot be true; all\nexperience is against it. The people in the South are made like the\npeople in the North--the vast majority of whom are right-hearted and\ncompassionate, and would be cruelly pained by such a spectacle--and\n_would attend it_, and let on to be pleased with it, if the public\napproval seemed to require it. We are made like that, and we cannot help\nit. The other animals are not so, but we cannot help that, either. They\nlack the Moral Sense; we have no way of trading ours off, for a nickel\nor some other thing above its value. The Moral Sense teaches us what is\nright, and how to avoid it--when unpopular.\n\nIt is thought, as I have said, that a lynching crowd enjoys a lynching.\nIt certainly is not true; it is impossible of belief. It is freely\nasserted--you have seen it in print many times of late--that the\nlynching impulse has been misinterpreted; that it is _not_ the outcome\nof a spirit of revenge, but of a \u201cmere atrocious hunger _to look upon\nhuman suffering_.\u201d If that were so, the crowds that saw the Windsor\nHotel burn down would have enjoyed the horrors that fell under their\neyes. Did they? No one will think that of them, no one will make that\ncharge. Many risked their lives to save the men and women who were in\nperil. Why did they do that? Because _none would disapprove_. There was\nno restraint; they could follow their natural impulse. Why does a crowd\nof the same kind of people in Texas, Colorado, Indiana, stand by,\nsmitten to the heart and miserable, and by ostentatious outward signs\npretend to enjoy a lynching? Why does it lift no hand or voice in\nprotest? Only because it would be unpopular to do it, I think; each man\nis afraid of his neighbor\u2019s disapproval--a thing which, to the general\nrun of the race, is more dreaded than wounds and death. When there is to\nbe a lynching the people hitch up and come miles to see it, bringing\ntheir wives and children. Really to see it? No--they come only because\nthey are afraid to stay at home, lest it be noticed and offensively\ncommented upon. We may believe this, for we all know how _we_ feel about\nsuch spectacles--also, how we would act under the like pressure. We are\nnot any better nor any braver than anybody else, and we must not try to\ncreep out of it.\n\nA Savonarola can quell and scatter a mob of lynchers with a mere glance\nof his eye: so can a Merrill[7] or a Beloat.[8] For no mob has any sand\nin the presence of a man known to be splendidly brave. Besides, a\nlynching mob would _like_ to be scattered, for of a certainty there are\nnever ten men in it who would not prefer to be somewhere else--and would\nbe, if they but had the courage to go. When I was a boy I saw a brave\ngentleman deride and insult a mob and drive it away; and afterward, in\nNevada, I saw a noted desperado make two hundred men sit still, with the\nhouse burning under them, until he gave them permission to retire. A\nplucky man can rob a whole passenger train by himself; and the half of a\nbrave man can hold up a stagecoach and strip its occupants.\n\nThen perhaps the remedy for lynchings comes to this: station a brave man\nin each affected community to encourage, support, and bring to light the\ndeep disapproval of lynching hidden in the secret places of its\nheart--for it is there, beyond question. Then those communities will\nfind something better to imitate--of course, being human, they must\nimitate something. Where shall these brave men be found? That is indeed\na difficulty; there are not three hundred of them in the earth. If\nmerely _physically_ brave men would do, then it were easy; they could be\nfurnished by the cargo. When Hobson called for seven volunteers to go\nwith him to what promised to be certain death, four thousand men\nresponded--the whole fleet, in fact. Because _all the world would\napprove_. They knew that; but if Hobson\u2019s project had been charged with\nthe scoffs and jeers of the friends and associates, whose good opinion\nand approval the sailors valued, he could not have got his seven.\n\nNo, upon reflection, the scheme will not work. There are not enough\nmorally brave men in stock. We are out of moral-courage material; we are\nin a condition of profound poverty. We have those two sheriffs down\nSouth who--but never mind, it is not enough to go around; they have to\nstay and take care of their own communities.\n\nBut if we only _could_ have three or four more sheriffs of that great\nbreed! Would it help? I think so. For we are all imitators: other brave\nsheriffs would follow; to be a dauntless sheriff would come to be\nrecognized as the correct and only thing, and the dreaded disapproval\nwould fall to the share of the other kind; courage in this office would\nbecome custom, the absence of it a dishonor, just as courage presently\nreplaces the timidity of the new soldier; then the mobs and the\nlynchings would disappear, and----\n\nHowever. It can never be done without some starters, and where are we to\nget the starters? Advertise? Very well, then, let us advertise.\n\nIn the meantime, there is another plan. Let us import American\nmissionaries from China, and send them into the lynching field. With\n1,511 of them out there converting two Chinamen apiece per annum against\nan uphill birth rate of 33,000 pagans per day,[9] it will take upward of\na million years to make the conversions balance the output and bring the\nChristianizing of the country in sight to the naked eye; therefore, if\nwe can offer our missionaries as rich a field at home at lighter expense\nand quite satisfactory in the matter of danger, why shouldn\u2019t they find\nit fair and right to come back and give us a trial? The Chinese are\nuniversally conceded to be excellent people, honest, honorable,\nindustrious, trustworthy, kind-hearted, and all that--leave them alone,\nthey are plenty good enough just as they are; and besides, almost every\nconvert runs a risk of catching our civilization. We ought to be\ncareful. We ought to think twice before we encourage a risk like that;\nfor, _once civilized, China can never be uncivilized again_. We have not\nbeen thinking of that. Very well, we ought to think of it now. Our\nmissionaries will find that we have a field for them--and not only for\nthe 1,511, but for 15,011. Let them look at the following telegram and\nsee if they have anything in China that is more appetizing. It is from\nTexas:\n\n  The negro was taken to a tree and swung in the air. Wood and fodder\n  were piled beneath his body and a hot fire was made. _Then it was\n  suggested that the man ought not to die too quickly, and he was let\n  down to the ground while a party went to Dexter, about two miles\n  distant, to procure coal oil._ This was thrown on the flames and the\n  work completed.\n\nWe implore them to come back and help us in our need. Patriotism imposes\nthis duty on them. Our country is worse off than China; they are our\ncountrymen, their motherland supplicates their aid in this her hour of\ndeep distress. They are competent; our people are not. They are used to\nscoffs, sneers, revilings, danger; our people are not. They have the\nmartyr spirit; nothing but the martyr spirit can brave a lynching mob,\nand cow it and scatter it. They can save their country, we beseech them\nto come home and do it. We ask them to read that telegram again, and yet\nagain, and picture the scene in their minds, and soberly ponder it; then\nmultiply it by 115, add 88; place the 203 in a row, allowing 600 feet of\nspace for each human torch, so that there may be viewing room around it\nfor 5,000 Christian American men, women, and children, youths and\nmaidens; make it night, for grim effect; have the show in a gradually\nrising plain, and let the course of the stakes be uphill; the eye can\nthen take in the whole line of twenty-four miles of blood-and-flesh\nbonfires unbroken, whereas if it occupied level ground the ends of the\nline would bend down and be hidden from view by the curvature of the\nearth. All being ready, now, and the darkness opaque, the stillness\nimpressive--for there should be no sound but the soft moaning of the\nnight wind and the muffled sobbing of the sacrifices--let all the far\nstretch of kerosened pyres be touched off simultaneously and the glare\nand the shrieks and the agonies burst heavenward to the Throne.\n\nThere are more than a million persons present; the light from the fires\nflushes into vague outline against the night the spires of five thousand\nchurches. O kind missionary, O compassionate missionary, leave China!\ncome home and convert these Christians!\n\nI believe that if anything can stop this epidemic of bloody insanities\nit is martial personalities that can face mobs without flinching; and as\nsuch personalities are developed only by familiarity with danger and by\nthe training and seasoning which come of resisting it, the likeliest\nplace to find them must be among the missionaries who have been under\ntuition in China during the past year or two. We have abundance of work\nfor them, and for hundreds and thousands more, and the field is daily\ngrowing and spreading. Shall we find them? We can try. In 75,000,000\nthere must be other Merrills and Beloats; and it is the law of our make\nthat each example shall wake up drowsing chevaliers of the same great\nknighthood and bring them to the front.\n\n-----\n\nFootnote 7:\n\n  Sheriff of Carroll County, Georgia.\n\nFootnote 8:\n\n  Sheriff, Princeton, Indiana. By that formidable power which lies in an\n  established reputation for cold pluck they faced lynching mobs and\n  securely held the field against them.\n\nFootnote 9:\n\n  These figures are not fanciful; all of them are genuine and authentic.\n  They are from official missionary records in China. See Doctor\n  Morrison\u2019s book on his pedestrian journey across China; he quotes them\n  and gives his authorities. For several years he has been the London\n  _Times\u2019s_ representative in Peking, and was there through the siege.\n\n\n\n\n                   TO THE PERSON SITTING IN DARKNESS\n                    (_North American Review_, 1901)\n\n\nSee introduction to this volume for some account of this and the\nfollowing article.\n\n  Christmas will dawn in the United States over a people full of hope\n  and aspiration and good cheer. Such a condition means contentment and\n  happiness. The carping grumbler who may here and there go forth will\n  find few to listen to him. The majority will wonder what is the matter\n  with him and pass on.--New York _Tribune_, on Christmas Eve.\n\nFrom the _Sun_, of New York:\n\n  The purpose of this article is not to describe the terrible offenses\n  against humanity committed in the name of Politics in some of the most\n  notorious East Side districts. _They could not be described, even\n  verbally._ But it is the intention to let the great mass of more or\n  less careless citizens of this beautiful metropolis of the New World\n  get some conception of the havoc and ruin wrought to man, woman, and\n  child in the most densely populated and least-known section of the\n  city. Name, date, and place can be supplied to those of little\n  faith--or to any man who feels himself aggrieved. It is a plain\n  statement of record and observation, written without license and\n  without garnish.\n\n  Imagine, if you can, a section of the city territory completely\n  dominated by one man, without whose permission neither legitimate nor\n  illegitimate business can be conducted; _where illegitimate business\n  is encouraged and legitimate business discouraged_; where the\n  respectable residents have to fasten their doors and windows summer\n  nights and sit in their rooms with asphyxiating air and 100-degree\n  temperature, rather than try to catch the faint whiff of breeze in\n  their natural breathing places, the stoops of their homes; _where\n  naked women dance by night in the streets, and unsexed men prowl like\n  vultures through the darkness on \u201cbusiness\u201d_ not only permitted but\n  encouraged by the police; _where the education of infants begins with\n  the knowledge of prostitution_ and the training of little girls is\n  training in the arts of Phryne; where _American_ girls brought up with\n  the refinements of _American_ homes are imported from small towns\n  up-state, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Jersey, and kept as\n  virtually prisoners as if they were locked up behind jail bars until\n  they have lost all semblance of womanhood; _where small boys are\n  taught to solicit for the women of disorderly houses_; where there is\n  an organized society of young men _whose sole business in life is to\n  corrupt young girls and turn them over to bawdy houses_; where men\n  walking with their wives along the street are openly insulted; _where\n  children that have adult diseases are the chief patrons of the\n  hospitals and dispensaries_; where it is the rule, rather than the\n  exception, that _murder, rape, robbery, and theft go unpunished_--in\n  short where the Premium of the most awful forms of Vice is the Profit\n  of the politicians.\n\nThe following news from China appeared in the _Sun_, of New York, on\nChristmas Eve. The italics are mine:\n\n  The Rev. Mr. Ament, of the American Board of Foreign Missions, has\n  returned from a trip which he made for the purpose of collecting\n  indemnities for damages done by Boxers. _Everywhere he went he\n  compelled the Chinese to pay._ He says that all his native Christians\n  are now provided for. He had 700 of them under his charge, and 300\n  were killed. He has _collected 300 taels for each_ of these murders,\n  and has _compelled full payment for all the property belonging to\n  Christians_ that was destroyed. He also assessed _fines_ amounting to\n  THIRTEEN TIMES the amount of the indemnity. _This money will be used\n  for the propagation of the Gospel._\n\n  Mr. Ament declares that the compensation he has collected is\n  _moderate_ when compared with the amount secured by the Catholics, who\n  demand, in addition to money, _head for head_. They collect 500 taels\n  for each murder of a Catholic. In the Wenchiu country, 680 Catholics\n  were killed, and for this the European Catholics here demand 750,000\n  strings of cash and 680 _heads_.\n\n  In the course of a conversation, Mr. Ament referred to the attitude of\n  the missionaries toward the Chinese. He said:\n\n  \u201cI deny emphatically that the missionaries are _vindictive_, that they\n  _generally_ looted, or that they have done anything _since_ the siege\n  that _the circumstances did not demand_. I criticize the Americans.\n  _The soft hand of the Americans is not as good as the mailed fist of\n  the Germans._ If you deal with the Chinese with a soft hand they will\n  take advantage of it.\n\n  \u201cThe statement that the French government will return the loot taken\n  by the French soldiers is the source of the greatest amusement here.\n  The French soldiers were more systematic looters than the Germans, and\n  it is a fact that to-day _Catholic Christians_, carrying French flags\n  and armed with modern guns, _are looting villages_ in the Province of\n  Chili.\u201d\n\nBy happy luck, we get all these glad tidings on Christmas Eve--just in\ntime enable us to celebrate the day with proper gayety and enthusiasm.\nOur spirits soar, and we find we can even make jokes: Taels, I win,\nHeads you lose.\n\nOur Reverend Ament is the right man in the right place. What we want of\nour missionaries out there is, not that they shall merely represent in\ntheir acts and persons the grace and gentleness and charity and\nloving-kindness of our religion, but that they shall also represent the\nAmerican spirit. The oldest Americans are the Pawnees. Macallum\u2019s\nHistory says:\n\n  When a white Boxer kills a Pawnee and destroys his property, the other\n  Pawnees do not trouble to seek _him_ out, they kill any white person\n  that comes along; also, they make some white village pay deceased\u2019s\n  heirs the full cash value of deceased, together with full cash value\n  of the property destroyed; they also make the village pay, in\n  addition, _thirteen times_ the value of that property into a fund for\n  the dissemination of the Pawnee religion, which they regard as the\n  best of all religions for the softening and humanizing of the heart of\n  man. It is their idea that it is only fair and right that the innocent\n  should be made to suffer for the guilty, and that it is better that\n  ninety and nine innocent should suffer than that one guilty person\n  should escape.\n\nOur Reverend Ament is justifiably jealous of those enterprising\nCatholics, who not only get big money for each lost convert, but get\n\u201chead for head\u201d besides. But he should soothe himself with the\nreflections that the entirety of their exactions are for their own\npockets, whereas he, less selfishly, devotes only 300 taels per head to\nthat service, and gives the whole vast thirteen repetitions of the\nproperty-indemnity to the service of propagating the Gospel. His\nmagnanimity has won him the approval of his nation, and will get him a\nmonument. Let him be content with these rewards. We all hold him dear\nfor manfully defending his fellow missionaries from exaggerated charges\nwhich were beginning to distress us, but which his testimony has so\nconsiderably modified that we can now contemplate them without\nnoticeable pain. For now we know that, even before the siege, the\nmissionaries were not \u201cgenerally\u201d out looting, and that, \u201csince the\nsiege,\u201d they have acted quite handsomely, except when \u201ccircumstances\u201d\ncrowded them. I am arranging for the monument. Subscriptions for it can\nbe sent to the American Board; designs for it can be sent to me. Designs\nmust allegorically set forth the Thirteen Reduplications of the\nIndemnity, and the Object for which they were exacted; as Ornaments, the\ndesigns must exhibit 680 Heads, so disposed as to give a pleasing and\npretty effect; for the Catholics have done nicely, and are entitled to\nnotice in the monument. Mottoes may be suggested, if any shall be\ndiscovered that will satisfactorily cover the ground.\n\nMr. Ament\u2019s financial feat of squeezing a thirteenfold indemnity out of\nthe pauper peasants to square other people\u2019s offenses, thus condemning\nthem and their women and innocent little children to inevitable\nstarvation and lingering death, in order that the blood money so\nacquired might be \u201c_used for the propagation of the Gospel_,\u201d does not\nflutter my serenity; although the act and the words, taken together,\nconcrete a blasphemy so hideous and so colossal that, without doubt, its\nmate is not findable in the history of this or of any other age. Yet, if\na layman had done that thing and justified it with those words, I should\nhave shuddered, I know. Or, if I had done the thing and said the words\nmyself--However, the thought is unthinkable, irreverent as some\nimperfectly informed people think me. Sometimes an ordained minister\nsets out to be blasphemous. When this happens, the layman is out of the\nrunning; he stands no chance.\n\nWe have Mr. Ament\u2019s impassioned assurance that the missionaries are not\n\u201cvindictive.\u201d Let us hope and pray that they will never become so, but\nwill remain in the almost morbidly fair and just and gentle temper which\nis affording so much satisfaction to their brother and champion to-day.\n\nThe following is from the New York _Tribune_ of Christmas Eve. It comes\nfrom that journal\u2019s Tokyo correspondent. It has a strange and impudent\nsound, but the Japanese are but partially civilized as yet. When they\nbecome wholly civilized they will not talk so:\n\n  The missionary question, of course, occupies a foremost place in the\n  discussion. It is now felt as essential that the Western Powers take\n  cognizance of the sentiment here, that religious invasions of Oriental\n  countries by powerful Western organizations are tantamount to\n  filibustering expeditions, and should not only be discountenanced, but\n  that stern measures should be adopted for their suppression. The\n  feeling here is that the missionary organizations constitute a\n  constant menace to peaceful international relations.\n\n_Shall we?_ That is, shall we go on conferring our Civilization upon the\npeoples that sit in darkness, or shall we give those poor things a rest?\nShall we bang right ahead in our old-time, loud, pious way, and commit\nthe new century to the game; or shall we sober up and sit down and think\nit over first? Would it not be prudent to get our Civilization tools\ntogether, and see how much stock is left on hand in the way of Glass\nBeads and Theology, and Maxim Guns and Hymn Books, and Trade Gin and\nTorches of Progress and Enlightenment (patent adjustable ones, good to\nfire villages with, upon occasion), and balance the books, and arrive at\nthe profit and loss, so that we may intelligently decide whether to\ncontinue the business or sell out the property and start a new\nCivilization Scheme on the proceeds?\n\nExtending the Blessings of Civilization to our Brother who Sits in\nDarkness has been a good trade and has paid well, on the whole; and\nthere is money in it yet, if carefully worked--but not enough, in my\njudgment, to make any considerable risk advisable. The People that Sit\nin Darkness are getting to be too scarce--too scarce and too shy. And\nsuch darkness as is now left is really of but an indifferent quality,\nand not dark enough for the game. The most of those People that Sit in\nDarkness have been furnished with more light than was good for them or\nprofitable for us. We have been injudicious.\n\nThe Blessings-of-Civilization Trust, wisely and cautiously administered,\nis a Daisy. There is more money in it, more territory, more sovereignty,\nand other kinds of emolument, than there is in any other game that is\nplayed. But Christendom has been playing it badly of late years, and\nmust certainly suffer by it, in my opinion. She has been so eager to get\nevery stake that appeared on the green cloth, that the People who Sit in\nDarkness have noticed it--they have noticed it, and have begun to show\nalarm. They have become suspicious of the Blessings of Civilization.\nMore--they have begun to examine them. This is not well. The Blessings\nof Civilization are all right, and a good commercial property; there\ncould not be a better, in a dim light. In the right kind of a light, and\nat a proper distance, with the goods a little out of focus, they furnish\nthis desirable exhibit to the Gentlemen who Sit in Darkness:\n\n LOVE,                               LAW AND ORDER,\n JUSTICE,                            LIBERTY,\n GENTLENESS,                         EQUALITY,\n CHRISTIANITY,                       HONORABLE DEALING,\n PROTECTION TO THE WEAK,             MERCY,\n TEMPERANCE,                         EDUCATION,\n                              --and so on.\n\nThere. Is it good? Sir, it is pie. It will bring into camp any idiot\nthat sits in darkness anywhere. But not if we adulterate it. It is\nproper to be emphatic upon that point. This brand is strictly for\nExport--apparently. _Apparently._ Privately and confidentially, it is\nnothing of the kind. Privately and confidentially, it is merely an\noutside cover, gay and pretty and attractive, displaying the special\npatterns of our Civilization which we reserve for Home Consumption,\nwhile _inside_ the bale is the Actual Thing that the Customer Sitting in\nDarkness buys with his blood and tears and land and liberty. That Actual\nThing is, indeed, Civilization, but it is only for Export. Is there a\ndifference between the two brands? In some of the details, yes.\n\nWe all know that the Business is being ruined. The reason is not far to\nseek. It is because our Mr. McKinley, and Mr. Chamberlain, and the\nKaiser, and the Tsar and the French have been exporting the Actual Thing\n_with the outside cover left off_. This is bad for the Game. It shows\nthat these new players of it are not sufficiently acquainted with it.\n\nIt is a distress to look on and note the mismoves, they are so strange\nand so awkward. Mr. Chamberlain manufactures a war out of materials so\ninadequate and so fanciful that they make the boxes grieve and the\ngallery laugh, and he tries hard to persuade himself that it isn\u2019t\npurely a private raid for cash, but has a sort of dim, vague\nrespectability about it somewhere, if he could only find the spot; and\nthat, by and by, he can scour the flag clean again after he has finished\ndragging it through the mud, and make it shine and flash in the vault of\nheaven once more as it had shone and flashed there a thousand years in\nthe world\u2019s respect until he laid his unfaithful hand upon it. It is bad\nplay--bad. For it exposes the Actual Thing to Them that Sit in Darkness,\nand they say: \u201cWhat! Christian against Christian? And only for money? Is\n_this_ a case of magnanimity, forbearance, love, gentleness, mercy,\nprotection of the weak--this strange and overshowy onslaught of an\nelephant upon a nest of field mice, on the pretext that the mice had\nsqueaked an insolence at him--conduct which \u201cno self-respecting\ngovernment could allow to pass unavenged\u201d? as Mr. Chamberlain said. Was\nthat a good pretext in a small case, when it had not been a good pretext\nin a large one?--for only recently Russia had affronted the elephant\nthree times and survived alive and unsmitten. Is this Civilization and\nProgress? Is it something better than we already possess? These\nharryings and burnings and desert-makings in the Transvaal--is this an\nimprovement on our darkness? Is it, perhaps, possible that there are two\nkinds of Civilization--one for home consumption and one for the heathen\nmarket?\u201d\n\nThen They that Sit in Darkness are troubled, and shake their heads; and\nthey read this extract from a letter of a British private, recounting\nhis exploits in one of Methuen\u2019s victories, some days before the affair\nof Magersfontein, and they are troubled again:\n\n  We tore up the hill and into the intrenchments, and the Boers saw we\n  had them; so they dropped their guns and went down on their knees and\n  put up their hands clasped, and begged for mercy. And we gave it\n  them--_with the long spoon_.\n\nThe long spoon is the bayonet. See _Lloyd\u2019s Weekly_, London, of those\ndays. The same number--and the same column--contained some quite\nunconscious satire in the form of shocked and bitter upbraidings of the\nBoers for their brutalities and inhumanities!\n\nNext, to our heavy damage, the Kaiser went to playing the game without\nfirst mastering it. He lost a couple of missionaries in a riot in\nShantung, and in his account he made an overcharge for them. China had\nto pay a hundred thousand dollars apiece for them, in money; twelve\nmiles of territory, containing several millions of inhabitants and worth\ntwenty million dollars; and to build a monument, and also a Christian\nchurch; whereas the people of China could have been depended upon to\nremember the missionaries without the help of these expensive memorials.\nThis was all bad play. Bad, because it would not, and could not, and\nwill not now or ever, deceive the Person Sitting in Darkness. He knows\nthat it was an overcharge. He knows that a missionary is like any other\nman: he is worth merely what you can supply his place for, and no more.\nHe is useful, but so is a doctor, so is a sheriff, so is an editor; but\na just Emperor does not charge war prices for such. A diligent,\nintelligent, but obscure missionary, and a diligent, intelligent country\neditor are worth much, and we know it; but they are not worth the earth.\nWe esteem such an editor, and we are sorry to see him go; but, when he\ngoes, we should consider twelve miles of territory, and a church, and a\nfortune, overcompensation for his loss. I mean, if he was a Chinese\neditor, and we had to settle for him. It is no proper figure for an\neditor or a missionary; one can get shop-worn kings for less. It was bad\nplay on the Kaiser\u2019s part. It got this property, true; but it _produced\nthe Chinese revolt_, the indignant uprising of China\u2019s traduced\npatriots, the Boxers. The results have been expensive to Germany, and to\nthe other Disseminators of Progress and the Blessings of Civilization.\n\nThe Kaiser\u2019s claim was paid, yet it was bad play, for it could not fail\nto have an evil effect upon Persons Sitting in Darkness in China. They\nwould muse upon the event, and be likely to say: \u201cCivilization is\ngracious and beautiful, for such is its reputation; but can we afford\nit? There are rich Chinamen, perhaps they can afford it; but this tax is\nnot laid upon them, it is laid upon the peasants of Shantung; it is they\nthat must pay this mighty sum, and their wages are but four cents a day.\nIs this a better civilization than ours, and holier and higher and\nnobler? Is not this rapacity? Is not this extortion? Would Germany\ncharge America two hundred thousand dollars for two missionaries, and\nshake the mailed fist in her face, and send warships, and send soldiers,\nand say: \u2018Seize twelve miles of territory, worth twenty millions of\ndollars, as additional pay for the missionaries; and make those peasants\nbuild a monument to the missionaries, and a costly Christian church to\nremember them by?\u2019 And later would Germany say to her soldiers: \u2018March\nthrough America and slay, _giving no quarter_; make the German face\nthere, as has been our Hun-face here, a terror for a thousand years;\nmarch through the Great Republic and slay, slay, slay, carving a road\nfor our offended religion through its heart and bowels?\u2019 Would Germany\ndo like this to America, to England, to France, to Russia? Or only to\nChina, the helpless--imitating the elephant\u2019s assault upon the field\nmice? Had we better invest in this Civilization--this Civilization which\ncalled Napoleon a buccaneer for carrying off Venice\u2019s bronze horses, but\nwhich steals our ancient astronomical instruments from our walls, and\ngoes looting like common bandits--that is, all the alien soldiers except\nAmerica\u2019s; and (Americans again excepted) storms frightened villages and\ncables the result to glad journals at home every day: \u2018Chinese losses,\n450 killed; ours, _one officer and two men wounded_. Shall proceed\nagainst neighboring village to-morrow, where a _massacre_ is reported.\u2019\nCan we afford Civilization?\u201d\n\nAnd next Russia must go and play the game injudiciously. She affronts\nEngland once or twice--with the Person Sitting in Darkness observing and\nnoting; by moral assistance of France and Germany, she robs Japan of her\nhard-earned spoil, all swimming in Chinese blood--Port Arthur--with the\nPerson again observing and noting; then she seizes Manchuria, raids its\nvillages, and chokes its great river with the swollen corpses of\ncountless massacred peasants--that astonished Person still observing and\nnoting. And perhaps he is saying to himself: \u201cIt is yet _another_\nCivilized Power, with its banner of the Prince of Peace in one hand and\nits loot basket and its butcher knife in the other. Is there no\nsalvation for us but to adopt Civilization and lift ourselves down to\nits level?\u201d\n\nAnd by and by comes America, and our Master of the Game plays it\nbadly--plays it as Mr. Chamberlain was playing it in South Africa. It\nwas a mistake to do that; also, it was one which was quite unlooked for\nin a Master who was playing it so well in Cuba. In Cuba, he was playing\nthe usual and regular _American_ game, and it was winning, for there is\nno way to beat it. The Master, contemplating Cuba, said: \u201cHere is an\noppressed and friendless little nation which is willing to fight to be\nfree; we go partners, and put up the strength of seventy million\nsympathizers and the resources of the United States: play!\u201d Nothing but\nEurope combined could call that hand: and Europe cannot combine on\nanything. There, in Cuba, he was following our great traditions in a way\nwhich made us very proud of him, and proud of the deep dissatisfaction\nwhich his play was provoking in continental Europe. Moved by a high\ninspiration, he threw out those stirring words which proclaimed that\nforcible annexation would be \u201ccriminal aggression\u201d; and in that\nutterance fired another \u201cshot heard round the world.\u201d The memory of that\nfine saying will be outlived by the remembrance of no act of his but\none--that he forgot it within the twelvemonth, and its honorable gospel\nalong with it.\n\nFor, presently, came the Philippine temptation. It was strong; it was\ntoo strong, and he made that bad mistake: he played the European game,\nthe Chamberlain game. It was a pity; it was a great pity, that error;\nthat one grievous error, that irrevocable error. For it was the very\nplace and time to play the American game again. And at no cost. Rich\nwinnings to be gathered in, too; rich and permanent; indestructible; a\nfortune transmissible forever to the children of the flag. Not land, not\nmoney, not dominion--no, something worth many times more than that\ndross: our share, the spectacle of a nation of long harassed and\npersecuted slaves set free through our influence; our posterity\u2019s share,\nthe golden memory of that fair deed. The game was in our hands. If it\nhad been played according to the American rules, Dewey would have sailed\naway from Manila as soon as he had destroyed the Spanish fleet--after\nputting up a sign on shore guaranteeing foreign property and life\nagainst damage by the Filipinos, and warning the Powers that\ninterference with the emancipated patriots would be regarded as an act\nunfriendly to the United States. The Powers cannot combine, in even a\nbad cause, and the sign would not have been molested.\n\nDewey could have gone about his affairs elsewhere, and left the\ncompetent Filipino army to starve out the little Spanish garrison and\nsend it home, and the Filipino citizens to set up the form of government\nthey might prefer, and deal with the friars and their doubtful\nacquisitions according to Filipino ideas of fairness and justice--ideas\nwhich have since been tested and found to be of as high an order as any\nthat prevail in Europe or America.\n\nBut we played the Chamberlain game, and lost the chance to add another\nCuba and another honorable deed to our good record.\n\nThe more we examine the mistake, the more clearly we perceive that it is\ngoing to be bad for the Business. The Person Sitting in Darkness is\nalmost sure to say: \u201cThere is something curious about this--curious and\nunaccountable. There must be two Americas: one that sets the captive\nfree, and one that takes a once-captive\u2019s new freedom away from him, and\npicks a quarrel with him with nothing to found it on; then kills him to\nget his land.\u201d\n\nThe truth is, the Person Sitting in Darkness _is_ saying things like\nthat; and for the sake of the Business we must persuade him to look at\nthe Philippine matter in another and healthier way. We must arrange his\nopinions for him. I believe it can be done; for Mr. Chamberlain has\narranged England\u2019s opinion of the South African matter, and done it most\ncleverly and successfully. He presented the facts--some of the\nfacts--and showed those confiding people what the facts meant. He did it\nstatistically, which is a good way. He used the formula: \u201cTwice 2 are\n14, and 2 from 9 leaves 35.\u201d Figures are effective; figures will\nconvince the elect.\n\nNow, my plan is a still bolder one than Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s, though\napparently a copy of it. Let us be franker than Mr. Chamberlain; let us\naudaciously present the whole of the facts, shirking none, then explain\nthem according to Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s formula. This daring truthfulness\nwill astonish and dazzle the Person Sitting in Darkness, and he will\ntake the Explanation down before his mental vision has had time to get\nback into focus. Let us say to him:\n\n\u201cOur case is simple. On the 1st of May, Dewey destroyed the Spanish\nfleet. This left the Archipelago in the hands of its proper and rightful\nowners, the Filipino nation. Their army numbered 30,000 men, and they\nwere competent to whip out or starve out the little Spanish garrison;\nthen the people could set up a government of their own devising. Our\ntraditions required that Dewey should now set up his warning sign, and\ngo away. But the Master of the Game happened to think of another\nplan--the European plan. He acted upon it. This was, to send out an\narmy--ostensibly to help the native patriots put the finishing touch\nupon their long and plucky struggle for independence, but really to take\ntheir land away from them and keep it. That is, in the interest of\nProgress and Civilization. The plan developed, stage by stage, and quite\nsatisfactorily. We entered into a military alliance with the trusting\nFilipinos, and they hemmed in Manila on the land side, and by their\nvaluable help the place, with its garrison of 8,000 or 10,000 Spaniards,\nwas captured--a thing which we could not have accomplished unaided at\nthat time. We got their help by--by ingenuity. We knew they were\nfighting for their independence, and that they had been at it for two\nyears. We knew they supposed that we also were fighting in their worthy\ncause--just as we had helped the Cubans fight for Cuban\nindependence--and we allowed them to go on thinking so. _Until Manila\nwas ours and we could get along without them._ Then we showed our hand.\nOf course, they were surprised--that was natural; surprised and\ndisappointed; disappointed and grieved. To them it looked un-American;\nuncharacteristic; foreign to our established traditions. And this was\nnatural, too; for we were only playing the American Game in public--in\nprivate it was the European. It was neatly done, very neatly, and it\nbewildered them. They could not understand it; for we had been so\nfriendly--so affectionate, even--with those simple-minded patriots! We,\nour own selves, had brought back out of exile their leader, their hero,\ntheir hope, their Washington--Aguinaldo; brought him in a warship, in\nhigh honor, under the sacred shelter and hospitality of the flag;\nbrought him back and restored him to his people, and got their moving\nand eloquent gratitude for it. Yes, we had been so friendly to them, and\nhad heartened them up in so many ways! We had lent them guns and\nammunition; advised with them; exchanged pleasant courtesies with them;\nplaced our sick and wounded in their kindly care; intrusted our Spanish\nprisoners to their humane and honest hands; fought shoulder to shoulder\nwith them against \u201cthe common enemy\u201d (our own phrase); praised their\ncourage, praised their gallantry, praised their mercifulness, praised\ntheir fine and honorable conduct; borrowed their trenches, borrowed\nstrong positions which they had previously captured from the Spaniards;\npetted them, lied to them--officially proclaiming that our land and\nnaval forces came to give them their freedom and displace the bad\nSpanish Government--fooled them, used them until we needed them no\nlonger; then derided the sucked orange and threw it away. We kept the\npositions which we had beguiled them of; by and by, we moved a force\nforward and overlapped patriot ground--a clever thought, for we needed\ntrouble, and this would produce it. A Filipino soldier, crossing the\nground, where no one had a right to forbid him, was shot by our sentry.\nThe badgered patriots resented this with arms, without waiting to know\nwhether Aguinaldo, who was absent, would approve or not. Aguinaldo did\nnot approve; but that availed nothing. What we wanted, in the interest\nof Progress and Civilization, was the Archipelago, unencumbered by\npatriots struggling for independence; and War was what we needed. We\nclinched our opportunity. It is Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s case over again--at\nleast in its motive and intention; and we played the game as adroitly as\nhe played it himself.\u201d\n\nAt this point in our frank statement of fact to the Person Sitting in\nDarkness, we should throw in a little trade taffy about the Blessings of\nCivilization--for a change, and for the refreshment of his spirit--then\ngo on with our tale:\n\n\u201cWe and the patriots having captured Manila, Spain\u2019s ownership\nof the Archipelago and her sovereignty over it were at an\nend--obliterated--annihilated--not a rag or shred of either remaining\nbehind. It was then that we conceived the divinely humorous idea of\n_buying_ both of these specters from Spain! [It is quite safe to confess\nthis to the Person Sitting in Darkness, since neither he nor any other\nsane person will believe it.] In buying those ghosts for twenty\nmillions, we also contracted to take care of the friars and their\naccumulations. I think we also agreed to propagate leprosy and smallpox,\nbut as to this there is doubt. But it is not important; persons\nafflicted with the friars do not mind other diseases.\n\n\u201cWith our Treaty ratified, Manila subdued, and our Ghosts secured, we\nhad no further use for Aguinaldo and the owners of the Archipelago. We\nforced a war, and we have been hunting America\u2019s guest and ally through\nthe woods and swamps ever since.\u201d\n\nAt this point in the tale, it will be well to boast a little of our war\nwork and our heroisms in the field, so as to make our performance look\nas fine as England\u2019s in South Africa; but I believe it will not be best\nto emphasize this too much. We must be cautious. Of course, we must read\nthe war telegrams to the Person, in order to keep up our frankness; but\nwe can throw an air of humorousness over them, and that will modify\ntheir grim eloquence a little, and their rather indiscret exhibitions of\ngory exultation. Before reading to him the following display heads of\nthe dispatches of November 18, 1900, it will be well to practice on them\nin private first, so as to get the right tang of lightness and gayety\ninto them:\n\n                         \u201cADMINISTRATION WEARY OF\n                         PROTRACTED HOSTILITIES!\u201d\n\n                       \u201cREAL WAR AHEAD FOR FILIPINO\n                               REBELS!\u201d[10]\n\n\n                          \u201cWILL SHOW NO MERCY!\u201d\n                       \u201cKITCHENER\u2019S PLAN ADOPTED!\u201d\n\nKitchener knows how to handle disagreeable people who are fighting for\ntheir homes and their liberties, and we must let on that we are merely\nimitating Kitchener, and have no national interest in the matter,\nfurther than to get ourselves admired by the Great Family of Nations, in\nwhich august company our Master of the Game has bought a place for us in\nthe back row.\n\nOf course, we must not venture to ignore our General MacArthur\u2019s\nreports--oh, why do they keep on printing those embarrassing things?--we\nmust drop them trippingly from the tongue and take the chances:\n\n  During the last ten months our losses have been 268 killed and 750\n  wounded; Filipino loss, _three thousand two hundred and twenty-seven\n  killed_, and 694 wounded.\n\nWe must stand ready to grab the Person Sitting in Darkness, for he will\nswoon away at this confession, saying: \u201cGood God! those \u2018niggers\u2019 spare\ntheir wounded, and the Americans massacre theirs!\u201d\n\nWe must bring him to, and coax him and coddle him, and assure him that\nthe ways of Providence are best, and that it would not become us to find\nfault with them; and then, to show him that we are only imitators, not\noriginators, we must read the following passage from the letter of an\nAmerican soldier lad in the Philippines to his mother, published in\n_Public Opinion_, of Decorah, Iowa, describing the finish of a\nvictorious battle:\n\n\u201cWE NEVER LEFT ONE ALIVE. IF ONE WAS WOUNDED, WE WOULD RUN OUR BAYONETS\nTHROUGH HIM.\u201d\n\nHaving now laid all the historical facts before the Person Sitting in\nDarkness, we should bring him to again, and explain them to him. We\nshould say to him:\n\n\u201cThey look doubtful, but in reality they are not. There have been lies;\nyes, but they were told in a good cause. We have been treacherous; but\nthat was only in order that real good might come out of apparent evil.\nTrue, we have crushed a deceived and confiding people; we have turned\nagainst the weak and the friendless who trusted us; we have stamped out\na just and intelligent and well-ordered republic; we have stabbed an\nally in the back and slapped the face of a guest; we have bought a\nShadow from an enemy that hadn\u2019t it to sell; we have robbed a trusting\nfriend of his land and his liberty; we have invited our clean young men\nto shoulder a discredited musket and do bandits\u2019 work under a flag which\nbandits have been accustomed to fear, not to follow; we have debauched\nAmerica\u2019s honor and blackened her face before the world; but each detail\nwas for the best. We know this. The Head of every State and Sovereignty\nin Christendom and 90 per cent of every legislative body in Christendom,\nincluding our Congress and our fifty state legislatures, are members not\nonly of the church, but also of the Blessings-of-Civilization Trust.\nThis world-girdling accumulation of trained morals, high principles, and\njustice cannot do an unright thing, an unfair thing, an ungenerous\nthing, an unclean thing. It knows what it is about. Give yourself no\nuneasiness; it is all right.\u201d\n\nNow then, that will convince the Person. You will see. It will restore\nthe Business. Also, it will elect the Master of the Game to the vacant\nplace in the Trinity of our national gods; and there on their high\nthrones the Three will sit, age after age, in the people\u2019s sight, each\nbearing the Emblem of his service: Washington, the Sword of the\nLiberator; Lincoln, the Slave\u2019s Broken Chains; the Master, the Chains\nRepaired.\n\nIt will give the Business a splendid new start. You will see.\n\nEverything is prosperous, now; everything is just as we should wish it.\nWe have got the Archipelago, and we shall never give it up. Also, we\nhave every reason to hope that we shall have an opportunity before very\nlong to slip out of our congressional contract with Cuba and give her\nsomething better in the place of it. It is a rich country, and many of\nus are already beginning to see that the contract was a sentimental\nmistake. But now--right now--is the best time to do some profitable\nrehabilitating work--work that will set us up and make us comfortable,\nand discourage gossip. We cannot conceal from ourselves that, privately,\nwe are a little troubled about our uniform. It is one of our prides; it\nis acquainted with honor; it is familiar with great deeds and noble; we\nlove it, we revere it; and so this errand it is on makes us uneasy. And\nour flag--another pride of ours, our chiefest! We have worshiped it so;\nand when we have seen it in far lands--glimpsing it unexpectedly in that\nstrange sky, waving its welcome and benediction to us--we have caught\nour breaths, and uncovered our heads, and couldn\u2019t speak, for a moment,\nfor the thought of what it was to us and the great ideals it stood for.\nIndeed, we _must_ do something about these things; it is easily managed.\nWe can have a special one--our states do it: we can have just our usual\nflag, with the white stripes painted black and the stars replaced by the\nskull and crossbones.\n\nAnd we do not need that Civil Commission out there. Having no powers, it\nhas to invent them, and that kind of work cannot be effectively done by\njust anybody; an expert is required. Mr. Croker can be spared. We do not\nwant the United States represented there, but only the Game.\n\nBy help of these suggested amendments, Progress and Civilization in that\ncountry can have a boom, and it will take in the Persons who are Sitting\nin Darkness, and we can resume Business at the old stand.\n\n-----\n\nFootnote 10:\n\n  \u201cRebels!\u201d Mumble that funny word--don\u2019t let the Person catch it\n  distinctly.\n\n\n\n\n                        TO MY MISSIONARY CRITICS\n                    (_North American Review_, 1901)\n\n\nI have received many newspaper cuttings; also letters from several\nclergymen; also a note from the Rev. Dr. Judson Smith, Corresponding\nSecretary of the American Board of Foreign Missions--all of a like\ntenor; all saying, substantially, what is said in the cutting here\ncopied:\n\n                    AN APOLOGY DUE FROM MR. CLEMENS\n\n  The evidence of the past day or two should induce Mark Twain to make\n  for the amen corner and formulate a prompt apology for his scathing\n  attack on the Rev. Dr. Ament, the veteran Chinese missionary. The\n  assault was based on a Peking dispatch to the New York _Sun_, which\n  said that Dr. Ament had collected from the Chinese in various places\n  damages thirteen times in excess of actual losses. So Mark Twain\n  charged Mr. Ament with bullyragging, extortion, and things. A Peking\n  dispatch to the _Sun_ yesterday, however, explains that the amount\n  collected was not thirteen times the damage sustained, but _one-third\n  in excess of the indemnities_, and that the blunder was due to a cable\n  error in transmission. The 1-3d got converted into 13. Yesterday the\n  Rev. Judson Smith, Secretary of the American Board, received a\n  dispatch from Dr. Ament, calling attention to the cable blunder, and\n  declaring that all the collections which he made were _approved by the\n  Chinese officials_. The fractional amount that was collected in excess\n  of actual losses, he explains, is being _used for the support of\n  widows and orphans_.\n\n  So collapses completely--and convulsively--Mark Twain\u2019s sensational\n  and ugly bombardment of a missionary whose character and services\n  should have exempted him from such an assault.\n\n  From the charge the underpinning has been knocked out. To Dr. Ament\n  Mr. Clemens has done an injustice which is gross but unintentional. If\n  Mark Twain is the man we take him to be he won\u2019t be long in filing a\n  retraction, plus an apology.\n\nI have no prejudice against apologies. I trust I shall never withhold\none when it is due; I trust I shall never even have a disposition to do\nso. These letters and newspaper paragraphs are entitled to my best\nattention; respect for their writers and for the humane feeling which\nhas prompted their utterances requires this of me. It may be barely\npossible that, if these requests for an apology had reached me before\nthe 20th of February, I might have had a sort of qualified chance to\napologize; but on that day appeared the two little cablegrams referred\nto in the newspaper cutting copied above--one from the Rev. Dr. Smith to\nthe Rev. Dr. Ament, the other from Dr. Ament to Dr. Smith--and my small\nchance died then. In my opinion, these cablegrams ought to have been\nsuppressed, for it seems clear that they give Dr. Ament\u2019s case entirely\naway. Still, that is only an opinion, and may be a mistake. It will be\nbest to examine the case from the beginning, by the light of the\ndocuments connected with it.\n\n                               EXHIBIT A\n\nThis is a dispatch from Mr. Chamberlain,[11] chief of the _Sun\u2019s_\ncorrespondence staff in Peking. It appeared in the _Sun_ last Christmas\nEve, and in referring to it hereafter I will call it the \u201cC. E.\ndispatch\u201d for short:\n\n  The Rev. Mr. Ament, of the American Board of Foreign Missions, has\n  returned from a trip which he made for the purpose of collecting\n  indemnities for damages done by Boxers. Everywhere he went he\n  compelled the Chinese to pay. He says that all his native Christians\n  are now provided for. He had seven hundred of them under his charge,\n  and three hundred were killed. He has collected 300 taels for each of\n  these murders, and has compelled full payment for all the property\n  belonging to Christians that was destroyed. He also assessed fines\n  amounting to thirteen times[12] the amount of the indemnity. This\n  money will be used for the propagation of the Gospel.\n\n  Mr. Ament declares that the compensation he has collected is moderate\n  when compared with the amount secured by the Catholics, who demand, in\n  addition to money, head for head. They collect 500 taels for each\n  murder of a Catholic. In the Wen-Chiu country 680 Catholics were\n  killed, and for this the European Catholics here demand 750,000\n  strings of cash and 680 heads.\n\n  In the course of a conversation Mr. Ament referred to the attitude of\n  the missionaries toward the Chinese. He said:\n\n  \u201cI deny emphatically that the missionaries are vindictive, that they\n  generally looted, or that they have done anything since the siege that\n  the circumstances did not demand. I criticize the Americans. The soft\n  hand of the Americans is not as good as the mailed fist of the\n  Germans. If you deal with the Chinese with a soft hand they will take\n  advantage of it.\u201d\n\nIn an article addressed \u201cTo the Person Sitting in Darkness,\u201d published\nin the _North American Review_ for February, I made some comments upon\nthis C. E. dispatch.\n\nIn an Open Letter to me, from the Rev. Dr. Smith, published in the\n_Tribune_ of February 15th, doubt is cast upon the authenticity of the\ndispatch.\n\nUp to the 20th of February, this doubt was an important factor in the\ncase: Dr. Ament\u2019s brief cablegram, published on that date, took the\nimportance all out of it.\n\nIn the Open Letter, Dr. Smith quotes this passage from a letter from Dr.\nAment, dated November 13th. The italics are mine:\n\n  _This_ time I proposed to settle affairs _without the aid of soldiers\n  or_ legations.\n\nThis cannot mean two things, but only one: that, previously, he _had_\ncollected by armed force.\n\nAlso, in the Open Letter, Dr. Smith quotes some praises of Dr. Ament and\nthe Rev. Mr. Tewksbury, furnished by the Rev. Dr. Sheffield, and says:\n\n  Dr. Sheffield is not accustomed to speak thus of _thieves_, or\n  _extortioners_, or _braggarts_.\n\nWhat can he mean by those vigorous expressions? Can he mean that the\nfirst two would be applicable to a missionary who should collect from B,\nwith the \u201caid of soldiers,\u201d indemnities possibly due by A, and upon\noccasion go out looting?\n\n                               EXHIBIT B\n\nTestimony of George Lynch (indorsed as entirely trustworthy by the\n_Tribune_ and the _Herald_), war correspondent in the Cuban and South\nAfrican wars, and in the march upon Peking for the rescue of the\nlegations. The italics are mine:\n\n  When the _soldiers_ were prohibited from looting, no such prohibitions\n  seemed to operate with the _missionaries_. For instance, the _Rev. Mr.\n  Tewksbury held a great sale of looted goods, which lasted several\n  days_.\n\n  A day or two after the relief, when looking for a place to sleep in, I\n  met the Rev. Mr. Ament, of the American Board of Foreign Missions. _He\n  told me_ he was going to take possession of the house of a wealthy\n  Chinaman who was an old enemy of his, as he had interfered much in the\n  past with his missionary labors in Peking. A couple of days afterwards\n  _he did so_, and held a _great sale of his enemy\u2019s effects_. I bought\n  a sable cloak at it for $125, and a couple of statues of Buddha. As\n  the stock became depleted _it was replenished by the efforts of his\n  converts, who were ransacking the houses in the neighborhood_.--New\n  York _Herald_, February 18th.\n\nIt is Dr. Smith, not I, who has suggested that persons who act in this\nway are \u201cthieves and extortioners.\u201d\n\n                               EXHIBIT C\n\nSir Robert Hart, in the _Fortnightly Review_ for January, 1901. This\nwitness has been for many years the most prominent and important\nEnglishman in China, and bears an irreproachable reputation for\nmoderation, fairness, and truth-speaking. In closing a description of\nthe revolting scenes which followed the occupation of Peking, when the\nChristian armies (with the proud exception of the American soldiery, let\nus be thankful for that) gave themselves up to a ruthless orgy of\nrobbery and spoliation, he says (the italics are mine):\n\n  And even some _missionaries_ took such a _leading_ part in \u201cspoiling\n  the Egyptians\u201d for the greater glory of God that a bystander was heard\n  to say: \u201c_For a century to come Chinese converts will consider looting\n  and vengeance Christian virtues._\u201d\n\nIt is Dr. Smith, not I, who has suggested that persons who act in this\nway are \u201cthieves and extortioners.\u201d According to Mr. Lynch and Mr.\nMartin (another war correspondent), Dr. Ament helped to spoil several of\nthose Egyptians. Mr. Martin took a photograph of the scene. It was\nreproduced in the _Herald_. I have it.\n\n                               EXHIBIT D\n\nIn a brief reply to Dr. Smith\u2019s Open Letter to me, I said this in the\n_Tribune_. I am italicizing several words--for a purpose:\n\n  Whenever he (Dr. Smith) can produce from the Rev. Mr. Ament an\n  assertion that the _Sun\u2019s_ character-blasting dispatch was not\n  authorized _by him_, and whenever Dr. Smith can buttress Mr. Ament\u2019s\n  disclaimer with a confession from _Mr. Chamberlain_, the head of the\n  Laffan News Service in China, that that dispatch was a false invention\n  _and unauthorized_, the case against Mr. Ament will fall at once to\n  the ground.\n\n                               EXHIBIT E\n\nBrief cablegrams, referred to above, which passed between Dr. Smith and\nDr. Ament, and were published on February 20th:\n\n  Ament, Peking: Reported December 24 your collecting thirteen times\n  actual losses; using for propagating the Gospel. Are these statements\n  true? Cable specific answer.\n\n                                                              SMITH.\n\n  Statement untrue. Collected 1-3 for church expenses, additional actual\n  damages; now supporting widows and orphans. Publication thirteen times\n  blunder cable. All collections received approval Chinese officials,\n  who are urging further settlements same line.\n\n                                                              AMENT.\n\nOnly two questions are asked; \u201cspecific\u201d answers required; no perilous\nwanderings among the other details of the unhappy dispatch desired.\n\n                               EXHIBIT F\n\nLetter from Dr. Smith to me, dated March 8th. The italics are mine; they\ntag inaccuracies of statement:\n\n  Permit me to call your attention to the marked paragraphs in the\n  inclosed papers, and to ask you to note their relation to the two\n  conditions named in your letter to the New York _Tribune_ of February\n  15th.\n\n  The first is _Dr. Ament\u2019s denial of the truth of the dispatch in the\n  New York \u201cSun,\u201d_ of December 24th, on which your criticisms of him in\n  the _North American Review_ of February were founded. The second is a\n  correction by the _\u201cSun\u2019s\u201d_ _special correspondent_ in Peking of the\n  dispatch printed in the _Sun_ of December 24th.\n\n  Since, as you state in your letter to the _Tribune_, \u201cthe case against\n  Mr. Ament would fall to the ground\u201d _if Mr. Ament denied the truth_ of\n  the _Sun\u2019s_ first dispatch, and _if the \u2018Sun\u2019s\u2019 news agency_ in Peking\n  also _declared that dispatch false_, and these two conditions _have\n  thus been fulfilled_, I am sure that upon having these _facts_ brought\n  to your attention you will gladly withdraw the criticisms that were\n  _founded on a \u201ccable blunder.\u201d_\n\nI think Dr. Smith ought to read me more carefully; then he would not\nmake so many mistakes. Within the narrow space of two paragraphs,\ntotaling eleven lines, he has scored nine departures from fact out of a\npossible 9\u00bd. Now, is that parliamentary? I do not treat him like that.\nWhenever I quote him, I am particular not to do him the least wrong, or\nmake him say anything he did not say.\n\n(1) Mr. Ament doesn\u2019t \u201cdeny the truth of the C. E. dispatch\u201d; he merely\nchanges one of its phrases, without materially changing the meaning, and\n(immaterially) corrects a cable blunder (which correction I accept). He\nwas asked no question about the other four fifths of the C. E. dispatch.\n(2) I said nothing about \u201cspecial\u201d correspondents; I named the right and\nresponsible man--Mr. Chamberlain. The \u201ccorrection\u201d referred to is a\nrepetition of the one I have just accepted, which (immaterially) changes\n\u201cthirteen times\u201d to \u201cone third\u201d extra tax. (3) I did not say anything\nabout \u201cthe _Sun\u2019s_ news agency\u201d; I said \u201cChamberlain.\u201d I have every\nconfidence in Mr. Chamberlain, but I am not personally acquainted with\nthe others. (4) Once more--Mr. Ament didn\u2019t \u201cdeny the truth\u201d of the C.\nE. dispatch, but merely made unimportant emendations of a couple of its\nmany details. (5) I did not say \u201cif Mr. Ament denied the truth\u201d of the\nC. E. dispatch: I said, if he would assert that the dispatch was not\n\u201cauthorized\u201d _by him_. For example, I did not suppose that the charge\nthat the Catholic missionaries wanted 680 Chinamen beheaded was true;\nbut I did want to know if Dr. Ament personally authorized that statement\nand the others, as coming from his lips. Another detail: one of my\nconditions was that Mr. Chamberlain must not stop with confessing that\nthe C. E. was a \u201cfalse invention,\u201d he must also confess that it was\n\u201c_unauthorized_.\u201d Dr. Smith has left out that large detail. (6) The\n_Sun\u2019s_ news agency did not \u201cdeclare the C. E. dispatch false,\u201d but\nconfined itself to correcting one unimportant detail of its long\nlist--the change of \u201c13 times\u201d to \u201cone third\u201d extra. (7) The \u201ctwo\nconditions\u201d have not \u201cbeen fulfilled\u201d--far from it. (8) Those details\nlabeled \u201cfacts\u201d are only fancies. (9) Finally, my criticisms were by no\nmeans confined to that detail of the C. E. dispatch which we now accept\nas having been a \u201ccable blunder.\u201d\n\nSetting to one side these nine departures from fact, I find that what is\nleft of the eleven lines is straight and true. I am not blaming Dr.\nSmith for these discrepancies--it would not be right, it would not be\nfair. I make the proper allowances. He has not been a journalist, as I\nhave been--a trade wherein a person is brought to book by the rest of\nthe press so often for divergencies that, by and by, he gets to be\nalmost morbidly afraid to indulge in them. It is so with me. I always\nhave the disposition to tell what is not so; I was born with it; we all\nhave it. But I try not to do it now, because I have found out that it is\nunsafe. But with the Doctor of course it is different.\n\n                               EXHIBIT G\n\nI wanted to get at the whole of the facts as regards the C. E. dispatch,\nand so I wrote to China for them, when I found that the Board was not\ngoing to do it. But I am not allowed to wait. It seemed quite within the\npossibilities that a full detail of the facts might furnish me a chance\nto make an apology to Mr. Ament--a chance which, I give you my word, I\nwould have honestly used, and not abused. But it is no matter. If the\nBoard is not troubled about the bulk of that lurid dispatch, why should\nI be? I answered the apology-urging letters of several clergymen with\nthe information that I had written to China for the details, and said I\nthought it was the only sure way of getting into a position to do fair\nand full justice to all concerned; but a couple of them replied that it\nwas not a matter that could wait. That is to say, groping your way out\nof a jungle in the dark with guesses and conjectures is better than a\nstraight march out in the sunlight of fact. It seems a curious idea.\n\nHowever, those two clergymen were in a large measure right--from their\npoint of view and the Board\u2019s; which is, putting it in the form of a\ncouple of questions:\n\n1. _Did Dr. Ament collect the assessed damages and thirteen times over?_\nThe answer is: He did _not_. He collected only a _third_ over.\n\n2. _Did he apply the third to the \u201cpropagation of the Gospel?\u201d_ The\nanswer is this correction: He applied it to \u201cchurch expenses.\u201d Part or\nall of the outlay, it appears, goes to \u201csupporting widows and orphans.\u201d\nIt may be that church expenses and supporting widows and orphans are not\npart of the machinery for propagating the Gospel. I supposed they were,\nbut it isn\u2019t any matter; I prefer this phrasing; it is not so blunt as\nthe other.\n\nIn the opinion of the two clergymen and of the Board, these two points\nare _the only important ones_ in the whole C. E. dispatch.\n\nI accept that. Therefore let us throw out the rest of the dispatch as\nbeing no longer a part of Dr. Ament\u2019s case.\n\n                               EXHIBIT H\n\n  The two clergymen and the Board are quite content with Dr. Ament\u2019s\n  answers upon the two points.\n\nUpon the first point of the two, my own viewpoint may be indicated by a\nquestion:\n\n_Did Dr. Ament collect from B (whether by compulsion or simple demand)\neven so much as a penny in payment for murders or depredations, without\nknowing, beyond question, that B, and not another, committed the murders\nor the depredations?_\n\nOr, in other words:\n\n_Did Dr. Ament ever, by chance or through ignorance, make the innocent\npay the debts of the guilty?_\n\nIn the article entitled \u201cTo the Person Sitting in Darkness,\u201d I put\nforward that point in a paragraph taken from Macallum\u2019s (imaginary)\n\u201cHistory\u201d:\n\n                               EXHIBIT I\n\n  When a white Boxer kills a Pawnee and destroys his property the other\n  Pawnees do not trouble to seek _him_ out; they kill any white person\n  that comes along; also, they make some white village pay deceased\u2019s\n  heirs the full cash value of deceased, together with full cash value\n  of the property destroyed; they also make the village pay, in\n  addition, _thirteen times_[13] the value of that property into a fund\n  for the dissemination of the Pawnee religion, which they regard as the\n  best of all religions for the softening and humanizing of the heart of\n  man. It is their idea that it is only fair and right _that the\n  innocent should be made to suffer for the guilty_, and that it is\n  better that 90 and 9 innocent should suffer than that one guilty\n  person should escape.\n\nWe all know that Dr. Ament did not bring suspected persons into a duly\norganized court and try them by just and fair Christian and civilized\nmethods, but proclaimed his \u201cconditions,\u201d and collected damages from the\ninnocent and the guilty alike, without any court proceedings at all.[14]\nThat he himself, and not the villagers, made the \u201cconditions,\u201d we learn\nfrom his letter of November 13th, already quoted from--the one in which\nhe remarked that, upon _that_ occasion he brought no soldiers with him.\nThe italics are mine:\n\n  After our _conditions_ were known many villagers came of their own\n  accord and brought their money with them.\n\nNot all, but \u201cmany.\u201d The Board really believes that those hunted and\nharried paupers out there were not only willing to strip themselves to\npay Boxer damages, whether they owed them or not, but were sentimentally\neager to do it. Mr. Ament says, in his letter: \u201cThe villagers were\nextremely grateful because I brought no foreign soldiers, and were glad\nto settle on the terms proposed.\u201d Some of those people know more about\ntheology than they do about human nature. I do not remember encountering\neven a Christian who was \u201cglad\u201d to pay money he did not owe; and as for\na Chinaman doing it, why, dear me, the thing is unthinkable. We have all\nseen Chinamen, many Chinamen, but not that kind. It is a new kind: an\ninvention of the Board--and \u201csoldiers.\u201d\n\n                       CONCERNING THE COLLECTIONS\n\nWhat was the \u201cone third extra\u201d? Money due? No. Was it a theft, then?\nPutting aside the \u201cone third extra,\u201d what was the _remainder_ of the\nexacted indemnity, if collected from persons not _known_ to owe it, and\nwithout Christian and civilized forms of procedure? Was _it_ theft, was\nit robbery? In America it would be that; in Christian Europe it would be\nthat. I have great confidence in Dr. Smith\u2019s judgment concerning this\ndetail, and he calls it \u201ctheft and extortion\u201d--even in China; for he was\ntalking about the \u201cthirteen times\u201d at the time that he gave it that\nstrong name.[15] It is his idea that, when you make guilty and innocent\nvillagers pay the appraised damages, and then make them pay thirteen\ntimes that, besides, the _thirteen_ stand for \u201ctheft and extortion.\u201d\n\nThen what does _one third_ extra stand for? Will he give that one third\na name? Is it Modified Theft and Extortion? Is that it? The girl who was\nrebuked for having borne an illegitimate child excused herself by\nsaying, \u201cBut it is such a _little_ one.\u201d\n\nWhen the \u201cthirteen-times-extra\u201d was alleged, it stood for theft and\nextortion, in Dr. Smith\u2019s eyes, and he was shocked. But when Dr. Ament\nshowed that he had taken only a _third_ extra, instead of thirteenfold,\nDr. Smith was relieved, content, happy. I declare I cannot imagine why.\nThat editor--quoted at the head of this article--was happy about it,\ntoo. I cannot think why. He thought I ought to \u201cmake for the amen corner\nand formulate a prompt apology.\u201d To whom, and for what? It is too deep\nfor me.\n\nTo Dr. Smith, the \u201cthirteenfold extra\u201d clearly stood for \u201ctheft and\nextortion,\u201d and he was right, distinctly right, indisputably right. He\nmanifestly thinks that when it got scaled away down to a mere \u201cone\nthird,\u201d a little thing like that was something other than \u201ctheft and\nextortion.\u201d Why? Only the Board knows! I will try to explain this\ndifficult problem, so that the Board can get an idea of it. If a pauper\nowes me a dollar, and I catch him unprotected and make him pay me\nfourteen dollars, thirteen of it is \u201ctheft and extortion\u201d; if I make him\npay only a dollar and thirty-three and a third cents the thirty-three\nand a third cents are \u201ctheft and extortion\u201d just the same. I will put it\nin another way, still simpler. If a man owes me one dog--any kind of a\ndog, the breed is of no consequence--and I----But let it go; the Board\nwould never understand it. It _can\u2019t_ understand these involved and\ndifficult things.\n\nBut _if_ the Board could understand, then I could furnish some more\ninstruction--which is this. The one third, obtained by \u201ctheft and\nextortion,\u201d is _tainted money_, and cannot be purified even by defraying\n\u201cchurch expenses\u201d and \u201csupporting widows and orphans\u201d with it. It has to\nbe restored to the people it was taken from.\n\nAlso, there is another view of these things. By our Christian code of\nmorals and law, the _whole_ $1.33 1-3, if taken from a man not formally\n_proven_ to have committed the damage the dollar represents, is \u201ctheft\nand extortion.\u201d It cannot be honestly used for any purpose at all. It\nmust be handed back to the man it was taken from.\n\nIs there no way, then, to justify these thefts and extortions and make\nthem clean and fair and honorable? Yes, there is. It can be done; it has\nbeen done; it continues to be done--by revising the Ten Commandments and\nbringing them down to date: for use in pagan lands. For example:\n\n  _Thou shalt not steal_--except when it is the custom of the country.\n\nThis way out is recognized and _approved_ by all the best authorities,\nincluding the Board. I will cite witnesses.\n\n_The newspaper cutting, above_: \u201cDr. Ament declares that all the\ncollections which he made were approved by the _Chinese_ officials.\u201d The\neditor is satisfied.\n\n_Dr. Ament\u2019s cable to Dr. Smith_: \u201cAll collections received approval\n_Chinese_ officials.\u201d Dr. Ament is satisfied.\n\n_Letters from eight clergymen_--all to the same effect: Dr. Ament merely\ndid as the _Chinese_ do. So they are satisfied.\n\n_Mr. Ward, of the \u201cIndependent.\u201d_\n\n_The Rev. Dr. Washington Gladden._\n\nI have mislaid the letters of these gentlemen and cannot quote their\nwords, but they are of the satisfied.\n\n_The Rev. Dr. Smith_, in his Open Letter, published in the _Tribune:_\n\u201cThe whole procedure [Dr. Ament\u2019s] is in accordance with a custom among\nthe _Chinese_, of holding a village responsible for wrongs suffered in\nthat village, and especially making the head man of the village\naccountable for wrongs committed there.\u201d Dr. Smith is satisfied. Which\nmeans that the Board is satisfied.\n\nThe \u201chead man\u201d! Why, then, this poor rascal, innocent or guilty, must\npay the whole bill, if he cannot squeeze it out of his poor-devil\nneighbors. But, indeed, he can be depended upon to try, even to the\nskinning them of their last brass farthing, their last rag of clothing,\ntheir last ounce of food. He can be depended upon to get the indemnity\nout of them, though it cost stripes and blows, blood-tears, and flesh.\n\nTHE TALE OF THE KING AND HIS TREASURER\n\nHow strange and remote and romantic and Oriental and Arabian-Nighty it\nall seems--and is. It brings back the old forgotten tales, and we hear\nthe King say to his Treasurer:\n\n\u201cBring me 30,000 gold tomauns.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllah preserve us, Sire! the treasury is empty.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you hear? Bring the money--in ten days. Else, send me your head in a\nbasket.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear and obey.\u201d\n\nThe Treasurer summons the head men of a hundred villages, and says to\none:\n\n\u201cBring me a hundred gold tomauns.\u201d To another, \u201cBring me five hundred.\u201d\nTo another, \u201cBring a thousand. In ten days. Your head is the forfeit.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour slaves kiss your feet! Ah, high and mighty lord, be merciful to\nour hard-pressed villagers; they are poor, they are naked, they starve;\noh, these impossible sums! even the half----\u201d\n\n\u201cGo! Grind it out of them, crush it out of them, turn the blood of the\nfathers, the tears of the mothers, the milk of the babes to money--or\ntake the consequences. Have you heard?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis will be done, Who is the Fount of love and mercy and compassion,\nWho layeth this heavy burden upon us by the hand of His anointed\nservants--blessed be His holy Name! The father shall bleed, the mother\nshall faint for hunger, the babe shall perish at the dry breast. The\nchosen of God have commanded: it shall be as they say.\u201d\n\nI am not meaning to object to the substitution of pagan customs for\nChristian, here and there and now and then, when the Christian ones are\ninconvenient. No; I like it and admire it. I do it myself. And I admire\nthe alertness of the Board in watching out for chances to trade Board\nmorals for Chinese morals, and get the best of the swap; for I cannot\nendure those people, they are yellow, and I have never considered yellow\nbecoming. I have always been like the Board--perfectly well-meaning, but\ndestitute of the Moral Sense. Now, one of the main reasons why it is so\nhard to make the Board understand that there is no moral difference\nbetween a big filch and a little filch, but only a legal one, is that\nvacancy in its make-up. Morally, there are no degrees in stealing. The\nCommandment merely says, \u201cThou shalt not _steal_,\u201d and stops there. It\ndoesn\u2019t recognize any difference between stealing a third and stealing\nthirteenfold. If I could think of a way to put it before the Board in\nsuch a plain and--\n\nTHE WATERMELONS\n\nI have it, now. Many years ago, when I was studying for the gallows, I\nhad a dear comrade, a youth who was not in my line, but still a\nthoroughly good fellow, though devious. He was preparing to qualify for\na place on the Board, for there was going to be a vacancy by\nsuperannuation in about five years. This was down South, in the slavery\ndays. It was the nature of the negro then, as now, to steal watermelons.\nThey stole three of the melons of an adoptive brother of mine, the only\ngood ones he had. I suspected three of a neighbor\u2019s negroes, but there\nwas no proof: and, besides, the watermelons in those negroes\u2019 private\npatches were all green and small, and not up to indemnity standard. But\nin the private patches of three other negroes there were a number of\ncompetent melons. I consulted with my comrade, the understudy of the\nBoard. He said that if I would approve his arrangements, he would\narrange. I said, \u201cConsider me the Board; I approve: arrange.\u201d So he took\na gun, and went and collected three large melons for my\nbrother-on-the-half-shell, and one over. I was greatly pleased, and\nasked:\n\n\u201cWho gets the extra one?\u201d\n\n\u201cWidows and orphans.\u201d\n\n\u201cA good idea, too. Why didn\u2019t you take thirteen?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would have been wrong; a crime, in fact--Theft and Extortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the one third extra--the odd melon--the same?\u201d\n\nIt caused him to reflect. But there was no result.\n\nThe justice of the peace was a stern man. On the trial, he found fault\nwith the scheme, and required us to explain upon what we based our\nstrange conduct--as he called it. The understudy said:\n\n\u201cOn the custom of the niggers. They all do it.\u201d\n\nThe justice forgot his dignity, and descended to sarcasm:\n\n\u201cCustom of the niggers! Are our morals so inadequate that we have to\nborrow of niggers?\u201d Then he said to the jury: \u201cThree melons were owing;\nthey were collected from persons not proven to owe them; this is theft.\nThey were collected by compulsion; this is extortion. A melon was\nadded--for the widows and orphans. It was owed by no one. It is another\ntheft, another extortion. Return it whence it came, with the others. It\nis not permissible, here, to apply to any object goods dishonestly\nobtained--not even to the feeding of widows and orphans, for that would\nbe to put a shame upon charity and dishonor it.\u201d\n\nHe said it in open court, before everybody, and to me it did not seem\nvery kind.\n\nA clergyman, in a letter to me, reminds me, with a touch of reproach,\nthat \u201cmany of the missionaries are good men, kind-hearted, earnest,\ndevoted to their work.\u201d Certainly they are. No one is disputing it.\nInstead of \u201cmany,\u201d he could have said \u201calmost all,\u201d and still said the\ntruth, no doubt. I know many missionaries; I have met them all about the\nglobe, and have known only one or two who could not fill that bill and\nanswer to that description. \u201cAlmost all\u201d comes near to being a\nproportion and a description applicable also to lawyers, authors,\neditors, merchants, manufacturers--in fact, to most guilds and\nvocations. Without a doubt, Dr. Ament did what he believed to be right,\nand I concede that when a man is doing what he believes to be right,\nthere is argument on his side. I differ with Dr. Ament, but that is only\nbecause he got his training from the Board and I got mine outside.\nNeither of us is responsible, altogether.\n\nRECAPITULATION\n\nBut there is no need to sum up. Mr. Ament has acknowledged the \u201cone\nthird extra\u201d--no other witness is necessary. The Rev. Dr. Smith has\ncarefully considered the act and labeled it with a stern name, and his\nverdict seems to have no flaw in it. The morals of the act are Chinese,\nbut are approved by the Board, and by some of the clergy and some of the\nnewspapers, as being a valuable improvement upon Christian ones--which\nleaves me with a closed mouth, though with a pain in my heart.\n\nIS THE AMERICAN BOARD ON TRIAL?\n\nDo I think that Dr. Ament and certain of his fellow missionaries are as\nbad as their conduct? No, I do not. They are the product of their\ntraining; and now that I understand the whole case, and where they got\ntheir ideals, and that they are merely subordinates and subject to\nauthority, I comprehend that they are rather accessories than\nprincipals, and that their acts only show faulty heads curiously\ntrained, not bad hearts. Mainly, as it seems to me, it is the American\nBoard that is on trial. And again, it is a case of the head, not of the\nheart. That it has a heart which has never harbored an evil intention,\nno one will deny, no one will question; the Board\u2019s history can silence\nany challenge on that score. The Board\u2019s heart is not in court: it is\nits head that is on trial.\n\nIt is a sufficiently strange head. Its ways baffle comprehension; its\nideas are like no one else\u2019s; its methods are novelties to the practical\nworld; its judgments are surprises. When one thinks it is going to speak\nand must speak, it is silent; when one thinks it ought to be silent and\nmust be silent, it speaks. Put your finger where you think it ought to\nbe, it is not there; put it where you think it ought not to be, there\nyou find it.\n\nWhen its servant in China seemed to be charging himself with amazing\nthings, in a reputable journal--in a dispatch which was copied into many\nother papers--the Board was as silent about it as any dead man could\nhave been who was informed that his house was burning over his head. An\nexchange of cablegrams could have enabled it, within two days, to prove\nto the world--possibly--that the damaging dispatch had not proceeded\nfrom the mouth of its servant; yet it sat silent and asked no questions\nabout the matter.\n\nIt was silent during thirty-eight days. Then the dispatch came into\nprominence again. It chanced that I was the occasion of it. A break in\nthe stillness followed. In what form? An exchange of cablegrams,\nresulting in proof that the damaging dispatch had not been authorized?\nNo, in the form of an Open Letter by the Corresponding Secretary of the\nAmerican Board, the Rev. Dr. Smith, in which it was _argued_ that Dr.\nAment could not have said and done the things set forth in the dispatch.\n\nSurely, this was bad politics. A repudiating telegram would have been\nworth more than a library of argument.\n\nAn extension of the silence would have been better than the Open Letter,\nI think. I thought so at the time. It seemed to me that mistakes enough\nhad been made and harm enough done. I thought it questionable policy to\npublish the Letter, for I \u201cdid not think it likely that Dr. Ament would\ndisown the dispatch,\u201d and I telegraphed that to the Rev. Dr. Smith.\nPersonally, I had nothing against Dr. Ament, and that is my attitude\nyet.\n\nOnce more it was a good time for an extension of the silence. But no;\nthe Board has its own ways, and one of them is to do the unwise thing,\nwhen occasion offers. After having waited fifty-six days, it cabled to\nDr. Ament. No one can divine why it did so then, instead of fifty-six\ndays earlier.[16] It got a fatal reply--and was not aware of it. That\nwas that curious confession about the \u201cone third extra\u201d; its\napplication, not to the \u201cpropagation of the Gospel,\u201d but only to \u201cchurch\nexpenses,\u201d support of widows and orphans; and, on top of this\nconfession, that other strange one revealing the dizzying fact that our\nmissionaries, who went to China to teach Christian morals and justice,\nhad adopted pagan morals and justice in their place. _That cablegram was\ndynamite._\n\nIt seems odd that the Board did not see that that revelation made the\ncase far worse than it was before; for there was a saving doubt,\nbefore--a doubt which was a Gibraltar for strength, and should have been\ncarefully left undisturbed. Why did the Board allow that revelation to\nget into print? Why did the Board not suppress it and keep still? But\nno; in the Board\u2019s opinion, this was once more the time for speech.\nHence Dr. Smith\u2019s latest letter to me, suggesting that I speak also--a\nletter which is a good enough letter, barring its nine defects, but is\nanother evidence that the Board\u2019s head is not as good as its heart.\n\nA missionary is a man who is pretty nearly all heart, else he would not\nbe in a calling which requires of him such large sacrifices of one kind\nand another. He is made up of faith, zeal, courage, sentiment, emotion,\nenthusiasm; and so he is a mixture of poet, devotee, and knight errant.\nHe exiles himself from home and friends and the scenes and associations\nthat are dearest to him; patiently endures discomforts, privations,\ndiscouragements; goes with good pluck into dangers which he knows may\ncost him his life; and when he must suffer death, willingly makes that\nsupreme sacrifice for his cause.\n\nSometimes the headpiece of that kind of a man can be of an inferior\nsort, and error of judgment can result--as we have seen. Then, for his\nprotection, as it seems to me, he ought to have at his back a Board able\nto know a blunder when it sees one, and prompt to bring him back upon\nhis right course when he strays from it. That is to say, I think the\ncaptain of a ship ought to understand navigation. Whether he does or\nnot, he will have to take a captain\u2019s share of the blame, if the crew\nbring the vessel to grief.\n\n-----\n\nFootnote 11:\n\n  Testimony of the manager of the _Sun_.\n\nFootnote 12:\n\n    Cable error. For \u201cthirteen times\u201d read \u201cone third.\u201d This correction\n    was made by Dr. Ament in his brief cablegram published February\n    20th, previously referred to.\n\nFootnote 13:\n\n  For \u201cthirteen times\u201d read \u201cone third.\u201d--M.

Dr.\n  Sheffield), and adds this comment: \u201cDr. Sheffield is not accustomed to\n  speak thus in praise of thieves, or extortioners, or braggarts.\u201d The\n  reference is to the \u201cthirteen-times\u201d extra tax.\n\nFootnote 16:\n\n  The cablegram went on the day (February 18th) that Mr. George Lynch\u2019s\n  account of the looting was published. See \u201cExhibit B.\u201d It seems a pity\n  it did not inquire about the looting and get it denied.\n\n\n\n\n                          THOMAS BRACKETT REED\n\n\nHe wore no shell. His ways were frank and open, and the road to his\nlarge sympathies was straight and unobstructed. His was a nature which\ninvited affection--compelled it, in fact--and met it halfway. Hence he\nwas \u201cTom\u201d to the most of his friends, and to half of the nation. The\nabbreviating of such a man\u2019s name is a patent of nobility, and is\nconferred from the heart. Mr. Reed had a very strong and decided\ncharacter, and he may have had enemies; I do not know; if he had\nthem--outside of politics--they did not know the man. He was\ntransparently honest and honorable, there were no furtivenesses about\nhim, and whoever came to know him trusted him and was not disappointed.\nHe was wise, he was shrewd and alert, he was a clear and capable\nthinker, a logical reasoner, and a strong and convincing speaker. His\nmanner was easy and engaging, his speeches sparkled with felicities of\nphrasing thrown off without apparent effort, and when he needed the\nhappy help of humor he had a mine of it as deep and rich as Kimberly to\ndraw from. His services to his country were great, and they were\ngratefully acknowledged.\n\nI cannot remember back to a time when he was not \u201cTom\u201d Reed to me, nor\nto a time when he would have been offended at being so addressed by me.\nI cannot remember back to a time when I could let him alone in an\nafter-dinner speech if he was present, nor to a time when he did not\ntake my extravagances concerning him and misstatements about him in good\npart, nor yet to a time when he did not pay them back with usury when\nhis turn came. The last speech he made was at my birthday dinner at the\nend of November, when naturally I was his text; my last word to him was\nin a letter the next day; a day later I was illustrating a fantastic\narticle on Art with his portrait among others--a portrait now to be laid\nreverently away among the jests that begin in humor and end in pathos.\nThese things happened only eight days ago, and now he is gone from us,\nand the nation is speaking of him as one who _was_. It seems incredible,\nimpossible. Such a man, such a friend, seems to us a permanent\npossession; his vanishing from our midst is unthinkable; as unthinkable\nas was the vanishing of the Campanile, that had stood for a thousand\nyears, and was turned to dust in a moment.\n\nI have no wish, at this time, to enter upon light and humorous\nreminiscences connected with yachting voyages with Mr. Reed in northern\nand southern seas, nor with other recreations in his company in other\nplaces--they do not belong in this paper, they do not invite me, they\nwould jar upon me. I have only wished to say how fine and beautiful was\nhis life and character, and to take him by the hand and say good-by, as\nto a fortunate friend who has done well his work and goes a pleasant\njourney.\n\n\n\n\n                           THE FINISHED BOOK\n                      (On Finishing _Joan of Arc_)\n\n\n                                                        PARIS, 1895.\n\nDo you know that shock? I mean, when you come, at your regular hour,\ninto the sick room where you have watched for months, and find the\nmedicine bottles all gone, the night table removed, the bed stripped,\nthe furniture set stiffly to rights, the windows up, the room cold,\nstark, vacant--and you catch your breath. Do you know that shock?\n\nThe man who has written a long book has that experience the morning\nafter he has revised it for the last time, seen the bearers convey it\nfrom the house, and sent it away to the printer. He steps into his study\nat the hour established by the habit of months--and he gets that little\nshock. All the litter and the confusion are gone. The piles of dusty\nreference books are gone from the chairs, the maps from the floor; the\nchaos of letters, manuscripts, notebooks, paper knives, pipes, matches,\nphotographs, tobacco jars, and cigar boxes is gone from the writing\ntable. The furniture is back where it use to be in the long ago. The\nhousemaid, forbidden the place for five months, has been there, and\ntidied it up, and scoured it clean, and made it repellent and awful.\n\nI stand here this morning, contemplating this desolation, and I realize\nthat if I would bring back the spirit that made this hospital homelike\nand pleasant to me, I must restore the aids to lingering dissolution to\ntheir wonted places, and nurse another patient through and send it forth\nfor the last rites, with many or few to assist there, as may happen; and\nthat I will do.\n\n\n\n\n                         AS REGARDS PATRIOTISM\n                              (About 1900)\n\n\nIt is agreed, in this country, that if a man can arrange his religion so\nthat it perfectly satisfies his conscience, it is not incumbent upon him\nto care whether the arrangement is satisfactory to anyone else or not.\n\nIn Austria and some other countries this is not the case. There the\nstate arranges a man\u2019s religion for him, he has no voice in it himself.\n\nPatriotism is merely a religion--love of country, worship of country,\ndevotion to the country\u2019s flag and honor and welfare.\n\nIn absolute monarchies it is furnished from the throne, cut and dried,\nto the subject; in England and America it is furnished, cut and dried,\nto the citizen by the politician and the newspaper.\n\nThe newspaper-and-politician-manufactured Patriot often gags in private\nover his dose; but he takes it, and keeps it on his stomach the best he\ncan. Blessed are the meek.\n\nSometimes, in the beginning of an insane shabby political upheaval, he\nis strongly moved to revolt, but he doesn\u2019t do it--he knows better. He\nknows that his maker would find it out--the maker of his Patriotism, the\nwindy and incoherent six-dollar subeditor of his village newspaper--and\nwould bray out in print and call him a Traitor. And how dreadful that\nwould be. It makes him tuck his tail between his legs and shiver. We all\nknow--the reader knows it quite well--that two or three years ago nine\ntenths of the human tails in England and America performed just that\nact. Which is to say, nine tenths of the Patriots in England and America\nturned traitor to keep from being called traitor. Isn\u2019t it true? You\nknow it to be true. Isn\u2019t it curious?\n\nYet it was not a thing to be very seriously ashamed of. A man can\nseldom--very, very seldom--fight a winning fight against his training;\nthe odds are too heavy. For many a year--perhaps always--the training of\nthe two nations had been dead against independence in political thought,\npersistently inhospitable toward patriotism manufactured on a man\u2019s own\npremises, Patriotism reasoned out in the man\u2019s own head and fire-assayed\nand tested and proved in his own conscience. The resulting Patriotism\nwas a shop-worn product procured at second hand. The Patriot did not\nknow just how or when or where he got his opinions, neither did he care,\nso long as he was with what seemed the majority--which was the main\nthing, the safe thing, the comfortable thing. Does the reader believe he\nknows three men who have actual reasons for their pattern of\nPatriotism--and can furnish them? Let him not examine, unless he wants\nto be disappointed. He will be likely to find that his men got their\nPatriotism at the public trough, and had no hand in its preparation\nthemselves.\n\nTraining does wonderful things. It moved the people of this country to\noppose the Mexican War; then moved them to fall in with what they\nsupposed was the opinion of the majority--majority Patriotism is the\ncustomary Patriotism--and go down there and fight. Before the Civil War\nit made the North indifferent to slavery and friendly to the slave\ninterest; in that interest it made Massachusetts hostile to the American\nflag, and she would not allow it to be hoisted on her State House--in\nher eyes it was the flag of a faction. Then by and by, training swung\nMassachusetts the other way, and she went raging South to fight under\nthat very flag and against that aforetime protected interest of hers.\n\nThere is nothing that training cannot do. Nothing is above its reach or\nbelow it. It can turn bad morals to good, good morals to bad; it can\ndestroy principles, it can recreate them; it can debase angels to men\nand lift men to angelship. And it can do any one of these miracles in a\nyear--even in six months.\n\nThen men can be trained to manufacture their own Patriotism. They can be\ntrained to labor it out in their own heads and hearts and in the privacy\nand independence of their own premises. It can train them to stop taking\nit by command, as the Austrian takes his religion.\n\n\n\n\n                    DR. LOEB\u2019S INCREDIBLE DISCOVERY\n\n  Experts in biology will be apt to receive with some skepticism the\n  announcement of Dr. Jacques Loeb of the University of California as to\n  the creation of life by chemical agencies.... Doctor Loeb is a very\n  bright and ingenious experimenter, but _a consensus of opinion among\n  biologists_ would show that he is voted rather as a man of lively\n  imagination than an inerrant investigator of natural phenomena.--New\n  York _Times_, March 2d.\n\n\nI wish I could be as young as that again. Although I seem so old, now, I\nwas once as young as that. I remember, as if it were but thirty or forty\nyears ago, how a paralyzing Consensus of Opinion accumulated from\nExperts a-setting around, about brother experts who had patiently and\nlaboriously cold-chiseled their way into one or another of nature\u2019s\nsafe-deposit vaults and were reporting that they had found something\nvaluable was a plenty for me. It settled it.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t so now--no. Because, in the drift of the years I by and by\nfound out that a Consensus examines a new thing with its feelings rather\noftener than with its mind. You know, yourself, that that is so. Do\nthose people examine with feelings that are friendly to evidence? You\nknow they don\u2019t. It is the other way about. They do the examining by the\nlight of their prejudices--now isn\u2019t that true?\n\nWith curious results, yes. So curious that you wonder the Consensuses do\nnot go out of the business. Do you know of a case where a Consensus won\na game? You can go back as far as you want to and you will find history\nfurnishing you this (until now) unwritten maxim for your guidance and\nprofit: Whatever new thing a Consensus coppers (colloquial for \u201cbets\nagainst\u201d), bet your money on that very card and do not be afraid.\n\nThere was that primitive steam engine--ages back, in Greek times: a\nConsensus made fun of it. There was the Marquis of Worcester\u2019s steam\nengine, 250 years ago: a Consensus made fun of it. There was Fulton\u2019s\nsteamboat of a century ago: a French Consensus, including the Great\nNapoleon, made fun of it. There was Priestly, with his oxygen: a\nConsensus scoffed at him, mobbed him, burned him out, banished him.\nWhile a Consensus was proving, by statistics and things, that a\nsteamship could not cross the Atlantic, a steamship did it. A Consensus\nconsisting of all the medical experts in Great Britain made fun of\nJenner and inoculation. A Consensus consisting of all the medical\nexperts in France made fun of the stethoscope. A Consensus of all the\nmedical experts in Germany made fun of that young doctor (his name?\nforgotten by all but doctors, now, revered now by doctors alone) who\ndiscovered and abolished the cause of that awful disease, puerperal\nfever; made fun of him, reviled him, hunted him, persecuted him, broke\nhis heart, killed him. Electric telegraph, Atlantic cable, telephone,\nall \u201ctoys,\u201d and of no practical value--verdict of the Consensuses.\nGeology, pal\u00e6ontology, evolution--all brushed into space by a Consensus\nof theological experts, comprising all the preachers in Christendom,\nassisted by the Duke of Argyle and (at first) the other scientists. And\ndo look at Pasteur and his majestic honor roll of prodigious\nbenefactions! Damned--each and every one of them in its turn--by\nfrenzied and ferocious Consensuses of medical and chemical Experts\ncomprising, for years, every member of the tribe in Europe; damned\nwithout even a casual _look_ at what he was doing--and he pathetically\nimploring them to come and take at least one little look before making\nthe damnation eternal. They shortened his life by their malignities and\npersecutions; and thus robbed the world of the further and priceless\nservices of a man who--along certain lines and within certain\nlimits--had done more for the human race than any other one man in all\nits long history: a man whom it had taken the Expert brotherhood ten\nthousand years to produce, and whose mate and match the brotherhood may\npossibly not be able to bring forth and assassinate in another ten\nthousand. The preacher has an old and tough reputation for bull-headed\nand unreasoning hostility to new light; why, he is not \u201cin it\u201d with the\ndoctor! Nor, perhaps, with some of the other breeds of Experts that sit\naround and get up the Consensuses and squelch the new things as fast as\nthey come from the hands of the plodders, the searchers, the inspired\ndreamers, the Pasteurs that come bearing pearls to scatter in the\nConsensus sty.\n\nThis is warm work! It puts my temperature up to 106 and raises my pulse\nto the limit. It always works just so when the red rag of a Consensus\njumps my fence and starts across my pasture. I have been a Consensus\nmore than once myself, and I know the business--and its vicissitudes. I\nam a compositor-expert, of old and seasoned experience; nineteen years\nago I delivered the final-and-for-good verdict that the linotype would\nnever be able to earn its own living nor anyone else\u2019s: it takes\nfourteen acres of ground, now, to accommodate its factories in England.\nThirty-five years ago I was an expert precious-metal quartz-miner. There\nwas an outcrop in my neighborhood that assayed $600 a ton--gold. But\nevery fleck of gold in it was shut up tight and fast in an intractable\nand impersuadable base-metal shell. Acting as a Consensus, I delivered\nthe finality verdict that no human ingenuity would ever be able to set\nfree two dollars\u2019 worth of gold out of a ton of that rock. The fact is,\nI did not foresee the cyanide process. Indeed, I have been a Consensus\never so many times since I reached maturity and approached the age of\ndiscretion, but I call to mind no instance in which I won out.\n\nThese sorrows have made me suspicious of Consensuses. Do you know, I\ntremble and the goose flesh rises on my skin every time I encounter one,\nnow. I sheer warily off and get behind something, saying to myself, \u201cIt\nlooks innocent and all right, but no matter, ten to one there\u2019s a\ncyanide process under that thing somewhere.\u201d\n\nNow as concerns this \u201ccreation of life by chemical agencies.\u201d Reader,\ntake my advice: don\u2019t you copper it. I don\u2019t say bet on it; no, I only\nsay, don\u2019t you copper it. As you see, there is a Consensus out against\nit. If you find that you can\u2019t control your passions; if you feel that\nyou have _got_ to copper something and can\u2019t help it, copper the\nConsensus. It is the safest way--all history confirms it. If you are\nyoung, you will, of course, have to put up, on one side or the other,\nfor you will not be able to restrain yourself; but as for me, I am old,\nand I am going to wait for a new deal.\n\n_P.S._--In the same number of the _Times_ Doctor Funk says: \u201cMan may be\nas badly fooled by believing too little as by believing too much; the\nhard-headed skeptic Thomas was the only disciple who was cheated.\u201d Is\nthat the right and rational way to look at it? I will not be sure, for\nmy memory is faulty, but it has always been my impression that Thomas\nwas the only one who made an examination and proved a fact, while the\nothers were accepting, or discounting, the fact on trust--like any other\nConsensus. If that is so, Doubting Thomas removed a doubt which must\notherwise have confused and troubled the world until now. Including\nDoctor Funk. It seems to me that we owe that hard-headed--or\nsound-headed--witness something more than a slur. Why does Doctor Funk\n_examine_ into spiritism, and then throw stones at Thomas. Why doesn\u2019t\nhe take it on trust? Has inconsistency become a jewel in Lafayette\nPlace?\n\n                                      OLD-MAN-AFRAID-OF-THE-CONSENSUS.\n\n_Extract from Adam\u2019s Diary._--Then there was a Consensus about it. It\nwas the very first one. It sat six days and nights. It was then\ndelivered of the verdict that a world could not be made out of nothing;\nthat such small things as sun and moon and stars might, maybe, but it\nwould take years and years, if there was considerable many of them. Then\nthe Consensus got up and looked out of the window, and there was the\nwhole outfit spinning and sparkling in space!

No man can command the results, nor allot\nthem.\n\n_The Dervish_: And so----\n\n_The Offensive Stranger_: And so you shall praise men for their good\nintentions, and not blame them for the evils resulting; you shall\nblame men for their evil intentions, and not praise them for the\ngood resulting.\n\n_The Dervish_: O maniac! will you say----\n\n_The Offensive Stranger_: Listen to the law: From _every_ impulse,\nwhether good or evil, flow two streams; the one carries health, the\nother carries poison. From the beginning of time this law has not\nchanged, to the end of time it will not change.\n\n_The Dervish_: If I should strike thee dead in anger----\n\n_The Offensive Stranger_: Or kill me with a drug which you hoped\nwould give me new life and strength----\n\n_The Dervish_: Very well. Go on.\n\n_The Offensive Stranger_: In either case the results would be the\nsame. Age-long misery of mind for you--an evil result; peace,\nrepose, the end of sorrow for me--a good result. Three hearts that\nhold me dear would break; three pauper cousins of the third removed\nwould get my riches and rejoice; you would go to prison and your\nfriends would grieve, but your humble apprentice-priest would step\ninto your shoes and your fat sleek life and be happy. And are these\nall the goods and all the evils that would flow from the\nwell-intended or ill-intended act that cut short my life, O\nthoughtless one, O purblind creature? The good and evil results that\nflow from _any_ act, even the smallest, breed on and on, century\nafter century, forever and ever and ever, creeping by inches around\nthe globe, affecting all its coming and going populations until the\nend of time, until the final cataclysm!\n\n_The Dervish_: Then, there being no such thing as a good deed----\n\n_The Offensive Stranger_: Don\u2019t I tell you there are good\n_intentions_, and evil ones, and there an end? The _results_ are not\nforeseeable. They are of both kinds, in all cases. It is the law.\nListen: this is far-Western history:\n\n                           VOICES OUT OF UTAH\n\n\n                                 I\n\n_The White Chief_ (_to his people_): This wide plain was a desert.\nBy our Heaven-blest industry we have damned the river and utilized\nits waters and turned the desert into smiling fields whose fruitage\nmakes prosperous and happy a thousand homes where poverty and hunger\ndwelt before. How noble, how beneficent, is Civilization!\n\n                                 II\n\n_Indian Chief_ (_to his people_): This wide plain, which the Spanish\npriests taught our fathers to irrigate, was a smiling field, whose\nfruitage made our homes prosperous and happy. The white American has\ndamned our river, taken away our water for his own valley, and\nturned our field into a desert; wherefore we starve.\n\n_The Dervish_: I perceive that the good intention did really bring\nboth good and evil results in equal measure. But a single case\ncannot prove the rule. Try again.\n\n_The Offensive Stranger_: Pardon me, _all_ cases prove it. Columbus\ndiscovered a new world and gave to the plodding poor and the\nlandless of Europe farms and breathing space and plenty and\nhappiness----\n\n_The Dervish_: A good result.\n\n_The Offensive Stranger_: And they hunted and harried the original\nowners of the soil, and robbed them, beggared them, drove them from\ntheir homes, and exterminated them, root and branch.\n\n_The Dervish_: An evil result, yes.\n\n_The Offensive Stranger_: The French Revolution brought desolation\nto the hearts and homes of five million families and drenched the\ncountry with blood and turned its wealth to poverty.\n\n_The Dervish_: An evil result.\n\n_The Offensive Stranger_: But every great and precious liberty\nenjoyed by the nations of continental Europe to-day are the gift of\nthat Revolution.\n\n_The Dervish_: A good result, I concede it.\n\n_The Offensive Stranger_: In our well-meant effort to lift up the\nFilipino to our own moral altitude with a musket, we have slipped on\nthe ice and fallen down to his.\n\n_The Dervish_: A large evil result.\n\n_The Offensive Stranger_: But as an offset we are a World Power.\n\n_The Dervish_: Give me time. I must think this one over. Pass on.\n\n_The Offensive Stranger_: By help of three hundred thousand soldiers\nand eight hundred million dollars England has succeeded in her good\npurpose of lifting up the unwilling Boers and making them better and\npurer and happier than they could ever have become by their own\ndevices.\n\n_The Dervish_: Certainly that is a good result.\n\n_The Offensive Stranger_: But there are only eleven Boers left now.\n\n_The Dervish_: It has the appearance of an evil result. But I will\nthink it over before I decide.\n\n_The Offensive Stranger_: Take yet one more instance. With the best\nintentions the missionary has been laboring in China for eighty\nyears.\n\n_The Dervish_: The evil result is----\n\n_The Offensive Stranger_: That nearly a hundred thousand Chinamen\nhave acquired our Civilization.\n\n_The Dervish_: And the good result is----\n\n_The Offensive Stranger_: That by the compassion of God four hundred\nmillions have escaped it.\n\n\n\n\n                          INSTRUCTIONS IN ART\n                   (With Illustrations by the Author)\n\n\nThe great trouble about painting a whole gallery of portraits at the\nsame time is, that the housemaid comes and dusts, and does not put\nthem back the way they were before, and so when the public flock to\nthe studio and wish to know which is Howells and which is Depew and\nso on, you have to dissemble, and it is very embarrassing at first.\nStill, you know they are there, and this knowledge presently gives\nyou more or less confidence, and you say sternly, \u201c_This_ is\nHowells,\u201d and watch the visitor\u2019s eye. If you see doubt there, you\ncorrect yourself and try another. In time you find one that will\nsatisfy, and then you feel relief and joy, but you have suffered\nmuch in the meantime; and you know that this joy is only temporary,\nfor the next inquirer will settle on another Howells of a quite\ndifferent aspect, and one which you suspect is Edward VII or\nCromwell, though you keep that to yourself, of course. It is much\nbetter to label a portrait when you first paint it, then there is no\nuncertainty in your mind and you can get bets out of the visitor and\nwin them.\n\nI believe I have had the most trouble with a portrait which I\npainted in installments--the head on one canvas and the bust on\nanother.\n\n[Illustration: THE HEAD ON ONE CANVAS]\n\nThe housemaid stood the bust up sideways, and now I don\u2019t know which\nway it goes. Some authorities think it belongs with the breastpin at\nthe top, under the man\u2019s chin; others think it belongs the reverse\nway, on account of the collar, one of these saying, \u201cA person can\nwear a breastpin on his stomach if he wants to, but he can\u2019t wear\nhis collar anywhere he dern pleases.\u201d There is a certain amount of\nsense in that view of it. Still, there is no way to determine the\nmatter for certain; when you join the installments, with the pin\nunder the chin, that seems to be right; then when you reverse it and\nbring the collar under the chin it seems as right as ever; whichever\nway you fix it the lines come together snug and convincing, and\neither way you do it the portrait\u2019s face looks equally surprised and\nrejoiced, and as if it wouldn\u2019t be satisfied to have it any way but\njust that one; in fact, even if you take the bust away altogether\nthe face seems surprised and happy just the same--I have never seen\nan expression before, which no vicissitudes could alter. I wish I\ncould remember who it is. It looks a little like Washington, but I\ndo not think it can be Washington, because he had as many ears on\none side as the other. You can always tell Washington by that; he\nwas very particular about his ears, and about having them arranged\nthe same old way all the time.\n\n[Illustration: AND THE BUST ON ANOTHER]\n\nBy and by I shall get out of these confusions, and then it will be\nplain sailing; but first-off the confusions were natural and not to\nbe avoided. My reputation came very suddenly and tumultuously when I\npublished my own portrait, and it turned my head a little, for\nindeed there was never anything like it. In a single day I got\norders from sixty-two people not to paint their portraits, some of\nthem the most distinguished persons in the country--the President,\nthe Cabinet, authors, governors, admirals, candidates for office on\nthe weak side--almost everybody that was anybody, and it would\nreally have turned the head of nearly any beginner to get so much\nnotice and have it come with such a frenzy of cordiality. But I am\ngrowing calm and settling down to business, now; and pretty soon I\nshall cease to be flurried, and then when I do a portrait I shall be\nquite at myself and able on the instant to tell it from the others\nand pick it out when wanted.\n\nI am living a new and exalted life of late. It steeps me in a sacred\nrapture to see a portrait develop and take soul under my hand.\nFirst, I throw off a study--just a mere study, a few apparently\nrandom lines--and to look at it you would hardly ever suspect who it\nwas going to be; even I cannot tell, myself. Take this picture, for\ninstance:\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  FIRST YOU THINK IT\u2019S DANTE; NEXT YOU THINK IT\u2019S EMERSON; THEN YOU\n    THINK IT\u2019S WAYNE MAC VEAGH. YET IT ISN\u2019T ANY OF THEM; IT\u2019S THE\n    BEGINNINGS OF DEPEW\n]\n\nFirst you think it\u2019s Dante; next you think it\u2019s Emerson; then you\nthink it\u2019s Wayne Mac Veagh. Yet it isn\u2019t any of them; it\u2019s the\nbeginnings of Depew. Now you wouldn\u2019t believe Depew could be\ndevolved out of that; yet the minute it is finished here you have\nhim to the life, and you say, yourself, \u201cIf that isn\u2019t Depew it\nisn\u2019t anybody.\u201d\n\nSome would have painted him speaking, but he isn\u2019t always speaking,\nhe has to stop and think sometimes.\n\nThat is a _genre_ picture, as we say in the trade, and differs from\nthe encaustic and other schools in various ways, mainly technical,\nwhich you wouldn\u2019t understand if I should explain them to you. But\nyou will get the idea as I go along, and little by little you will\nlearn all that is valuable about Art without knowing how it\nhappened, and without any sense of strain or effort, and then you\nwill know what school a picture belongs to, just at a glance, and\nwhether it is an animal picture or a landscape. It is then that the\njoy of life will begin for you.\n\nWhen you come to examine my portraits of Mr. Joe Jefferson and the\nrest, your eye will have become measurably educated by that time,\nand you will recognize at once that no two of them are alike. I will\nclose the present chapter with an example of the nude, for your\ninstruction.\n\nThis creation is different from any of the other works. The others\nare from real life, but this is an example of still-life; so called\nbecause it is a portrayal of a fancy only, a thing which has no\nactual and active existence. The purpose of a still-life picture is\nto concrete to the eye the spiritual, the intangible, a something\nwhich we feel, but cannot see with the fleshy vision--such as joy,\nsorrow, resentment, and so on. This is best achieved by the\nemployment of that treatment which we call the impressionist, in the\ntrade. The present example is an impressionist picture, done in\ndistemper, with a chiaroscuro motif modified by monochromatic\ntechnique, so as to secure tenderness of feeling and spirituality of\nexpression. At a first glance it would seem to be a Botticelli, but\nit is not that; it is only a humble imitation of that great master\nof longness and slimness and limbfulness.\n\n[Illustration: THAT THING IN THE RIGHT HAND IS NOT A SKILLET; IT IS\nA TAMBOURINE]\n\nThe work is imagined from Greek story, and represents Proserpine or\nPersepolis, or one of those other Bacchantes doing the solemnities\nof welcome before the altar of Isis upon the arrival of the annual\nshipload of Athenian youths in the island of Minos to be sacrificed\nin appeasement of the Dordonian Cyclops.\n\n[Illustration: THE PORTRAIT REPRODUCES MR. JOSEPH JEFFERSON, THE\nCOMMON FRIEND OF THE HUMAN RACE]\n\nThe figure symbolizes solemn joy. It is severely Greek, therefore\ndoes not call details of drapery or other factitious helps to its\naid, but depends wholly upon grace of action and symmetry of contour\nfor its effects. It is intended to be viewed from the south or\nsoutheast, and I think that that is best; for while it expresses\nmore and larger joy when viewed from the east or the north, the\nfeatures of the face are too much foreshortened and wormy when\nviewed from that point. That thing in the right hand is not a\nskillet; it is a tambourine.\n\n[Illustration: EITHER MR. HOWELLS OR MR. LAFFAN. I CANNOT TELL WHICH\nBECAUSE THE LABEL IS LOST]\n\nThis creation will be exhibited at the Paris Salon in June, and will\ncompete for the _Prix de Rome_.\n\nThe above is a marine picture, and is intended to educate the eye in\nthe important matters of perspective and foreshortening. The\nmountainous and bounding waves in the foreground, contrasted with\nthe tranquil ship fading away as in a dream the other side of the\nfishing-pole, convey to us the idea of space and distance as no\nwords could do. Such is the miracle wrought by that wondrous device,\nperspective.\n\nThe portrait reproduces Mr. Joseph Jefferson, the common friend of\nthe human race. He is fishing, and is not catching anything. This is\nfinely expressed by the moisture in the eye and the anguish of the\nmouth. The mouth is holding back words. The pole is bamboo, the line\nis foreshortened. This foreshortening, together with the smoothness\nof the water away out there where the cork is, gives a powerful\nimpression of distance, and is another way of achieving a\nperspective effect.\n\nWe now come to the next portrait, which is either Mr. Howells or Mr.\nLaffan. I cannot tell which, because the label is lost. But it will\ndo for both, because the features are Mr. Howells\u2019s, while the\nexpression is Mr. Laffan\u2019s. This work will bear critical\nexamination.\n\nThe next picture is part of an animal, but I do not know the name of\nit. It is not finished. The front end of it went around a corner\nbefore I could get to it.\n\n[Illustration: THE FRONT END OF IT WENT AROUND A CORNER BEFORE I\nCOULD GET TO IT]\n\n[Illustration: THE BEST AND MOST WINNING AND ELOQUENT PORTRAIT MY\nBRUSH HAS EVER PRODUCED]\n\nWe will conclude with the portrait of a lady in the style of\nRaphael. Originally I started it out for Queen Elizabeth, but was\nnot able to do the lace hopper her head projects out of, therefore I\ntried to turn it into Pocahontas, but was again baffled, and was\ncompelled to make further modifications, this time achieving\nsuccess. By spiritualizing it and turning it into the noble mother\nof our race and throwing into the countenance the sacred joy which\nher first tailor-made outfit infuses into her spirit, I was enabled\nto add to my gallery the best and most winning and eloquent portrait\nmy brush has ever produced.\n\nThe most effective encouragement a beginner can have is the\nencouragement which he gets from noting his own progress with an\nalert and persistent eye. Save up your works and date them; as the\nyears go by, run your eye over them from time to time, and measure\nyour advancing stride. This will thrill you, this will nerve you,\nthis will inspire you as nothing else can.\n\nIt has been my own course, and to it I owe the most that I am to-day\nin Art. When I look back and examine my first effort and then\ncompare it with my latest, it seems unbelievable that I have climbed\nso high in thirty-one years. Yet so it is. Practice--that is the\nsecret. From three to seven hours a day. It is all that is required.\nThe results are sure; whereas indolence achieves nothing great.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  IT SEEMS UNBELIEVABLE THAT I HAVE CLIMBED SO HIGH IN THIRTY-ONE\n    YEARS\n]\n\n\n\n\n                             SOLD TO SATAN\n                                 (1904)\n\n\nIt was at this time that I concluded to sell my soul to Satan. Steel\nwas away down, so was St. Paul; it was the same with all the\ndesirable stocks, in fact, and so, if I did not turn out to be away\ndown myself, now was my time to raise a stake and make my fortune.\nWithout further consideration I sent word to the local agent, Mr.\nBlank, with description and present condition of the property, and\nan interview with Satan was promptly arranged, on a basis of 2\u00bd per\ncent, this commission payable only in case a trade should be\nconsummated.\n\nI sat in the dark, waiting and thinking. How still it was! Then came\nthe deep voice of a far-off bell proclaiming midnight--Boom-m-m!\nBoom-m-m! Boom-m-m!--and I rose to receive my guest, and braced\nmyself for the thunder crash and the brimstone stench which should\nannounce his arrival. But there was no crash, no stench. Through the\nclosed door, and noiseless, came the modern Satan, just as we see\nhim on the stage--tall, slender, graceful, in tights and trunks, a\nshort cape mantling his shoulders, a rapier at his side, a single\ndrooping feather in his jaunty cap, and on his intellectual face the\nwell-known and high-bred Mephistophelian smile.\n\nBut he was not a fire coal; he was not red, no! On the contrary. He\nwas a softly glowing, richly smoldering torch, column, statue of\npallid light, faintly tinted with a spiritual green, and out from\nhim a lunar splendor flowed such as one sees glinting from the\ncrinkled waves of tropic seas when the moon rides high in cloudless\nskies.\n\nHe made his customary stage obeisance, resting his left hand upon\nhis sword hilt and removing his cap with his right and making that\nhandsome sweep with it which we know so well; then we sat down. Ah,\nhe was an incandescent glory, a nebular dream, and so much improved\nby his change of color. He must have seen the admiration in my\nilluminated face, but he took no notice of it, being long ago used\nto it in faces of other Christians with whom he had had trade\nrelations.\n\n... A half hour of hot toddy and weather chat, mixed with occasional\ntentative feelers on my part and rejoinders of, \u201cWell, I could\nhardly pay _that_ for it, you know,\u201d on his, had much modified my\nshyness and put me so much at my ease that I was emboldened to feed\nmy curiosity a little. So I chanced the remark that he was\nsurprisingly different from the traditions, and I wished I knew what\nit was he was made of. He was not offended, but answered with frank\nsimplicity:\n\n\u201cRadium!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat accounts for it!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cIt is the loveliest\neffulgence I have ever seen. The hard and heartless glare of the\nelectric doesn\u2019t compare with it. I suppose Your Majesty weighs\nabout--about----\u201d\n\n\u201cI stand six feet one; fleshed and blooded I would weigh two hundred\nand fifteen; but radium, like other metals, is heavy. I weigh nine\nhundred-odd.\u201d\n\nI gazed hungrily upon him, saying to myself:\n\n\u201cWhat riches! what a mine! Nine hundred pounds at, say, $3,500,000 a\npound, would be--would be----\u201d Then a treacherous thought burst into\nmy mind!\n\nHe laughed a good hearty laugh, and said:\n\n\u201cI perceive your thought; and what a handsomely original idea it\nis!--to kidnap Satan, and stock him, and incorporate him, and water\nthe stock up to ten billions--just three times its actual value--and\nblanket the world with it!\u201d My blush had turned the moonlight to a\ncrimson mist, such as veils and spectralizes the domes and towers of\nFlorence at sunset and makes the spectator drunk with joy to see,\nand he pitied me, and dropped his tone of irony, and assumed a grave\nand reflective one which had a pleasanter sound for me, and under\nits kindly influence my pains were presently healed, and I thanked\nhim for his courtesy. Then he said:\n\n\u201cOne good turn deserves another, and I will pay you a compliment. Do\nyou know I have been trading with your poor pathetic race for ages,\nand you are the first person who has ever been intelligent enough to\ndivine the large commercial value of my make-up.\u201d\n\nI purred to myself and looked as modest as I could.\n\n\u201cYes, you are the first,\u201d he continued. \u201cAll through the Middle Ages\nI used to buy Christian souls at fancy rates, building bridges and\ncathedrals in a single night in return, and getting swindled out of\nmy Christian nearly every time that I dealt with a priest--as\nhistory will concede--but making it up on the lay square-dealer now\nand then, as _I_ admit; but none of those people ever guessed where\nthe _real_ big money lay. You are the first.\u201d\n\nI refilled his glass and gave him another Cavour. But he was\nexperienced, by this time. He inspected the cigar pensively awhile;\nthen:\n\n\u201cWhat do you pay for these?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cTwo cents--but they come cheaper when you take a barrel.\u201d\n\nHe went on inspecting; also mumbling comments, apparently to\nhimself:\n\n\u201cBlack--rough-skinned--rumpled, irregular, wrinkled, barky, with\ncrispy curled-up places on it--burnt-leather aspect, like the shoes\nof the damned that sit in pairs before the room doors at home of a\nSunday morning.\u201d He sighed at thought of his home, and was silent a\nmoment; then he said, gently, \u201cTell me about this projectile.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the discovery of a great Italian statesman,\u201d I said. \u201cCavour.\nOne day he lit his cigar, then laid it down and went on writing and\nforgot it. It lay in a pool of ink and got soaked. By and by he\nnoticed it and laid it on the stove to dry. When it was dry he lit\nit and at once noticed that it didn\u2019t taste the same as it did\nbefore. And so----\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he say what it tasted like before?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I think not. But he called the government chemist and told him\nto find out the source of that new taste, and report. The chemist\napplied the tests, and reported that the source was the presence of\nsulphate of iron, touched up and spiritualized with vinegar--the\ncombination out of which one makes ink. Cavour told him to introduce\nthe brand in the interest of the finances. So, ever since then this\nbrand passes through the ink factory, with the great result that\nboth the ink and the cigar suffer a sea change into something new\nand strange. This is history, Sire, not a work of the imagination.\u201d\n\nSo then he took up his present again, and touched it to the\nforefinger of his other hand for an instant, which made it break\ninto flame and fragrance--but he changed his mind at that point and\nlaid the torpedo down, saying, courteously:\n\n\u201cWith permission I will save it for Voltaire.\u201d\n\nI was greatly pleased and flattered to be connected in even this\nlittle way with that great man and be mentioned to him, as no doubt\nwould be the case, so I hastened to fetch a bundle of fifty for\ndistribution among others of the renowned and lamented--Goethe, and\nHomer, and Socrates, and Confucius, and so on--but Satan said he had\nnothing against those. Then he dropped back into reminiscences of\nthe old times once more, and presently said:\n\n\u201cThey knew nothing about radium, and it would have had no value for\nthem if they had known about it. In twenty million years it has had\nno value for your race until the revolutionizing steam-and-machinery\nage was born--which was only a few years before you were born\nyourself. It was a stunning little century, for sure, that\nnineteenth! But it\u2019s a poor thing compared to what the twentieth is\ngoing to be.\u201d\n\nBy request, he explained why he thought so.\n\n\u201cBecause power was so costly, then, and everything goes by\npower--the steamship, the locomotive, and everything else. Coal, you\nsee! You have to have it; no steam and no electricity without it;\nand it\u2019s such a waste--for you burn it up, and it\u2019s gone! But\nradium--that\u2019s another matter! With my nine hundred pounds you could\nlight the world, and heat it, and run all its ships and machines and\nrailways a hundred million years, and not use up five pounds of it\nin the whole time! And then----\u201d\n\n\u201cQuick--my soul is yours, dear Ancestor; take it--we\u2019ll start a\ncompany!\u201d\n\nBut he asked my age, which is sixty-eight, then politely sidetracked\nthe proposition, probably not wishing to take advantage of himself.\nThen he went on talking admiringly of radium, and how with its own\nnatural and inherent heat it could go on melting its own weight of\nice twenty-four times in twenty-four hours, and keep it up forever\nwithout losing bulk or weight; and how a pound of it, if exposed in\nthis room, would blast the place like a breath from hell, and burn\nme to a crisp in a quarter of a minute--and was going on like that,\nbut I interrupted and said:\n\n\u201cBut _you_ are here, Majesty--nine hundred pounds--and the\ntemperature is balmy and pleasant. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, hesitatingly, \u201cit is a secret, but I may as well\nreveal it, for these prying and impertinent chemists are going to\nfind it out sometime or other, anyway. Perhaps you have read what\nMadame Curie says about radium; how she goes searching among its\nsplendid secrets and seizes upon one after another of them and\nitalicizes its specialty; how she says \u2018the compounds of radium are\n_spontaneously luminous_\u2019--require no coal in the production of\nlight, you see; how she says, \u2018a glass vessel containing radium\n_spontaneously charges itself with electricity_\u2019--no coal or water\npower required to generate it, you see; how she says \u2018radium\npossesses the remarkable property of _liberating heat spontaneously\nand continuously_\u2019--no coal required to fire-up on the world\u2019s\nmachinery, you see. She ransacks the pitch-blende for its\nradioactive substances, and captures three and labels them; one,\nwhich is embodied with bismuth, she names polonium; one, which is\nembodied with barium, she names radium; the name given to the third\nwas actinium. Now listen; she says \u2018_the question now was to\nseparate the polonium from the bismuth_ ... this is the task that\nhas occupied us for years and has been a most difficult one.\u2019 For\nyears, you see--for _years_. That is their way, those plagues, those\nscientists--peg, peg, peg--dig, dig, dig--plod, plod, plod. I wish I\ncould catch a cargo of them for my place; it would be an economy.\nYes, for years, you see. They never give up. Patience, hope, faith,\nperseverance; it is the way of all the breed. Columbus and the rest.\nIn radium this lady has added a new world to the planet\u2019s\npossessions, and matched--Columbus--and his peer. She has set\nherself the task of divorcing polonium and bismuth; when she\nsucceeds she will have done--what, should you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cPray name it, Majesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another new world added--a gigantic one. I will explain; for\nyou would never divine the size of it, and she herself does not\nsuspect it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo, Majesty, I beg of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolonium, freed from bismuth and made independent, is the one and\nonly power that can control radium, restrain its destructive forces,\ntame them, reduce them to obedience, and make them do useful and\nprofitable work for your race. Examine my skin. What do you think of\nit?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is delicate, silky, transparent, thin as a gelatine\nfilm--exquisite, beautiful, Majesty!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is made of polonium. All the rest of me is radium. If I should\nstrip off my skin the world would vanish away in a flash of flame\nand a puff of smoke, and the remnants of the extinguished moon would\nsift down through space a mere snow-shower of gray ashes!\u201d\n\nI made no comment, I only trembled.\n\n\u201cYou understand, now,\u201d he continued. \u201cI burn, I suffer within, my\npains are measureless and eternal, but my skin protects you and the\nglobe from harm. Heat is power, energy, but is only useful to man\nwhen he can control it and graduate its application to his needs.\nYou cannot do that with radium, now; it will not be prodigiously\nuseful to you until polonium shall put the slave whip in your hand.\nI can release from my body the radium force in any measure I please,\ngreat or small; at my will I can set in motion the works of a lady\u2019s\nwatch or destroy a world. You saw me light that unholy cigar with my\nfinger?\u201d\n\nI remembered it.\n\n\u201cTry to imagine how minute was the fraction of energy released to do\nthat small thing! You are aware that everything is made up of\nrestless and revolving molecules?--everything--furniture, rocks,\nwater, iron, horses, men--everything that exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cMolecules of scores of different sizes and weights, but none of\nthem big enough to be seen by help of any microscope?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that each molecule is made up of thousands of separate and\nnever-resting little particles called atoms?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that up to recent times the smallest atom known to science was\nthe hydrogen atom, which was a thousand times smaller than the atom\nthat went to the building of any other molecule?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the radium atom from the positive pole is 5,000 times smaller\nthan _that_ atom! This unspeakably minute atom is called an\n_electron_. Now then, out of my long affection for you and for your\nlineage, I will reveal to you a secret--a secret known to no\nscientist as yet--the secret of the firefly\u2019s light and the\nglowworm\u2019s; it is produced by a single electron imprisoned in a\npolonium atom.\u201d\n\n\u201cSire, it is a wonderful thing, and the scientific world would be\ngrateful to know this secret, which has baffled and defeated all its\nsearchings for more than two centuries. To think!--a single\nelectron, 5,000 times smaller than the invisible hydrogen atom, to\nproduce that explosion of vivid light which makes the summer night\nso beautiful!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd consider,\u201d said Satan; \u201cit is the only instance in all nature\nwhere radium exists in a pure state unencumbered by fettering\nalliances; where polonium enjoys the like emancipation; and where\nthe pair are enabled to labor together in a gracious and beneficent\nand effective partnership. Suppose the protecting polonium envelope\nwere removed; the radium spark would flash but once and the firefly\nwould be consumed to vapor! Do you value this old iron letterpress?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Majesty, for it is not mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I will destroy it and let you see. I lit the ostensible cigar\nwith the heat energy of a single electron, the equipment of a single\nlightning bug. I will turn on twenty thousand electrons now.\u201d\n\nHe touched the massive thing and it exploded with a cannon crash,\nleaving nothing but vacancy where it had stood. For three minutes\nthe air was a dense pink fog of sparks, through which Satan loomed\ndim and vague, then the place cleared and his soft rich moonlight\npervaded it again. He said:\n\n\u201cYou see? The radium in 20,000 lightning bugs would run a\nracing-mobile forever. There\u2019s no waste, no diminution of it.\u201d Then\nhe remarked in a quite casual way, \u201cWe use nothing but radium at\nhome.\u201d\n\nI was astonished. And interested, too, for I have friends there, and\nrelatives. I had always believed--in accordance with my early\nteachings--that the fuel was soft coal and brimstone. He noticed the\nthought, and answered it.\n\n\u201cSoft coal and brimstone is the tradition, yes, but it is an error.\nWe could use it; at least we could make out with it after a fashion,\nbut it has several defects: it is not cleanly, it ordinarily makes\nbut a temperate fire, and it would be exceedingly difficult, if even\npossible, to heat it up to standard, Sundays; and as for the supply,\nall the worlds and systems could not furnish enough to keep us going\nhalfway through eternity. Without radium there could be no hell;\ncertainly not a satisfactory one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause if we hadn\u2019t radium we should have to dress the souls in\nsome other material; then, of course, they would burn up and get out\nof trouble. They would not last an hour. You know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy--yes, now that you mention it. But I supposed they were dressed\nin their natural flesh; they look so in the pictures--in the Sistine\nChapel and in the illustrated books, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, our damned look as they looked in the world, but it isn\u2019t\nflesh; flesh could not survive any longer than that copying press\nsurvived--it would explode and turn to a fog of sparks, and the\nresult desired in sending it there would be defeated. Believe me,\nradium is the only wear.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see it now,\u201d I said, with prophetic discomfort, \u201cI know that you\nare right, Majesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am. I speak from experience. You shall see, when you get there.\u201d\n\nHe said this as if he thought I was eaten up with curiosity, but it\nwas because he did not know me. He sat reflecting a minute, then he\nsaid:\n\n\u201cI will make your fortune.\u201d\n\nIt cheered me up and I felt better. I thanked him and was all\neagerness and attention.\n\n\u201cDo you know,\u201d he continued, \u201cwhere they find the bones of the\nextinct moa, in New Zealand? All in a pile--thousands and thousands\nof them banked together in a mass twenty feet deep. And do you know\nwhere they find the tusks of the extinct mastodon of the\nPleistocene? Banked together in acres off the mouth of the Lena--an\nivory mine which has furnished freight for Chinese caravans for five\nhundred years. Do you know the phosphate beds of our South? They are\nmiles in extent, a limitless mass and jumble of bones of vast\nanimals whose like exists no longer in the earth--a cemetery, a\nmighty cemetery, that is what it is. All over the earth there are\nsuch cemeteries. Whence came the instinct that made those families\nof creatures go to a chosen and particular spot to die when sickness\ncame upon them and they perceived that their end was near? It is a\nmystery; not even science has been able to uncover the secret of it.\nBut there stands the fact. Listen, then. For a million years there\nhas been a firefly cemetery.\u201d\n\nHopefully, appealingly, I opened my mouth--he motioned me to close\nit, and went on:\n\n\u201cIt is in a scooped-out bowl half as big as this room on the top of\na snow summit of the Cordilleras. That bowl is level full--of what?\nPure firefly radium and the glow and heat of hell? For countless\nages myriads of fireflies have daily flown thither and died in that\nbowl and been burned to vapor in an instant, each fly leaving as its\ncontribution its only indestructible particle, its single electron\nof pure radium. There is energy enough there to light the whole\nworld, heat the whole world\u2019s machinery, supply the whole world\u2019s\ntransportation power from now till the end of eternity. The massed\nriches of the planet could not furnish its value in money. You are\nmine, it is yours; when Madame Curie isolates polonium, clothe\nyourself in a skin of it and go and take possession!\u201d\n\nThen he vanished and left me in the dark when I was just in the act\nof thanking him. I can find the bowl by the light it will cast upon\nthe sky; I can get the polonium presently, when that illustrious\nlady in France isolates it from the bismuth. Stock is for sale.\nApply to Mark Twain.\n\n\n\n\n                            THAT DAY IN EDEN\n                      (Passage from Satan\u2019s Diary)\n\n\nLong ago I was in the bushes near the Tree of Knowledge when the Man\nand the Woman came there and had a conversation. I was present, now,\nwhen they came again after all these years. They were as\nbefore--mere boy and girl--trim, rounded, slender, flexible, snow\nimages lightly flushed with the pink of the skies, innocently\nunconscious of their nakedness, lovely to look upon, beautiful\nbeyond words.\n\nI listened again. Again as in that former time they puzzled over\nthose words, Good, Evil, Death, and tried to reason out their\nmeaning; but, of course, they were not able to do it. Adam said:\n\n\u201cCome, maybe we can find Satan. He might know these things.\u201d\n\nThen I came forth, still gazing upon Eve and admiring, and said to\nher:\n\n\u201cYou have not seen me before, sweet creature, but I have seen you. I\nhave seen all the animals, but in beauty none of them equals you.\nYour hair, your eyes, your face, your flesh tints, your form, the\ntapering grace of your white limbs--all are beautiful, adorable,\nperfect.\u201d\n\nIt gave her pleasure, and she looked herself over, putting out a\nfoot and a hand and admiring them; then she na\u00efvely said:\n\n\u201cIt is a joy to be so beautiful. And Adam--he is the same.\u201d\n\nShe turned him about, this way and that, to show him off, with such\nguileless pride in her blue eyes, and he--he took it all as just\nmatter of course, and was innocently happy in it, and said, \u201cWhen I\nhave flowers on my head it is better still.\u201d\n\nEve said, \u201cIt is true--you shall see,\u201d and she flitted hither and\nthither like a butterfly and plucked flowers, and in a moment laced\ntheir stems together in a glowing wreath and set it upon his head;\nthen tiptoed and gave it a pat here and there with her nimble\nfingers, with each pat enhancing its grace and shape, none knows\nhow, nor why it should so result, but in it there is a law\nsomewhere, though the delicate art and mystery of it is her secret\nalone, and not learnable by another; and when at last it was to her\nmind she clapped her hands for pleasure, then reached up and kissed\nhim--as pretty a sight, taken altogether, as in my experience I have\nseen.\n\nPresently, to the matter in hand. The meaning of those words--would\nI tell her?\n\nCertainly none could be more willing, but how was I to do it? I\ncould think of no way to make her understand, and I said so. I said:\n\n\u201cI will try, but it is hardly of use. For instance--what is pain?\u201d\n\n\u201cPain? I do not know.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly. How should you? Pain is not of your world; pain is\nimpossible to you; you have never experienced a physical pain.\nReduce that to a formula, a principle, and what have we?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have we?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis: Things which are outside of our orbit--our own particular\nworld--things which by our constitution and equipment we are unable\nto see, or feel, or otherwise experience--_cannot be made\ncomprehensible to us in words_. There you have the whole thing in a\nnutshell. It is a principle, it is axiomatic, it is a law. Now do\nyou understand?\u201d\n\nThe gentle creature looked dazed, and for all result she was\ndelivered of this vacant remark:\n\n\u201cWhat is axiomatic?\u201d\n\nShe had missed the point. Necessarily she would. Yet her effort was\nsuccess for me, for it was a vivid confirmation of the truth of what\nI had been saying. Axiomatic was for the present a thing outside of\nthe world of her experience, therefore it had no meaning for her. I\nignored her question and continued:\n\n\u201cWhat is fear?\u201d\n\n\u201cFear? I do not know.\u201d\n\n\u201cNaturally. Why should you? You have not felt it, you cannot feel\nit, it does not belong in your world. With a hundred thousand words\nI should not be able to make you understand what fear is. How then\nam I to explain death to you? You have never seen it, it is foreign\nto your world, it is impossible to make the word mean anything to\nyou, so far as I can see. In a way, it is a sleep----\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I know what that is!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it is a sleep only in a way, as I said. It is more than a\nsleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cSleep is pleasant, sleep is lovely!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut death is a long sleep--very long.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, all the lovelier! Therefore I think nothing could be better\nthan death.\u201d\n\nI said to myself, \u201cPoor child, some day you may know what a pathetic\ntruth you have spoken; some day you may say, out of a broken heart,\n\u2018Come to me, O Death the compassionate! steep me in the merciful\noblivion, O refuge of the sorrowful, friend of the forsaken and the\ndesolate!\u2019\u201d Then I said aloud, \u201cBut this sleep is eternal.\u201d\n\nThe word went over her head. Necessarily it would.\n\n\u201cEternal. What is eternal?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, that also is outside of your world, as yet. There is no way to\nmake you understand it.\u201d\n\nIt was a hopeless case. Words referring to things outside of her\nexperience were a foreign language to her, and meaningless. She was\nlike a little baby whose mother says to it, \u201cDon\u2019t put your finger\nin the candle flame; it will burn you.\u201d Burn--it is a foreign word\nto the baby, and will have no terrors for it until experience shall\nhave revealed its meaning. It is not worth while for mamma to make\nthe remark, the baby will goo-goo cheerfully, and put its finger in\nthe pretty flame--once. After these private reflections I said again\nthat I did not think there was any way to make her understand the\nmeaning of the word eternal. She was silent awhile, turning these\ndeep matters over in the unworn machinery of her mind; then she gave\nup the puzzle and shifted her ground, saying:\n\n\u201cWell, there are those other words. What is good, and what is evil?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is another difficulty. They, again, are outside of your world;\nthey have place in the moral kingdom only. You have no morals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are morals?\u201d\n\n\u201cA system of law which distinguishes between right and wrong, good\nmorals and bad. These things do not exist for you. I cannot make it\nclear; you would not understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut try.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, obedience to constituted authority is a moral law. Suppose\nAdam should forbid you to put your child in the river and leave it\nthere overnight--would you put the child there?\u201d\n\nShe answered with a darling simplicity and guilelessness:\n\n\u201cWhy, yes, if I wanted to.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, it is just as I said--you would not know any better; you\nhave no idea of duty, command, obedience; they have no meaning for\nyou. In your present estate you are in no possible way responsible\nfor anything you do or say or think. It is impossible for you to do\nwrong, for you have no more notion of right and wrong than the other\nanimals have. You and they can do only right; whatever you and they\ndo is right and innocent. It is a divine estate, the loftiest and\npurest attainable in heaven and in earth. It is the angel gift. The\nangels are wholly pure and sinless, for they do not know right from\nwrong, and all the acts of such are blameless. No one can do wrong\nwithout knowing how to distinguish between right and wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it an advantage to know?\u201d\n\n\u201cMost certainly not! That knowledge would remove all that is divine,\nall that is angelic, from the angels, and immeasurably degrade\nthem.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there any persons that know right from wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in--well, not in heaven.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat gives that knowledge?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Moral Sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell--no matter. Be thankful that you lack it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it is a degradation, a disaster. Without it one cannot do\nwrong; with it, one can. Therefore it has but one office, only\none--to teach how to do wrong. It can teach no other thing--no other\nthing whatever. It is the _creator_ of wrong; wrong cannot exist\nuntil the Moral Sense brings it into being.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can one acquire the Moral Sense?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy eating of the fruit of the Tree, here. But why do you wish to\nknow? Would you like to have the Moral Sense?\u201d\n\nShe turned wistfully to Adam:\n\n\u201cWould you like to have it?\u201d\n\nHe showed no particular interest, and only said:\n\n\u201cI am indifferent. I have not understood any of this talk, but if\nyou like we will eat it, for I cannot see that there is any\nobjection to it.\u201d\n\nPoor ignorant things, the command of refrain had meant nothing to\nthem, they were but children, and could not understand untried\nthings and verbal abstractions which stood for matters outside of\ntheir little world and their narrow experience. Eve reached for an\napple!--oh, farewell, Eden and your sinless joys, come poverty and\npain, hunger and cold and heartbreak, bereavement, tears and shame,\nenvy, strife, malice and dishonor, age, weariness, remorse; then\ndesperation and the prayer for the release of death, indifferent\nthat the gates of hell yawn beyond it!\n\nShe tasted--the fruit fell from her hand.\n\nIt was pitiful. She was like one who wakens slow and confusedly out\nof a sleep. She gazed half vacantly at me, then at Adam, holding her\ncurtaining fleece of golden hair back with her hand; then her\nwandering glance fell upon her naked person. The red blood mounted\nto her cheek, and she sprang behind a bush and stood there crying,\nand saying:\n\n\u201cOh, my modesty is lost to me--my unoffending form is become a shame\nto me!\u201d She moaned and muttered in her pain, and dropped her head,\nsaying, \u201cI am degraded--I have fallen, oh, so low, and I shall never\nrise again.\u201d\n\nAdam\u2019s eyes were fixed upon her in a dreamy amazement, for he could\nnot understand what had happened, it being outside his world as yet,\nand her words having no meaning for one void of the Moral Sense. And\nnow his wonder grew: for, unknown to Eve, her hundred years rose\nupon her, and faded the heaven of her eyes and the tints of her\nyoung flesh, and touched her hair with gray, and traced faint sprays\nof wrinkles about her mouth and eyes, and shrunk her form, and\ndulled the satin luster of her skin.\n\nAll this the fair boy saw: then loyally and bravely he took the\napple and tasted it, saying nothing.\n\nThe change came upon him also. Then he gathered boughs for both and\nclothed their nakedness, and they turned and went their way, hand in\nhand and bent with age, and so passed from sight.\n\n\n\n\n                               EVE SPEAKS\n\n\n                                 I\n\nThey drove us from the Garden with their swords of flame, the fierce\ncherubim. And what had we done? We meant no harm. We were ignorant,\nand did as any other children might do. We could not know it was\nwrong to disobey the command, for the words were strange to us and\nwe did not understand them. We did not know right from wrong--how\nshould we know? We could not, without the Moral Sense; it was not\npossible. If we had been given the Moral Sense first--ah, that would\nhave been fairer, that would have been kinder; then we should be to\nblame if we disobeyed. But to say to us poor ignorant children words\nwhich we could not understand, and then punish us because we did not\ndo as we were told--ah, how can that be justified? We knew no more\nthen than this littlest child of mine knows now, with its four\nyears--oh, not so much, I think. Would I say to it, \u201cIf thou\ntouchest this bread I will overwhelm thee with unimaginable\ndisaster, even to the dissolution of thy corporeal elements,\u201d and\nwhen it took the bread and smiled up in my face, thinking no harm,\nas not understanding those strange words, would I take advantage of\nits innocence and strike it down with the mother hand it trusted?\nWhoso knoweth the mother heart, let him judge if it would do that\nthing. Adam says my brain is turned by my troubles and that I am\nbecome wicked. I am as I am; I did not make myself.\n\nThey drove us out. Drove us out into this harsh wilderness, and shut\nthe gates against us. We that had meant no harm. It is three months.\nWe were ignorant then; we are rich in learning, now--ah, how rich!\nWe know hunger, thirst, and cold; we know pain, disease, and grief;\nwe know hate, rebellion, and deceit; we know remorse, the conscience\nthat prosecutes guilt and innocence alike, making no distinction; we\nknow weariness of body and spirit, the unrefreshing sleep, the rest\nwhich rests not, the dreams which restore Eden, and banish it again\nwith the waking; we know misery; we know torture and the heartbreak;\nwe know humiliation and insult; we know indecency, immodesty, and\nthe soiled mind; we know the scorn that attaches to the transmitted\nimage of God exposed unclothed to the day; we know fear; we know\nvanity, folly, envy, hypocrisy; we know irreverence; we know\nblasphemy; we know right from wrong, and how to avoid the one and do\nthe other; we know all the rich product of the Moral Sense, and it\nis our possession. Would we could sell it for one hour of Eden and\nwhite purity; would we could degrade the animals with it!\n\nWe have it all--that treasure. All but death. Death.... Death. What\nmay that be?\n\nAdam comes.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe still sleeps.\u201d\n\nThat is our second-born--our Abel.\n\n\u201cHe has slept enough for his good, and his garden suffers for his\ncare. Wake him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have tried and cannot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen he is very tired. Let him sleep on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it is his hurt that makes him sleep so long.\u201d\n\nI answer: \u201cIt may be so. Then we will let him rest; no doubt the\nsleep is healing it.\u201d\n\n                                 II\n\nIt is a day and a night, now, that he has slept. We found him by his\naltar in his field, that morning, his face and body drenched in\nblood. He said his eldest brother struck him down. Then he spoke no\nmore and fell asleep. We laid him in his bed and washed the blood\naway, and were glad to know the hurt was light and that he had no\npain; for if he had had pain he would not have slept.\n\nIt was in the early morning that we found him. All day he slept that\nsweet, reposeful sleep, lying always on his back, and never moving,\nnever turning. It showed how tired he was, poor thing. He is so good\nand works so hard, rising with the dawn and laboring till the dark.\nAnd now he is overworked; it will be best that he tax himself less,\nafter this, and I will ask him; he will do anything I wish.\n\nAll the day he slept. I know, for I was always near, and made dishes\nfor him and kept them warm against his waking. Often I crept in and\nfed my eyes upon his gentle face, and was thankful for that blessed\nsleep. And still he slept on--slept with his eyes wide; a strange\nthing, and made me think he was awake at first, but it was not so,\nfor I spoke and he did not answer. He always answers when I speak.\nCain has moods and will not answer, but not Abel.\n\nI have sat by him all the night, being afraid he might wake and want\nhis food. His face was very white; and it changed, and he came to\nlook as he had looked when he was a little child in Eden long ago,\nso sweet and good and dear. It carried me back over the abyss of\nyears, and I was lost in dreams and tears--oh, hours, I think. Then\nI came to myself; and thinking he stirred, I kissed his cheek to\nwake him, but he slumbered on and I was disappointed. His cheek was\ncold. I brought sacks of wool and the down of birds and covered him,\nbut he was still cold, and I brought more. Adam has come again, and\nsays he is not yet warm. I do not understand it.\n\n                                III\n\nWe cannot wake him! With my arms clinging about him I have looked\ninto his eyes, through the veil of my tears, and begged for one\nlittle word, and he will not answer. Oh, is it that long sleep--is\nit death? And will he wake no more?\n\n                         FROM SATAN\u2019S DIARY\n\nDeath has entered the world, the creatures are perishing; one of The\nFamily is fallen; the product of the Moral Sense is complete. The\nFamily think ill of death--they will change their minds.\n\n\n\n\n                         SAMUEL ERASMUS MOFFETT\n                            AUGUST 16, 1908\n\n                    HIS CHARACTER AND HIS DEATH\n\n_August 16th._--Early in the evening of the first day of this month\nthe telephone brought us a paralyzing shock: my nephew, Samuel E.\nMoffett, was drowned. It was while sea bathing. The seas were\nrunning high and he was urged not to venture out, but he was a\nstrong swimmer and not afraid. He made the plunge with confidence,\nhis frightened little son looking on. Instantly he was helpless. The\ngreat waves tossed him hither and thither, they buried him, they\nstruck the life out of him. In a minute it was all over.\n\nHe was forty-eight years old, he was at his best, physically and\nmentally, and was well on his way toward earned distinction. He was\nlarge-minded and large-hearted, there was no blot nor fleck upon his\ncharacter, his ideals were high and clean, and by native impulse and\nwithout effort he lived up to them.\n\nHe had been a working journalist, an editorial writer, for nearly\nthirty years, and yet in that exposed position had preserved his\nindependence in full strength and his principles undecayed. Several\nyears ago he accepted a high place on the staff of _Collier\u2019s\nWeekly_ and was occupying it when he died.\n\nIn an early chapter of my _Autobiography_, written three years ago,\nI have told how he wrote from San Francisco, when he was a stripling\nand asked me to help him get a berth on a daily paper there; and how\nhe submitted to the severe conditions I imposed, and got the berth\nand kept it sixteen years.\n\nAs child and lad his health was delicate, capricious, insecure, and\nhis eyesight affected by a malady which debarred him from book study\nand from reading. This was a bitter hardship for him, for he had a\nwonderful memory and a sharp hunger for knowledge. School was not\nfor him, yet while still a little boy he acquired an education, and\na good one. He managed it after a method of his own devising: he got\npermission to listen while the classes of the normal school recited\ntheir abstruse lessons and black-boarded their mathematics. By\nquestioning the little chap it was found that he was keeping up with\nthe star scholars of the school.\n\nIn those days he paid us a visit in Hartford. It was when he was\nabout twelve years old. I was laboriously constructing an\nancient-history game at the time, to be played by my wife and\nmyself, and I was digging the dates and facts for it out of\ncyclop\u00e6dias, a dreary and troublesome business. I had sweated blood\nover that work and was pardonably proud of the result, as far as I\nhad gone. I showed the child my mass of notes, and he was at once as\nexcited as I should have been over a Sunday-school picnic at his\nage. He wanted to help, he was eager to help, and I was as willing\nto let him as I should have been to give away an interest in a\nsurgical operation that I was getting tired of. I made him free of\nthe cyclop\u00e6dias, but he never consulted them--he had their contents\nin his head. All alone he built and completed the game rapidly and\nwithout effort.\n\nAway back in \u201980 or \u201981 when the grand eruption of Krakatoa, in the\nStraits of Sunda, occurred, the news reached San Francisco late in\nthe night--too late for editors to hunt for information about that\nunknown volcano in cyclop\u00e6dias and write it up exhaustively and\nlearnedly in time for the first edition. The managing editor said,\n\u201cSend to Moffett\u2019s home; rout him out and fetch him; he will know\nall about it; he won\u2019t need the cyclop\u00e6dia.\u201d Which was true. He came\nto the office and swiftly wrote it all up without having to refer to\nbooks.\n\nI will take a few paragraphs from the article about him in\n_Collier\u2019s Weekly_:\n\n  If you wanted to know any fact about any subject it was quicker to\n  go to him than to books of reference. His good nature made him the\n  martyr of interruptions. In the middle of a sentence, in a hurry\n  hour, he would look up happily, and whether the thing you wanted\n  was railroad statistics or international law, he would bring it\n  out of one of the pigeonholes in his brain. A born dispenser of\n  the light, he made the giving of information a privilege and a\n  pleasure on all occasions.\n\n  This cyclop\u00e6dic faculty was marvelous because it was only a small\n  part of his equipment which became invaluable in association with\n  other gifts. A student and a humanist, he delighted equally in\n  books and in watching all the workings of a political convention.\n\n  For any one of the learned professions he had conspicuous ability.\n  He chose that which, in the cloister of the editorial rooms, makes\n  fame for others. Any judge or Cabinet Minister of our time may\n  well be proud of a career of such usefulness as his. Men with such\n  a quality of mind as Moffett\u2019s are rare.\n\n  Anyone who discussed with him the things he advocated stood a\n  little awed to discover that here was a man who had carefully\n  thought out what would be best for all the people in the world two\n  or three generations hence, and guided his work according to that\n  standard. This was the one broad subject that covered all his\n  interests; in detail they included the movement for universal\n  peace about which he wrote repeatedly; so small a thing as a plan\n  to place flowers on the window sills and fire escapes of New York\n  tenement houses enlisted not only the advocacy of his pen, but his\n  direct personal presence and co-operation; again and again, in his\n  department in this paper, he gave indorsement and aid to similar\n  movements, whether broad or narrow in their scope--the saving of\n  the American forests, fighting tuberculosis, providing free meals\n  for poor school children in New York, old-age pensions, safety\n  appliances for protecting factory employees, the beautifying of\n  American cities, the creation of inland waterways, industrial\n  peace.\n\nHe leaves behind him wife, daughter, and son--inconsolable mourners.\nThe son is thirteen, a beautiful human creature, with the broad and\nsquare face of his father and his grandfather, a face in which one\nreads high character and intelligence. This boy will be\ndistinguished, by and by, I think.\n\nIn closing this slight sketch of Samuel E. Moffett I wish to dwell\nwith lingering and especial emphasis upon the dignity of his\ncharacter and ideals. In an age when we would rather have money than\nhealth, and would rather have another man\u2019s money than our own, he\nlived and died unsordid; in a day when the surest road to national\ngreatness and admiration is by showy and rotten demagoguery in\npolitics and by giant crimes in finance, he lived and died a\ngentleman.\n\n\n\n\n                             THE NEW PLANET\n\n  (The astronomers at Harvard have observed \u201cperturbations in the\n  orbital movement of Neptune,\u201d such as might be caused by the\n  presence of a new planet in the vicinity.)\n\n\nI believe in the new planet. I was eleven years old in 1846,\nwhen Leverrier and Adams and Mary Somerville discovered Neptune\nthrough the disturbance and discomfort it was causing Uranus.\n\u201cPerturbations,\u201d they call that kind of disturbance. I had been\nhaving those perturbations myself, for more than two months; in\nfact, all through watermelon time, for they used to keep dogs in\nsome of the patches in those days. You notice that these recent\nperturbations are considered remarkable because they perturbate\nthrough three seconds of arc, but really that is nothing: often\nI used to perturbate through as much as half an hour if it was a\ndog that was attending to the perturbating. There isn\u2019t any\nNeptune that can outperturbate a dog; and I know, because I am\nnot speaking from hearsay. Why, if there was a planet two\nhundred and fifty thousand \u201clight-years\u201d the other side of\nNeptune\u2019s orbit, Professor Pickering would discover it in a\nminute if it could perturbate equal to a dog. Give me a dog\nevery time, when it comes to perturbating. You let a dog jump\nout at you all of a sudden in the dark of the moon, and you will\nsee what a small thing three seconds of arc is: the shudder that\ngoes through you then would open the seams of Noah\u2019s Ark itself,\nfrom figurehead to rudder post, and you would drop that melon\nthe same as if you had never had any but just a casual interest\nin it. I know about these things, because this is not tradition\nI am writing, but history.\n\nNow then, notice this. About the end of August, 1846, a change came\nover me and I resolved to lead a better life, so I reformed; but it\nwas just as well, anyway, because they had got to having guns and\ndogs both. Although I was reformed, the perturbations did not stop!\nDoes that strike you? They did not stop, they went right on and on\nand on, for three weeks, clear up to the 23d of September; then\nNeptune was discovered and the whole mystery stood explained. It\nshows that I am so sensitively constructed that I perturbate when\nany other planet is disturbed. This has been going on all my life.\nIt only happens in the watermelon season, but that has nothing to do\nwith it, and has no significance: geologists and anthropologists and\nhorticulturists all tell me it is only ancestral and hereditary, and\nthat is what I think myself. Now then, I got to perturbating again,\nthis summer--all summer through; all through watermelon time: and\n_where_, do you think? Up here on my farm in Connecticut. Is that\nsignificant? Unquestionably it is, for you couldn\u2019t raise a\nwatermelon on this farm with a derrick.\n\nThat perturbating was caused by the new planet. That Washington\nObservatory may throw as much doubt as it wants to, it cannot affect\nme, because I know there _is_ a new planet. I know it because I\ndon\u2019t perturbate for nothing. There has got to be a dog or a planet,\none or the other; and there isn\u2019t any dog around here, so there\u2019s\n_got_ to be a planet. I hope it is going to be named after me; I\nshould just love it if I can\u2019t have a constellation.\n\n\n\n\n                      MARJORIE FLEMING, THE WONDER\n                                 CHILD\n\n\nMarjorie has been in her tiny grave a hundred years; and still the\ntears fall for her, and will fall. What an intensely human little\ncreature she was! How vividly she lived her small life; how\nimpulsive she was; how sudden, how tempestuous, how tender, how\nloving, how sweet, how loyal, how rebellious, how repentant, how\nwise, how unwise, how bursting with fun, how frank, how free, how\nhonest, how innocently bad, how natively good, how charged with\nquaint philosophies, how winning, how precious, how adorable--and\nhow perennially and indestructibly interesting! And all this\nexhibited, proved, and recorded before she reached the end of her\nninth year and \u201cfell on sleep.\u201d\n\nGeographically considered, the lassie was a Scot; but in fact she\nhad no frontiers, she was the world\u2019s child, she was the human race\nin little. It is one of the prides of my life that the first time I\never heard her name it came from the lips of Dr. John Brown--his\nvery own self--Dr. John Brown of Edinburgh--Dr. John Brown of _Rab\nand His Friends_--Dr. John Brown of the beautiful face and the sweet\nspirit, whose friends loved him with a love that was worship--Dr.\nJohn Brown, who was Marjorie\u2019s biographer, and who had clasped an\naged hand that had caressed Marjorie\u2019s fifty years before, thus\nlinking me with that precious child by an unbroken chain of\nhandshakes, for I had shaken hands with Dr. John. This was in\nEdinburgh thirty-six years ago. He gave my wife his little biography\nof Marjorie, and I have it yet.\n\nIs Marjorie known in America? No--at least to only a few. When Mr.\nL. MacBean\u2019s new and enlarged and charming biography[17] of her was\npublished five years ago it was sent over here in sheets, the market\nnot being large enough to justify recomposing and reprinting it on\nour side of the water. I find that there are even cultivated\nScotchmen among us who have not heard of Marjorie Fleming.\n\nShe was born in Kirkcaldy in 1803, and she died when she was eight\nyears and eleven months old. By the time she was five years old she\nwas become a devourer of various kinds of literature--both heavy and\nlight--and was also become a quaint and free-spoken and charming\nlittle thinker and philosopher whose views were a delightful jumble\nof first-hand cloth of gold and second-hand rags.\n\nWhen she was six she opened up that rich mine, her journals, and\ncontinued to work it by spells during the remainder of her brief\nlife. She was a pet of Walter Scott, from the cradle, and when he\ncould have her society for a few hours he was content, and required\nno other. Her little head was full of noble passages from\nShakespeare and other favorites of hers, and the fact that she could\ndeliver them with moving effect is proof that her elocution was a\nborn gift with her, and not a mechanical reproduction of somebody\nelse\u2019s art, for a child\u2019s parrot-work does not move. When she was a\nlittle creature of seven years, Sir Walter Scott \u201cwould read ballads\nto her in his own glorious way, the two getting wild with excitement\nover them; and he would take her on his knee and make her repeat\nConstance\u2019s speeches in _King John_ till he swayed to and fro,\nsobbing his fill.\u201d [Dr. John Brown.]\n\n\u201c_Sobbing his fill_\u201d--that great man--over that little thing\u2019s\ninspired interpretations. It is a striking picture; there is no mate\nto it. Sir Walter said of her:\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the most extraordinary creature I ever met with, and her\nrepeating of Shakespeare overpowers me as nothing else does.\u201d\n\nShe spent the whole of her little life in a Presbyterian heaven; yet\nshe was not affected by it; she could not have been happier if she\nhad been in the other heaven.\n\nShe was made out of thunderstorms and sunshine, and not even her\nlittle perfunctory pieties and shop-made holiness could squelch her\nspirits or put out her fires for long. Under pressure of a pestering\nsense of duty she heaves a shovelful of trade godliness into her\njournals every little while, but it does not offend, for none of it\nis her own; it is all borrowed, it is a convention, a custom of her\nenvironment, it is the most innocent of hypocrisies, and this\ntainted butter of hers soon gets to be as delicious to the reader as\nare the stunning and worldly sincerities she splatters around it\nevery time her pen takes a fresh breath. The adorable child! she\nhasn\u2019t a discoverable blemish in her make-up anywhere.\n\nMarjorie\u2019s first letter was written before she was six years old; it\nwas to her cousin, Isa Keith, a young lady of whom she was\npassionately fond. It was done in a sprawling hand, ten words to the\npage--and in those foolscap days a page was a spacious thing:\n\n\u201cMY DEAR ISA--\n\n\u201cI now sit down on my botom to answer all the kind & beloved letters\nwhich you was so so good as to write to me. This is the first time I\never wrote a letter in my life.\n\n\u201cMiss Potune, a lady of my acquaintance, praises me dreadfully. I\nrepeated something out of Deen Swift & she said I was fit for the\nstage, & you may think I was primmed up with majestick Pride, but\nupon my word I felt myself turn a little birsay--birsay is a word\nwhich is a word that William composed which is as you may suppose a\nlittle enraged. This horid fat Simpliton says that my Aunt is\nbeautifull which is intirely impossible for that is not her nature.\u201d\n\nFrank? Yes, Marjorie was that. And during the brief moment that she\nenchanted this dull earth with her presence she was the\nbewitchingest speller and punctuator in all Christendom.\n\nThe average child of six \u201cprints\u201d its correspondence in rickety and\nreeling Roman capitals, or dictates to mamma, who puts the little\nchap\u2019s message on paper. The sentences are labored, repetitious, and\nslow; there are but three or four of them; they deal in information\nsolely, they contain no ideas, they venture no judgments, no\nopinions; they inform papa that the cat has had kittens again; that\nMary has a new doll that can wink; that Tommy has lost his top; and\nwill papa come soon and bring the writer something nice? But with\nMarjorie it is different.\n\nShe needs no amanuensis, she puts her message on paper herself; and\nnot in weak and tottering Roman capitals, but in a thundering hand\nthat can be heard a mile and be read across the square without\nglasses. And she doesn\u2019t have to study, and puzzle, and search her\nhead for something to say; no, she had only to connect the pen with\nthe paper and turn on the current; the words spring forth at once,\nand go chasing after each other like leaves dancing down a stream.\nFor she has a faculty, has Marjorie! Indeed yes; when she sits down\non her bottom to do a letter, there isn\u2019t going to be any lack of\nmaterials, nor of fluency, and neither is her letter going to be\nwanting in pepper, or vinegar, or vitriol, or any of the other\ncondiments employed by genius to save a literary work of art from\nflatness and vapidity. And as for judgments and opinions, they are\nas commodiously in her line as they are in the Lord Chief Justice\u2019s.\nThey have weight, too, and are convincing: for instance, for\nthirty-six years they have damaged that \u201chorid Simpliton\u201d in my\neyes; and, more than that, they have even imposed upon me--and most\nunfairly and unwarrantably--an aversion to the horid fat Simpliton\u2019s\nname; a perfectly innocent name, and yet, because of the prejudice\nagainst it with which this child has poisoned my mind for a\ngeneration I cannot see \u201cPotune\u201d on paper and keep my gorge from\nrising.\n\nIn her journals Marjorie changes her subject whenever she wants\nto--and that is pretty often. When the deep moralities pay her a\npassing visit she registers them. Meantime if a cherished love\npassage drifts across her memory she shoves it into the midst of the\nmoralities--it is nothing to her that it may not feel at home there:\n\n\u201cWe should not be happy at the death of our fellow creatures, for\nthey love life like us love your neighbor & he will love you\nBountifulness and Mercifulness are always rewarded. In my travels I\nmet with a handsome lad named Charles Balfour Esge [Esqr.] and from\nhim I got offers of marage--ofers of marage did I say? nay plainly\n[he] loved me. Goodness does not belong to the wicked but badness\ndishonor befals wickedness but not virtue, no disgrace befals virtue\nperciverence overcomes almost al difficulties no I am rong in saying\nalmost I should say always as it is so perciverence is a virtue my\nCsosin says pacience is a cristain virtue, which is true.\u201d\n\nShe is not copying these profundities out of a book, she is getting\nthem out of her memory; her spelling shows that the book is not\nbefore her. The easy and effortless flow of her talk is a marvelous\nthing in a baby of her age. Her interests are as wide and varied as\na grown person\u2019s: she discusses all sorts of books, and fearlessly\ndelivers judgment upon them; she examines whomsoever crosses the\nfield of her vision, and again delivers a verdict; she dips into\nreligion and history, and even into politics; she takes a shy at the\nnews of the day, and comments upon it; and now and then she drops\ninto poetry--into rhyme, at any rate.\n\nMarjorie would not intentionally mislead anyone, but she has just\nbeen making a remark which moves me to hoist a danger-signal for the\nprotection of the modern reader. It is this one: \u201c_In my travels._\u201d\nNaturally we are apt to clothe a word with its present-day\nmeaning--the meaning we are used to, the meaning we are familiar\nwith; and so--well, you get the idea: some words that are giants\nto-day were very small dwarfs a century ago, and if we are not\ncareful to take that vast enlargement into account when we run\nacross them in the literatures of the past, they are apt to convey\nto us a distinctly wrong impression. To-day, when a person says \u201c_in\nmy travels_\u201d he means that he has been around the globe nineteen or\ntwenty times, and we so understand him; and so, when Marjorie says\nit, it startles us for a moment, for it gives us the impression that\n_she_ has been around it fourteen or fifteen times; whereas, such is\nnot at all the case. She has traveled prodigiously for _her_ day,\nbut not for ours. She had \u201ctraveled,\u201d altogether, three miles by\nland and eight by water--per ferryboat. She is fairly and justly\nproud of it, for it is the exact equivalent, in grandeur and\nimpressiveness, in the case of a child of our day, to two trips\nacross the Atlantic and a thousand miles by rail.\n\n\u201cIn the love novels all the heroins are very desperate Isabella will\nnot allow me to speak about lovers and heroins, and tiss too refined\nfor my taste a loadstone is a curous thing indeed it is true Heroic\nlove doth never win disgrace this is my maxum and I will follow it\nforever Miss Eguards [Edgeworth] tails are very good particularly\nsome that are very much adopted for youth as Lazy Lawrence Tarelton\nFalse Key &c &c Persons of the parlement house are as I think caled\nAdvocakes Mr Cay & Mr Crakey has that honour. This has been a very\nmild winter. Mr Banestors Budget is to-night I hope it will be a\ngood one. A great many authors have expressed themselfs too\nsentimentaly.... The Mercandile Afares are in a perilous situation\nsickness & a delicante frame I have not & I do not know what it is,\nbut Ah me perhaps I shall have it.[18] Grandure reigns in\nEdinburgh.... Tomson is a beautifull author and Pope but nothing is\nlike Shakepear of which I have a little knolegde of. An unfortunate\ndeath James the 5 had for he died of greif Macbeth is a pretty\ncomposition but awful one Macbeth is so bad & wicked, but Lady\nMacbeth is so hardened in guilt she does not mind her sins & faults\nNo.\n\n\u201c... A sailor called here to say farewell, it must be dreadful to\nleave his native country where he might get a wife or perhaps me,\nfor I love him very much & with all my heart, but O I forgot\nIsabella forbid me to speak about love.... I wish everybody would\nfollow her example & be as good as pious & virtious as she is & they\nwould get husbands soon enough, love is a parithatick [pathetic]\nthing as well as troublesome & tiresome but O Isabella forbid me to\nspeak about it.\u201d\n\nBut the little rascal can\u2019t _keep_ from speaking about it, because\nit is her supreme interest in life; her heart is not capacious\nenough to hold all the product that is engendered by the\never-recurring inflaming spectacle of man-creatures going by, and\nthe surplus is obliged to spill over; Isa\u2019s prohibitions are no\nsufficient dam for such a discharge.\n\n\u201cLove I think is the fasion for everybody is marring [marrying]....\nYesterday a marrade man named Mr John Balfour Esg [Esq.] offered to\nkiss me, & offered to marry me though the man was espused\n[espoused], & his wife was present & said he must ask her permission\nbut he did not, I think he was ashamed or confounded before 3\ngentleman Mr Jobson and two Mr Kings.\u201d\n\nI must make room here for another of Marjorie\u2019s second-hand\nhigh-morality outbreaks. They give me a sinful delight which I ought\nto grieve at, I suppose, but I can\u2019t seem to manage it:\n\n\u201cJames Macary is to be transported for murder in the flower of his\nyouth O passion is a terible thing for it leads people from sin to\nsin at last it gets so far as to come to greater crimes than we\nthought we could comit and it must be dreadful to leave his native\ncountry and his friends and to be so disgraced and affronted.\u201d\n\nThat is Marjorie talking shop, dear little diplomat--to please and\ncomfort mamma and Isa, no doubt.\n\nThis wee little child has a marvelous range of interests. She reads\nphilosophies, novels, baby books, histories, the mighty poets--reads\nthem with burning interest, and frankly and freely criticizes them\nall; she revels in storms, sunsets, cloud effects, scenery of\nmountain, plain, ocean, and forest, and all the other wonders of\nnature, and sets down her joy in them all; she loves people, she\ndetests people, according to mood and circumstances, and delivers\nher opinion of them, sometimes seasoned with attar of roses,\nsometimes with vitriol; in games, and all kinds of childish play she\nis an enthusiast; she adores animals, adores them all; none is too\nforlorn to fail of favor in her friendly eyes, no creature so humble\nthat she cannot find something in it on which to lavish her\ncaressing worship.\n\n\u201cI am going to-morrow to a delightfull place, Braehead by name,\nbelonging to Mrs. Crraford [Crauford], where there is ducks cocks\nhens bobblyjocks 2 dogs 2 cats and swine which is delightful. I\nthink it is shocking to think that the dog and cat should bear them\nand they are drowned after all.\u201d\n\nShe is a dear child, a bewitching little scamp; and never dearer, I\nthink, than when the devil has had her in possession and she is\nbreaking her stormy little heart over the remembrance of it:\n\n\u201cI confess I have been very more like a little young divil than a\ncreature for when Isabella went up stairs to teach me religion and\nmy multiplication and to be good and all my other lessons I stamped\nwith my foot and threw my new hat which she had made on the ground\nand was sulky and was dreadfully passionate, but she never whiped me\nbut said Marjory go into another room and think what a great crime\nyou are committing letting your temper git the better of you. But I\nwent so sulkily that the devil got the better of me but she never\nnever never whips me so that I think I would be the better of it &\nthe next time that I behave ill I think she should do it for she\nnever does it.... Isabella has given me praise for checking my\ntemper for I was sulky even when she was kneeling an whole hour\nteaching me to write.\u201d\n\nThe wise Isabella, the sweet and patient Isabella! It is just a\nhundred years now (May, 1909) since the grateful child made that\ngolden picture of you and laid your good heart bare for distant\ngenerations to see and bless; a hundred years--but if the picture\nendures a thousand it will still bring you the blessing, and with it\nthe reverent homage that is your due. You had the seeing eye and the\nwise head. A fool would have punished Marjorie and wrecked her, but\nyou held your hand, as knowing that when her volcanic fires went\ndown she would repent, and grieve, and punish herself, and be saved.\n\nSometimes when Marjorie was miraculously good, she got a penny for\nit, and once when she got an entire sixpence, she recognized that it\nwas wealth. This wealth brought joy to her heart. Why? Because she\ncould spend it on somebody else! We who know Marjorie would know\nthat without being told it. I am sorry--often sorry, often\ngrieved--that I was not there and looking over her shoulder when she\nwas writing down her valued penny rewards: I would have said, \u201cSave\nthat scrap of manuscript, dear; make a will, and leave it to your\nposterity, to save them from want when penury shall threaten them; a\nday will come when it will be worth a thousand guineas, and a later\nday will come when it will be worth five thousand; here you are,\nrejoicing in copper farthings, and don\u2019t know that your magic pen is\nshowering gold coin all over the paper.\u201d But I was not there to say\nit; those who were there did not think to say it; and so there is\nnot a line of that quaint precious cacography in existence to-day.\n\nI have adored Marjorie for six-and-thirty years; I have adored her\nin detail, I have adored the whole of her; but above all other\ndetails--just a little above all other details--I have adored her\nbecause she detested that odious and confusing and unvanquishable\nand unlearnable and shameless invention, the multiplication table:\n\n\u201cI am now going to tell you the horible and wretched plaege [plague]\nthat my multiplication gives me you can\u2019t conceive it the most\nDevilish thing is 8 times 8 & 7 times 7 it is what nature itself\ncant endure.\u201d\n\nI stand reverently uncovered in the presence of that holy verdict.\n\nHere is that person again whom I so dislike--and for no reason at\nall except that my Marjorie doesn\u2019t like her:\n\n\u201cMiss Potune is very fat she pretends to be very learned she says\nshe saw a stone that dropt from the skies, but she is a good\nchristian.\u201d\n\nOf course, stones have fallen from the skies, but I don\u2019t believe\nthis \u201chorid fat Simpliton\u201d had ever seen one that had done it; but\neven if she had, it was none of her business, and she could have\nbeen better employed than in going around exaggerating it and\ncarrying on about it and trying to make trouble with a little child\nthat had never done _her_ any harm.\n\n\u201c... The Birds do chirp the Lambs do leap and Nature is clothed with\nthe garments of green yellow, and white, purple, and red.\n\n\u201c... There is a book that is called the Newgate Calender that\ncontains all the Murders: all the Murders did I say, nay all Thefts\n& Forgeries that ever were committed & fills me with horror &\nconsternation.\u201d\n\nMarjorie is a diligent little student, and her education is always\nstorming along and making great time and lots of noise:\n\n\u201cIsabella this morning taught me some French words one of which is\nbon suar the interpretation is good morning.\u201d\n\nIt slanders Isabella, but the slander is not intentional. The main\nthing to notice is that big word, \u201cinterpretation.\u201d Not many\nchildren of Marjorie\u2019s age can handle a five syllable team in that\neasy and confident way. It is observable that she frequently employs\nwords of an imposingly formidable size, and is manifestly quite\nfamiliar with them and not at all afraid of them.\n\n\u201cIsa is teaching me to make Simecolings nots of interrigations\nperiods & commas &c. As this is Sunday I will meditate uppon\nsenciable & Religious subjects first I should be very thankful I am\nnot a beggar as many are.\u201d\n\nThat was the \u201cfirst.\u201d She didn\u2019t get to her second subject, but got\nside-tracked by a saner interest, and used her time to better\npurpose.\n\n\u201cIt is melancholy to think, that I have so many talents, & many\nthere are that have not had the attention paid to them that I have,\n& yet they contrive to be better then me.\n\n\u201c... Isabella is far too indulgent to me & even the Miss Crafords\nsay that they wonder at her patience with me & it is indeed true for\nmy temper is a bad one.\u201d\n\nThe daring child wrote a (synopsized) history of Mary Queen of Scots\nand of five of the royal Jameses in rhyme--but never mind, we have\nno room to discuss it here. Nothing was entirely beyond her literary\njurisdiction; if it had occurred to her that the laws of Rome needed\ncodifying she would have taken a chance at it.\n\nHere is a sad note:\n\n\u201cMy religion is greatly falling off because I dont pray with so much\nattention when I am saying my prayers and my character is lost\na-mong the Breahead people I hope I will be religious again but as\nfor regaining my character I despare of it.\u201d\n\nWhen religion and character go, they leave a large vacuum. But there\nare ways to fill it:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve forgot to say, but I\u2019ve four lovers, the other one is Harry\nWatson, a very delightful boy.... James Keith hardly ever Spoke to\nme, he said Girl! make less noise.... Craky hall ... I walked to\nthat delightfull place with a delightful young man beloved by all\nhis friends and espacialy by me his loveress but I must not talk any\nlonger about him for Isa said it is not proper for to speak of\ngentalman but I will never forget him....\n\n\u201cThe Scythians tribe live very coarsely for a Gluton Introduced to\nArsaces the Captain of the Army, 1 man who Dressed hair & another\nman who was a good cook but Arsaces said that he would keep 1 for\nbrushing his horses tail and the other to fead his pigs....\n\n\u201cOn Saturday I expected no less than three well-made bucks, the\nnames of whom is here advertised. Mr. Geo. Crakey [Cragie], and Wm.\nKeith and Jn Keith--the first is the funniest of every one of them.\nMr. Crakey and I walked to Craky-hall [Craigiehall] hand and hand in\nInnocence and matitation sweet thinking on the kind love which flows\nin our tender hearted mind which is overflowing with majestic\npleasure no one was ever so polite to me in the hole state of my\nexistence. Mr. Craky you must know is a great Buck and pretty\ngood-looking.\u201d\n\nFor a purpose, I wish the reader to take careful note of these\nstatistics:\n\n\u201cI am going to tell you of a melancholy story. A young turkie of 2\nor 3 months old, would you believe it, the father broke its leg, &\nhe killed another! I think he ought to be transported or hanged.\u201d\n\nMarjorie wrote some verses about this tragedy--I think. I cannot be\nquite certain it is this one, for in the verses there are three\ndeaths, whereas these statistics do not furnish so many. Also in the\nstatistics the father of the deceased is indifferent about the loss\nhe has sustained, whereas in the verses he is not. Also in the third\nverse, the _mother_, too, exhibits feeling, whereas in the two\nclosing verses of the poem she--at least it seems to be she--is\nindifferent. At least it looks like indifference to me, and I\nbelieve it _is_ indifference:\n\n           \u201cThree turkeys fair their last have breathed,\n           And now this world forever leaved;\n           Their father, and their mother too,\n           They sighed and weep as well as you;\n           Indeed, the rats their bones have cranched.\n           Into eternity theire launched.\n           A direful death indeed they had,\n           As wad put any parent mad;\n           But she was more than usual calm,\n           She did not give a single dam.\u201d\n\nThe naughty little scamp! I mean, for not leaving out the _l_ in the\nword \u201cCalm,\u201d so as to perfect the rhyme. It seems a pity to damage\nwith a lame rhyme a couplet that is otherwise without a blemish.\n\nMarjorie wrote four journals. She began the first one in January,\n1809, when she was just six years old, and finished it five months\nlater, in June.\n\nShe began the second in the following month, and finished it six\nmonths afterward (January, 1810), when she was just seven.\n\nShe began the third one in April, 1810, and finished it in the\nautumn.\n\nShe wrote the fourth in the winter of 1810-11, and the last entry in\nit bears date July 19, 1811, and she died exactly five months later,\nDecember 19th, aged eight years and eleven months. It contains her\nrhymed Scottish histories.\n\nLet me quote from Dr. John Brown:\n\n\u201cThe day before her death, Sunday, she sat up in bed, worn and thin,\nher eye gleaming as with the light of a coming world, and with a\ntremulous, old voice repeated a long poem by Burns--heavy with the\nshadow of death, and lit with the fantasy of the judgment seat--the\npublican\u2019s prayer in paraphrase, beginning:\n\n         \u201c\u2018Why am I loth to leave this earthly scene?\n             Have I so found it full of pleasing charms?\n         Some drops of joy, with draughts of ill between,\n             Some gleams of sunshine \u2019mid renewing storms.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt is more affecting than we care to say to read her mother\u2019s and\nIsabella Keith\u2019s letters written immediately after her death. Old\nand withered, tattered and pale, they are now; but when you read\nthem, how quick, how throbbing with life and love! how rich in that\nlanguage of affection which only women, and Shakespeare, and Luther\ncan use--that power of detaining the soul over the beloved object\nand its loss.\u201d\n\nFifty years after Marjorie\u2019s death her sister, writing to Dr. Brown,\nsaid:\n\n\u201cMy mother was struck by the patient quietness manifested by\nMarjorie during this illness, unlike her ardent, impulsive nature;\nbut love and poetic feeling were unquenched. When Dr. Johnstone\nrewarded her submissiveness with a sixpence, the request speedily\nfollowed that she might get out ere New Year\u2019s Day came. When asked\nwhy she was so desirous of getting out, she immediately rejoined:\n\u2018Oh, I am so anxious to buy something with my sixpence for my dear\nIsa Keith.\u2019 Again, when lying very still, her mother asked her if\nthere was anything she wished: \u2018Oh yes, if you would just leave the\nroom door open a wee bit, and play the _Land o\u2019 the Leal_, and I\nwill lie and _think_ and enjoy myself\u2019 (this is just as stated to me\nby her mother and mine). Well, the happy day came, alike to parents\nand child, when Marjorie was allowed to come forth from the nursery\nto the parlor. It was Sabbath evening, and after tea. My father, who\nidolized this child, and never afterward in my hearing mentioned her\nname, took her in his arms; and while walking her up and down the\nroom she said: \u2018Father, I will repeat something to you; what would\nyou like?\u2019 He said, \u2018Just choose for yourself, Maidie.\u2019 She\nhesitated for a moment between the paraphrase, \u2018Few are thy days and\nfull of woe,\u2019 and the lines of Burns already quoted, but decided on\nthe latter; a remarkable choice for a child. The repeating of these\nlines seemed to stir up the depths of feeling in her soul. She asked\nto be allowed to write a poem. There was a doubt whether it would be\nright to allow her, in case of hurting her eyes. She pleaded\nearnestly, \u2018Just this once\u2019; the point was yielded, her slate was\ngiven her, and with great rapidity she wrote an address of fourteen\nlines \u2018To my loved cousin on the author\u2019s recovery.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe cousin was Isa Keith.\n\n\u201cShe went to bed apparently well, awoke in the middle of the night\nwith the old cry of woe to a mother\u2019s heart, \u2018My head, my head!\u2019\nThree days of the dire malady, \u2018water in the head,\u2019 followed, and\nthe end came.\u201d\n\n-----\n\nFootnote 17:\n\n  _Marjorie Fleming._ By L. MacBean. G. P. Putnam\u2019s Sons,\n  publishers, London and New York.\n\n  Permission to use the extracts quoted from Marjorie\u2019s Journal in\n  this article has been granted me by the publishers.\n\nFootnote 18:\n\n  It is a whole century since the dimly conscious little prophet\n  said it, but the pathos of it is still there.\n\n\n\n\n                            ADAM\u2019S SOLILOQUY\n\n  (The spirit of Adam is supposed to be visiting New York City\n  inspecting the dinosaur at the Museum of Natural History)\n\n                               (1905)\n\n                                 I\n\nIt is strange ... very strange. _I_ do not remember this creature.\n(_After gazing long and admiringly._) Well, it is wonderful! The\nmere _skeleton_ fifty-seven feet long and sixteen feet high! Thus\nfar, it seems, they\u2019ve found only this sample--without doubt a\nmerely medium-sized one; a person could not step out here into the\nPark and happen by luck upon the largest horse in America; no, he\nwould happen upon one that would look small alongside of the biggest\nNormandy. It is quite likely that the biggest dinosaur was ninety\nfeet long and twenty feet high. It would be five times as long as an\nelephant; an elephant would be to it what a calf is to an elephant.\nThe bulk of the creature! The weight of him! As long as the longest\nwhale, and twice the substance in him! And all good wholesome pork,\nmost likely; meat enough to last a village a year.... Think of a\nhundred of them in line, draped in shining cloth of gold!--a\nmajestic thing for a coronation procession. But expensive, for he\nwould eat much; only kings and millionaires could afford him.\n\nI have no recollection of him; neither Eve nor I had heard of him\nuntil yesterday. We spoke to Noah about him; he colored and changed\nthe subject. Being brought back to it--and pressed a little--he\nconfessed that in the matter of stocking the Ark the stipulations\nhad not been carried out with absolute strictness--that is, in minor\ndetails, unessentials. There were some irregularities. He said the\nboys were to blame for this--the boys mainly, his own fatherly\nindulgence partly. They were in the giddy heyday of their youth at\nthe time, the happy springtime of life; their hundred years sat upon\nthem lightly, and--well, he had once been a boy himself, and he had\nnot the heart to be too exacting with them. And so--well, they did\nthings they shouldn\u2019t have done, and he--to be candid, he winked.\nBut on the whole they did pretty faithful work, considering their\nage. They collected and stowed a good share of the really useful\nanimals; and also, when Noah was not watching, a multitude of\nuseless ones, such as flies, mosquitoes, snakes, and so on, but they\ndid certainly leave ashore a good many creatures which might\npossibly have had value some time or other, in the course of time.\nMainly these were vast saurians a hundred feet long, and monstrous\nmammals, such as the megatherium and that sort, and there was really\nsome excuse for leaving them behind, for two reasons: (1) it was\nmanifest that some time or other they would be needed as fossils for\nmuseums and (2) there had been a miscalculation, the Ark was smaller\nthan it should have been, and so there wasn\u2019t room for those\ncreatures. There was actually fossil material enough all by\nitself to freight twenty-five Arks like that one. As for the\ndinosaur----But Noah\u2019s conscience was easy; it was not named in his\ncargo list and he and the boys were not aware that there was such a\ncreature. He said he could not blame himself for not knowing about\nthe dinosaur, because it was an American animal, and America had not\nthen been discovered.\n\nNoah went on to say, \u201cI did reproach the boys for not making the\nmost of the room we had, by discarding trashy animals and\nsubstituting beasts like the mastodon, which could be useful to man\nin doing heavy work such as the elephant performs, but they said\nthose great creatures would have increased our labors beyond our\nstrength, in the matter of feeding and watering them, we being\nshort-handed. There was something in that. We had no pump; there was\nbut one window; we had to let down a bucket from that, and haul it\nup a good fifty feet, which was very tiresome; then we had to carry\nthe water downstairs--fifty feet again, in cases where it was for\nthe elephants and their kind, for we kept them in the hold to serve\nfor ballast. As it was, we lost many animals--choice animals that\nwould have been valuable in menageries--different breeds of lions,\ntigers, hyenas, wolves, and so on; for they wouldn\u2019t drink the water\nafter the salt sea water got mixed with the fresh. But we never lost\na locust, nor a grasshopper, nor a weevil, nor a rat, nor a cholera\ngerm, nor any of that sort of beings. On the whole, I think we did\nvery well, everything considered. We were shepherds and farmers; we\nhad never been to sea before; we were ignorant of naval matters, and\nI know this for certain, that there is more difference between\nagriculture and navigation than a person would think. It is my\nopinion that the two trades do not belong together. Shem thinks the\nsame; so does Japheth. As for what Ham thinks, it is not important.\nHam is biased. You find me a Presbyterian that isn\u2019t, if you think\nyou can.\u201d\n\nHe said it aggressively; it had in it the spirit of a challenge. I\navoided argument by changing the subject. With Noah, arguing is a\npassion, a disease, and it is growing upon him; has been growing\nupon him for thirty thousand years, and more. It makes him\nunpopular, unpleasant; many of his oldest friends dread to meet him.\nEven strangers soon get to avoiding him, although at first they are\nglad to meet him and gaze at him, on account of his celebrated\nadventure. For a time they are proud of his notice, because he is so\ndistinguished; but he argues them to rags, and before long they\nbegin to wish, like the rest, that something had happened to the\nArk.\n\n                                 II\n\n(_On the bench in the Park, midafternoon, dreamily noting the drift,\nof the human species back and forth._) To think--this multitude is\nbut a wee little fraction of the earth\u2019s population! And all blood\nkin to me, every one! Eve ought to have come with me; this would\nexcite her affectionate heart. She was never able to keep her\ncomposure when she came upon a relative; she would try to kiss every\none of these people, black and white and all. (_A baby wagon\npasses._) How little change one can notice--none at all, in fact. I\nremember the first child well----Let me see ... it is three hundred\nthousand years ago come Tuesday. This one is just like it. So\nbetween the first one and the last one there is really nothing to\nchoose. The same insufficiency of hair, the same absence of teeth,\nthe same feebleness of body and apparent vacancy of mind, the same\ngeneral unattractiveness all around. Yet Eve worshiped that early\none, and it was pretty to see her with it. This latest one\u2019s mother\nworships _it_; it shows in her eyes--it is the very look that used\nto shine in Eve\u2019s. To think that so subtle and intangible a thing as\na _look_ could flit and flash from face to face down a procession\nthree hundred thousand years long and remain the same, without shade\nof change! Yet here it is, lighting this young creature\u2019s face just\nas it lighted Eve\u2019s in the long ago--the newest thing I have seen in\nthe earth, and the oldest. Of course, the dinosaur----But that is in\nanother class.\n\nShe drew the baby wagon to the bench and sat down and began to shove\nit softly back and forth with one hand while she held up a newspaper\nwith the other and absorbed herself in its contents. Presently,\n\u201cMy!\u201d she exclaimed; which startled me, and I ventured to ask her,\nmodestly and respectfully, what was the matter. She courteously\npassed the paper to me and said--pointing with her finger:\n\n\u201cThere--it reads like fact, but I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nIt was very embarrassing. I tried to look at my ease, and\nnonchalantly turned the paper this and that and the other way, but\nher eye was upon me and I felt that I was not succeeding. Pretty\nsoon she asked, hesitatingly:\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t--can\u2019t--you--read?\u201d\n\nI had to confess that I couldn\u2019t. It filled her with wonder. But it\nhad one pleasant effect--it interested her in me, and I was\nthankful, for I was getting lonesome for some one to talk to and\nlisten to. The young fellow who was showing me around--on his own\nmotion, I did not invite him--had missed his appointment at the\nMuseum, and I was feeling disappointed, for he was good company.\nWhen I told the young woman I could not read, she asked me another\nembarrassing question:\n\n\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\n\nI skirmished--to gain time and position. I said:\n\n\u201cMake a guess. See how near you can come.\u201d\n\nShe brightened, and exclaimed:\n\n\u201cI shall dearly like it, sir, if you don\u2019t mind. If I guess right\nwill you tell me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonor bright?\u201d\n\n\u201cHonor bright? What is that?\u201d\n\nShe laughed delightedly and said:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good start! I was _sure_ that that phrase would catch you.\nI know one thing, now, all right. I know----\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat you are not an American. And you aren\u2019t, _are_ you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. You are right. I\u2019m not--honor bright, as you say.\u201d\n\nShe looked immensely pleased with herself, and said:\n\n\u201cI reckon I\u2019m not always smart, but _that_ was smart, anyway. But\nnot so _very_, after all, because I already knew--believed I\nknew--that you were a foreigner, by another sign.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour accent.\u201d\n\nShe was an accurate observer; I do speak English with a heavenly\naccent, and she had detected the foreign twang in it. She ran\ncharmingly on, most na\u00efvely and engagingly pleased with her triumph:\n\n\u201cThe minute you said, \u2018See \u2019ow near you can come to it,\u2019 I said to\nmyself, \u2018Two to one he is a foreigner, and ten to one he\u2019s English.\u2019\nNow that _is_ your nationality, _isn\u2019t_ it?\u201d\n\nI was sorry to spoil her victory, but I had to do it: \u201cAh--you\u2019ll\nhave to guess again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat--you are not an Englishman?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo--honor bright.\u201d\n\nShe looked me searchingly over, evidently communing with\nherself--adding up my points, then she said:\n\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t _look_ like an Englishman, and that is true.\u201d After\na little she added, \u201cThe fact is, you don\u2019t look like _any_\nforeigner--not quite like ... like _anybody_ I\u2019ve seen before. I\nwill guess some more.\u201d\n\nShe guessed every country whose name she could think of and grew\ngradually discouraged. Finally she said:\n\n\u201cYou must be the Man Without a Country--the one the story tells\nabout. You don\u2019t seem to have any nationality at all. How did you\ncome to come to America? Have you any kinfolks here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes--several.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, then you came to see _them_.\u201d\n\n\u201cPartly--yes.\u201d\n\nShe sat awhile, thinking, then:\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to give up quite yet. Where do you live when\nyou are at home--in a city, or in the country?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich do you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t quite know. You _do_ look a little countrified, if\nyou don\u2019t mind my saying it; but you look a little citified,\ntoo--not much, but a little, although you can\u2019t read, which is very\ncurious, and you are not used to newspapers. Now _my_ guess is that\nyou live mainly in the country when you are at home, and not very\nmuch in the city. Is that right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, quite right.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, good! Now I\u2019ll take a fresh start.\u201d\n\nThen she wore herself to the bone, naming cities. No success. Next\nshe wanted me to help her a little with some \u201cpointers,\u201d as she\nphrased it. Was my city large? Yes. Was it very large? Yes. Did they\nhave mobiles there? No. Electric light? No. Railroads, hospitals,\ncolleges, cops? No.\n\n\u201cWhy, then, it\u2019s not civilized! Where _can_ that place be? Be good\nand tell me just one peculiarity of it--then maybe I can guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, just one; it has gates of pearl.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, go along! That\u2019s the New Jerusalem. It isn\u2019t fair to joke.\nNever mind. I\u2019ll guess it yet--it will come into my head pretty\nsoon, just when I\u2019m not expecting it. Oh, I\u2019ve got an idea! Please\ntalk a little in your own language--that\u2019ll be a good pointer.\u201d I\naccommodated her with a sentence or two. She shook her head\ndespondently.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t sound human. I mean, it doesn\u2019t sound\nlike any of these other foreigners. It\u2019s pretty enough--it\u2019s quite\npretty, I think--but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve not heard it before. Maybe if you\nwere to pronounce your name----  What _is_ your name, if you\u2019ll be\nso good?\u201d\n\n\u201cAdam.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdam?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Adam _what_?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is all--just Adam.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing at all but just that? Why, how curious! There\u2019s plenty of\nAdams; how can they tell you from the rest?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that is no trouble. I\u2019m the only one there is, there where I\u2019m\nfrom.\u201d\n\n\u201cUpon my word! Well, it beats the band! It reminds a person of the\nold original. That was his name, too, and he hadn\u2019t any but\nthat--just like you.\u201d Then, archly, \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of him, I\nsuppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes! Do you know him? Have you ever seen him?\u201d\n\n\u201c_Seen_ him? Seen _Adam_? Thanks to goodness, no! It would scare me\ninto fits.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Why_ don\u2019t you see why?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause there is no sense in a person being scared of his kin.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Kin?_\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Isn\u2019t he a distant relative of yours?\u201d\n\nShe thought it was prodigiously funny, and said it was perfectly\ntrue, but _she_ never would have been bright enough to think of it.\nI found it a new and most pleasant sensation to have my wit admired,\nand was about to try to do some more when that young fellow came. He\nplanted himself on the other side of the young woman and began a\nvapid remark about the weather, but she gave him a look that\nwithered him and got stiffly up and wheeled the baby away.\n\n\n\n\n                      BIBLE TEACHING AND RELIGIOUS\n                                PRACTICE\n\n\nReligion had its share in the changes of civilization and national\ncharacter, of course. What share? The lion\u2019s. In the history of the\nhuman race this has always been the case, will always be the case,\nto the end of time, no doubt; or at least until man by the slow\nprocesses of evolution shall develop into something really fine and\nhigh--some billions of years hence, say.\n\nThe Christian\u2019s Bible is a drug store. Its contents remain the same;\nbut the medical practice changes. For eighteen hundred years these\nchanges were slight--scarcely noticeable. The practice was\nallopathic--allopathic in its rudest and crudest form. The dull and\nignorant physician day and night, and all the days and all the\nnights, drenched his patient with vast and hideous doses of the most\nrepulsive drugs to be found in the store\u2019s stock; he bled him,\ncupped him, purged him, puked him, salivated him, never gave his\nsystem a chance to rally, nor nature a chance to help. He kept him\nreligion sick for eighteen centuries, and allowed him not a well day\nduring all that time. The stock in the store was made up of about\nequal portions of baleful and debilitating poisons, and healing and\ncomforting medicines; but the practice of the time confined the\nphysician to the use of the former; by consequence, he could only\ndamage his patient, and that is what he did.\n\nNot until far within our century was any considerable change in the\npractice introduced; and then mainly, or in effect only, in Great\nBritain and the United States. In the other countries to-day, the\npatient either still takes the ancient treatment or does not call\nthe physician at all. In the English-speaking countries the changes\nobservable in our century were forced by that very thing just\nreferred to--the revolt of the patient against the system; they were\nnot projected by the physician. The patient fell to doctoring\nhimself, and the physician\u2019s practice began to fall off. He modified\nhis method to get back his trade. He did it gradually, reluctantly;\nand never yielded more at a time than the pressure compelled. At\nfirst he relinquished the daily dose of hell and damnation, and\nadministered it every other day only; next he allowed another day to\npass; then another and presently another; when he had restricted it\nat last to Sundays, and imagined that now there would surely be a\ntruce, the hom\u0153opath arrived on the field and made him abandon hell\nand damnation altogether, and administered Christ\u2019s love, and\ncomfort, and charity and compassion in its stead. These had been in\nthe drug store all the time, gold labeled and conspicuous among the\nlong shelfloads of repulsive purges and vomits and poisons, and so\nthe practice was to blame that they had remained unused, not the\npharmacy. To the ecclesiastical physician of fifty years ago, his\npredecessor for eighteen centuries was a quack; to the\necclesiastical physician of to-day, his predecessor of fifty years\nago was a quack. To the every-man-his-own-ecclesiastical-doctor\nof--when?--what will the ecclesiastical physician of to-day be?\nUnless evolution, which has been a truth ever since the globes,\nsuns, and planets of the solar system were but wandering films of\nmeteor dust, shall reach a limit and become a lie, there is but one\nfate in store for him.\n\nThe methods of the priest and the parson have been very curious,\ntheir history is very entertaining. In all the ages the Roman Church\nhas owned slaves, bought and sold slaves, authorized and encouraged\nher children to trade in them. Long after some Christian peoples had\nfreed their slaves the Church still held on to hers. If any could\nknow, to absolute certainty, that all this was right, and according\nto God\u2019s will and desire, surely it was she, since she was God\u2019s\nspecially appointed representative in the earth and sole authorized\nand infallible expounder of his Bible. There were the texts; there\nwas no mistaking their meaning; she was right, she was doing in this\nthing what the Bible had mapped out for her to do. So unassailable\nwas her position that in all the centuries she had no word to say\nagainst human slavery. Yet now at last, in our immediate day, we\nhear a Pope saying slave trading is wrong, and we see him sending an\nexpedition to Africa to stop it. The texts remain: it is the\npractice that has changed. Why? Because the world has corrected the\nBible. The Church never corrects it; and also never fails to drop in\nat the tail of the procession--and take the credit of the\ncorrection. As she will presently do in this instance.\n\nChristian England supported slavery and encouraged it for two\nhundred and fifty years, and her Church\u2019s consecrated ministers\nlooked on, sometimes taking an active hand, the rest of the time\nindifferent. England\u2019s interest in the business may be called a\nChristian interest, a Christian industry. She had her full share in\nits revival after a long period of inactivity, and this revival was\na Christian monopoly; that is to say, it was in the hands of\nChristian countries exclusively. English parliaments aided the slave\ntraffic and protected it; two English kings held stock in\nslave-catching companies. The first regular English slave\nhunter--John Hawkins, of still revered memory--made such successful\nhavoc, on his second voyage, in the matter of surprising and burning\nvillages, and maiming, slaughtering, capturing, and selling their\nunoffending inhabitants, that his delighted queen conferred the\nchivalric honor of knighthood on him--a rank which had acquired its\nchief esteem and distinction in other and earlier fields of\nChristian effort. The new knight, with characteristic English\nfrankness and brusque simplicity, chose as his device the figure of\na negro slave, kneeling and in chains. Sir John\u2019s work was the\ninvention of Christians, was to remain a bloody and awful monopoly\nin the hands of Christians for a quarter of a millennium, was to\ndestroy homes, separate families, enslave friendless men and women,\nand break a myriad of human hearts, to the end that Christian\nnations might be prosperous and comfortable, Christian churches be\nbuilt, and the gospel of the meek and merciful Redeemer be spread\nabroad in the earth; and so in the name of his ship, unsuspected but\neloquent and clear, lay hidden prophecy. She was called _The Jesus_.\n\nBut at last in England, an illegitimate Christian rose against\nslavery. It is curious that when a Christian rises against a rooted\nwrong at all, he is usually an illegitimate Christian, member of\nsome despised and bastard sect. There was a bitter struggle, but in\nthe end the slave trade had to go--and went. The Biblical\nauthorization remained, but the practice changed.\n\nThen--the usual thing happened; the visiting English critic among us\nbegan straightway to hold up his pious hands in horror at our\nslavery. His distress was unappeasable, his words full of bitterness\nand contempt. It is true we had not so many as fifteen hundred\nthousand slaves for him to worry about, while his England still\nowned twelve millions, in her foreign possessions; but that fact did\nnot modify his wail any, or stay his tears, or soften his censure.\nThe fact that every time we had tried to get rid of our slavery in\nprevious generations, but had always been obstructed, balked, and\ndefeated by England, was a matter of no consequence to him; it was\nancient history, and not worth the telling.\n\nOur own conversion came at last. We began to stir against slavery.\nHearts grew soft, here, there, and yonder. There was no place in the\nland where the seeker could not find some small budding sign of pity\nfor the slave. No place in all the land but one--the pulpit. It\nyielded at last; it always does. It fought a strong and stubborn\nfight, and then did what it always does, joined the procession--at\nthe tail end. Slavery fell. The slavery text remained; the practice\nchanged, that was all.\n\nDuring many ages there were witches. The Bible said so. The Bible\ncommanded that they should not be allowed to live. Therefore the\nChurch, after doing its duty in but a lazy and indolent way for\neight hundred years, gathered up its halters, thumb-screws, and\nfirebrands, and set about its holy work in earnest. She worked hard\nat it night and day during nine centuries and imprisoned, tortured,\nhanged, and burned whole hordes and armies of witches, and washed\nthe Christian world clean with their foul blood.\n\nThen it was discovered that there was no such thing as witches, and\nnever had been. One does not know whether to laugh or to cry. Who\ndiscovered that there was no such thing as a witch--the priest, the\nparson? No, these never discover anything. At Salem, the parson\nclung pathetically to his witch text after the laity had abandoned\nit in remorse and tears for the crimes and cruelties it has\npersuaded them to do. The parson wanted more blood, more shame, more\nbrutalities; it was the unconsecrated laity that stayed his hand. In\nScotland the parson killed the witch after the magistrate had\npronounced her innocent; and when the merciful legislature proposed\nto sweep the hideous laws against witches from the statute book, it\nwas the parson who came imploring, with tears and imprecations, that\nthey be suffered to stand.\n\nThere are no witches. The witch text remains; only the practice has\nchanged. Hell fire is gone, but the text remains. Infant damnation\nis gone, but the text remains. More than two hundred death penalties\nare gone from the law books, but the texts that authorized them\nremain.\n\nIs it not well worthy of note that of all the multitude of texts\nthrough which man has driven his annihilating pen he has never once\nmade the mistake of obliterating a good and useful one? It does\ncertainly seem to suggest that if man continues in the direction of\nenlightenment, his religious practice may, in the end, attain some\nsemblance of human decency.\n\n\n\n\n                             THE WAR PRAYER\n                           (Dictated 1904-05)\n\n\nIt was a time of great and exalting excitement. The country was up\nin arms, the war was on, in every breast burned the holy fire of\npatriotism; the drums were beating, the bands playing, the toy\npistols popping, the bunched firecrackers hissing and spluttering;\non every hand and far down the receding and fading spread of roofs\nand balconies a fluttering wilderness of flags flashed in the sun;\ndaily the young volunteers marched down the wide avenue gay and fine\nin their new uniforms, the proud fathers and mothers and sisters and\nsweethearts cheering them with voices choked with happy emotion as\nthey swung by; nightly the packed mass meetings listened, panting,\nto patriot oratory which stirred the deepest deeps of their hearts,\nand which they interrupted at briefest intervals with cyclones of\napplause, the tears running down their cheeks the while; in the\nchurches the pastors preached devotion to flag and country, and\ninvoked the God of Battles, beseeching His aid in our good cause in\noutpouring of fervid eloquence which moved every listener. It was\nindeed a glad and gracious time, and the half dozen rash spirits\nthat ventured to disapprove of the war and cast a doubt upon its\nrighteousness straightway got such a stern and angry warning that\nfor their personal safety\u2019s sake they quickly shrank out of sight\nand offended no more in that way.\n\nSunday morning came--next day the battalions would leave for the\nfront; the church was filled; the volunteers were there, their young\nfaces alight with martial dreams--visions of the stern advance, the\ngathering momentum, the rushing charge, the flashing sabers, the\nflight of the foe, the tumult, the enveloping smoke, the fierce\npursuit, the surrender!--them home from the war, bronzed heroes,\nwelcomed, adored, submerged in golden seas of glory! With the\nvolunteers sat their dear ones, proud, happy, and envied by the\nneighbors and friends who had no sons and brothers to send forth to\nthe field of honor, there to win for the flag, or, failing, die the\nnoblest of noble deaths. The service proceeded; a war chapter from\nthe Old Testament was read; the first prayer was said; it was\nfollowed by an organ burst that shook the building, and with one\nimpulse the house rose, with glowing eyes and beating hearts, and\npoured out that tremendous invocation--\n\n           \u201cGod the all-terrible! Thou who ordainest,\n           Thunder thy clarion and lightning thy sword!\u201d\n\nThen came the \u201clong\u201d prayer. None could remember the like of it for\npassionate pleading and moving and beautiful language. The burden of\nits supplication was, that an ever-merciful and benignant Father of\nus all would watch over our noble young soldiers, and aid, comfort,\nand encourage them in their patriotic work; bless them, shield them\nin the day of battle and the hour of peril, bear them in His mighty\nhand, make them strong and confident, invincible in the bloody\nonset; help them to crush the foe, grant to them and to their flag\nand country imperishable honor and glory--\n\nAn aged stranger entered and moved with slow and noiseless step up\nthe main aisle, his eyes fixed upon the minister, his long body\nclothed in a robe that reached to his feet, his head bare, his white\nhair descending in a frothy cataract to his shoulders, his seamy\nface unnaturally pale, pale even to ghastliness. With all eyes\nfollowing him and wondering, he made his silent way; without\npausing, he ascended to the preacher\u2019s side and stood there,\nwaiting. With shut lids the preacher, unconscious of his presence,\ncontinued his moving prayer, and at last finished it with the words,\nuttered in fervent appeal, \u201cBless our arms, grant us the victory, O\nLord our God, Father and Protector of our land and flag!\u201d\n\nThe stranger touched his arm, motioned him to step aside--which the\nstartled minister did--and took his place. During some moments he\nsurveyed the spellbound audience with solemn eyes, in which burned\nan uncanny light; then in a deep voice he said:\n\n\u201cI come from the Throne--bearing a message from Almighty God!\u201d The\nwords smote the house with a shock; if the stranger perceived it he\ngave no attention. \u201cHe has heard the prayer of His servant your\nshepherd, and will grant it if such shall be your desire after I,\nHis messenger, shall have explained to you its import--that is to\nsay, its full import. For it is like unto many of the prayers of\nmen, in that it asks for more than he who utters it is aware\nof--except he pause and think.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s servant and yours has prayed his prayer. Has he paused and\ntaken thought? Is it one prayer? No, it is two--one uttered, the\nother not. Both have reached the ear of Him Who heareth all\nsupplications, the spoken and the unspoken. Ponder this--keep it in\nmind. If you would beseech a blessing upon yourself, beware! lest\nwithout intent you invoke a curse upon a neighbor at the same time.\nIf you pray for the blessing of rain upon your crop which needs it,\nby that act you are possibly praying for a curse upon some\nneighbor\u2019s crop which may not need rain and can be injured by it.\n\n\u201cYou have heard your servant\u2019s prayer--the uttered part of it. I am\ncommissioned of God to put into words the other part of it--that\npart which the pastor--and also you in your hearts--fervently prayed\nsilently. And ignorantly and unthinkingly? God grant that it was so!\nYou heard these words: \u2018Grant us the victory, O Lord our God!\u2019 That\nis sufficient. The _whole_ of the uttered prayer is compact into\nthose pregnant words. Elaborations were not necessary. When you have\nprayed for victory you have prayed for many unmentioned results\nwhich follow victory--_must_ follow it, cannot help but follow it.\nUpon the listening spirit of God the Father fell also the unspoken\npart of the prayer. He commandeth me to put it into words. Listen!\n\n\u201cO Lord our Father, our young patriots, idols of our hearts, go\nforth to battle--be Thou near them! With them--in spirit--we also go\nforth from the sweet peace of our beloved firesides to smite the\nfoe. O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds\nwith our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale\nforms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the\nguns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to\nlay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to\nwring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief;\nhelp us to turn them out roofless with their little children to\nwander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and\nhunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames of summer and the icy\nwinds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee\nfor the refuge of the grave and denied it--for our sakes who adore\nThee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their\nbitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way with\ntheir tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded\nfeet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source of\nLove, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that are\nsore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen.\u201d\n\n(_After a pause._) \u201cYe have prayed it; if ye still desire it, speak!\nThe messenger of the Most High waits.\u201d\n\nIt was believed afterward that the man was a lunatic, because there\nwas no sense in what he said.\n\n\n\n\n                           CORN-PONE OPINIONS\n                           (Written in 1900)\n\n\nFifty years ago, when I was a boy of fifteen and helping to inhabit\na Missourian village on the banks of the Mississippi, I had a friend\nwhose society was very dear to me because I was forbidden by my\nmother to partake of it. He was a gay and impudent and satirical and\ndelightful young black man--a slave--who daily preached sermons from\nthe top of his master\u2019s woodpile, with me for sole audience. He\nimitated the pulpit style of the several clergymen of the village,\nand did it well, and with fine passion and energy. To me he was a\nwonder. I believed he was the greatest orator in the United States\nand would some day be heard from. But it did not happen; in the\ndistribution of rewards he was overlooked. It is the way, in this\nworld.\n\nHe interrupted his preaching, now and then, to saw a stick of wood;\nbut the sawing was a pretense--he did it with his mouth; exactly\nimitating the sound the bucksaw makes in shrieking its way through\nthe wood. But it served its purpose; it kept his master from coming\nout to see how the work was getting along. I listened to the sermons\nfrom the open window of a lumber room at the back of the house. One\nof his texts was this:\n\n\u201cYou tell me whar a man gits his corn pone, en I\u2019ll tell you what\nhis \u2019pinions is.\u201c\n\nI can never forget it. It was deeply impressed upon me. By my\nmother. Not upon my memory, but elsewhere. She had slipped in upon\nme while I was absorbed and not watching. The black philosopher\u2019s\nidea was that a man is not independent, and cannot afford views\nwhich might interfere with his bread and butter. If he would\nprosper, he must train with the majority; in matters of large\nmoment, like politics and religion, he must think and feel with the\nbulk of his neighbors, or suffer damage in his social standing and\nin his business prosperities. He must restrict himself to corn-pone\nopinions--at least on the surface. He must get his opinions from\nother people; he must reason out none for himself; he must have no\nfirst-hand views.\n\nI think Jerry was right, in the main, but I think he did not go far\nenough.\n\n1. It was his idea that a man conforms to the majority view of his\nlocality by calculation and intention.\n\nThis happens, but I think it is not the rule.\n\n2. It was his idea that there is such a thing as a first-hand\nopinion; an original opinion; an opinion which is coldly reasoned\nout in a man\u2019s head, by a searching analysis of the facts involved,\nwith the heart unconsulted, and the jury room closed against outside\ninfluences. It may be that such an opinion has been born somewhere,\nat some time or other, but I suppose it got away before they could\ncatch it and stuff it and put it in the museum.\n\nI am persuaded that a coldly-thought-out and independent verdict\nupon a fashion in clothes, or manners, or literature, or politics,\nor religion, or any other matter that is projected into the field of\nour notice and interest, is a most rare thing--if it has indeed ever\nexisted.\n\nA new thing in costume appears--the flaring hoopskirt, for\nexample--and the passers-by are shocked, and the irreverent laugh.\nSix months later everybody is reconciled; the fashion has\nestablished itself; it is admired, now, and no one laughs. Public\nopinion resented it before, public opinion accepts it now, and is\nhappy in it. Why? Was the resentment reasoned out? Was the\nacceptance reasoned out? No. The instinct that moves to conformity\ndid the work. It is our nature to conform; it is a force which not\nmany can successfully resist. What is its seat? The inborn\nrequirement of self-approval. We all have to bow to that; there are\nno exceptions. Even the woman who refuses from first to last to wear\nthe hoopskirt comes under that law and is its slave; she could not\nwear the skirt and have her own approval; and that she _must_ have,\nshe cannot help herself. But as a rule our self-approval has its\nsource in but one place and not elsewhere--the approval of other\npeople. A person of vast consequences can introduce any kind of\nnovelty in dress and the general world will presently adopt\nit--moved to do it, in the first place, by the natural instinct to\npassively yield to that vague something recognized as authority, and\nin the second place by the human instinct to train with the\nmultitude and have its approval. An empress introduced the\nhoopskirt, and we know the result. A nobody introduced the bloomer,\nand we know the result. If Eve should come again, in her ripe\nrenown, and reintroduce her quaint styles--well, we know what would\nhappen. And we should be cruelly embarrassed, along at first.\n\nThe hoopskirt runs its course and disappears. Nobody reasons about\nit. One woman abandons the fashion; her neighbor notices this and\nfollows her lead; this influences the next woman; and so on and so\non, and presently the skirt has vanished out of the world, no one\nknows how nor why; nor cares, for that matter. It will come again,\nby and by; and in due course will go again.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, in England, six or eight wine glasses stood\ngrouped by each person\u2019s plate at a dinner party, and they were\nused, not left idle and empty; to-day there are but three or four in\nthe group, and the average guest sparingly uses about two of them.\nWe have not adopted this new fashion yet, but we shall do it\npresently. We shall not think it out; we shall merely conform, and\nlet it go at that. We get our notions and habits and opinions from\noutside influences; we do not have to study them out.\n\nOur table manners, and company manners, and street manners change\nfrom time to time, but the changes are not reasoned out; we merely\nnotice and conform. We are creatures of outside influences; as a\nrule we do not think, we only imitate. We cannot invent standards\nthat will stick; what we mistake for standards are only fashions,\nand perishable. We may continue to admire them, but we drop the use\nof them. We notice this in literature. Shakespeare is a standard,\nand fifty years ago we used to write tragedies which we couldn\u2019t\ntell from--from somebody else\u2019s; but we don\u2019t do it any more, now.\nOur prose standard, three quarters of a century ago, was ornate and\ndiffuse; some authority or other changed it in the direction of\ncompactness and simplicity, and conformity followed, without\nargument. The historical novel starts up suddenly, and sweeps the\nland. Everybody writes one, and the nation is glad. We had\nhistorical novels before; but nobody read them, and the rest of us\nconformed--without reasoning it out. We are conforming in the other\nway, now, because it is another case of everybody.\n\nThe outside influences are always pouring in upon us, and we are\nalways obeying their orders and accepting their verdicts. The Smiths\nlike the new play; the Joneses go to see it, and they copy the Smith\nverdict. Morals, religions, politics, get their following from\nsurrounding influences and atmospheres, almost entirely; not from\nstudy, not from thinking. A man must and will have his own approval\nfirst of all, in each and every moment and circumstance of his\nlife--even if he must repent of a self-approved act the moment after\nits commission, in order to get his self-approval _again_: but,\nspeaking in general terms, a man\u2019s self-approval in the large\nconcerns of life has its source in the approval of the peoples about\nhim, and not in a searching personal examination of the matter.\nMohammedans are Mohammedans because they are born and reared among\nthat sect, not because they have thought it out and can furnish\nsound reasons for being Mohammedans; we know why Catholics are\nCatholics; why Presbyterians are Presbyterians; why Baptists are\nBaptists; why Mormons are Mormons; why thieves are thieves; why\nmonarchists are monarchists; why Republicans are Republicans and\nDemocrats, Democrats. We know it is a matter of association and\nsympathy, not reasoning and examination; that hardly a man in the\nworld has an opinion upon morals, politics, or religion which he got\notherwise than through his associations and sympathies. Broadly\nspeaking, there are none but corn-pone opinions. And broadly\nspeaking, corn-pone stands for self-approval. Self-approval is\nacquired mainly from the approval of other people. The result is\nconformity. Sometimes conformity has a sordid business interest--the\nbread-and-butter interest--but not in most cases, I think. I think\nthat in the majority of cases it is unconscious and not calculated;\nthat it is born of the human being\u2019s natural yearning to stand well\nwith his fellows and have their inspiring approval and praise--a\nyearning which is commonly so strong and so insistent that it cannot\nbe effectually resisted, and must have its way.\n\nA political emergency brings out the corn-pone opinion in fine force\nin its two chief varieties--the pocketbook variety, which has its\norigin in self-interest, and the bigger variety, the sentimental\nvariety--the one which can\u2019t bear to be outside the pale; can\u2019t bear\nto be in disfavor; can\u2019t endure the averted face and the cold\nshoulder; wants to stand well with his friends, wants to be smiled\nupon, wants to be welcome, wants to hear the precious words, \u201c_He\u2019s_\non the right track!\u201d Uttered, perhaps by an ass, but still an ass of\nhigh degree, an ass whose approval is gold and diamonds to a smaller\nass, and confers glory and honor and happiness, and membership in\nthe herd. For these gauds many a man will dump his life-long\nprinciples into the street, and his conscience along with them. We\nhave seen it happen. In some millions of instances.\n\nMen think they think upon great political questions, and they do;\nbut they think with their party, not independently; they read its\nliterature, but not that of the other side; they arrive at\nconvictions, but they are drawn from a partial view of the matter in\nhand and are of no particular value. They swarm with their party,\nthey feel with their party, they are happy in their party\u2019s\napproval; and where the party leads they will follow, whether for\nright and honor, or through blood and dirt and a mush of mutilated\nmorals.\n\nIn our late canvass half of the nation passionately believed that in\nsilver lay salvation, the other half as passionately believed that\nthat way lay destruction. Do you believe that a tenth part of the\npeople, on either side, had any rational excuse for having an\nopinion about the matter at all? I studied that mighty question to\nthe bottom--came out empty. Half of our people passionately believe\nin high tariff, the other half believe otherwise. Does this mean\nstudy and examination, or only feeling? The latter, I think. I have\ndeeply studied that question, too--and didn\u2019t arrive. We all do no\nend of feeling, and we mistake it for thinking. And out of it we get\nan aggregation which we consider a boon. Its name is Public Opinion.\nIt is held in reverence. It settles everything.

This often insures brevity.\u201d\n\nAccepting the above as gospel (as necessarily we must, in this book,)\none is only required here to furnish a few more or less plausible\nexcuses for its existence. Very well, then, we can think of two:\n\nFirst: To prove to those who have read Mark Twain sparingly, or know him\nmainly from hearsay, that he was something more than a mere fun-maker.\n\nSecond: To provide for those who have read largely of his work something\nof its essence, as it were\u2014put up in a form which may be found\nconvenient when one has not time, or inclination, to search the volumes.\n\nThese are the excuses\u2014now, an added word as to method: The examples have\nbeen arranged chronologically, so that the reader, following them in\norder, may note the author\u2019s evolution\u2014the development of his humor, his\nobservation, his philosophy and his literary style. They have been\nselected with some care, in the hope that those who know the author best\nmay consider him fairly represented.\n\nFeeling now that this little volume is sufficiently explained, the\ncompiler begs to offer it, without further extenuation, to all who do\nhonor to the memory of our foremost laughing philosopher.\n\n\n\n\n                                                            MOMENTS WITH\n                                                            MARK TWAIN\n                                                                \u2756\n\n\n\n\n                _FROM_ \u201cSKETCHES NEW AND OLD\u201d (1865\u201367)\n\n\n                       ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS\n\n\u201cMoral Statistician.\u201d\u2014I don\u2019t want any of your statistics; I took your\nwhole batch and lit my pipe with it. I hate your kind of people. You are\nalways ciphering out how much a man\u2019s health is injured, and how much\nhis intellect is impaired, and how many pitiful dollars and cents he\nwastes in the course of ninety-two years\u2019 indulgence in the fatal\npractice of smoking; and in the equally fatal practice of drinking\ncoffee; and in playing billiards occasionally; and in taking a glass of\nwine at dinner, etc., etc., etc. And you are always figuring out how\nmany women have been burned to death because of the dangerous fashion of\nwearing expansive hoops, etc., etc., etc. You never see more than one\nside of the question. You are blind to the fact that most old men in\nAmerica smoke, and drink coffee, although, according to your theory,\nthey ought to have died young; and that hearty old Englishmen drink wine\nand survive it, and portly old Dutchmen both drink and smoke freely, and\nyet grow older and fatter all the time. And you never try to find out\nhow much solid comfort, relaxation, and enjoyment a man derives from\nsmoking in the course of a lifetime (which is worth ten times the money\nhe would save by letting it alone), nor the appalling aggregate of\nhappiness lost in a lifetime by your kind of people from _not_ smoking.\nOf course you can save money by denying yourself all those little\nvicious enjoyments for fifty years; but then what can you do with it?\nWhat use can you put it to? Money can\u2019t save your infinitesimal soul.\nAll the use that money can be put to is to purchase comfort and\nenjoyment in this life; therefore, as you are an enemy to comfort and\nenjoyment, where is the use of accumulating cash? It won\u2019t do for you to\nsay that you can use it to better purpose in furnishing a good table,\nand in charities, and in supporting tract societies, because you know\nyourself that you people who have no petty vices are never known to give\naway a cent, and that you stint yourselves so in the matter of food that\nyou are always feeble and hungry. And you never dare to laugh in the\ndaytime for fear some poor wretch, seeing you in a good humor, will try\nto borrow a dollar of you; and in church you are always down on your\nknees, with your eyes buried in the cushion, when the contribution box\ncomes around; and you never give the revenue officers a full statement\nof your income. Now you know all these things yourself, don\u2019t you? Very\nwell, then, what is the use of your stringing out your miserable lives\nto a lean and withered old age? What is the use of your saving money\nthat is so utterly worthless to you? In a word, why don\u2019t you go off\nsomewhere and die, and not be always trying to seduce people into\nbecoming as \u201cornery\u201d and unloveable as you are yourselves, by your\nvillainous \u201cmoral statistics\u201d? Now I don\u2019t approve of dissipation, and I\ndon\u2019t indulge in it, either; but I haven\u2019t a particle of confidence in a\nman who has no redeeming petty vices, and so I don\u2019t want to hear from\nyou any more. I think you are the very same man who read me a long\nlecture last week about the degrading vice of smoking cigars, and then\ncame back, in my absence, with your reprehensible fireproof gloves on,\nand carried off my beautiful parlor stove.\n\n\u201cYoung Author.\u201d\u2014Yes, Agassiz _does_ recommend authors to eat fish,\nbecause the phosphorus in it makes brain. So far you are correct. But I\ncannot help you to a decision about the amount you need to eat\u2014at least,\nnot with certainty. If the specimen composition you send is about your\nfair usual average, I should judge that perhaps a couple of whales would\nbe all you would want for the present. Not the largest kind, but simply\ngood, middling-sized whales.\n\n\n                   HOW I EDITED AN AGRICULTURAL PAPER\n\nIn about half an hour an old gentleman, with a flowing beard and a fine\nbut rather austere face, entered, and sat down at my invitation. He\nseemed to have something on his mind. He took off his hat and set it on\nthe floor, and got out of it a red silk handkerchief and a copy of our\npaper.\n\nHe put the paper on his lap, and while he polished his spectacles with\nhis handkerchief, he said, \u201cAre you the new editor?\u201d\n\nI said I was.\n\n\u201cHave you ever edited an agricultural paper before?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said; \u201cthis is my first attempt.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery likely. Have you had any experience in agriculture, practically?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo; I believe I have not.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome instinct told me,\u201d said the old gentleman, putting on his\nspectacles and looking over them at me with asperity, while he folded\nhis paper into a convenient shape. \u201cI wish to read you what must have\nmade me have that instinct. It was this editorial. Listen, and see if it\nwas you that wrote it:\n\n\u201cTurnips should never be pulled, it injures them. It is much better to\nsend a boy up and let him shake the tree.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, what do you think of that?\u2014for I really suppose you wrote it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThink of it? Why, I think it is good. I think it is sense. I have no\ndoubt that every year millions and millions of bushels of turnips are\nspoiled in this township alone by being pulled in a half-ripe condition,\nwhen, if they had sent a boy up to shake the tree\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShake your grandmother! Turnips don\u2019t grow on trees!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, they don\u2019t don\u2019t they? Well, who said they did? The language was\nintended to be figurative, wholly figurative. Anybody that knows\nanything will know that I meant that the boy should shake the vine.\u201d\n\nThen this old person got up and tore his paper all into small shreds,\nand stamped on them, and broke several things with his cane, and said I\ndid not know as much as a cow; and then went out and banged the door\nafter him, and, in short, acted in such a way that I fancied he was\ndispleased about something. But not knowing what the trouble was, I\ncould not be any help to him.\n\n\n\n\n                _FROM_ \u201cTHE INNOCENTS ABROAD\u201d (1867\u201368)\n\n\n                          ON KEEPING A JOURNAL\n\nAt certain periods it becomes the dearest ambition of a man to keep a\nfaithful record of his performances, in a book; and he dashes at his\nwork with an enthusiasm that imposes on him the notion that keeping a\njournal is the veriest pastime in the world, and the pleasantest. But if\nhe only lives twenty-one days, he will find out that only those rare\nnatures that are made up of pluck, endurance, devotion to duty for\nduty\u2019s sake, and invincible determination, may hope to venture upon so\ntremendous an enterprise as the keeping of a journal and not sustain a\nshameful defeat.... If you wish to inflict a heartless and malignant\npunishment upon a young person, pledge him to keep a journal a year.\n\n\n                      THE \u201cQUAKER CITY\u201d IN A STORM\n\nAnd the last night of the seven was the stormiest of all. There was no\nthunder, no noise but the pounding bows of the ship, the keen whistling\nof the gale through the cordage, and the rush of the seething waters.\nBut the vessel climbed aloft as if she would climb to heaven\u2014then paused\nan instant that seemed a century, and plunged headlong down again, as\nfrom a precipice. The sheeted sprays drenched the decks like rain. The\nblackness of darkness was everywhere. At long intervals a flash of\nlightning clove it with a quivering line of fire, that revealed a\nheaving world of water where was nothing before, kindled the dusky\ncordage to glittering silver, and lit up the faces of the men with a\nghastly lustre!\n\nFear drove many on deck that were used to avoiding the night winds and\nthe spray. Some thought the vessel could not live through the night, and\nit seemed less dreadful to stand out in the midst of the wild tempest\nand _see_ the peril that threatened than to be shut up in the sepulchral\ncabins, under the dim lamps, and imagine the horrors that were abroad on\nthe ocean. And once out\u2014once where they could see the ship struggling in\nthe strong grasp of the storm\u2014once where they could hear the shriek of\nthe winds, and face the driving spray and look out upon the majestic\npicture the lightnings disclosed, they were prisoners to a fierce\nfascination they could not resist, and so remained. It was a wild\nnight\u2014and a very, very long one.\n\n\n                         THE BEAUTIFUL STRANGER\n\nWhile we stood admiring the cloud-capped peaks and the lowlands robed in\nmisty gloom, a finer picture burst upon us and chained every eye like a\nmagnet\u2014a stately ship, with canvas piled on canvas till she was one\ntowering mass of bellying sail. She came speeding over the sea like a\ngreat bird. Africa and Spain were forgotten. All homage was for the\nbeautiful stranger. While everybody gazed, she swept superbly by and\nflung the Stars and Stripes to the breeze! Quicker than thought hats and\nhandkerchiefs flashed in the air, and a cheer went up! She was beautiful\nbefore\u2014she was radiant now. Many a one on her decks knew then for the\nfirst time how tame a sight his country\u2019s flag is at home compared with\nwhat it is in a foreign land. To see it is to see a vision of home\nitself and all its idols, and feel a thrill that would stir a very river\nof sluggish blood!\n\n\n                                TANGIER\n\nWhat a funny old town it is! It seems like profanation to laugh and jest\nand bandy the frivolous chat of our day amid its hoary relics. Only the\nstately phraseology and the measured speech of the sons of the Prophet\nare suited to a venerable antiquity like this. Here is a crumbling wall\nthat was old when Columbus discovered America; was old when Peter the\nHermit roused the knightly men of the Middle Ages to arm for the first\nCrusade; was old when Charlemagne and his paladins beleaguered enchanted\ncastles and battled with giants and genii in the fabled days of the\nolden time; was old when Christ and his disciples walked the earth;\nstood where it stands to-day when the lips of Memnon were vocal, and men\nbought and sold in the streets of ancient Thebes!\n\n\n                           AMERICAN BEAUTIES\n\nI will conclude this chapter with a remark that I am sincerely proud to\nbe able to make\u2014and glad, as well, that my comrades cordially indorse\nit, to wit: by far the handsomest women we have seen in France were born\nand reared in America.\n\nI feel, now, like a man who has redeemed a failing reputation and shed\nluster upon a dimmed escutcheon, by a single just deed done at the\neleventh hour.\n\nLet the curtain fall, to slow music.\n\n\n                            AN EARLY MEMORY\n\nIt is hard to forget repulsive things. I remember yet how I ran off from\nschool once when I was a boy, and then, pretty late at night, concluded\nto climb into the window of my father\u2019s office and sleep on a lounge,\nbecause I had a delicacy about going home and getting thrashed. As I lay\non the lounge and my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, I fancied I\ncould see a long, dusky, shapeless thing stretched upon the floor. A\ncold shiver went through me. I turned my face to the wall. That did not\nanswer. I was afraid that the thing would creep over and seize me in the\ndark. I turned back and stared at it for minutes and minutes\u2014they seemed\nhours. It appeared to me that the lagging moonlight never, never would\nget to it. I turned to the wall and counted twenty, to pass the feverish\ntime away. I looked\u2014the pale square was nearer. I turned again and\ncounted fifty\u2014it was almost touching it. With desperate will I turned\nagain and counted one hundred, and faced about, all in a tremble. A\nwhite human hand lay in the moonlight! Such an awful sinking at the\nheart\u2014such a sudden gasp for breath. I felt\u2014I cannot tell _what_ I felt.\nWhen I recovered strength enough, I faced the wall again. But no boy\ncould have remained so, with that mysterious hand behind him. I counted\nagain, and looked\u2014the most of a naked arm was exposed. I put my hands\nover my eyes and counted until I could stand it no longer, and then\u2014the\npallid face of a man was there, with the corners of the mouth drawn\ndown, and the eyes fixed and glassy in death! I raised to a sitting\nposture and glowered on the corpse till the light crept down the bare\nbreast,\u2014line by line\u2014inch by inch\u2014past the nipple,\u2014and then it disclosed\na ghastly stab!\n\nI went away from there. I do not say that I went away in any sort of a\nhurry, but I simply went\u2014\u2014that is sufficient. I went out at the window,\nand I carried the sash along with me. I did not need the sash, but it\nwas handier to take it than it was to leave it, and so I took it. I was\nnot scared, but I was considerably agitated.\n\nWhen I reached home, they whipped me, but I enjoyed it. It seemed\nperfectly delightful. That man had been stabbed near the office that\nafternoon, and they carried him in there to doctor him, but he only\nlived an hour. I have slept in the same room with him often, since\nthen\u2014in my dreams.\n\n\n                        AT THE AMBROSIAN LIBRARY\n\nWe saw a manuscript of Virgil, with annotations in the handwriting of\nPetrarch, the gentleman who loved another man\u2019s Laura, and lavished upon\nher all through life a love which was a clear waste of the raw material.\nIt was sound sentiment, but bad judgment. It brought both parties fame,\nand created a fountain of commiseration for them in sentimental breasts\nthat is running yet. But who says a word in behalf of poor Mr. Laura? (I\ndo not know his other name.) Who glorifies him? Who bedews him with\ntears? Who writes poetry about him? Nobody. How do you suppose _he_\nliked the state of things that has given the world so much pleasure?...\nLet the world go on fretting about Laura and Petrarch if it will; but as\nfor me, my tears and my lamentations shall be lavished upon the unsung\ndefendant.\n\nWe saw also an autograph letter of Lucrezia Borgia, a lady for whom I\nhave always entertained the highest respect, on account of her rare\nhistrionic capabilities, her opulence in solid gold goblets made of\ngilded wood, her high distinction as an operatic screamer, and the\nfacility with which she could order a sextuple funeral and get the\ncorpses ready for it. We saw one single coarse yellow hair from\nLucrezia\u2019s head, likewise. It awoke emotions, but we still live. In this\nsame library we saw some drawings by Michael Angelo (these Italians call\nhim Mickel Angelo), and Leonardo da Vinci. (They spell it Vinci and\npronounce it Vinchy; foreigners always spell better than they\npronounce.) We reserve our opinion of these sketches.\n\n\n                           OUR NEED OF REPOSE\n\nJust in this one matter lies the main charm of life in Europe\u2014comfort.\nIn America, we hurry\u2014which is well; but when the day\u2019s work is done, we\ngo on thinking of losses and gains, we plan for the morrow, we even\ncarry our business cares to bed with us, and toss and worry over them\nwhen we ought to be restoring our racked bodies and brains with sleep.\nWe burn up our energies with these excitements, and either die early or\ndrop into a lean and mean old age at a time of life which they call a\nman\u2019s prime in Europe. When an acre of ground has produced long and\nwell, we let it lie fallow and rest for a season; we take no man clear\nacross the continent in the same coach he started in\u2014the coach is\nstabled somewhere on the plains and its heated machinery allowed to cool\nfor a few days; when a razor has seen long service and refuses to hold\nan edge, the barber lays it away for a few weeks, and the edge comes\nback of its own accord. We bestow thoughtful care upon inanimate\nobjects, but none upon ourselves. What a robust people, what a nation of\nthinkers we might be, if we would only lay ourselves on the shelf\noccasionally, and renew our edges!\n\nI do envy these Europeans the comfort they take. When the work of the\nday is done, they forget it.\n\n\n                                 VENICE\n\nIt was a long, long ride. But toward evening, as we sat silent and\nhardly conscious of where we were\u2014subdued into that meditative calm that\ncomes so surely after a conversational storm\u2014some one shouted:\n\n\u201cVENICE!\u201d\n\nAnd sure enough, afloat on the placid sea a league away, lay a great\ncity with its towers and domes and steeples drowsing in a golden midst\nof sunset.\n\nThe venerable Mother of the Republics is scarce a fit subject for\nflippant speech or the idle gossiping of tourists. It seems a sort of\nsacrilege to disturb the glamour of old romance that pictures her to us\nsoftly from afar off as through a tinted mist, and curtains her ruin and\nher desolation from our view. One ought, indeed, to turn away from her\nrags, her poverty, and her humiliation, and think of her only as she was\nwhen she sunk the fleets of Charlemagne; when she humbled Frederick\nBarbarossa or waved her victorious banners above the battlements of\nConstantinople.\n\nThere was music everywhere\u2014choruses, string bands, brass bands, flutes,\neverything. I was so surrounded, walled in with music, magnificence, and\nloveliness, that I became inspired with the spirit of the scene, and\nsang one tune myself. However, when I observed that the other gondolas\nhad sailed away, and my gondolier was preparing to go overboard, I\nstopped.\n\nIn the glare of the day, there is little poetry about Venice, but under\nthe charitable moon her stained palaces are white again, their battered\nsculptures are hidden in shadows, and the old city seems crowned once\nmore with the grandeur that was hers five hundred years ago. It is easy,\nthen, in fancy, to people these silent canals with plumed gallants and\nfair ladies\u2014with Shylocks in gaberdine and sandals, venturing loans upon\nthe rich argosies of Venetian commerce\u2014with Othellos and Desdemonas,\nwith Iagos and Roderigos\u2014with noble fleets and victorious legions\nreturning from the wars. In the treacherous sunlight we see Venice\ndecayed, forlorn, poverty-stricken, and commerceless\u2014forgotten and\nutterly insignificant. But in the moonlight, her fourteen centuries of\ngreatness fling their glories about her, and once more is she the\nprinceliest among the nations of the earth.\n\nYes, I think we have seen all Venice. We have seen in these old churches\na profusion of costly and elaborate sepulchre ornamentation such as we\nnever dreamt of before. We have stood in the dim religious light of\nthese hoary sanctuaries, in the midst of long ranks of dusty monuments\nand effigies of the great dead of Venice, until we seemed drifting back,\nback, back, into the solemn past, and looking upon the scenes and\nmingling with the people of a remote antiquity. We have been in a\nhalf-waking sort of a dream all the time. I do not know how else to\ndescribe the feeling. A part of our being has remained still in the\nnineteenth century, while another part of it has seemed in some\nunaccountable way walking among the phantoms of the tenth.\n\nWe have seen famous pictures until our eyes are weary with looking at\nthem and refuse to find interest in them any longer.... We have striven\nhard to learn. We have had some success. We have mastered some things,\npossibly of trifling import in the eyes of the learned, but to us they\ngive pleasure, and we take as much pride in our little acquirements as\ndo others who have learned far more, and we love to display them full as\nwell. When we see a monk going about with a lion and looking tranquilly\nup to heaven, we know that that is St. Mark. When we see a monk with a\nbook and a pen, looking tranquilly up to heaven, trying to think of a\nword, we know that that is St. Matthew. When we see a monk sitting on a\nrock, looking tranquilly up to heaven, with a human skull beside him,\nand without other baggage, we know that that is St. Jerome. Because we\nknow that he always went flying light in the matter of baggage. When we\nsee a party looking tranquilly up to heaven, unconscious that his body\nis shot through and through with arrows, we know that that is St.\nSebastian. When we see other monks looking tranquilly up to heaven, but\nhaving no trademark, we always ask who those parties are. We do this\nbecause we humbly wish to learn....\n\nAnd so, having satisfied ourselves, we depart to-morrow, and leave the\nvenerable Queen of the Republics to summon her vanished ships, and\nmarshal her shadowy armies, and know again in dreams the pride of her\nold renown.\n\n\n                                AT PISA\n\nThe Baptistery, which is a few years older than the Leaning Tower, is a\nstately rotunda of huge dimensions, and was a costly structure. In it\nhangs the lamp whose measured swing suggested to Galileo the pendulum.\nIt looked an insignificant thing to have conferred upon the world of\nscience and mechanics such a mighty extension of their dominions as it\nhas. Pondering, in its suggestive presence, I seemed to see a crazy\nuniverse of swinging disks, the toiling children of this sedate parent.\nHe appeared to have an intelligent expression about him of knowing that\nhe was not a lamp at all; that he was a Pendulum; a pendulum disguised,\nfor prodigious and inscrutable purposes of his own deep devising, and\nnot a common pendulum either, but the old original patriarchal\nPendulum\u2014the Abraham Pendulum of the world.\n\n\n                          CHRISTIAN PERSUASION\n\nHow times have changed, between the older ages and the new! Some\nseventeen or eighteen centuries ago, the ignorant men of Rome were wont\nto put Christians in the arena of the Coliseum yonder, and turn the wild\nbeasts in upon them, for show. It was for a lesson as well. It was to\nteach the people to abhor and fear the new doctrine the followers of\nChrist were teaching. The beasts tore the victims limb from limb and\nmade poor mangled corpses of them in the twinkling of an eye. But when\nthe Christians came into power, when the holy Mother Church became\nmistress of the barbarians, she taught them the error of their ways by\nno such means. No, she put them in this pleasant Inquisition and pointed\nto the Blessed Redeemer, who was so gentle and so merciful toward all\nmen, and they urged the barbarians to love him; and they did all they\ncould to persuade them to love and honor him\u2014first by twisting their\nthumbs out of joint with a screw; then by nipping their flesh with\npincers\u2014red-hot ones, because they are the most comfortable in cold\nweather; then by skinning them alive a little, and finally by roasting\nthem in public. They always convinced those barbarians. The true\nreligion, properly administered, as the good Mother Church used to\nadminister it, is very, very soothing. It is wonderfully persuasive\nalso. There is a great difference between feeding parties to wild beasts\nand stirring up their finer feelings in an Inquisition. One is the\nsystem of degraded barbarians, the other of enlightened civilized\npeople. It is a great pity the playful Inquisition is no more.\n\n\n                      TAKING IT OUT OF THE GUIDES\n\nI never felt so fervently thankful, so soothed, so tranquil, so filled\nwith a blessed peace, as I did yesterday when I learned that Michael\nAngelo was dead.\n\nBut we have taken it out of this guide. He has marched us through miles\nof pictures and sculpture in the vast corridors of the Vatican; and\nthrough miles of pictures and sculpture in twenty other palaces; he has\nshown us the great picture in the Sistine Chapel, and frescoes enough to\nfresco the heavens\u2014pretty much all done by Michael Angelo. So with him\nwe have played that game which has vanquished so many guides for\nus\u2014imbecility and idiotic questions. These creatures never suspect\u2014they\nhave no idea of a sarcasm.\n\nHe shows us a figure and says: \u201cStatoo brunzo.\u201d (Bronze statue).\n\nWe look at it indifferently and the doctor asks: \u201cBy Michael Angelo?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014not know who.\u201d\n\nThen he shows us the ancient Roman Forum. The doctor asks: \u201cMichael\nAngelo?\u201d\n\nA stare from the guide. \u201cNo\u2014a thousan\u2019 year before he is born.\u201d\n\nThen an Egyptian obelisk. Again: \u201cMichael Angelo?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, mon dieu, genteelman! Zis is TWO thousan\u2019 year before he is born.\u201d\n\nHe grows so tired of that unceasing question sometimes, that he dreads\nto show us anything at all. The wretch has tried all the ways he can\nthink of to make us comprehend that Michael Angelo is only responsible\nfor the creation of a _part_ of the world, but somehow he has not\nsucceeded yet. Relief for overtasked eyes and brain from study and\nsightseeing is necessary, or we shall become idiotic, sure enough.\nTherefore this guide must continue to suffer. If he does not enjoy it,\nso much the worse for him. We do.\n\nIn this place I might as well jot down a chapter concerning those\nnecessary nuisances, European guides. Many a man has wished in his heart\nhe could do without his guide; but knowing he could not, has wished he\ncould get some amusement out of him as a remuneration for the affliction\nof his society. We accomplished this latter matter, and if our\nexperience can be made useful to others they are welcome to it.\n\nGuides know about enough English to tangle everything up so that a man\ncan make neither head nor tail of it. They know their story by heart\u2014the\nhistory of every statue, painting, cathedral, or other wonder they show\nyou. They know it and tell it as a parrot would\u2014and if you interrupt,\nand throw them off the track, they have to go back and begin over again.\nAll their lives long, they are employed in showing strange things to\nforeigners and listening to their bursts of admiration. It is human\nnature to take delight in exciting admiration. It is what prompts\nchildren to say \u201csmart\u201d things, and to do absurd ones, and in other ways\n\u201cshow off\u201d when company is present. It is what makes gossips turn out in\nrain and storm to go and be the first to tell a startling bit of news.\nThink, then, what a passion it becomes with a guide, whose privilege it\nis, every day, to show to strangers wonders that throw them into perfect\necstasies of admiration! He gets so that he could not by any possibility\nlive in a soberer atmosphere. After we discovered this, we _never_ went\ninto ecstasies any more\u2014we never admired anything\u2014we never showed any\nbut impassible faces and stupid indifference in the presence of the\nsublimest wonders a guide had to display. We had found their weak point.\nWe have made good use of it ever since. We have made some of those\npeople savage, at times, but we have never lost our own serenity.\n\nThe doctor asks the questions, generally, because he can keep his\ncountenance, and look more like an inspired idiot, and throw more\nimbecility into the tone of his voice than any man that lives. It comes\nnatural to him.\n\nThe guides in Genoa are delighted to secure an American party, because\nAmericans have so much wonder, and deal so much in sentiment and emotion\nbefore any relic of Columbus. Our guide there fidgeted about as if he\nhad swallowed a spring mattress. He was full of animation\u2014full of\nimpatience. He said:\n\n\u201cCome wis me, genteelmen!\u2014come! I show you ze letter writing by\nChristopher Colombo! write it himself!\u2014write it wis his own hand!\u2014come!\u201d\n\nHe took us to the municipal palace. After much impressive fumbling of\nkeys and opening of locks, the stained and aged document was spread\nbefore us. The guide\u2019s eyes sparkled. He danced about us and tapped the\nparchment with his finger:\n\n\u201cWhat I tell you, genteelmen! Is it not so? See! handwriting Christopher\nColombo!\u2014write it himself!\u201d\n\nWe looked indifferent\u2014unconcerned. The doctor examined the document very\ndeliberately, during a painful pause. Then he said, without any show of\ninterest:\n\n\u201cAh\u2014Ferguson\u2014what\u2014what did you say was the name of the party who wrote\nthis?\u201d\n\n\u201cChristopher Colombo! ze great Christopher Colombo.\u201d\n\nAnother deliberate examination.\n\n\u201cAh\u2014did he write it himself, or\u2014or how?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe write it himself!\u2014Christopher Colombo! he\u2019s own handwriting, write\nby himself!\u201d\n\nThen the doctor laid the document down and said:\n\n\u201cWhy, I have seen boys in America only fourteen years old that could\nwrite better than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut zis is ze great Christo\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care who it is! It\u2019s the worst writing I ever saw. Now you\nmustn\u2019t think you can impose on us because we are strangers. We are not\nfools, by a good deal. If you have got any specimens of penmanship of\nreal merit, trot them out!\u2014and if you haven\u2019t, drive on!\u201d\n\nWe drove on. The guide was considerably shaken up, but he made one more\nventure. He had something which he thought would overcome us. He said:\n\n\u201cAh, genteelmen, you come wis me! I show you beautiful, oh, magnificent\nbust Christopher Colombo!\u2014splendid, grand, magnificent!\u201d\n\nHe brought us before the beautiful bust\u2014for it _was_ beautiful\u2014and\nsprang back and struck an attitude:\n\n\u201cAh, look, genteelmen!\u2014beautiful, grand,\u2014bust Christopher\nColombo!\u2014Beautiful bust, beautiful pedestal!\u201d\n\nThe doctor put up his eyeglass\u2014procured for such occasions:\n\n\u201cAh\u2014what did you say this gentleman\u2019s name was?\u201d\n\n\u201cChristopher Colombo! ze great Christopher Colombo!\u201d\n\n\u201cChristopher Colombo\u2014the great Christopher Colombo. Well what did _he_\ndo?\u201d\n\n\u201cDiscover America!\u2014discover America, oh, ze devil!\u201d\n\n\u201cDiscover America. No\u2014that statement will hardly wash. We are just from\nAmerica ourselves. We heard nothing about it. Christopher\nColombo\u2014pleasant name\u2014is\u2014is he dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, corpo di Baccho!\u2014three hundred year!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he die of?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know!\u2014I cannot tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmallpox, think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know, genteelmen!\u2014I do not know _what_ he die of!\u201d\n\n\u201cMeasles, likely?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe\u2014maybe\u2014I do not know\u2014I think he die of somethings.\u201d\n\n\u201cParents living?\u201d\n\n\u201cIm-posseeble!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u2014which is the bust and which is the pedestal?\u201d\n\n\u201cSanta Maria!\u2014_zis_ ze bust!\u2014_zis_ ze pedestal!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, I see, I see\u2014happy combination\u2014very happy combination, indeed.\nIs\u2014is this the first time this gentleman was ever on a bust?\u201d\n\nThat joke was lost on the foreigner\u2014guides cannot master subtleties of\nthe American joke.\n\nWe have made it interesting for this Roman guide. Yesterday we spent\nthree or four hours in the Vatican again, that wonderful world of\ncuriosities. We came very near expressing interest, sometimes\u2014even\nadmiration\u2014it was very hard to keep from it. We succeeded though.\nNobody else ever did, in the Vatican museums. The guide was\nbewildered\u2014nonplussed. He walked his legs off, nearly, hunting up\nextraordinary things, and exhausted all his ingenuity on us, but it\nwas a failure; we never showed any interest in anything. He had\nreserved what he considered to be his greatest wonder till the last\u2014a\nroyal Egyptian mummy; the best-preserved in the world, perhaps. He\ntook us there. He felt so sure, this time, that some of his old\nenthusiasm came back to him:\n\n\u201cSee, genteelmen!\u2014Mummy! Mummy!\u201d\n\nThe eyeglass came up as calmly, as deliberately as ever.\n\n\u201cAh,\u2014Ferguson\u2014what did I understand you to say the gentleman\u2019s name\nwas?\u201d\n\n\u201cName?\u2014he got no name! Mummy!\u2014\u2019Gyptian mummy!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes. Born here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! _\u2019Gyptian_ mummy!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, just so. Frenchman, I presume?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u2014_Not_ Frenchman, not Roman!\u2014born in Egypta!\u201d\n\n\u201cBorn in Egypta. Never heard of Egypta before. Foreign locality, likely.\nMummy\u2014mummy. How calm he is\u2014how self-possessed. Is, ah\u2014is he dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, SACRE BLEU, been dead three thousan\u2019 year!\u201d\n\nThe doctor turned on him savagely:\n\n\u201cHere, now, what do you mean by such conduct as this! Playing us for\nChinamen because we are strangers and trying to learn. Trying to impose\nyour vile second-hand carcasses on _us_!\u2014thunder and lightning, I\u2019ve a\nnotion to\u2014to\u2014if you\u2019ve got a nice _fresh_ corpse, fetch him out!\u2014or, by\nGeorge, we\u2019ll brain you!\u201d\n\nWe make it exceedingly interesting for this Frenchman. However, he has\npaid us back, partly, without knowing it. He came to the hotel this\nmorning to ask if we were up, and he endeavored as well as he could to\ndescribe us, so that the landlord would know which persons he meant. He\nfinished with the casual remark that we were lunatics. The observation\nwas so innocent and so honest that it amounted to a very good thing for\na guide to say.\n\nThere is one remark (already mentioned) which never yet has failed to\ndisgust these guides. We use it always, when we can think of nothing\nelse to say. After they have exhausted their enthusiasm pointing out to\nus and praising the beauties of some ancient bronze image or\nbroken-legged statue, we look at it stupidly and in silence for five,\nten, fifteen minutes\u2014as long as we can hold out, in fact\u2014and then ask:\n\n\u201cIs\u2014is he dead?\u201d\n\n\n                            A SURFEIT OF ART\n\nWhen I was a schoolboy and was to have a new knife, I could not make up\nmy mind as to which was the prettiest in the showcase, and I did not\nthink any of them were particularly pretty; and so I chose with a heavy\nheart. But when I looked at my purchase, at home, where no glittering\nblades came into composition with it, I was astonished to see how\nhandsome it was. To this day my new hats look better out of the shop\nthan they did in it, with other new hats. It begins to dawn upon me now,\nthat possibly, what I have been taking for uniform ugliness in the\ngalleries may be uniform beauty, after all. I honestly hope it is, to\nothers, but certainly it is not to me. Perhaps the reason I used to\nenjoy going to the Academy of Fine Arts in New York was because there\nwere but a few hundred paintings in it, and it did not surfeit me to go\nthrough the list. I suppose the Academy was bacon and beans in the\nForty-Mile Desert, and a European gallery is a state dinner of thirteen\ncourses. One leaves no sign after him of the one dish, but the thirteen\nfrighten away his appetite and give him no satisfaction.\n\nThere is one thing I am certain of, though. With all the Michael\nAngelos, the Raphaels, the Guidos, and the other old masters, the\nsublime history of Rome remains unpainted! They painted Virgins enough,\nand Popes enough, and saintly scarecrows enough, to people Paradise,\nalmost, and these things are all they did paint. \u201cNero fiddling o\u2019er\nburning Rome,\u201d the assassination of Caesar, the stirring spectacle of a\nhundred thousand people bending forward with rapt interest, in the\ncoliseum, to see two skilful gladiators hacking away each other\u2019s lives,\na tiger springing upon a kneeling martyr\u2014these and a thousand other\nmatters which we read of with a living interest, must be sought for only\nin books\u2014not among the rubbish left by the old masters\u2014who are no more,\nI have the satisfaction of informing the public.\n\n\n                               AT POMPEII\n\nEverywhere, you see things that make you wonder how old these old houses\nwere before the night of destruction came\u2014things, too, which bring back\nthose long-dead inhabitants and place them living before your eyes. For\ninstance: The steps (two feet thick\u2014lava blocks) that lead up out of the\nschool, and the same kind of steps that lead up into the dress circle of\nthe principal theater, are almost worn through! For ages the boys\nhurried out of that school, and for ages their parents hurried into that\ntheater, and the nervous feet that have been dust and ashes for eighteen\ncenturies have left their record for us to read to-day. I imagined I\ncould see crowds of gentlemen and ladies thronging into the theater,\nwith tickets for secured seats in their hands, and on the wall I read\nthe imaginary placard, in infamous grammar, \u201cPOSITIVELY NO FREE LIST,\nEXCEPT MEMBERS OF THE PRESS!\u201d Hanging about the doorway (I fancied) were\nslouchy Pompeiian street boys uttering slang and profanity, and keeping\na wary eye out for checks. I entered the theater, and sat down in one of\nthe long rows of stone benches in the dress circle, and looked at the\nplace for the orchestra, and the ruined stage, and around at the wide\nsweep of empty boxes, and thought to myself, \u201cThis house won\u2019t pay.\u201d I\ntried to imagine the music in full blast, the leader of the orchestra\nbeating time, and the \u201cversatile\u201d So-and-So (who had \u201cjust returned from\na most successful tour in the provinces to play his last and farewell\nengagement of positively six nights only, in Pompeii, previous to his\ndeparture for Herculaneum\u201d) charging around the stage and piling the\nagony mountains high\u2014but I could not do it with such a \u201chouse\u201d as that;\nthose empty benches tied my fancy down to dull reality. I said, these\npeople that ought to be here have been dead, and still, and moldering to\ndust for ages and ages, and will never care for the trifles and follies\nof life any more forever\u2014\u201cOwing to circumstances, etc., etc., there will\nnot be any performance to-night.\u201d Close down the curtains. Put out the\nlights.\n\n\n                                  FAME\n\nAfter browsing among the stately ruins of Rome, of Baiae, of Pompeii,\nand after glancing down the long marble ranks of battered and nameless\nimperial heads that stretch down the corridors of the Vatican, one thing\nstrikes me with a force it never had before: the unsubstantial,\nunlasting character of fame. Men lived long lives, in the olden time,\nand struggled feverishly through them, toiling like slaves, in oratory,\nin generalship, or in literature, and then laid them down and died,\nhappy in the possession of an enduring history and a deathless name.\nWell, twenty little centuries flutter away, and what is left of these\nthings? A crazy inscription on a block of stone, which snuffy\nantiquaries bother over and tangle up and make nothing out of but a bare\nname (which they spell wrong)\u2014no history, no tradition, no\npoetry\u2014nothing that can give it even a passing interest. What may be\nleft of General Grant\u2019s great name forty centuries hence? This\u2014in the\nEncyclopedia for A.D. 5868, possibly.\n\n\u201cUriah S. (or Z.) Grant\u2014popular poet of ancient times in the Aztec\nprovinces of the United States of British America. Some authors say\nflourished about A.D. 742; but the learned Ah-ah Foo-foo states that he\nwas a contemporary of Scharkspyre, the English poet, and flourished\nabout A.D. 1328, some three centuries _after_ the Trojan war instead of\nbefore it. He wrote \u2018Rock me to Sleep, Mother,\u2019\u201d\n\nThese thoughts sadden me. I will to bed.\n\n\n                       ATHENS FROM THE ACROPOLIS\n\nThe full moon was riding high in the cloudless heavens now. We sauntered\ncarelessly and unthinkingly to the edge of the lofty battlements of the\ncitadel, and looked down\u2014a vision! And such a vision! Athens by\nmoonlight! The prophet that thought the splendors of the New Jerusalem\nwere revealed to him, surely saw this instead! It lay in the level plain\nright under our feet\u2014all spread abroad like a picture\u2014and we looked down\nupon it as we might have looked from a balloon. We saw no semblance of a\nstreet, but every house, every window, every clinging vine, every\nprojection, was as distinct and sharply marked as if the time were\nnoonday; and yet there was no glare, no glitter, nothing harsh or\nrepulsive\u2014the noiseless city was flooded with the mellowest light that\never streamed from the moon, and seemed like some living creature\nwrapped in peaceful slumber. On its further side was a little temple,\nwhose delicate pillars and ornate front glowed with a rich luster that\nchained the eye like the spell; and nearer by, the palace of the king\nreared its creamy walls out of the midst of a great garden of shrubbery\nthat was flecked all over with a random shower of amber lights\u2014a spray\nof golden sparks that lost their brightness in the glory of the moon,\nand glinted softly upon the sea of dark foliage like the pallid stars of\nthe milky way. Overhead the stately columns, majestic still in their\nruin\u2014under foot the dreaming city\u2014in the distance the silver sea\u2014not on\nthe broad earth is there another picture half so beautiful!\n\nAs we turned and moved again through the temple, I wished that the\nillustrious men who had sat in it in the remote ages could visit it\nagain and reveal themselves to our curious eyes\u2014Plato, Aristotle,\nDemosthenes, Socrates, Phocion, Pythagoras, Euclid, Pindar, Xenophon,\nHerodotus, Praxiteles and Phidias, Zeuxis the painter. What a\nconstellation of celebrated names! But more than all, I wished that old\nDiogenes, groping so patiently with his lantern, searching so zealously\nfor one solitary honest man in all the world, might meander along and\nstumble on our party. I ought not to say it, maybe, but still I suppose\nhe would have put out his light.\n\n\n                             CONSTANTINOPLE\n\nCommercial morals, especially, are bad. There is no gainsaying that.\nGreek, Turkish, and Armenian morals consist only in attending church\nregularly on the appointed Sabbaths, and in breaking the ten\ncommandments all the balance of the week. It comes natural to them to\nlie and cheat in the first place, and then they go on and improve on\nnature until they arrive at perfection. In recommending his son to a\nmerchant as a valuable salesman, a father does not say he is a nice,\nmoral, upright boy, and goes to Sunday-school and is honest, but he\nsays, \u201cThis boy is worth his weight in broad pieces of a hundred\u2014for\nbehold, he will cheat whomsoever hath dealings with him, and from the\nEuxine to the waters of Marmora there abideth not so gifted a liar!\u201d How\nis that for a recommendation? The missionaries tell me that they hear\nencomiums like that passed upon people every day. They say of a person\nthey admire, \u201cAh, he is a charming swindler, and a most exquisite liar!\u201d\n\n\n                           TURKISH JOURNALISM\n\nThe newspaper business has its inconveniences in Constantinople. Two\nGreek papers and one French one were suppressed here within a few days\nof each other. No victories of the Cretans are allowed to be printed.\nFrom time to time the Grand Vizier sends a notice to the various editors\nthat the Cretan insurrection is entirely suppressed, and although that\neditor knows better, he still has to print the notice. The Levant Herald\nis too fond of speaking praisefully of Americans to be popular with the\nSultan, who does not relish our sympathy with the Cretans, and therefore\nthat paper has to be particularly circumspect in order to keep out of\ntrouble. Once the editor, forgetting the official notice in his paper\nthat the Cretans were crushed out, printed a letter of a very different\ntenor, from the American Consul in Crete, and was fined two hundred and\nfifty dollars for it. Shortly he printed another from the same source\nand was imprisoned three months for his pains. I think I could get the\nassistant editorship of the Levant Herald, but I am going to try to\nworry along without it.\n\n\n                               THE CAMEL\n\nBy half-past six we were under way, and all the Syrian world seemed to\nbe under way also. The road was filled with mule trains and long\nprocessions of camels. This reminds me that we have been trying for some\ntime to think what a camel looks like, and now we have made it out. When\nhe is down on all his knees, flat on his breast to receive his load, he\nlooks something like a goose, swimming; and when he is upright he looks\nlike an ostrich with an extra set of legs. Camels are not beautiful, and\ntheir long under lip gives them an exceedingly \u201cgallus\u201d expression. They\nhave immense flat, forked cushions of feet, that make a track in the\ndust like a pie with a slice cut out of it. They are not particular\nabout their diet. They would eat a tombstone if they could bite it. A\nthistle grows about here which has needles on it that would pierce\nthrough leather, I think; if one touches you, you can find relief in\nnothing but profanity. The camels eat these. They show by their actions\nthat they enjoy them. I suppose it would be a real treat to a camel to\nhave a keg of nails for supper.\n\n\n                             AT NOAH\u2019S TOMB\n\nNoah\u2019s tomb is built of stone, and is covered with a long stone\nbuilding. Bucksheesh let us in. The building had to be long, because the\ngrave of the honored old navigator is two hundred and ten feet long\nitself! It is only about four feet high, though. He must have cast a\nshadow like a lightning-rod. The proof that this is the genuine spot\nwhere Noah was buried can only be doubted by uncommonly incredulous\npeople. The evidence is pretty straight. Shem, the son of Noah, was\npresent at the burial, and showed the place to his descendants, who\ntransmitted the knowledge to their descendants, and the lineal\ndescendants of these introduced themselves to us to-day. It was pleasant\nto make the acquaintance of members of so respectable a family. It was a\nthing to be proud of. It was the next thing to being acquainted with\nNoah himself.\n\n\n                                DAMASCUS\n\nDamascus dates back anterior to the days of Abraham, and is the oldest\ncity in the world. It was founded by Uz, the grandson of Noah. \u201cThe\nearly history of Damascus is shrouded in the mists of a hoary\nantiquity.\u201d Leave the matters written of in the first eleven chapters of\nthe Old Testament out, and no recorded event has occurred in the world\nbut Damascus was in existence to receive the news of it. Go back as far\nas you will into the vague past, there was always a Damascus. In the\nwritings of every century for more than four thousand years, its name\nhas been mentioned, and its praises sung. To Damascus, years are only\nmoments, decades are only flitting trifles of time. She measures time,\nnot by days and months and years, but by the empires she has seen rise\nand prosper and crumble to ruin. She is a type of immortality. She saw\nthe foundations of Baalbec, and Thebes, and Ephesus laid; she saw these\nvillages grow into mighty cities, and amaze the world with their\ngrandeur\u2014and she has lived to see them desolate, deserted, and given\nover to the owls and the bats. She saw the Israelitish empire exalted,\nand she saw it annihilated. She saw Greece rise, and flourish two\nthousand years, and die. In her old age she saw Rome built; she saw it\novershadow the world with its power; she saw it perish. The few hundreds\nof years of Genoese and Venetian might and splendor were, to grave old\nDamascus, only a trifling scintillation hardly worth remembering.\nDamascus has seen all that has ever occurred on earth, and still she\nlives. She has looked upon the dry bones of a thousand empires and will\nsee the tombs of a thousand more before she dies. Though another claims\nthe name, old Damascus is by right the Eternal City.\n\n\n                               AT BANIAS\n\nIt seems curious enough to us to be standing on ground that was once\nactually pressed by the feet of the Saviour. The situation is suggestive\nof a reality and a tangibility that seem at variance with the vagueness\nand mystery and ghostliness that one naturally attaches to the character\nof a god. I cannot comprehend yet that I am sitting where a god has\nstood, and looking upon the brook and the mountains which that god\nlooked upon, and am surrounded by dusky men and women whose ancestors\nsaw him, and even talked with him, face to face, and carelessly, just as\nthey would have done with any other stranger. I cannot comprehend this;\nthe gods of my understanding have been always hidden in clouds, and very\nfar away.\n\n\n                         A HEALER IN PALESTINE\n\nAs soon as the tribe found out that we had a doctor in our party, they\nbegan to flock in from all quarters. Dr. B., in the charity of his\nnature, had taken a child from a wagon who sat near by, and put some\nsort of a wash upon its diseased eyes. That woman went off and started\nthe whole nation, and it was a sight to see them swarm! The lame, the\nhalt, the blind, the leprous\u2014all the distempers that are bred of\nindolence, dirt, and iniquity\u2014were represented in the congress in ten\nminutes, and still they came! Every woman that had a sick baby brought\nit along, and every woman that hadn\u2019t, borrowed one. What reverent and\nwhat worshiping looks they bent upon that dread, mysterious power, the\nDoctor! They watched him take his phials out; they watched him measure\nthe particles of white powder; they watched him add drops of one\nprecious liquid, and drops of another; they lost not the slightest\nmovement; their eyes were riveted upon him with a fascination that\nnothing could distract. I believe they thought he was gifted like a god.\nWhen each individual got his portion of medicine, his eyes were radiant\nwith joy\u2014notwithstanding by nature they are a thankless and impassive\nrace\u2014and upon his face was written the unquestioning faith that nothing\non earth could prevent the patient from getting well, now.\n\nChrist knew how to preach to these simple, superstitious,\ndisease-tortured creatures: He healed the sick. They flocked to our poor\nhuman doctor this morning when the fame of what he had done to the sick\nchild went abroad in the land, and they worshiped him with their eyes\nwhile they did not know as yet whether there was virtue in his simples\nor not. The ancestors of these\u2014people precisely like them in color,\ndress, manners, costumes, simplicity\u2014flocked in vast multitudes after\nChrist, and when they saw Him make the afflicted whole with a word, it\nis no wonder they worshiped Him. No wonder His deeds were the talk of\nthe nation. No wonder the multitude that followed Him was so great that\nat one time\u2014thirty miles from here\u2014they had to let a sick man down\nthrough the roof because no approach could be made to the door; no\nwonder His audiences were so great at Galilee that He had to preach from\na ship removed a little distance from the shore; no wonder that even in\nthe desert places about Bethsaida, five thousand invaded His solitude,\nand He had to feed them by a miracle or else see them suffer for their\nconfiding faith and devotion; no wonder when there was a great commotion\nin a city in those days, one neighbor explained it to another in words\nto this effect: \u201cThey say that Jesus of Nazareth is come!\u201d\n\n\n                               THE BIBLE\n\nIt is hard to make a choice of the most beautiful passage in a book\nwhich is so gemmed with beautiful passages, as the Bible; but it is\ncertain that not many things within its lids may take rank above the\nexquisite story of Joseph. Who taught those ancient writers their\nsimplicity of language, their felicity of expression, their pathos, and,\nabove all, their faculty of sinking themselves entirely out of sight of\nthe reader and making the narrative stand out alone and seem to tell\nitself? Shakespeare is always present when one reads his book; Macaulay\nis present when we follow the march of his stately sentences; but the\nOld Testament writers are hidden from view.\n\n\n                            GALILEE AT NIGHT\n\nIn the starlight, Galilee has no boundaries but the broad compass of the\nheavens, and is a theater meet for great events; meet for the birth of a\nreligion able to save a world; and meet for the stately figure appointed\nto stand upon its stage and proclaim its high decrees. But in the\nsunlight, one says: Is it for the deeds which were done and the words\nwhich were spoken in this little acre of rocks and sand eighteen\ncenturies gone, that the bells are ringing to-day in the remote islands\nof the sea and far and wide over continents that clasp the circumference\nof the huge globe?\n\n\n                          DISTANCE IN THE EAST\n\nIn Constantinople you ask, \u201cHow far is it to the Consulate?\u201d and they\nanswer, \u201cAbout ten minutes.\u201d \u201cHow far is it to the Lloyds\u2019 Agency?\u201d\n\u201cQuarter of an hour.\u201d \u201cHow far is it to the lower bridge?\u201d \u201cFour\nminutes.\u201d I cannot be positive about it, but I think that there, when a\nman orders a pair of pantaloons, he says he wants them a quarter of a\nminute in the legs and nine seconds around the waist.\n\n\n                          A PLEASANT INCIDENT\n\nI cannot think of anything now more certain to make one shudder, than to\nhave a soft-footed camel sneak up behind him and touch him on the ear\nwith its cold, flabby under lip. A camel did this for one of the boys,\nwho was drooping over his saddle in a brown study. He glanced up and saw\nthe majestic apparition hovering above him, and made frantic efforts to\nget out of the way, but the camel reached out and bit him on the\nshoulder before he accomplished it. This was the only pleasant incident\nof the journey.\n\n\n                             SACRED MARVELS\n\nImagination labors best in distant fields. I doubt if any man can stand\nin the Grotto of the Annunciation and people with the phantom images of\nhis mind its too tangible walls of stone.\n\nThey showed us a broken granite pillar, depending from the roof, which\nthey said was hacked in two by the Moslem conquerors of Nazareth, in the\nvain hope of pulling down the sanctuary. But the pillar remained\nmiraculously suspended in the air, and, unsupported itself, supported\nthen and still supports the roof. By dividing this statement up among\neight, it was found not difficult to believe it.\n\nThese gifted Latin monks never do anything by halves. If they were to\nshow you the Brazen Serpent that was elevated in the wilderness, you\ncould depend upon it that they had on hand the pole it was elevated on\nalso, and even the hole it stood in. They have got the \u201cGrotto\u201d of the\nAnnunciation here; and just as convenient to it as one\u2019s throat is to\nhis mouth, they have also the Virgin\u2019s Kitchen, and even her\nsitting-room, where she and Joseph watched the infant Saviour play with\nHebrew toys, eighteen hundred years ago. All under one roof, and all\nclean, spacious, comfortable \u201cgrottoes.\u201d It seems curious that\npersonages intimately connected with the Holy Family always lived in\ngrottoes\u2014in Nazareth, in Bethlehem, in imperial Ephesus\u2014and yet nobody\nelse in their day and generation thought of doing anything of the kind.\nIf they ever did, their grottoes are all gone, and I suppose we ought to\nwonder at the peculiar marvel of the preservation of these I speak of.\nWhen the Virgin fled from Herod\u2019s wrath, she hid in a grotto in\nBethlehem, and the same is there to this day. The slaughter of the\ninnocents in Bethlehem was done in a grotto; the Saviour was born in a\ngrotto\u2014both are shown to pilgrims yet. It is exceedingly strange that\nthese tremendous events all happened in grottoes\u2014and exceedingly\nfortunate, likewise, because the strongest houses must crumble to ruin\nin time, but a grotto in the living rock will last forever.\n\n\n                            AT ADAM\u2019S GRAVE\n\nThe tomb of Adam! How touching it was, here in a land of strangers, far\naway from home, and friends, and all who cared for me, thus to discover\nthe grave of a blood relation. True, a distant one, but still a\nrelation. The unerring instinct of nature thrilled its recognition. The\nfountain of my filial affection was stirred to its profoundest depths,\nand I gave way to tumultuous emotion. I leaned upon a pillar and burst\ninto tears. I deem it no shame to have wept over the grave of my poor\ndead relative. Let him who would sneer at my emotion close this volume\nhere, for he will find little to his taste in my journeyings through the\nHoly Land. Noble old man\u2014he did not live to see me\u2014he did not live to\nsee his child. And I\u2014I\u2014alas, I did not live to see _him_. Weighed down\nby sorrow and disappointment, he died before I was born\u2014six thousand\nbrief summers before I was born. But let us try to bear it with\nfortitude. Let us trust that he is better off where he is. Let us take\ncomfort in the thought that his loss is our eternal gain.\n\n\n                           THE WANDERING JEW\n\nAnd so we came at last to another wonder, of deep and abiding\ninterest\u2014the veritable house where the unhappy wretch once lived who has\nbeen celebrated in song and story for more than eighteen hundred years\nas the Wandering Jew. On the memorable day of the Crucifixion he stood\nin this old doorway with his arms akimbo, looking out upon the\nstruggling mob that was approaching, and when the weary Saviour would\nhave sat down and rested him a moment, pushed him rudely away and said,\n\u201cMove on!\u201d The Lord said, \u201cMove on, thou, likewise,\u201d and the command has\nnever been revoked from that day to this. All men know now that the\nmiscreant upon whose head that just curse fell has roamed up and down\nthe wide world, for ages and ages, seeking rest and never finding\nit\u2014courting death but always in vain\u2014longing to stop, in city, in\nwilderness, in desert solitudes, yet hearing always that relentless\nwarning to march\u2014march on! They say\u2014do these hoary traditions\u2014that when\nTitus sacked Jerusalem and slaughtered eleven hundred thousand Jews in\nher streets and byways, the Wandering Jew was seen always in the\nthickest of the fight, and that when battle-axes gleamed in the air, he\nbowed his head beneath them; when swords flashed their deadly\nlightnings, he sprang in their way; he bared his breast to whizzing\njavelins, to hissing arrows, to any and to every weapon that promised\ndeath and forgetfulness, and rest. But it was useless\u2014he walked forth\nout of the carnage without a wound. And it is said that five hundred\nyears afterwards he followed Mahomet when he carried destruction to the\ncities of Arabia, and then turned against him, hoping in this way to win\nthe death of a traitor. His calculations were wrong again. No quarter\nwas given to any living creature but one, and that was the only one of\nall the host that did not want it. He sought death five hundred years\nlater, in the wars of the Crusades, and offered himself to famine and\npestilence at Ascalon. He escaped again\u2014he could not die. These repeated\nannoyances could have at last but one effect\u2014they shook his confidence.\nSince then the Wandering Jew has carried on a kind of desultory toying\nwith the most promising of the aids and implements of destruction, but\nwith small hope, as a general thing. He has speculated some in cholera\nand railroads and has taken almost a lively interest in infernal\nmachines and patent medicines. He is old, now, and grave, as becomes an\nage like his; he indulges in no light amusements save that he goes\nsometimes to executions, and is fond of funerals.\n\n\n                                BEDOUINS\n\nWe had had a glimpse, from a mountain top, of the Dead Sea, lying like a\nblue shield in the plain of the Jordan, and now we were marching down a\nclose, flaming, rugged, desolate defile, where no living creature could\nenjoy life, except, perhaps, a salamander. It was such a dreary,\nrepulsive, horrible solitude! It was the \u201cwilderness\u201d where John\npreached, with camel\u2019s hair about his loins\u2014raiment enough\u2014but he never\ncould have got his locusts and wild honey here. We were moping along\ndown through this dreadful place, every man in the rear. Our guards\u2014two\ngorgeous young Arab sheiks, with cargoes of swords, guns, pistols, and\ndaggers on board\u2014were loafing ahead.\n\n\u201cBedouins!\u201d\n\nEvery man shrunk up and disappeared in his clothes like a mud-turtle. My\nfirst impulse was to dash forward and destroy the Bedouins. My second\nwas to dash to the rear to see if there were any coming in that\ndirection. I acted on the latter impulse. So did all the others. If any\nBedouins had approached us, then, from that point of compass, they would\nhave paid dearly for their rashness. We all remarked that, afterwards.\nThere would have been scenes of riot and bloodshed there that no pen\ncould describe. I know that, because each man told what he would have\ndone, individually; and such a medley of strange and unheard-of\ninventions of cruelty you could not conceive of. One man said he had\ncalmly made up his mind to perish where he stood, if need be, but never\nyield an inch; he was going to wait, with deadly patience, till he could\ncount the stripes on the first Bedouin\u2019s jacket, and then count them and\nlet him have it. Another was going to sit still till the first lance\nreached within an inch of his breast, and then dodge it and seize it. I\nforbear to tell what he was going to do to that Bedouin that owned it.\nIt makes my blood run cold to think of it.\n\n\n                             A SMITTEN LAND\n\nPalestine sits in sackcloth and ashes. Over it broods the spell of a\ncurse that has withered its fields and fettered its energies. Where\nSodom and Gomorrah reared their domes and towers, that solemn sea now\nfloods the plain, in whose bitter waters no living thing exists\u2014over\nwhose waveless surface the blistering air hangs motionless and\ndead\u2014about whose borders nothing grows but weeds, and scattering tufts\nof cane, and that treacherous fruit that promises refreshment to\nparching lips, but turns to ashes at the touch. Nazareth is forlorn;\nabout that ford of Jordan where the hosts of Israel entered the Promised\nLand with songs of rejoicing, one finds only a squalid camp of fantastic\nBedouins of the desert; Jericho the accursed lies a moldering ruin\nto-day, even as Joshua\u2019s miracle left it more than three thousand years\nago; Bethlehem and Bethany, in their poverty and their humiliation, have\nnothing about them now to remind one that they once knew the high honor\nof the Saviour\u2019s presence; the hallowed spot where the shepherds watched\ntheir flocks by night, and where the angels sang \u201cPeace on earth, good\nwill to men,\u201d is untenanted by any living creature, and unblessed by any\nfeature that is pleasant to the eye. Renowned Jerusalem itself, the\nstateliest name in history, has lost all its ancient grandeur, and is\nbecome a pauper village; the riches of Solomon are no longer there to\ncompel the admiration of visiting Oriental queens; the wonderful temple,\nwhich was the pride and glory of Israel, is gone, and the Ottoman\ncrescent is lifted above the spot where, on that most memorable day in\nthe annals of the world, they reared the Holy Cross. The noted Sea of\nGalilee, where Roman fleets once rode at anchor and the disciples of the\nSaviour sailed in their ships, was long ago deserted by the devotees of\nwar and commerce, and its borders are a silent wilderness; Capernaum is\na shapeless ruin; Magdala is the home of beggared Arabs; Bethsaida and\nChorazin have vanished from the earth, and the \u201cdesert places\u201d round\nabout them, where thousands of men once listened to the Saviour\u2019s voice\nand ate the miraculous bread, sleep in the hush of a solitude that is\ninhabited only by birds of prey and skulking foxes.\n\nPalestine is desolate and unlovely. And why should it be otherwise? Can\nthe _curse_ of the Deity beautify a land?\n\n\n                               THE SPHINX\n\nAfter years of waiting, it was before me at last. The great face was so\nsad, so earnest, so longing, so patient. There was a dignity not of\nearth in its mien, and in its countenance a benignity such as never\nanything human wore. It was stone, but seemed sentient. If ever image of\nstone thought, it was thinking. It was looking toward the verge of the\nlandscape, yet looking _at_ nothing\u2014nothing but distance and vacancy. It\nwas looking over and beyond everything of the present, and far into the\npast. It was gazing out over the ocean of Time\u2014over lines of\ncentury-waves which, further and further receding, closed nearer and\nnearer together, and blended at last into one unbroken tide, away toward\nthe horizon of remote antiquity. It was thinking of the wars of departed\nages; of the empires it had seen created and destroyed; of the nations\nwhose birth it had witnessed, whose progress it had watched, whose\nannihilation it had noted; of the joy and sorrow, the life and death,\nthe grandeur and decay, of five thousand slow revolving years. It was\nthe type of an attribute of man\u2014of a faculty of his heart and brain. It\nwas MEMORY\u2014RETROSPECTION\u2014wrought into visible, tangible form. All who\nknow what pathos there is in memories of days that are accomplished and\nfaces that have vanished\u2014albeit only a trifling score of years gone\nby\u2014will have some appreciation of the pathos that dwells in these grave\neyes that look so steadfastly back upon the things they knew before\nHistory was born\u2014before tradition had being\u2014things that were, and forms\nthat moved, in a vague era which even Poetry and Romance scarce know\nof\u2014and passed one by one away and left the stony dreamer solitary in the\nmidst of a strange new age, and uncomprehended scenes.\n\nThe Sphinx is grand in its loneliness; it is imposing in its magnitude;\nit is impressive in the mystery that hangs over its story. And there is\nthat in the overshadowing majesty of this eternal figure of stone, with\nits accusing memory of the deeds of all ages, which reveals to one\nsomething of what he shall feel when he shall stand at last in the awful\npresence of God.\n\n\n                       MEMORIES OF THE PILGRIMAGE\n\nWe shall remember something of pleasant France; and something also of\nParis, though it flashed upon us a splendid meteor, and was gone again,\nwe hardly knew how or where. We shall remember, always, how we saw\nmajestic Gibraltar glorified with the rich coloring of a Spanish sunset\nand swimming in a sea of rainbows. In fancy we shall see Milan again,\nand her stately cathedral with its marble wilderness of graceful spires.\nAnd Padua\u2014Verona\u2014Como, jeweled with stars; and patrician Venice, afloat\non her stagnant flood\u2014silent, desolate, haughty\u2014scornful of her humbled\nstate\u2014wrapping herself in memories of her lost fleets, of battle and\ntriumph, and all the pageantry of a glory that is departed.\n\nWe cannot forget Florence\u2014Naples\u2014nor the foretaste of heaven that is in\nthe delicious atmosphere of Greece\u2014and surely not Athens and the broken\ntemples of the Acropolis. Surely not venerable Rome\u2014nor the green plain\nthat compasses her round about, contrasting its brightness with her gray\ndecay\u2014nor the ruined arches that stand apart in the plain and clothe\ntheir looped and windowed raggedness with vines. We shall remember St.\nPeter\u2019s; not as one sees it when he walks the streets of Rome and\nfancies all her domes are just alike, but as he sees it leagues away,\nwhen every meaner edifice has faded out of sight and that one dome looms\nsuperbly up in the flush of sunset, full of dignity and grace, strongly\noutlined as a mountain.\n\nWe shall remember Constantinople and the Bosporus\u2014the colossal\nmagnificence of Baalbec\u2014the Pyramids of Egypt\u2014the prodigious form, the\nbenignant countenance of the Sphinx\u2014Oriental Smyrna\u2014sacred\nJerusalem\u2014Damascus, the \u201cPearl of the East,\u201d the pride of Syria, the\nfabled Garden of Eden, the home of princes and genii of the Arabian\nNights, the oldest metropolis on the earth, the one city in all the\nworld that has kept its name and held its place and looked serenely on\nwhile the Kingdoms and Empires of four thousand years have risen to\nlife, enjoyed their little season of pride and pomp and then vanished\nand been forgotten!\n\n\n\n\n                          _FROM_ \u201cROUGHING IT\u201d\n\n\n                             STARTING WEST\n                               (1870\u201371)\n\nWe were six days going from St. Louis to \u201cSt. Joe\u201d\u2014a trip that was so\ndull, and sleepy, and eventless that it has left no more impression on\nmy memory than if its duration had been six minutes instead of that many\ndays. No record is left in my mind, now, concerning it, but a confused\njumble of savage looking snags, which we deliberately walked over with\none wheel or the other; and of reefs which we butted and butted, and\nthen retired from and climbed over in some softer place; and of\nsand-bars which we roosted on occasionally, and rested, and then got out\nour crutches and sparred over. In fact, the boat might almost as well\nhave gone to St. Joe by land, for she was walking most of the time,\nanyhow\u2014climbing over reefs and clambering over snags patiently and\nlaboriously all day long. The captain said she was a \u201cbully\u201d boat, and\nall she wanted was more \u201cshear\u201d and a bigger wheel. I thought she wanted\na pair of stilts, but I had the deep sagacity not to say so.\n\n\n                      GEORGE BEMIS AND \u201cTHE ALLEN\u201d\n\nMr. George Bemis was dismally formidable. George Bemis was our fellow\ntraveler. We had never seen him before. He wore in his belt an old\noriginal \u201cAllen\u201d revolver, such as irreverent people called a\n\u201cpepper-box.\u201d Simply drawing the trigger back, cocked and fired the\npistol. As the trigger came back, the hammer would begin to rise and the\nbarrel to turn over, and presently down would drop the hammer, and away\nwould speed the ball. To aim along the turning barrel and hit the thing\naimed at was a feat which was probably never done with an \u201cAllen\u201d in the\nworld. But George\u2019s was a reliable weapon, nevertheless, because, as one\nof the stage-drivers afterwards said, \u201cIf she didn\u2019t get what she went\nafter, she would fetch something else.\u201d\n\n\nAnd so she did. She went after a deuce of spades nailed against a tree,\nonce, and fetched a mule standing about thirty yards to the left of it.\nBemis did not want the mule; but the owner came out with a\ndouble-barreled shot-gun and persuaded him to buy it, anyhow.\n\n\n                           THE OVERLAND STAGE\n\nOur coach was a great swinging and swaying stage, of the most sumptuous\ndescription\u2014an imposing cradle on wheels. It was drawn by six handsome\nhorses, and by the side of the driver sat the \u201cconductor,\u201d the\nlegitimate captain of the craft; for it was his business to take charge\nand care of the mails, baggage, express matter, and passengers. We three\nwere the only passengers, this trip. We sat on the back seat, inside.\nAbout all the rest of the coach was full of mail bags\u2014for we had three\ndays\u2019 delayed mails with us. Almost touching our knees, a perpendicular\nwall of mail matter rose up to the roof. There was a great pile of it\nstrapped on top of the stage, and both the fore and hind boots were\nfull. We had twenty-seven hundred pounds of it aboard, the driver\nsaid\u2014\u201ca little for Brigham, and Carson, and \u2019Frisco, but the heft of it\nfor the Injuns, which is powerful troublesome \u2019thout they get plenty of\ntruck to read.\u201d But as he just then got up a fearful convulsion of his\ncountenance which was suggestive of a wink being swallowed by an\nearthquake, we guessed that his remark was intended to be facetious, and\nto mean that we would unload the most of our mail matter somewhere on\nthe plains and leave it to the Indians, or whosoever wanted it.\n\nWe changed horses every ten miles, all day long, and fairly flew over\nthe hard level road. We jumped out and stretched our legs every time the\ncoach stopped, and so the night found us still vivacious and unfatigued.\n\n\n                         MORNING ON THE PLAINS\n\nAnother night of alternate tranquillity and turmoil. But morning came,\nby and by. It was another glad awakening to fresh breezes, vast expanses\nof level greensward, bright sunlight, an impressive solitude, utterly\nwithout visible human beings or human habitations, and an atmosphere of\nsuch amazing magnifying properties that trees that seemed close at hand\nwere more than three miles away. We resumed undress uniform, climbed\na-top of the flying coach, dangled our legs over the side, shouted\noccasionally at our frantic mules, merely to see them lay their ears\nback and scamper faster, tied our hats on to keep our hair from blowing\naway, and leveled an outlook over the world-wide carpet about us for\nthings new and strange to gaze at. Even at this day it thrills me\nthrough and through to think of the life, the gladness and the wild\nsense of freedom that used to make the blood dance in my veins on those\nfine overland mornings.\n\n\n                               THE CAYOTE\n\nThe cayote is a long, slim, sick and sorry-looking skeleton, with a gray\nwolf-skin stretched over it, a tolerably bushy tail that forever sags\ndown with a despairing expression of forsakenness and misery, a furtive\nand evil eye, and a long, sharp face, with slightly lifted lip and\nexposed teeth. He has a general slinking expression all over. The cayote\nis a living, breathing allegory of Want. He is _always_ hungry. He is\nalways poor, out of luck and friendless. The meanest creatures despise\nhim, and even the fleas would desert him for a velocipede. He is so\nspiritless and cowardly that even while his exposed teeth are pretending\na threat, the rest of his face is apologizing for it. And he is _so_\nhomely!\u2014so scrawny, and ribby, and coarse-haired, and pitiful. When he\nsees you he lifts his lip and lets a flash of his teeth out, and then\nturns a little out of the course he was pursuing, depresses his head a\nbit, and strikes a long, soft-footed trot through the sagebrush,\nglancing over his shoulder at you, from time to time, till he is about\nout of easy pistol range, and then he stops and takes a deliberate\nsurvey of you; he will trot fifty yards and stop again\u2014another fifty and\nstop again; and finally the gray of his gliding body blends with the\ngray of the sagebrush, and he disappears. All this is when you make no\ndemonstration against him; but if you do, he develops a livelier\ninterest in his journey, and instantly electrifies his heels and puts\nsuch a deal of real estate between himself and your weapon, that by the\ntime you have raised the hammer you see that you need a minie rifle, and\nby the time you have got him in line you need a rifled cannon, and by\nthe time you have \u201cdrawn a bead\u201d on him you see well enough that nothing\nbut an unusually long-winded streak of lightning could reach him where\nhe is now. But if you start a swift-footed dog after him, you will enjoy\nit ever so much\u2014especially if it is a dog that has a good opinion of\nhimself, and has been brought up to think he knows something about\nspeed. The cayote will go swinging gently off on that deceitful trot of\nhis, and every little while he will smile a fraudful smile over his\nshoulder that will fill that dog entirely full of encouragement and\nworldly ambition, and make him lay his head still lower to the ground,\nand stretch his neck further to the front, and pant more fiercely, and\nstick his tail out straighter behind, and move his furious legs with a\nyet wilder frenzy, and leave a broader and broader, and higher and\ndenser cloud of desert sand smoking behind, and marking his long wake\nacross the level plain! And all this time the dog is only a short twenty\nfeet behind the cayote, and to save the soul of him he cannot understand\nwhy it is that he cannot get perceptibly closer; and he begins to get\naggravated, and it makes him madder and madder to see how gently the\ncayote glides along and never pants or sweats or ceases to smile; and he\ngrows still more and more incensed to see how shamefully he has been\ntaken in by an entire stranger, and what an ignoble swindle that long,\ncalm, soft-footed trot is; and next he notices that he is getting\nfagged, and that the cayote actually has to slacken speed a little to\nkeep from running away from him\u2014and _then_ that town-dog is mad in\nearnest, and he begins to strain and weep and swear, and paw the sand\nhigher than ever, and reach for the cayote with concentrated and\ndesperate energy. This \u201cspurt\u201d finds him six feet behind the gliding\nenemy, and two miles from his friends. And then, in the instant that a\nwild new hope is lighting up his face, the cayote turns and smiles\nblandly upon him once more, and with a something about it which seems to\nsay, \u201cWell, I shall have to tear myself away from you, bud\u2014business is\nbusiness, and it will not do for me to be fooling along this way all\nday\u201d\u2014and forthwith there is a rushing sound, and the sudden splitting of\na long crack through the atmosphere, and behold that dog is solitary and\nalone in the midst of a vast solitude!\n\n\n                             THE PONY RIDER\n\nIn a little while all interest was taken up in stretching our necks and\nwatching for the \u201cpony-rider\u201d\u2014the fleet messenger who sped across the\ncontinent from St. Joe to Sacramento, carrying letters nineteen hundred\nmiles in eight days! Think of that for perishable horse and human flesh\nand blood to do! The pony-rider was usually a little bit of a man,\nbrimful of spirit and endurance. No matter what time of the day or night\nhis watch came on, and no matter whether it was winter or summer,\nraining, snowing, hailing, or sleeting, or whether his \u201cbeat\u201d was a\nlevel straight road or a crazy trail over mountain crags and precipices,\nor whether it led through peaceful regions that swarmed with hostile\nIndians, he must be always ready to leap into the saddle and be off like\nthe wind! There was no idling-time for a pony-rider on duty. He rode\nfifty miles without stopping by daylight, moonlight, starlight, or\nthrough the blackness of darkness\u2014just as it happened. He rode a\nsplendid horse that was born for a racer and fed and lodged like a\ngentleman; kept him at his utmost speed for ten miles, and then, as he\ncame crashing up to the station where stood two men holding fast a\nfresh, impatient steed, the transfer of rider and mail-bag was made in\nthe twinkling of an eye, and away flew the eager pair and were out of\nsight before the spectator could get hardly the ghost of a look. Both\nrider and horse went \u201cflying light.\u201d The rider\u2019s dress was thin, and\nfitted close; he wore a \u201croundabout,\u201d and a skull-cap, and tucked his\npantaloons into his boot tops like a race-rider. He carried no arms\u2014he\ncarried nothing that was not absolutely necessary, for even the postage\non his literary freight was worth _five dollars a letter_. He got but\nlittle frivolous correspondence to carry\u2014his bag had business letters in\nit, mostly. His horse was stripped of all unnecessary weight, too. He\nwore a little wafer of a racing-saddle, and no visible blanket. He wore\nlight shoes, or none at all. The little flat mail-pockets strapped under\nthe rider\u2019s thighs would each hold about the bulk of a child\u2019s primer.\nThey held many and many an important business chapter and newspaper\nletter, but these were written on paper as airy and thin as gold-leaf,\nnearly, and thus bulk and weight were economized. The stage-coach\ntraveled about a hundred to a hundred and twenty-five miles a day\n(twenty-four hours), the pony-rider about two hundred and fifty. There\nwere about eighty pony-riders in the saddle all the time, night and day,\nstretching in a long, scattering procession from Missouri to California,\nforty flying eastward, and forty toward the west, and among them making\nfour hundred gallant horses earn a stirring livelihood and see a deal of\nscenery every single day in the year.\n\nWe had had a consuming desire, from the beginning, to see a pony-rider,\nbut somehow or other all that passed us and all that met us managed to\nstreak by in the night, and so we heard only a whiz and a hail, and the\nswift phantom of the desert was gone before we could get our heads out\nof the windows. But now we were expecting one along every moment, and\nwould see him in broad daylight. Presently the driver exclaims:\n\n\u201cHERE HE COMES.\u201d\n\nEvery neck is stretched further, and every eye strained wider. Away\nacross the endless dead level of the prairie a black speck appears\nagainst the sky, and it is plain that it moves. Well, I should think so!\nIn a second or two it becomes a horse and rider, rising and falling,\nrising and falling,\u2014sweeping toward us nearer and nearer\u2014growing more\nand more distinct, more and more sharply defined\u2014nearer and still\nnearer, and the flutter of the hoofs comes faintly to the ear\u2014another\ninstant a whoop and a hurrah from our upper deck, a wave of the rider\u2019s\nhand, but no reply, and a man and horse burst past our excited faces,\nand go winging away like a belated fragment of a storm!\n\nSo sudden is it all, and so like a flash of unreal fancy, that but for\nthe flake of white foam left quivering and perishing on a mail-sack\nafter the vision had flashed by and disappeared, we might have doubted\nwhether we had seen any actual horse and man at all, maybe.\n\n\n                             INDIAN COUNTRY\n\nWe had now reached a hostile Indian country, and during the afternoon we\npassed Laparelle Station, and enjoyed great discomfort all the time we\nwere in the neighborhood, being aware that many of the trees we dashed\nby at arm\u2019s length concealed a lurking Indian or two. During the\npreceding night an ambushed savage had sent a bullet through the\npony-rider\u2019s jacket, but he had ridden on, just the same, because\npony-riders were not allowed to stop and inquire into such things except\nwhen killed. As long as they had life enough in them they had to stick\nto the horse and ride, even if the Indians had been waiting for them a\nweek, and were entirely out of patience. About two hours and a half\nbefore we arrived at Laparelle Station, the keeper in charge of it had\nfired four times at an Indian, but he said with an injured air that the\nIndian had \u201cskipped around so\u2019s to spile everything\u2014and ammunition\u2019s\nblamed skurse, too.\u201d The most natural inference conveyed by his manner\nof speaking was, that in \u201cskipping around,\u201d the Indian had taken an\nunfair advantage.... We shut the blinds down very tightly that first\nnight in the hostile Indian country, and lay on our arms. We slept on\nthem some, but most of the time we only lay on them. We did not talk\nmuch, but kept quiet and listened. It was an inky-black night, and\noccasionally rainy. We were among woods and rocks, hills and gorges\u2014so\nshut in, in fact, that when we peeped through a chink in a curtain, we\ncould discern nothing. The driver and conductor on top were still, too,\nor only spoke at long intervals, in low tones, as is the way of men in\nthe midst of invisible dangers. We listened to raindrops pattering on\nthe roof; and the grinding of the wheels through the muddy gravel; and\nthe low wailing of the wind; and all the time we had that absurd sense\nupon us, inseparable from travel at night in a close-curtained vehicle,\nthe sense of remaining perfectly still in one place, notwithstanding the\njolting and swaying of the vehicle, the trampling of the horses, and the\ngrinding of the wheels. We listened a long time, with intent faculties\nand bated breath; every time one of us would relax, and draw a long sigh\nof relief and start to say something, a comrade would be sure to utter a\nsudden \u201cHark!\u201d and instantly the experimenter was rigid and listening\nagain.\n\n\n                      AT THE SUMMIT OF THE ROCKIES\n\nAnd now, at last, we were fairly in the renowned SOUTH PASS, and\nwhirling gaily along, high above the common world. We were perched upon\nthe extreme summit of the great range of the Rocky Mountains, toward\nwhich we had been climbing, patiently climbing, ceaselessly climbing,\nfor days and nights together\u2014and about us was gathered a convention of\nNature\u2019s kings that stood ten, twelve, and even thirteen thousand feet\nhigh\u2014grand old fellows who would have to stoop to see Mount Washington,\nin the twilight. We were in such an airy elevation above the creeping\npopulations of the earth, that now and then when the obstructing crags\nstood out of the way it seemed that we could look around and abroad and\ncontemplate the whole great globe, with its dissolving views of\nmountains, seas, and continents stretching away through the mystery of\nthe summer haze.\n\n\n                          INCIDENTS BY THE WAY\n\nAt the Green River station we had breakfast\u2014hot biscuits, fresh antelope\nsteaks, and coffee\u2014the only decent meal we tasted between the United\nStates and Great Salt Lake City and the only one we were ever really\nthankful for. Think of the monotonous execrableness of the thirty that\nwent before it, to leave this one simple breakfast looming up in my\nmemory like a shot-tower after all these years have gone by!\n\nAt five p. m. we reached Fort Bridger, one hundred and seventeen miles\nfrom the South Pass, and one thousand and twenty-five miles from St.\nJoseph. Fifty-two miles further on, near the head of Echo Canyon, we met\nsixty United States soldiers from Camp Floyd. The day before, they had\nfired upon three hundred or four hundred Indians, whom they supposed\ngathered together for no good purpose. In the fight that had ensued,\nfour Indians were captured, and the main body chased four miles, but\nnobody killed. This looked like business. We had a notion to get out and\njoin the sixty soldiers, but upon reflecting that there were four\nhundred of the Indians, we concluded to go on and join the Indians.\n\n\n                            MORMON BEAUTIES\n\nOur stay in Salt Lake City amounted to only two days, and therefore we\nhad no time to make the customary inquisition into the workings of\npolygamy and get up the usual statistics and deductions preparatory to\ncalling the attention of the nation at large once more to the matter. I\nhad the will to do it. With the gushing self-sufficiency of youth I was\nfeverish to plunge in headlong and achieve a great reform here\u2014until I\nsaw the Mormon women. Then I was touched. My heart was wiser than my\nhead. It warmed toward these poor, ungainly, and pathetically \u201chomely\u201d\ncreatures, and as I turned to hide the generous moisture in my eyes, I\nsaid, \u201cNo\u2014the man that marries one of them has done an act of Christian\ncharity which entitles him to the kindly applause of mankind, not harsh\ncensure\u2014and the man that marries sixty of them has done a deed of\nopen-handed generosity so sublime that the nations should stand\nuncovered in his presence and worship in silence.\u201d\n\n\n                           THE ALKALI DESERT\n\nThe poetry was all in the anticipation\u2014there is none in the reality.\nImagine a vast, waveless ocean stricken dead and turned to ashes;\nimagine this solemn waste tufted with ash-dusted sage-bushes; imagine\nthe lifeless silence and solitude that belong to such a place; imagine a\ncoach, creeping like a bug through the midst of this shoreless level,\nand sending up tumbled volumes of dust as if it were a bug that went by\nsteam; imagine this aching monotony of toiling and plowing kept up hour\nafter hour, and the shore still as far away as ever, apparently; imagine\nteam, driver, coach and passengers so deeply coated with ashes that they\nare all one colorless color; imagine ash-drifts roosting above mustaches\nand eyebrows like snow accumulations on boughs and bushes. This is the\nreality of it.\n\nThe sun beats down with dead, blistering, relentless malignity; the\nperspiration is welling from every pore in man and beast, but scarcely a\nsign of it finds its way to the surface\u2014it is absorbed before it gets\nthere; there is not the faintest breath of air stirring; there is not a\nmerciful shred of cloud in all the brilliant firmament; there is not a\nliving creature visible in any direction whither one searches the blank\nlevel that stretches its monotonous miles on every hand; there is not a\nsound\u2014not a sigh\u2014not a whisper\u2014not a buzz, or a whir of wings, or\ndistant pipe of bird\u2014not even a sob from the lost souls that doubtless\npeople that dead air.\n\n\n                         ARRIVAL IN CARSON CITY\n\nBy and by Carson City was pointed out to us. It nestled in the edge of a\ngreat plain and was a sufficient number of miles away to look like an\nassemblage of mere white spots in the shadow of a grim range of\nmountains overlooking it, whose summits seemed lifted clear out of\ncompanionship and consciousness of earthly things.\n\nWe arrived, disembarked, and the stage went on. It was a \u201cwooden\u201d town;\nits population two thousand souls. The main street consisted of four or\nfive blocks of little frame stores which were too high to sit down on,\nbut not too high for various other purposes; in fact hardly high enough.\nThey were packed close together, side by side, as if room were scarce in\nthat mighty plain. The sidewalk was of boards that were more or less\nloose and inclined to rattle when walked upon. In the middle of the\ntown, opposite the stores, was the \u201cplaza,\u201d which is native to all towns\nbeyond the Rocky Mountains\u2014a large, unfenced, level vacancy, with a\nliberty pole in it, and very useful as a place for public auctions,\nhorse trades, and mass meetings, and likewise for teamsters to camp in.\nTwo other sides of the plaza were faced by stores, offices and stables.\nThe rest of Carson City was pretty scattering.\n\nWe were introduced to several citizens, at the stage-office and on the\nway up to the Governor\u2019s from the hotel\u2014among others, to a Mr. Harris,\nwho was on horseback; he began to say something, but interrupted himself\nwith the remark:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to get you to excuse me a minute; yonder is the witness that\nswore I helped to rob the California coach\u2014a piece of impertinent\nintermeddling, sir, for I am not even acquainted with the man.\u201d\n\nThen he rode over and began to rebuke the stranger with a six-shooter,\nand the stranger began to explain with another. When the pistols were\nemptied, the stranger resumed his work (mending a whip-lash), and Mr.\nHarris rode by with a polite nod, homeward bound, with a bullet through\none of his lungs, and several through his hips; and from them issued\nlittle rivulets of blood that coursed down the horse\u2019s sides and made\nthe animal look quite picturesque. I never saw Harris shoot a man after\nthat but it recalled to mind that first day in Carson.\n\n\n                               LAKE TAHOE\n\nThree months of camp life on Lake Tahoe would restore an Egyptian mummy\nto his pristine vigor, and give him an appetite like an alligator. I do\nnot mean the oldest and driest mummies, of course, but the fresher ones.\nThe air up there in the clouds is very pure and fine, bracing and\ndelicious. And why shouldn\u2019t it be?\u2014it is the same the angels breathe. I\nthink that hardly any amount of fatigue can be gathered together that a\nman cannot sleep off in one night on the sand by its side. Not under a\nroof, but under the sky; it seldom or never rains there in the summer\ntime. I know a man who went there to die. But he made a failure of it.\nHe was a skeleton when he came, and could barely stand. He had no\nappetite, and did nothing but read tracts and reflect on the future.\nThree months later he was sleeping out-of-doors regularly, eating all he\ncould hold, three times a day, and chasing game over mountains three\nthousand feet high for recreation. And he was a skeleton no longer, but\nweighed part of a ton. This is no fancy sketch, but the truth. His\ndisease was consumption. I confidently commend his experience to other\nskeletons.\n\n... As soon as we had eaten breakfast we got in the boat and skirted\nalong the lake shore about three miles and disembarked. We liked the\nappearance of the place, and so we claimed some three hundred acres of\nit and stuck our \u201cnotice\u201d on a tree. It was yellow pine timber land\u2014a\ndense forest of trees a hundred feet high and from one to five feet\nthrough at the butt. It was necessary to fence our property or we could\nnot hold it. That is to say, it was necessary to cut down trees here and\nthere and make them fall in such a way as to form a sort of enclosure\n(with pretty wide gaps in it). We cut down three trees apiece, and found\nit such heart-breaking work that we decided to \u201crest our case\u201d on those;\nif they held the property, well and good; if they didn\u2019t, let the\nproperty spill out through the gaps and go; it was no use to work\nourselves to death merely to save a few acres of land. Next day we came\nback to build a house\u2014for a house was also necessary, in order to hold\nthe property. We decided to build a substantial log-house and excite the\nenvy of the Brigade boys; but by the time we had cut and trimmed the\nfirst log it seemed unnecessary to be so elaborate, and so we concluded\nto build it of saplings. However, two saplings duly cut and trimmed,\ncompelled recognition of the fact that a still modester architecture\nwould satisfy the law, and so we concluded to build a \u201cbrush\u201d house. We\ndevoted the next day to this work, but we did so much \u201csitting around\u201d\nand discussing that by the middle of the afternoon we had achieved only\na half way sort of affair which one of us had to watch while the other\ncut brush, lest if both turned our backs we might not be able to find it\nagain, it had such a strong family resemblance to the surrounding\nvegetation. But we were satisfied with it.... We slept in the sand close\nto the water\u2019s edge, between two protecting boulders, which took care of\nthe stormy night winds for us. We never took any paregoric to make us\nsleep. At the first break of dawn we were always up and running\nfootraces to tone down excess of physical vigor and exuberance of\nspirits. That is, Johnny was\u2014but I held his hat. While smoking the pipe\nof peace after breakfast we watched the sentinel peaks put on the glory\nof the sun, and followed the conquering light as it swept among the\nshadows, and set the captive crags and forests free. We watched the\ntinted pictures grow and brighten upon the water till every little\ndetail of forest, precipice, and pinnacle was wrought in and finished,\nand the miracle of the enchanter complete. Then to \u201cbusiness.\u201d\n\nThat is, drifting around in the boat. We were on the north shore. There,\nthe rocks on the bottom are sometimes gray, sometimes white. This gives\nthe marvelous transparency of the water a fuller advantage than it has\nelsewhere on the lake. We usually pushed out a hundred yards or so from\nthe shore and then lay down on the thwarts in the sun, and let the boat\ndrift by the hour whither it would. We seldom talked. It interrupted the\nSabbath stillness, and marred the dreams, the luxurious rest and\nindolence brought.... So singularly clear was the water, that where it\nwas only twenty or thirty feet deep the bottom was so perfectly distinct\nthat the boat seemed floating in air! Yes, where it was even _eighty_\nfeet deep. Every little pebble was distinct, every speckled trout, every\nhand\u2019s-breadth of sand. Often, as we lay on our faces, a granite\nboulder, as large as a village church, would start out of the bottom\napparently, and seem climbing up rapidly to the surface, till presently\nit threatened to touch our faces, and we could not resist the impulse to\nseize the oar and avert the danger. But the boat would float on, and the\nboulder descend again, and then we could see that when we had been\nexactly above it, it must still have been twenty or thirty feet below\nthe surface. Down through the transparency of these great depths, the\nwater was not _merely_ transparent, but dazzlingly, brilliantly so. All\nobjects seen through it had a bright, strong vividness, not only of\noutline, but of every minute detail, which they would not have had when\nseen simply through the same depth of atmosphere. So empty and airy did\nall spaces seem below us, and so strong was the sense of floating high\naloft in mid-nothingness, that we called these boat-excursions\n\u201cballoon-voyages.\u201d ... Sometimes, on lazy afternoons, we lolled on the\nsand in camp, and smoked pipes and read some old well-worn novels. At\nnight, by the camp-fire, we played euchre and seven-up to strengthen the\nmind\u2014and played them with cards so greasy and defaced that only a whole\nsummer\u2019s acquaintance with them could enable the student to tell the ace\nof clubs from the jack of diamonds.\n\nWe never slept in our \u201chouse.\u201d It never occurred to us, for one thing;\nand besides, it was built to hold the ground, and that was enough. We\ndid not wish to strain it.\n\n\n                           SELLING OUT A MINE\n\nThe Gould & Curry claim comprised twelve hundred feet, and it all\nbelonged originally to the two men whose name it bears. Mr. Curry owned\ntwo-thirds of it\u2014and he said that he sold it out for twenty-five hundred\ndollars in cash, and an old plug horse that ate up his market value in\nhay and barley in seventeen days by the watch. And he said that Gould\nsold out for a pair of second-hand government blankets and a bottle of\nwhisky that killed nine men in three hours, and that an unoffending\nstranger that smelt the cork was disabled for life. Four years afterward\nthe mine thus disposed of was worth in the San Francisco market seven\nmillion six hundred thousand dollars in gold coin.\n\n\n                         BUCK FANSHAW\u2019S FUNERAL\n\nThere was a grand time over Buck Fanshaw when he died. He was a\nrepresentative citizen. He had \u201ckilled his man\u201d\u2014not in his own quarrel,\nit is true, but in defence of a stranger unfairly beset by numbers. He\nhad kept a sumptuous saloon. He had been the proprietor of a dashing\nhelpmeet whom he could have discarded without the formality of a\ndivorce. He had a high position in the fire department and had been a\nvery Warwick in politics. When he died there was great lamentation\nthroughout the town, but especially in the vast bottom stratum of\nsociety.\n\nOn the inquest it was shown that Buck Fanshaw, in the delirium of a\nwasting typhoid fever, had taken arsenic, shot himself through the body,\ncut his throat, and jumped out of a four-story window and broken his\nneck\u2014and after due deliberation, the jury, sad and tearful, but with\nintelligence unblinded by its sorrow, brought in a verdict of death \u201cby\nthe visitation of God.\u201d What could the world do without juries?\n\nProdigious preparations were made for the funeral. All the vehicles in\ntown were hired, all the saloons put in mourning, all the municipal and\nfire-company flags hung at half-mast, and all the firemen ordered to\nmuster in uniform and bring their machines duly draped in black. Now\u2014let\nit be remarked in parenthesis\u2014as all the people of the earth had\nrepresentative adventures in the Silverland, and as each adventurer had\nbrought the slang of his nation or of his locality with him, the\ncombination made the slang of Nevada the richest and the most infinitely\nvaried and copious that had ever existed anywhere in the world, perhaps,\nexcept in the mines of California in the \u201cearly days.\u201d Slang was the\nlanguage of Nevada. It was hard to preach a sermon without it, and be\nunderstood. Such phrases as \u201cYou bet!\u201d \u201cOh, no, I reckon not.\u201d \u201cNo Irish\nneed apply,\u201d and a hundred others, became so common as to fall from the\nlips of a speaker unconsciously\u2014and very often when they did not touch\nthe subject under discussion and consequently failed to mean anything.\n\nAfter Buck Fanshaw\u2019s inquest, a meeting of the short-haired brotherhood\nwas held, for nothing could be done on the Pacific coast without a\npublic meeting and an expression of sentiment. Regretful resolutions\nwere passed and various committees appointed; among others, a committee\nof one was deputed to call on the minister, a fragile, gentle, spiritual\nnew fledgling from an Eastern theological seminary, and as yet\nunacquainted with the ways of the mines. The committeeman, \u201cScotty\u201d\nBriggs, made his visit; and in after days it was worth something to hear\nthe minister tell about it. Scotty was a stalwart rough, whose customary\nsuit, when on weighty official business, like committee work, was a fire\nhelmet, flaming red flannel shirt, patent leather belt with spanner and\nrevolver attached, coat hung over arm, and pants stuffed into boot tops.\nHe formed something of a contrast to the pale theological student. It is\nfair to say of Scotty, however, in passing, that he had a warm heart,\nand a strong love for his friends, and never entered into a quarrel when\nhe could reasonably keep out of it. Indeed, it was commonly said that\nwhen ever one of Scotty\u2019s fights was investigated, it always turned out\nthat it had originally been no affair of his, but out of native\ngood-heartedness he had dropped in of his own accord to help the man who\nwas getting the worst of it. He and Buck Fanshaw were bosom friends, for\nyears, and had often taken adventurous \u201cpotluck\u201d together. On one\noccasion, they had thrown off their coats and taken the weaker side in a\nfight among strangers, and after gaining a hard earned victory, turned\nand found that the men they were helping had deserted early and not only\nthat, but had stolen their coats and made off with them! But to return\nto Scotty\u2019s visit to the minister. He was on a sorrowful mission, now,\nand his face was the picture of woe. Being admitted to the presence he\nsat down before the clergyman, placed his fire hat on an unfinished\nmanuscript sermon under the minister\u2019s nose, took from it a red silk\nhandkerchief, wiped his brow and heaved a sigh of dismal impressiveness,\nexplanatory of his business. He choked, and even shed tears; but with an\neffort he mastered his voice and said in lugubrious tones:\n\n\u201cAre you the duck that runs the gospel-mill next door?\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I the\u2014pardon me, I believe I do not understand?\u201d\n\nWith another sigh and a half-sob, Scotty rejoined:\n\n\u201cWhy, you see, we are in a bit of trouble, and the boys thought maybe\nyou would give us a lift, if we\u2019d tackle you\u2014that is, if I\u2019ve got the\nrights of it and you are the head clerk of the doxology-works next\ndoor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the shepherd in charge of the flock whose fold is next door.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe which?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe spiritual adviser of the little company of believers whose\nsanctuary adjoins these premises.\u201d\n\nScotty scratched his head, reflected a moment, and then said:\n\n\u201cYou rather hold over me, pard. I reckon I can\u2019t call that hand. Ante\nand pass the buck.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow? I beg pardon. What did I understand you to say?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve ruther got the bulge on me. Or may\u2019be we\u2019ve both got the\nbulge, somehow. You don\u2019t smoke me and I don\u2019t smoke you. You see, one\nof the boys has passed in his checks, and we want to give him a good\nsend-off, and so the thing I\u2019m on now is to roust out somebody to jerk a\nlittle chin-music for us and waltz him through handsome.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy friend, I seem to grow more and more bewildered. Your observations\nare wholly incomprehensible to me. Cannot you simplify them in some way?\nAt first I thought perhaps I understood you, but I grope now. Would it\nnot expedite matters if you restricted yourself to categorical\nstatements of facts, unencumbered with obstructive accumulations of\nmetaphor and allegory?\u201d\n\nAnother pause, and more reflection. Then, said Scotty:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to pass, I judge.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve raised me out, pard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still fail to catch your meaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, that last lead of yourn is too many for me\u2014that\u2019s the idea. I\ncan\u2019t neither trump nor follow suit.\u201d\n\nThe clergyman sank back in his chair perplexed. Scotty leaned his head\non his hand and gave himself up to thought. Presently his face came up,\nsorrowful, but confident.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it now, so\u2019s you can savvy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we want is a\ngospel-sharp. See?\u201d\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d\n\n\u201cGospel-sharp. Parson.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! Why did you not say so before? I am a clergyman\u2014a parson.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you talk! You see my blind and straddle it like a man. Put it\nthere!\u201d\u2014extending a brawny paw, which closed over the minister\u2019s small\nhand and gave it a shake indicative of fraternal sympathy and fervent\ngratification.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re all right, pard. Let\u2019s start fresh. Don\u2019t you mind my\nshuffling a little\u2014becuz we\u2019re in a power of trouble. You see, one of\nthe boys has gone up the flume\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGone where?\u201d\n\n\u201cUp the flume\u2014throwed up the sponge, you understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrown up the sponge?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014kicked the bucket\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u2014has departed to that mysterious country from whose bourne no\ntraveler returns.\u201d\n\n\u201cReturn! I reckon not. Why, pard, he\u2019s _dead!_\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you do? Well I thought maybe you might be getting tangled some\nmore. Yes, you see he\u2019s dead again\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c_Again!_ Why, has he ever been dead before?\u201d\n\n\u201cDead before? No! Do you reckon a man has got as many lives as a cat?\nBut you bet you, he\u2019s awful dead now, poor old boy, and I wish I\u2019d never\nseen this day. I don\u2019t want no better friend than Buck Fanshaw. I knowed\nhim by the back; and when I know a man and like him, I freeze to him\u2014you\nhear _me_. Take him all round, pard, there never was a bullier man in\nthe mines. No man ever knowed Buck Fanshaw to go back on a friend. But\nit\u2019s all up, you know, it\u2019s all up. It _ain\u2019t_ no use. They\u2019ve scooped\nhim.\u201d\n\n\u201cScooped him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014death has. Well, well, well, we\u2019ve got to give him up. Yes, indeed.\nIt\u2019s a kind of a hard world, after all, _ain\u2019t_ it? But pard, he was a\nrustler! You ought to see him get started once. He was a bully boy with\na glass eye! Just spit in his face and give him room according to his\nstrength, and it was just beautiful to see him peel and go in. He was\nthe worst son of a thief that ever drawed breath. Pard, he was _on_ it!\nHe was on it bigger than an Injun!\u201d\n\n\u201cOn it? On what?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the shoot. On the shoulder. On the fight, you understand. _He_\ndidn\u2019t give a continental for _any_ body. _Beg_ your pardon, friend, for\ncoming so near saying a cuss-word\u2014but you see I\u2019m on an awful strain, in\nthis palaver, on account of having to cramp down and draw everything so\nmild. But we\u2019ve got to give him up. There ain\u2019t any getting around that,\nI don\u2019t reckon. Now if we can get you to help plant him\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPreach the funeral discourse? Assist at the obsequies?\u201d\n\n\u201cObs\u2019quies is good. Yes. That\u2019s it\u2014that\u2019s our little game. We are going\nto get the thing up regardless, you know. He was always nifty himself,\nand so you bet you his funeral ain\u2019t going to be no slouch\u2014solid silver\ndoor-plate on his coffin, six plumes on the hearse, and one nigger on\nthe box in a biled shirt and a plug hat\u2014how\u2019s that for high? And we\u2019ll\ntake care of _you_ pard. We\u2019ll fix you all right. There\u2019ll be a kerridge\nfor you; and whatever you want, you just \u2019scape out and we\u2019ll \u2019tend to\nit. We\u2019ve got a shebang fixed up for you to stand behind, in No. 1\u2019s\nhouse, and don\u2019t you be afraid. Just go in and toot your horn, if you\ndon\u2019t sell a clam. Put Buck through as bully as you can, pard, for\nanybody that knowed him will tell you that he was one of the whitest men\nthat was ever in the mines. You can\u2019t draw it too strong. He never could\nstand it to see things going wrong. He\u2019s done more to make this town\nquiet and peaceable than any man in it. I\u2019ve seen him lick four Greasers\nin eleven minutes, myself. If a thing wanted regulating, _he_ warn\u2019t a\nman to go browsing around for somebody to do it, but he would prance in\nand regulate it himself. He warn\u2019t a Catholic. Scasely. He was down on\n\u2019em. His word was \u2018No Irish need apply!\u2019 But it didn\u2019t make no\ndifference about that when it came down to what a man\u2019s rights was\u2014and\nso, when some roughs jumped the Catholic boneyard and started in to\nstake out town lots in it he _went_ for \u2019em! And he _cleaned_ \u2019em, too!\nI was there, pard, and I seen it myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was very well, indeed\u2014at least the impulse was\u2014whether the act was\nstrictly defensible or not. Had deceased any religious convictions? That\nis to say, did he feel a dependence upon, or acknowledge allegiance to a\nhigher power?\u201d\n\nMore reflection.\n\n\u201cI reckon you\u2019ve stumped me again, pard. Could you say it over once\nmore, and say it slow?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, to simplify it somewhat, was he, or rather had he ever been\nconnected with any organization sequestered for secular concerns and\ndevoted to self-sacrifice in the interests of morality?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll down but nine\u2014set \u2019em up on the other alley, pard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did I understand you to say?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, you\u2019re most too many for me, you know. When you get in with your\nleft I hunt grass every time. Every time you draw, you fill; but I don\u2019t\nseem to have any luck. Let\u2019s have a new deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow? Begin again?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well. Was he a good man, and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2014I see that; don\u2019t put up another chip till I look at my hand. A\ngood man, says you? Pard, it ain\u2019t no name for it. He was the best man\nthat ever\u2014pard, you would have doted on that man. He could lam any\ngaloot of his inches in America. It was him that put down the riot last\nelection before it got a start; and everybody said he was the only man\nthat could have done it. He waltzed in with a spanner in one hand and a\ntrumpet in the other, and sent fourteen men home on a shutter in less\nthan three minutes. He had that riot all broke up and prevented nice\nbefore anybody ever got a chance to strike a blow. He was always for\npeace, and he would _have_ peace\u2014he could not stand disturbances. Pard,\nhe was a great loss to this town. It would please the boys if you would\nchip in something like that and do him justice. Here once when the Micks\ngot to throwing stones through the Methodis\u2019 Sunday-school windows, Buck\nFanshaw, all of his own notion, shut up his saloon and took a couple of\nsix-shooters and mounted guard over the Sunday-school. Says he, \u2018No\nIrish need Apply!\u2019 And they didn\u2019t. He was the bulliest man in the\nmountains, pard! He could run faster, jump higher, hit harder, and hold\nmore tanglefoot whisky without spilling than any man in seventeen\ncounties. Put that in, pard\u2014it\u2019ll please the boys more than anything you\ncould say. And you can say, pard, that he never shook his mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever shook his mother?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2014any of the boys will tell you so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, but why _should_ he shake her?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what _I_ say\u2014but some people does.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot people of any repute.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, some that averages pretty so-so.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my opinion the man that would offer personal violence to his own\nmother ought to\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCheese it, pard; you\u2019ve banked your ball clean outside the string. What\nI was drivin\u2019 at, was, that he never _throwed_ off on his mother\u2014don\u2019t\nyou see? No indeedy. He give her a house to live in, and town lots, and\nplenty of money; and he looked after her and took care of her all the\ntime; and when she was down with the smallpox I\u2019m d\u2014d if he didn\u2019t set\nup nights and nuss her himself! _Beg_ your pardon for saying it, but it\nhopped out too quick for yours truly. You\u2019ve treated me like a\ngentleman, pard, and I ain\u2019t the man to hurt your feelings intentional.\nI think you\u2019re white. I think you\u2019re a square man, pard. I like you, and\nI\u2019ll lick any man that don\u2019t. I\u2019ll lick him till he can\u2019t tell himself\nfrom a last year\u2019s corpse! Put it _there_!\u201d (Another fraternal\nhand-shake\u2014and exit).\n\nThe obsequies were all that \u201cthe boys\u201d could desire. Such a marvel of\nfuneral pomp had never been seen in Virginia. The plumed hearse, the\ndirge-breathing brass bands, the closed marts of business, the flags\ndrooping at half-mast, the long, plodding procession of uniformed secret\nsocieties, military battalions and fire companies, draped engines,\ncarriages of officials, and citizens in vehicles and on foot, attracted\nmultitudes of spectators to the sidewalks, roofs, and windows; and for\nyears afterward, the degree of grandeur attained by any civic display in\nVirginia was determined by comparison with Buck Fanshaw\u2019s funeral.\n\nScotty Briggs, as a pall-bearer and a mourner, occupied a prominent\nplace at the funeral, and when the sermon was finished and the last\nsentence of the prayer for the dead man\u2019s soul ascended, he responded in\na low voice, but with feeling:\n\n\u201cAMEN. No Irish need apply.\u201d\n\n\n                           AN ABANDONED TOWN\n\nWe lived in a small cabin on a verdant hillside, and there were not five\nother cabins in view over the wide expanse of hill and forest. Yet a\nflourishing city of two or three thousand population had occupied this\ngrassy dead solitude during the flush times of twelve or fifteen years\nbefore, and where our cabin stood had once been the heart of the teaming\nhive, the center of the city. When the mines gave out the town fell into\ndecay, and in a few years wholly disappeared\u2014streets, dwellings, shops,\neverything\u2014and left no sign. The grassy slopes were as green and smooth\nand desolate of life as if they had never been disturbed. The mere\nhandful of miners still remaining had seen the town spring up, spread,\ngrow, and flourish in its pride; and they had seen it sicken and die,\nand pass away like a dream. With it their hopes had died, and their zest\nof life. They had long ago resigned themselves to their exile, and\nceased to correspond with their distant friends or turn longing eyes\ntoward their distant homes. They had accepted banishment, forgotten the\nworld and been forgotten of the world. They were far from telegraphs and\nrailroads, and they stood, as it were, in a living grave, dead to the\nevents that stirred the globe\u2019s great populations, dead to the common\ninterests of men, isolated and outcast from brotherhood with their kind.\nIt was the most singular, and almost the most touching and melancholy\nexile that fancy can imagine.\n\n\n                           A HAWAIIAN TEMPLE\n\nNear by is an interesting ruin\u2014the meager remains of an ancient temple\u2014a\nplace where human sacrifices were offered up in those old by-gone days\nwhen the simple child of nature, yielding momentarily to sin when sorely\ntempted, acknowledged his error when calm reflection had shown it to\nhim, and came forward with noble frankness and offered up his\ngrandmother as an atoning sacrifice\u2014in those old days when the luckless\nsinner could keep on cleansing his conscience and achieving periodical\nhappiness as long as his relations held out; long, long before the\nmissionaries braved a thousand privations to come and make them\npermanently miserable by telling them how beautiful and how blissful a\nplace heaven is, and how nearly impossible it is to get there; and\nshowed the poor native how dreary a place perdition is and what\nunnecessarily liberal facilities there are for going to it; showed him\nhow, in his ignorance, he had gone and fooled away all his kinsfolk to\nno purpose; showed him what rapture it is to work all day long for fifty\ncents to buy food for next day with, as compared with fishing for a\npastime and lolling in the shade through eternal summer, and eating of\nthe bounty that nobody labored to provide but Nature. How sad it is to\nthink of the multitudes who have gone to their graves in this beautiful\nisland and never knew there was a hell.\n\n\n                          A HAWAIIAN STATESMAN\n\nThe President is the King\u2019s father. He is an erect, strongly built,\nmassive-featured, white-haired, tawny old gentleman of eighty years of\nage, or thereabouts. He was simply but well dressed, in a blue cloth\ncoat and white vest, and white pantaloons, without spot, dust, or\nblemish upon them. He bears himself with a calm, stately dignity, and is\na man of noble presence. He was a young man and a distinguished warrior\nunder that terrific fighter, Kamehameha I., more than half a century\nago. A knowledge of his career suggested some such thought as this:\n\u201cThis man, naked as the day he was born, and war-club and spear in hand,\nhas charged at the head of a horde of savages against other hordes of\nsavages more than a generation and a half ago, and reveled in slaughter\nand carnage; has worshiped wooden images on his devout knees; has seen\nhundreds of his race offered up in heathen temples as sacrifices to\nwooden idols, at a time when no missionary\u2019s foot had ever pressed this\nsoil, and he had never heard of the white man\u2019s God; has believed his\nenemy could secretly pray him to death; has seen the day, in his\nchildhood, when it was a crime punishable by death for a man to eat with\nhis wife, or for a plebeian to let his shadow fall upon the king\u2014and now\nlook at him an educated Christian; neatly and handsomely dressed; a\nhigh-minded, elegant gentleman; a traveler, in some degree, and one who\nhas been the honored guest of royalty in Europe; a man practiced in\nholding the reins of an enlightened government, and well versed in the\npolitics of his country and in general, practical information. Look at\nhim, sitting there presiding over the deliberations of a legislative\nbody, among whom are white men\u2014a grave, dignified, statesmanlike\npersonage, and as seemingly natural and fitted to the place as if he had\nbeen born in it and had never been out of it in his lifetime. How the\nexperiences of this old man\u2019s eventful life shame the cheap inventions\nof romance!\u201d\n\n\n                           HAWAIIAN RELIGION\n\nQuite a broad tract of land near the temple, extending from the sea to\nthe mountain, was sacred to the god Lono in olden times\u2014so sacred that\nif a common native set his sacrilegious foot upon it, it was judicious\nfor him to make his will, because his time had come. He might go around\nit by water, but he could not cross it. It was well sprinkled with pagan\ntemples and stocked with awkward, homely idols carved out of logs of\nwood. There was a temple devoted to prayers for rain\u2014and with fine\nsagacity it was placed at a point so well up on the mountain side that\nif you prayed there twenty-four times a day for rain you would be likely\nto get it every time. You would seldom get to your Amen before you would\nhave to hoist your umbrella.\n\n\n                        THE CRATER OF HALEAKALA\n\nPresently, vagrant white clouds came drifting along, high over the sea\nand the valley; then they came in couples and groups; then in imposing\nsquadrons; gradually joining their forces, they banked themselves\nsolidly together, a thousand feet under us, and _totally shut out land\nand ocean_\u2014not a vestige of _anything_ was left in view, but just a\nlittle of the rim of the crater, circling away from the pinnacle whereon\nwe sat (for a ghostly procession of wanderers from the filmy hosts\nwithout had drifted through a chasm in the crater wall and filed round\nand round, and gathered and sunk and blended together till the abyss was\nstored to the brim with a fleecy fog). Thus banked, motion ceased, and\nsilence reigned. Clear to the horizon, league on league, the snowy floor\nstretched without a break\u2014not level, but in rounded folds, with shallow\ncreases between, and here and there stately piles of vapory architecture\nlifting themselves aloft out of the common plain\u2014some near at hand, some\nin the middle distances, and others relieving the monotony of the remote\nsolitudes. There was little conversation, for the impressive scene\noverawed speech. I felt like the Last Man, neglected of the judgment,\nand left pinnacled in mid-heaven, a forgotten relic of a vanished world.\n\n\n\n\n                     _FROM_ \u201cTHE GILDED AGE\u201d (1873)\n\n\n                      COLONEL SELLER\u2019S GREAT IDEA\n\nWashington was not able to ignore the cold entirely. He was nearly as\nclose to the stove as he could get, and yet he could not persuade\nhimself that he felt the slightest heat, notwithstanding the isinglass\ndoor was still gently and serenely glowing. He tried to get a trifle\ncloser to the stove, and the consequence was he tripped the supporting\npoker and the stove-door tumbled to the floor. And then there was a\nrevelation\u2014there was nothing in the stove but a lighted tallow candle!\n\nThe poor youth blushed and felt as if he must die with shame. But the\nColonel was only disconcerted for a moment\u2014he straightaway found his\nvoice again:\n\n\u201cA little idea of my own, Washington\u2014one of the greatest things in the\nworld! You must write and tell your father about it\u2014don\u2019t forget that,\nnow. I have been reading up some European scientific reports\u2014friend of\nmine, Count Fugier sent them to me\u2014sends me all sorts of things from\nParis\u2014he thinks the world of me, Fugier does. Well, I saw that the\nAcademy of France had been testing the properties of heat, and they came\nto the conclusion that it was a non-conductor or something like that,\nand of course its influence must necessarily be deadly in nervous\norganizations with excitable temperaments, especially where there is any\ntendency toward rheumatic affections. Bless you, I saw in a moment what\nwas the matter with us, and says I, out goes your fires!\u2014no more slow\ntorture and certain death for me, sir. What you want is the _appearance_\nof heat, not the heat itself\u2014that\u2019s the idea. Well, how to do it was the\nnext thing. I just put my head to work, pegged away a couple of days,\nand here you are! Rheumatism? Why a man can\u2019t any more start a case of\nrheumatism in this house than he can shake an opinion out of a mummy!\nStove with a candle in it and transparent door\u2014that\u2019s it\u2014it has been the\nsalvation of this family. Don\u2019t you fail to write your father about it,\nWashington. And tell him the idea is mine\u2014I\u2019m no more conceited than\nmost people, I reckon, but you know it is human nature for a man to want\ncredit for a thing like that.\u201d\n\n\n                    COLONEL SELLERS LETS HIMSELF OUT\n\nThe supper at Colonel Sellers\u2019s was not sumptuous, in the beginning, but\nit improved on acquaintance. That is to say, that what Washington\nregarded at first sight as mere lowly potatoes, presently became\nawe-inspiring agricultural productions that had been reared in some\nducal garden beyond the sea, under the sacred eye of the duke himself,\nwho had sent them to Sellers; the bread was from corn which could be\ngrown in only one favored locality in the earth and only a favored few\ncould get it; the Rio coffee, which at first seemed execrable to the\ntaste, took to itself an improved flavor when Washington was told to\ndrink it slowly and not hurry what should be a lingering luxury in order\nto be fully appreciated\u2014it was from the private stores of a Brazilian\nnobleman with an unrememberable name. The Colonel\u2019s tongue was a\nmagician\u2019s wand that turned dried apples into figs and water into wine\nas easily as it could change a hovel into a palace and present poverty\ninto imminent future riches.\n\nWashington slept in a cold bed in a carpetless room and woke up in a\npalace in the morning; at least the palace lingered during the moment\nthat he was rubbing his eyes and getting his bearings\u2014and then it\ndisappeared and he recognized that the Colonel\u2019s inspiring talk had been\ninfluencing his dreams. Fatigue had made him sleep late; when he entered\nthe sitting-room he noticed that the old haircloth sofa was absent; when\nhe sat down to breakfast the Colonel tossed six or seven dollars in\nbills on the table, counted them over, said he was a little short and\nmust call upon his banker; then returned the bills to his wallet with\nthe indifferent air of a man who is used to money. The breakfast was not\nan improvement upon the supper, but the Colonel talked it up and\ntransformed it into an oriental feast. By and by, he said:\n\n\u201cI intend to look out for you, Washington, my boy. I hunted up a place\nfor you yesterday, but I am not referring to that, now\u2014that is a mere\nlivelihood\u2014mere bread and butter; but when I say I mean to look out for\nyou I mean something very different. I mean to put things in your way\nthat will make a mere livelihood a trifling thing. I\u2019ll put you in a way\nto make more money than you\u2019ll ever know what to do with. You\u2019ll be\nright here where I can put my hand on you when anything turns up. I\u2019ve\ngot some prodigious operations on foot; but I\u2019m keeping quiet; mum\u2019s the\nword; your old hand don\u2019t go around pow-wowing and letting everybody see\nhis k\u2019yards and find out his little game. But all in good time,\nWashington, all in good time. You\u2019ll see. Now, there\u2019s an operation in\ncorn that looks well. Some New York men are trying to get me to go into\nit\u2014buy up all the growing crops and just boss the market when they\nmature\u2014ah, I tell you, it\u2019s a great thing. And it only costs a trifle;\ntwo millions or two and a half will do it. I haven\u2019t exactly promised\nyet\u2014there\u2019s no hurry\u2014the more indifferent I seem, you know, the more\nanxious those fellows will get. And then there is the hog\nspeculation\u2014that\u2019s bigger still. We\u2019ve got quiet men at work\u201d (he was\nvery impressive here), \u201cmousing around, to get propositions out of all\nthe farmers in the whole West and Northwest for the hog crop, and other\nagents quietly getting propositions and terms out of all the\nmanufactories\u2014and don\u2019t you see, if we can get all the hogs and all the\nslaughter-houses into our hands on the dead quiet\u2014whew! it would take\nthree ships to carry the money. I\u2019ve looked into the thing\u2014calculated\nall the chances for and all the chances against, and though I shake my\nhead and hesitate and keep on thinking, apparently, I\u2019ve got my mind\nmade up that if the thing can be done on a capital of six millions,\nthat\u2019s the horse to put up money on! Why, Washington\u2014but what\u2019s the use\nof talking about it\u2014any man can see that there\u2019s whole Atlantic oceans\nof cash in it, gulfs and bays thrown in. But there\u2019s a bigger thing than\nthat, yet\u2014a bigger\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, Colonel, you can\u2019t want anything bigger!\u201d said Washington, his\neyes blazing. \u201cOh, I wish I could go into either of those speculations\u2014I\nonly wish I had money\u2014I wish I wasn\u2019t cramped and kept down and fettered\nwith poverty, and such prodigious chances lying right here in sight! Oh,\nit is a fearful thing to be poor. But don\u2019t throw away those things\u2014they\nare so splendid that I can see how sure they are. Don\u2019t throw them away\nfor something still better and maybe fail in it! I wouldn\u2019t, Colonel. I\nwould stick to these. I wish father were here and were his old self\nagain. Oh, he never in his life had such chances as these are. Colonel,\nyou _can\u2019t_ improve on these\u2014no man can improve on them!\u201d\n\nA sweet, compassionate smile played about the Colonel\u2019s features, and he\nleaned over the table with the air of a man who is \u201cgoing to show you\u201d\nand do it without the least trouble:\n\n\u201cWhy Washington, my boy, these things are nothing. They _look_ large\u2014of\ncourse they look large to a novice\u2014but to a man who has been all his\nlife accustomed to large operations\u2014pshaw! They\u2019re well enough to while\naway an idle hour with, or furnish a bit of employment that will give a\ntrifle of idle capital a chance to earn its bread while it is waiting\nfor something to _do_, but\u2014now just listen a moment\u2014just let me give you\nan idea of what we old veterans of commerce call \u2018business.\u2019 Here\u2019s the\nRothschilds\u2019 proposition\u2014this is between you and me, you understand\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nWashington nodded three or four times impatiently, and his glowing eyes\nsaid, \u201cYes, yes\u2014hurry\u2014I understand\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014\u2014for I wouldn\u2019t have it get out for a fortune. They want me to go in\nwith them on the sly\u2014agent was here two weeks ago about it\u2014go in on the\nsly\u201d (voice down to an impressive whisper, now) \u201cand buy up a hundred\nand thirteen wildcat banks in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, and\nMissouri\u2014notes of these banks are at all sorts of discount now\u2014average\ndiscount of the hundred and thirteen is forty-four per cent.\u2014buy them\nall up, you see, and then all of a sudden let the cat out of the bag!\nWhiz! the stock of every one of those wildcats would spin up to a\ntremendous premium before you could turn a handspring\u2014profit on the\nspeculation not a dollar less than forty millions!\u201d (An eloquent pause\nwhile the marvelous vision settled into W.\u2019s focus.) \u201cWhere\u2019s your hogs\nnow! Why, my dear innocent boy, we would just sit down on the front\ndoorsteps and peddle banks like lucifer matches!\u201d\n\nWashington finally got his breath and said:\n\n\u201cOh, it is perfectly wonderful! Why couldn\u2019t these things have happened\nin father\u2019s day. And I\u2014it\u2019s of no use\u2014they simply lie before my face and\nmock me. There is nothing for me to do but to stand helpless and see\nother people reap the astonishing harvest.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind, Washington, don\u2019t you worry. I\u2019ll fix you. There\u2019s plenty\nof chances. How much money have you got?\u201d\n\nIn the presence of so many millions, Washington could not keep from\nblushing when he had to confess that he had but eighteen dollars in the\nworld.\n\n\u201cWell, all right\u2014don\u2019t despair. Other people had been obliged to begin\nwith less. I have a small idea that may develop into something for us\nboth, all in good time. Keep your money close and add to it. I\u2019ll make\nit breed. I\u2019ve been experimenting (to pass away the time) on a little\npreparation for curing sore eyes\u2014a kind of decoction nine-tenths water\nand the other tenth drugs that don\u2019t cost more than a dollar a barrel;\nI\u2019m still experimenting; there\u2019s one ingredient wanted yet to perfect\nthe thing, and somehow I can\u2019t just manage to hit upon the thing that\u2019s\nnecessary, and I don\u2019t dare talk with a chemist, of course. But I\u2019m\nprogressing, and before many weeks I wager the country will ring with\nthe fame of Beriah Sellers\u2019 Infallible Imperial Oriental Optic Liniment\nand Salvation for Sore Eyes\u2014the Medical Wonder of the Age! Small bottles\nfifty cents, large ones a dollar. Average cost, five and seven cents for\nthe two sizes. The first year sell, say, ten thousand bottles in\nMissouri, seven thousand in Iowa, three thousand in Arkansas, four\nthousand in Kentucky, six thousand in Illinois, and say twenty-five\nthousand in the rest of the country. Total, fifty-five thousand bottles;\nprofit clear of all expenses, twenty thousand dollars at the very lowest\ncalculation. All the capital needed is to manufacture the first two\nthousand bottles\u2014say a hundred and fifty dollars\u2014then the money would\nbegin to flow in. The second year, sales would reach 200,000\nbottles\u2014clear profit, say, $75,000\u2014and in the meantime the great factory\nwould be building in St. Louis, to cost, say, $100,000. The third year\nwe could easily sell 1,000,000 bottles in the United States and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, splendid!\u201d said Washington. \u201cLet\u2019s commence right away\u2014let\u2019s\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014\u20141,000,000 bottles in the United States\u2014profit at least $350,000\u2014and\n_then_ it would begin to be time to turn our attention toward the _real_\nidea of the business.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe _real_ idea of it! Ain\u2019t $350,000 a year pretty real\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStuff! Why, what an infant you are, Washington\u2014what a guileless,\nshortsighted, easily-contented innocent you are, my poor little\ncountry-bred know-nothing! Would I go to all that trouble and bother for\nthe poor crumbs a body might pick up in _this_ country? Now do I look\nlike a man who\u2014does my history suggest that I am a man who deals in\ntrifles, contents himself with the narrow horizon that hems in the\ncommon herd, sees no further than the end of his nose? Now, _you_ know\nthat that is not me. Couldn\u2019t be me. _You_ ought to know that if I throw\nmy time and abilities into a patent medicine, it\u2019s a patent medicine\nwhose field of operations is the solid earth! its clients the swarming\nnations that inhabit it! Why what is the republic of America for an\neye-water country? Lord bless you, it is nothing but a barren highway\nthat you\u2019ve got to cross to get _to_ the true eye-water market! Why,\nWashington, in the Oriental countries people swarm like the sands of the\ndesert; every square mile of land upholds its thousands upon thousands\nof struggling human creatures\u2014and every separate and individual devil of\nthem\u2019s got the ophthalmia! It\u2019s as natural to them as noses are, and\nsin. It\u2019s born with them, it stays with them, that\u2019s all that some of\nthem have left when they die. Three years of introductory trade in the\nOrient and what will be the result? Why, our headquarters would be in\nConstantinople and our hindquarters in Further India! Factories and\nwarehouses in Cairo, Ispahan, Bagdad, Damascus, Jerusalem, Yedo, Peking,\nBangkok, Delhi, Bombay, and Calcutta! Annual income\u2014well, God only knows\nhow many millions and millions apiece!\u201d\n\nWashington was so dazed, so bewildered\u2014his heart and his eyes had\nwandered so far away among the strange lands beyond the seas, and such\navalanches of coin and currency had fluttered and jingled confusedly\ndown before him, that he was now as one who had been whirling round and\nround for a time, and stopping all at once, finds his surroundings still\nwhirling and all objects a dancing chaos. However, little by little the\nSellers family cooled down and crystallized into shape, and the poor\nroom lost its glitter and resumed its poverty. Then the youth found his\nvoice and begged Sellers to drop everything and hurry up the eye-water;\nand he got out his eighteen dollars and tried to force it upon the\nColonel\u2014pleaded with him to take it\u2014implored him to do it. But the\nColonel would not; said he would not need the capital (in his native\nmagnificent way he called that eighteen dollars capital) till the\neye-water was an accomplished fact. He made Washington easy in his mind,\nthough, by promising that he would call for it just as soon as the\ninvention was finished, and he added the glad tidings that nobody but\njust they two should be admitted to a share in the speculation.\n\nWhen Washington left the breakfast table he worshiped that man.\n\n\n\n\n               _FROM_ \u201cADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER\u201d (1874\u20135)\n\n\n                       A SPECULATION IN WHITEWASH\n\nSaturday morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and\nfresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if\nthe heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in\nevery face and a spring in every step. The locust trees were in bloom\nand the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond\nthe village and above it, was green with vegetation, and it lay just far\nenough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.\n\nTom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a\nlong-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and\na deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board\nfence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a\nburden. Sighing he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost\nplank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant\nwhitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed\nfence, and sat down on a tree box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at\nthe gate with a tin pail, and singing \u201cBuffalo Gals.\u201d Bringing water\nfrom the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom\u2019s eyes, before,\nbut now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company\nat the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there\nwaiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarreling, fighting,\nskylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred\nand fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an\nhour\u2014and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:\n\n\u201cSay, Jim, I\u2019ll fetch the water if you\u2019ll whitewash some.\u201d\n\nJim shook his head and said:\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an\u2019 git dis water\nan\u2019 not stop foolin\u2019 \u2019roun\u2019 wid anybody. She say she spec Mars Tom gwine\nto ax me to whitewash, an\u2019 so she tole me go \u2019long an\u2019 \u2019tend to my own\nbusiness\u2014she \u2019lowed _she\u2019d_ \u2019tend to de whitewashin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That\u2019s the way she always talks.\nGimme the bucket\u2014I won\u2019t be gone only a minute. _She_ won\u2019t ever know.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I dasn\u2019t Mars Tom. Ole missis she\u2019d take an\u2019 tar de head off\u2019n me.\n\u2019Deed she would.\u201d\n\n\u201c_She!_ She never licks anybody\u2014whacks \u2019em over the head with her\nthimble\u2014and who cares for that, I\u2019d like to know. She talks awful, but\ntalk don\u2019t hurt\u2014anyway it don\u2019t if she don\u2019t cry. Jim, I\u2019ll give you a\nmarvel. I\u2019ll give you a white alley!\u201d\n\nJim began to waver.\n\n\u201cWhite alley, Jim! And it\u2019s a bully taw.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy! Dat\u2019s a mighty gay marvel, _I_ tell you! But Mars Tom I\u2019s powerful\nafraid ole missis\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd besides, if you will I\u2019ll show you my sore toe.\u201d\n\nJim was only human\u2014this attraction was too much for him. He put down his\npail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing\ninterest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he was\nflying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was\nwhitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with\na slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.\n\nBut Tom\u2019s energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had\nplanned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys\nwould come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and\nthey would make a world of fun of him for having to work\u2014the very\nthought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and\nexamined it\u2014bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange\nof _work_, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of\npure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and\ngave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless\nmoment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great,\nmagnificent inspiration.\n\nHe took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in\nsight presently\u2014the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been\ndreading. Ben\u2019s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump\u2014proof enough that his\nheart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and\ngiving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned\nding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As\nhe drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned\nfar over to starboard and rounded to, ponderously and with laborious\npomp and circumstance\u2014for he was personating the \u201cBig Missouri,\u201d and\nconsidered himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was the boat and\ncaptain and engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing\non his own hurricane deck; giving the orders and executing them: \u201cStop\nher, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!\u201d The headway ran almost out and he drew up\nslowly toward the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cShip up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!\u201d His arms straightened and stiffened\ndown his sides.\n\n\u201cSet her back on the starboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!\nChow!\u201d His right hand, meantime, describing stately circles\u2014for it was\nrepresenting a forty-foot wheel.\n\n\u201cLet her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow chow!\u201d\nThe left hand began to describe circles.\n\n\u201cStop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on\nthe stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow!\nTing-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! _Lively_ now!\nCome\u2014out with your spring-line\u2014what\u2019re you about there! Take a turn\nround that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now\u2014let her\ngo! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! _Sh\u2019t! sh\u2019t! sh\u2019t!\u201d_\n(trying the gauge-cocks).\n\nTom went on whitewashing\u2014paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared\na moment and then said:\n\n\u201cHi-_yi. You\u2019re_ up a stump, ain\u2019t you!\u201d\n\nNo answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then\nhe gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as\nbefore. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom\u2019s mouth watered for the\napple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said\u2014\n\n\u201cHello, old chap, you got to work, hey?\u201d\n\nTom wheeled suddenly and said:\n\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s you Ben! I warn\u2019t noticing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay\u2014_I\u2019m_ going in a swimming, _I_ am. Don\u2019t you wish you could? But of\ncourse you\u2019d ruther _work_\u2014wouldn\u2019t you? Course you would!\u201d\n\nTom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:\n\n\u201cWhat do you call work?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, ain\u2019t _that_ work?\u201d\n\nTom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:\n\n\u201cWell, maybe it is, and maybe it ain\u2019t. All I know, is, it suits Tom\nSawyer.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come, now, you don\u2019t mean to let on that you _like_ it?\u201d\n\nThe brush continued to move.\n\n\u201cLike it? Well, I don\u2019t see why I oughtn\u2019t to like it. Does a boy get a\nchance to whitewash a fence every day?\u201d\n\nThat put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom\nswept his brush daintily\u2014added a touch here and there\u2014criticised the\neffect again\u2014Ben watching every move and getting more and more\ninterested, more and more absorbed. Presently he said:\n\n\u201cSay, Tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.\u201d\n\nTom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:\n\n\u201cNo\u2014no\u2014I reckon it wouldn\u2019t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly\u2019s awful\nparticular about this fence\u2014right here on the street, you know\u2014but if it\nwas the back fence I wouldn\u2019t mind and _she_ wouldn\u2019t. Yes, she\u2019s awful\nparticular about this fence; it\u2019s got to be done very careful; I reckon\nthere ain\u2019t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do the\nway it\u2019s got to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014is that so? Oh come, now\u2014lemme just try. Only just a little\u2014I\u2019d let\n_you_, if you was me, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cBen, I\u2019d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly\u2014well, Jim wanted to do\nit, but she wouldn\u2019t let him. Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn\u2019t let\nSid. Now don\u2019t you see how I\u2019m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence\nand anything was to happen to it\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shucks, I\u2019ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say\u2014I\u2019ll give you\nthe core of my apple.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, here\u2014\u2014 No, Ben, now don\u2019t. I\u2019m afeard\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you _all_ of it!\u201d\n\nTom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his\nheart. And while the late steamer \u201cBig Missouri\u201d worked and sweated in\nthe sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,\ndangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more\ninnocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every\nlittle while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time\nBen was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a\nkite, in good repair; and when _he_ played out, Johnny Miller bought in\nfor a dead rat and a string to swing it with\u2014and so on, and so on, hour\nafter hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a poor\npoverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in\nwealth. He had beside the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part\nof a jew\u2019s-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool\ncannon, a key that wouldn\u2019t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a\nglass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six\nfire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a\ndog-collar\u2014but no dog\u2014the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel,\nand a dilapidated old window-sash.\n\nHe had had a nice, good, idle time all the while\u2014plenty of company\u2014and\nthe fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn\u2019t run out of\nwhitewash, he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.\n\n\n                           TOM FALLS IN LOVE\n\nAs he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new\ngirl in the garden\u2014a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow hair\nplaited into two long tails, white summer frock and embroidered\npantalettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A\ncertain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a\nmemory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction; he\nhad regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor\nlittle evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had\nconfessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest\nboy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time\nshe had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is\ndone.\n\nHe worshiped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had\ndiscovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and\nbegan to \u201cshow off\u201d in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win\nher admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time; but\nby and by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic\nperformances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending\nher way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it,\ngrieving, and hoping she would tarry yet a while longer. She halted a\nmoment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great\nsigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up, right\naway, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she\ndisappeared.\n\n\n                                  HUCK\n\nHuckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps\nin fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to\nschool or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could\ngo fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it\nsuited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he\npleased; he was always the first that went barefoot in the spring and\nthe last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put on\nclean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything that\ngoes to make life precious, that boy had. So thought every harassed,\nhampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.\n\n\n                          THE PIRATES\u2019 ISLAND\n\nThey built a fire against the side of a great log, twenty or thirty\nsteps within the somber depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon\nin the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn \u201cpone\u201d stock\nthey had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild\nfree way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,\nfar from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to\ncivilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy\nglare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the\nvarnished foliage and festooning vines.\n\nGradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the\neyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the\nRed-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.\nThe Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had\nmore difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly,\nand lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them\nkneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at\nall, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they\nmight call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from Heaven....\n\nWhen Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and\nrubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool\ngray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the\ndeep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not a\nsound obtruded upon great Nature\u2019s meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood\nupon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire,\nand a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck\nstill slept.\n\n\n                          TOM LEARNS TO SMOKE\n\nAfter a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to learn to\nsmoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to try, too.\nSo Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never smoked\nanything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they \u201cbit\u201d the tongue,\nand were not considered manly anyway.\n\nNow they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,\ncharily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste,\nand they gagged a little, but Tom said:\n\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s just as easy! If I\u2019d a knowed _this_ was all, I\u2019d a learnt\nlong ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo would I,\u201d said Joe. \u201cIt\u2019s just nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, many a time I\u2019ve looked at people smoking, and thought \u2018well, I\nwish I could do that\u2019; but I never thought I could,\u201d said Tom.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the way with me, hain\u2019t it, Huck? You\u2019ve heard me talk just\nthat way\u2014haven\u2019t you Huck? I\u2019ll leave it to Huck if I haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014heaps of times,\u201d said Huck.\n\n\u201cWell, I have too,\u201d said Tom; \u201coh, hundreds of times. Once down by the\nslaughter-house. Don\u2019t you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and\nJohnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don\u2019t you remember,\nHuck, \u2019bout me saying that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s so,\u201d said Huck. \u201cThat was the day after I lost a white\nalley. No, \u2019twas the day before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2014I told you so,\u201d said Tom. \u201cHuck recollects it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,\u201d said Joe. \u201c_I_ don\u2019t feel\nsick.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither do I,\u201d said Tom. \u201c_I_ could smoke it all day. But I bet you\nJeff Thatcher couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cJeff Thatcher! Why, he\u2019d keel over just with two draws. Just let him\ntry it once. _He\u2019d_ see!\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet he would. And Johnny Miller\u2014I wish I could see Johnny Miller\ntackle it once.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t _I_!\u201d said Joe, \u201cWhy, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn\u2019t any\nmore do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch _him_.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Deed it would, Joe. Say\u2014I wish the boys could see us now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo do I.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay\u2014boys, don\u2019t say anything about it, and sometime when they\u2019re\naround, I\u2019ll come up to you and say \u2018Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.\u2019\nAnd you\u2019ll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn\u2019t anything, you\u2019ll\nsay, \u2018Yes, I got my _old_ pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain\u2019t\nvery good.\u2019 And I\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s all right, if it\u2019s _strong_\nenough.\u2019 And then you\u2019ll out with the pipes, and we\u2019ll light up just as\nca\u2019m, and then just see \u2019em look!\u201d\n\n\u201cBy jings, that\u2019ll be gay, Tom! I wish it was _now_!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo do I! And when we tell \u2019em we learned when we was off pirating,\nwon\u2019t they wish they\u2019d been along?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I reckon not! I\u2019ll just _bet_ they will!\u201d\n\nSo the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and grow\ndisjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvelously\nincreased. Every pore inside the boys\u2019 cheeks became a spouting\nfountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues\nfast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their\nthroats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings\nfollowed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,\nnow. Joe\u2019s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom\u2019s followed. Both\nfountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and\nmain. Joe said feebly:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.\u201d\n\nTom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you. You go over that way and I\u2019ll hunt around by the spring.\nNo, you needn\u2019t come, Huck\u2014we can find it.\u201d\n\nSo Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,\nand went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both\nvery pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had\nhad any trouble they had got rid of it.\n\nThey were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,\nand when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare\ntheirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well\u2014something they ate\nat dinner had disagreed with them.\n\n\n\n\n               _FROM_ \u201cTHE STOLEN WHITE ELEPHANT\u201d (1878)\n\n\n                         DESCRIBING AN ELEPHANT\n\n\u201cThere are cases in detective history to show that criminals have been\ndetected through peculiarities in their appetites. Now, what does this\nelephant eat? and how much?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, as to _what_ he eats\u2014he will eat _anything_. He will eat a man,\nhe will eat a Bible\u2014he will eat anything _between_ a man and a Bible.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood\u2014very good, indeed, but too general. Details are necessary\u2014details\nare the only valuable thing in our trade. Very well\u2014as to men: At one\nmeal\u2014or, if you prefer, during one day\u2014how many men will he eat, if\nfresh?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe would not care whether they were fresh or not; at a single meal he\nwould eat five ordinary men.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good; five men; we will put that down. What nationalities would he\nprefer?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is indifferent about nationalities. He prefers acquaintances, but is\nnot prejudiced against strangers.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good. Now, as to Bibles. How many Bibles would he eat at a meal?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe would eat an entire edition.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that is more exact. I will put that down. Very well; he likes men\nand Bibles; so far, so good. What else will he eat? I want particulars.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will leave Bibles to eat bricks, he will leave bricks to eat\nbottles, he will leave bottles to eat clothing, he will leave clothing\nto eat cats, he will leave cats to eat oysters, he will leave oysters to\neat ham, he will leave ham to eat sugar, he will leave sugar to eat pie,\nhe will leave pie to eat potatoes, he will leave potatoes to eat bran,\nhe will leave bran to eat hay, he will leave hay to eat oats, he will\nleave oats to eat rice, for he was mainly raised on it. There is nothing\nwhatever that he will not eat but European butter, and he would eat that\nif he could taste it.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good. General quantity at a meal\u2014say about\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, anywhere from a quarter to a half a ton.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he drinks\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything that is fluid. Milk, water, whisky, molasses, castor oil,\ncamphene, carbolic acid\u2014it is no use to go into particulars; whatever\nfluid occurs to you set it down. He will drink anything that is fluid,\nexcept European coffee.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                    _FROM_ \u201cA TRAMP ABROAD\u201d (1878\u20139)\n\n\n                                 WAGNER\n\nOne day we took the train and went down to Mannheim to see King Lear\nplayed in German. It was a mistake. We sat in our seats three whole\nhours and never understood anything but the thunder and lightning; and\neven that was reversed to suit German ideas, for the thunder came first\nand the lightning followed after.... Another time we went to Mannheim\nand attended a shivaree\u2014otherwise an opera\u2014the one called Lohengrin. The\nbanging and slamming and booming and crashing were something beyond\nbelief. The racking and pitiless pain of it remains stored up in my\nmemory alongside the memory of the time that I had my teeth fixed. There\nwere circumstances which made it necessary for me to stay through the\nfour hours to the end, and I stayed; but the recollection of that long,\ndragging, relentless season of suffering is indestructible. To have to\nendure it in silence, and sitting still, made it all the harder. I was\nin a railed compartment with eight or ten strangers, of the two sexes,\nand this compelled repression; yet at times the pain was so exquisite\nthat I could hardly keep the tears back. At those times, as the howlings\nand wailings and shriekings of the singers, and the ragings and roarings\nand explosions of the vast orchestra rose higher and higher, and wilder\nand wilder, and fiercer and fiercer, I could have cried if I had been\nalone. Those strangers would not have been surprised to see a man do\nsuch things who was being gradually skinned, but they would have\nmarveled at it here, and made remarks about it, no doubt, whereas there\nwas nothing in the present case which was an advantage over being\nskinned. There was a wait of half an hour at the end of the first act,\nand I could have gone out and rested during that time, but I could not\ntrust myself to do it, for I felt that I should desert and stay out.\nThere was another wait of half an hour toward nine o\u2019clock, but I had\ngone through so much by that time that I had no spirit left, and so had\nno desire but to be let alone.\n\nI do not wish to suggest that the rest of the people there were like me,\nfor, indeed, they were not. Whether it was that they naturally liked\nthat noise, or whether it was that they had learned to like it by\ngetting used to it, I did not at that time know; but they did like\nit\u2014this was plain enough. While it was going on they sat and looked rapt\nand grateful as cats do when one strokes their backs; and whenever the\ncurtain fell they rose to their feet, in one solid mighty multitude, and\nthe air was snowed thick with waving handkerchiefs, and hurricanes of\napplause swept the place. This was not comprehensible to me. Of course,\nthere were many people there who were not under compulsion to stay; yet\nthe tiers were as full at the close as they had been at the beginning.\nThis showed that the people liked it....\n\nI suppose there are two kinds of music\u2014one kind which one feels, just as\nan oyster might, and another sort which requires a higher faculty, a\nfaculty which must be assisted and developed by teaching. Yet if base\nmusic gives certain of us wings, why should we want any other? But we\ndo. We want it because the higher and better like it. But we want it\nwithout giving it the necessary time and trouble; so we climb into that\nupper tier, that dress circle, by a lie; we _pretend_ we like it. I know\nseveral of that sort of people\u2014and I propose to be one of them myself\nwhen I get home with my fine European education.\n\n\n                         MIDNIGHT ENTERTAINMENT\n\nAt last all sleepiness forsook me. I recognized the fact that I was\nhopelessly and permanently wide-awake. Wide-awake, and feverish and\nthirsty. When I had lain tossing there as long as I could endure it, it\noccurred to me that it would be a good idea to dress and go out in the\ngreat square and take a refreshing wash in the fountain, and smoke and\nreflect there until the remnant of the night was gone.\n\nI believed I could dress in the dark without waking Harris. I had\nbanished my shoes after the mouse, but my slippers would do for a summer\nnight. So I rose softly, and gradually got on everything\u2014down to one\nsock. I couldn\u2019t seem to get on the track of that sock, any way I could\nfix it. But I had to have it; so I went down on my hands and knees, with\none slipper on and the other in my hand, and began to paw gently around\nand rake the floor, but with no success. I enlarged my circle, and went\non pawing and raking. With every pressure of my knee, how the floor\ncreaked! and every time I chanced to rake against any article, it seemed\nto give out thirty-five or thirty-six times more noise than it would\nhave in the daytime. In those cases I always stopped and held my breath\ntill I was sure Harris had not awakened\u2014then I crept along again. I\nmoved on and on, but I could not find the sock; I could not seem to find\nanything but furniture. I could not remember that there was much\nfurniture in the room when I went to bed, but the place was alive with\nit now\u2014especially chairs\u2014chairs everywhere\u2014had a couple of families\nmoved in, in the meantime? And I never could seem to glance on one of\nthose chairs, but always struck it full and square with my head. My\ntemper rose, by steady and sure degrees, and as I pawed on and on, I\nfell to making vicious comments under my breath.\n\nFinally, with a venomous access of irritation, I said I would leave\nwithout the sock; so I rose up and made straight for the door\u2014as I\nsupposed\u2014and suddenly confronted my dim spectral image in the mirror. It\nstartled the breath out of me, for an instant; it was also showed me\nthat I was lost, and had no sort of idea where I was. When I realized\nthis, I was so angry that I had to sit down on the floor and take hold\nof something to keep from lifting the roof off with an explosion of\nopinion. If there had been only one mirror, it might possibly have\nhelped to locate me; but there were two, and two were as bad as a\nthousand; besides, these were on opposite sides of the room. I could see\nthe dim blur of the windows, but in my turned-around condition they were\nexactly where they ought not to be, and so they only confused me instead\nof helping me.\n\nI started to get up, and knocked down an umbrella; it made a noise like\na pistol-shot when it struck that hard, slick, carpetless floor; I\ngrated my teeth and held my breath\u2014Harris did not stir. I set the\numbrella slowly and carefully against the wall, but as soon as I took my\nhand away, its heel slipped from under it and down it came again with\nanother bang. I shrunk together and listened a moment in silent fury\u2014no\nharm done, everything quiet. With the most painstaking care and nicety I\nstood the umbrella up once more, took my hand away, and down it came\nagain.\n\nI have been strictly reared, but if it had not been so dark and solemn\nand awful there in that lonely, vast room, I do believe I should have\nsaid something then which could not have been put in a Sunday-school\nbook without injuring the sale of it. If my reasoning powers had not\nbeen already sapped dry by my harassments, I would have known better\nthan to try to set an umbrella on end on one of those glassy German\nfloors in the dark; it can\u2019t be done in the daytime without four\nfailures to one success. I had one comfort, though\u2014Harris was yet still\nand silent\u2014he had not stirred.\n\nThe umbrella could not locate me\u2014there were four standing around the\nroom, and all alike. I thought I would feel along the wall and find the\ndoor in that way. I rose up and began this operation, but raked down a\npicture. It was not a large one, but it made noise enough for a\npanorama. Harris gave out no sound, but I felt that if I experimented\nany further with the pictures I should be sure to wake him. Better give\nup trying to get out. Yes, I would find King Arthur\u2019s Round Table once\nmore\u2014I had already found it several times\u2014and used it for a base of\ndeparture on an exploring tour for my bed; if I could find my bed I\ncould find my water-pitcher. I would quench my raging thirst and turn\nin. So I started on my hands and knees, because I could go faster that\nway, and with more confidence, too, and not knock things down. By and by\nI found the table\u2014with my head\u2014rubbed the bruise a little, then rose up\nand started, with hands abroad and fingers spread, to balance myself. I\nfound a chair; then the wall; then another chair; then a sofa; then an\nalpenstock, then another sofa; this confounded me, for I had thought\nthere was only one sofa. I hunted up the table again and took a fresh\nstart; found some more chairs.\n\nIt occurred to me, now, as it ought to have done before, that as the\ntable was round, it was therefore no value as a place to aim from; so I\nmoved off once more and at random among the wilderness of chairs and\nsofas\u2014wandered off into unfamiliar regions, and presently knocked a\ncandlestick off a mantelpiece and knocked off a lamp, grabbed at the\nlamp and knocked off a water-pitcher with a rattling crash, and thought\nto myself, \u201cI\u2019ve found you at last\u2014I judged I was close upon you.\u201d\nHarris shouted \u201cmurder,\u201d and \u201cthieves,\u201d and finished with \u201cI\u2019m\nabsolutely drowned.\u201d\n\nThe crash had roused the house. Mr. X. pranced in, in his long\nnight-garment, with a candle, young Z. after him with another candle; a\nprocession swept in at another door, with candles and lanterns\u2014landlord\nand two German guests in their nightgowns, and a chambermaid in hers.\n\nI looked around; I was at Harris\u2019s bed, a sabbath day\u2019s journey from my\nown. There was only one sofa; it was against the wall; there was only\none chair where a body could get at it\u2014I had been revolving around it\nlike a planet, and colliding with it like a comet half the night.\n\nI explained how I had been employing myself, and why. Then the\nlandlord\u2019s party left, and the rest of us set about our preparations for\nbreakfast, for the dawn was ready to break. I glanced furtively at my\npedometer, and found I had made 47 miles. But I did not care, for I had\ncome out for a pedestrian tour anyway.\n\n\n                           FOREIGN QUOTATIONS\n\nI have a prejudice against people who print things in a foreign language\nand add no translation. When I am the reader, and the author considers\nme able to do the translating myself, he pays me quite a nice\ncompliment\u2014but if he would do the translating for me I would try to get\nalong without the compliment.\n\n\n                         REFLECTIONS ON THE ANT\n\nNow and then, while we rested, we watched the laborious ant at his work.\nI found nothing new in him\u2014certainly nothing to change my opinion of\nhim. It seems to me that in the matter of intellect the ant must be a\nstrangely overrated bird. During many summers, now, I have watched him,\nwhen I ought to have been in better business, and I have not yet come\nacross a living ant that seemed to have any more sense than a dead one.\nI refer to the ordinary ant, of course; I have had no experience of\nthose wonderful Swiss and African ones which vote, keep drilled armies,\nhold slaves, and dispute about religion. Those particular ants may be\nall that the naturalist paints them, but I am persuaded that the average\nant is a sham. I admit his industry, of course; he is the hardest\nworking creature in the world\u2014when anybody is looking\u2014but his\nleather-headedness is the point I make against him. He goes out\nforaging, he makes a capture, and then what does he do? Go home? No\u2014he\ngoes anywhere but home. He doesn\u2019t know where home is. His home may be\nonly three feet away,\u2014no matter, he can\u2019t find it. He makes his capture,\nas I have said; it is generally something which can be of no sort of use\nto himself or anybody else; it is usually seven times bigger than it\nought to be; he lifts it bodily up in the air by main force and starts;\nnot toward home, but in the opposite direction; not calmly and wisely,\nbut with a frantic haste which is wasteful of his strength; he fetches\nup against a pebble, and instead of going around it, he climbs over it\nbackwards dragging his booty after him, tumbles down on the other side,\njumps up in a passion, kicks the dust off his clothes, moistens his\nhands, grabs his property viciously, yanks it this way, then that,\nshoves it ahead of him a moment, turns tail and lugs it after him\nanother moment, gets madder and madder, then presently hoists it into\nthe air and goes tearing away in an entirely new direction; comes to a\nweed; it never occurs to him to go around it; no, he must climb it; and\nhe does climb it, dragging his worthless property to the top\u2014which is as\nbright a thing to do as it would be for me to carry a sack of flour from\nHeidelberg to Paris by way of Strasburg steeple; when he gets up there\nhe finds that that is not the place; takes a cursory glance at the\nscenery and either climbs down again or tumbles down, and starts off\nonce more\u2014as usual in a new direction. At the end of half an hour, he\nfetches up within six inches of the place he started from and lays his\nburden down; meantime he has been over all the ground for two yards\naround, and climbed all the weeds and pebbles he came across. Now he\nwipes the sweat from his brow, strokes his limbs, and then marches\naimlessly off, in as violent a hurry as ever. He traverses a good deal\nof zig-zag country, and by and by stumbles on his same booty again. He\ndoes not remember ever having seen it before; he looks around to see\nwhich is not the way home, grabs his bundle and starts; he goes through\nthe same adventures he had before; finally stops to rest, and a friend\ncomes along. Evidently the friend remarks that a last year\u2019s grasshopper\nleg is a very noble acquisition, and inquires where he got it. Evidently\nthe proprietor does not remember exactly where he did get it, but thinks\nhe got it \u201caround here somewhere.\u201d Evidently the friend contracts to\nhelp him freight it home. Then, with a judgment peculiarly antic (pun\nnot intentional), they take hold of opposite ends of that grasshopper\nleg and begin to tug with all their might in opposite directions.\nPresently they take a rest and confer together. They decide that\nsomething is wrong, they can\u2019t make out what. Then they go at it again,\njust as before. Same result. Mutual recriminations follow. Evidently\neach accuses the other of being an obstructionist. They warm up, and the\ndispute ends in a fight. They lock themselves together and chew each\nother\u2019s jaws for a while; then they roll and tumble on the ground till\none loses a horn or a leg and has to haul off for repairs. They make up\nand go to work again in the same old insane way, but the crippled ant is\nat a disadvantage; tug as he may, the other one drags off the booty and\nhim at the end of it. Instead of giving up, he hangs on, and gets his\nshins bruised against every obstruction that comes in the way. By and\nby, when that grasshopper leg has been dragged all over the same old\nground once more, it is finally dumped at about the spot where it\noriginally lay, the two perspiring ants inspect it thoughtfully and\ndecide that dried grasshopper legs are a poor sort of property after\nall, and then each starts off in a different direction to see if he\ncan\u2019t find an old nail or something else that is heavy enough to afford\nentertainment and at the same time valueless enough to make an ant want\nto own it.\n\n\n                        FOREIGN QUOTATIONS AGAIN\n\nWhen really learned men write books for other learned men to read, they\nare justified in using as many learned words as they please\u2014their\naudience will understand them; but a man that writes a book for the\ngeneral public to read is not justified in disfiguring his pages with\nuntranslated foreign expressions. It is an insolence toward the majority\nof the purchasers, for it is a very frank and impudent way of saying,\n\u201cGet the translations made yourself, if you want them; this book is not\nwritten for the ignorant classes.\u201d There are men who know a foreign\nlanguage so well and have used it so long in their daily life that they\nseem to discharge whole volleys of it into their English writings\nunconsciously, and so they omit to translate, as much as half the time.\nThat is a great cruelty to nine out of ten of the man\u2019s readers. What is\nthe excuse for this? The writer would say he only uses the foreign\nlanguage where the delicacy of his point cannot be conveyed in English.\nVery well, then he writes his best things for the tenth man, and he\nought to warn the other nine not to buy his book. However, the excuse he\noffers is at least an excuse; but there is another set of men who ...\nknow a _word_ here and there, of a foreign language, or a few beggarly\nlittle three-word phrases, filched from the back of the dictionary, and\nthese they are continually peppering into their literature, with a\npretense of knowing that language\u2014what excuse can they offer? The\nforeign words and phrases which they use have their exact equivalents in\na nobler language\u2014English; yet they think they \u201cadorn their page\u201d when\nthey say _Strasse_ for street, and _Bahnhof_ for railway station, and so\non\u2014flaunting these fluttering rags of poverty in the reader\u2019s face, and\nimagining he will be ass enough to take them for the sign of untold\nriches held in reserve.\n\n\n                              THE JUNGFRAU\n\nThere was something subduing in the influence of that silent and solemn\nand awful presence; one seemed to meet the immutable, the\nindestructible, the eternal, face to face, and to feel the trivial and\nfleeting nature of his own existence the more sharply by the contrast.\nOne had the sense of being under the brooding contemplation of a spirit,\nnot an inert mass of rocks and ice\u2014a spirit which had looked down,\nthrough the slow drift of the ages, upon a million vanished races of\nmen, and judged them; and would judge a million more\u2014and still be there,\nwatching, unchanged and unchangeable, after all life should be gone and\nthe earth have become a vacant desolation.\n\nWhile I was feeling these things, I was groping, without knowing it,\ntoward an understanding of what the spell is which people find in the\nAlps, and in no other mountains\u2014that strange, deep, nameless influence,\nwhich once felt, cannot be forgotten\u2014once felt, leaves always behind it\na restless longing to feel it again\u2014a longing which is like\nhomesickness; a grieving, haunting yearning, which will plead, implore,\nand persecute till it has its will. I met dozens of people, imaginative\nand unimaginative, cultivated and uncultivated, who had come from far\ncountries and roamed through the Swiss Alps year after year\u2014they could\nnot explain why. They had come first, they said, out of idle curiosity,\nbecause everybody talked about it; they had come since because they\ncould not help it, and they should keep on coming, while they lived, for\nthe same reason; they had tried to break their chains and stay away, but\nit was futile; now, they had no desire to break them. Others came nearer\nformulating what they felt: they said they could find perfect rest and\npeace nowhere else when they were troubled; all frets and worries and\nchafings sank to sleep in the presence of the benignant serenity of the\nAlps: the Great Spirit of the Mountain breathed his own peace upon their\nhurt minds and sore hearts, and healed them; they could not think base\nthoughts or do mean and sordid things here, before the visible throne of\nGod.\n\n\n                        CLIMBING THE GEMMI PASS\n\nWhen we began that ascent, we could see a microscopic chalet perched\naway up against heaven on what seemed to be the highest mountain near\nus. It was on our right, across the narrow head of the valley. But when\nwe got up abreast it on its own level, mountains were towering high\nabove on every hand, and we saw that its altitude was just about that of\nthe little Gasternthal which we had visited the evening before. Still it\nseemed a long way up in the air, in that waste and lonely wilderness of\nrocks. It had an unfenced grass-plot in front of it which seemed about\nas big as a billiard table, and this grass plot slanted so sharply\ndownwards, and was so brief, and ended so exceedingly soon at the verge\nof the absolute precipice, that it was a shuddery thing to think of a\nperson\u2019s venturing to trust his foot on an incline so situated at all.\nSuppose a man stepped on an orange peel in that yard; there would be\nnothing for him to seize; nothing could keep him from rolling; five\nrevolutions would bring him to the edge, and over he would go. What a\nfrightful distance he would fall!\u2014for there are very few birds that fly\nas high as his starting-point. He would strike and bounce, two or three\ntimes, on his way down, but this would be no advantage to him. I would\nas soon take an airing on the slant of a rainbow as in such a front\nyard. I would rather, in fact, for the distance down would be about the\nsame, and it is pleasanter to slide than to bounce.\n\n\n                         DESCENT OF GEMMI PASS\n\nWe began our descent, now, by the most remarkable road I have ever seen.\nIt wound in corkscrew curves down the face of the colossal precipice\u2014a\nnarrow way, with always the solid rock wall at one elbow, and\nperpendicular nothingness at the other. We met an everlasting procession\nof guides, porters, mules, litters, and tourists climbing up this steep\nand muddy path, and there was no room to spare when you had to pass a\ntolerably fat mule. I always took the inside, when I heard or saw the\nmule coming, and flattened myself against the wall. I preferred the\ninside, of course, but I should have had to take it anyhow, because the\nmule prefers the outside. A mule\u2019s preference\u2014on a precipice\u2014is a thing\nto be respected. Well, his choice is always the outside. His life is\nmostly devoted to carrying bulky panniers and packages which rest\nagainst his body\u2014therefore he is habituated to taking the outside edge\nof mountain paths, to keep his bundles from rubbing against rocks or\nbanks on the other. When he goes into the passenger business he absurdly\nclings to his old habit, and keeps one leg of his passenger always\ndangling over the great deeps of the lower world while that passenger\u2019s\nheart is in the highlands, so to speak. More than once I saw a mule\u2019s\nhind foot cave out over the outer edge and send earth and rubbish into\nthe bottomless abyss; and I noticed that upon these occasions the rider,\nwhether male or female, looked tolerably unwell.\n\nThere was one place where an 18\u2013inch breadth of light masonry had been\nadded to the verge of the path, and as there was a very sharp turn,\nhere, a panel of fencing had been set up there at some ancient time, as\na protection. This panel was old and gray and feeble, and the light\nmasonry had been loosened by recent rains. A young American girl came\nalong on a mule, and in making the turn the mule\u2019s hind foot caved all\nthe loose masonry and one of the fence posts overboard; the mule gave a\nviolent lurch inboard to save himself, and succeeded in the effort, but\nthe girl turned as white as the snow of Mont Blanc for a moment.\n\nThe path here was simply a groove cut in the face of the precipice;\nthere was a four-foot breadth of solid rock under the traveler, and a\nfour-foot breadth of solid rock just above his head, like the roof of a\nnarrow porch; he could look out from this gallery and see a sheer\nsummitless and bottomless wall of rock before him, across a gorge or\ncrack a biscuit\u2019s toss in width\u2014but he could not see the bottom of his\nown precipice unless he lay down and projected his nose over the edge. I\ndid not do this, because I did not wish to soil my clothes.\n\n\n                              ALP CLIMBING\n\nThere is probably no pleasure equal to the pleasure of climbing a\ndangerous Alp; but it is a pleasure which is confined strictly to people\nwho can find pleasure in it. I have not jumped to this conclusion; I\nhave traveled to it per gravel train, so to speak. I have thought the\nwhole thing out, and am quite sure I am right. A born climber\u2019s appetite\nfor climbing is hard to satisfy; when it comes upon him he is like a\nstarving man with a feast before him; he may have other business on\nhand, but it must wait. Mr. Girdlestone had had his usual summer holiday\nin the Alps, and had spent it in the usual way, hunting for unique\nchances to break his neck; his vacation was over, and his luggage packed\nfor England, but all of a sudden a hunger had come upon him to climb the\ntremendous Weisshorn once more, for he had heard of a new and utterly\nimpossible route up it. His baggage was unpacked at once, and now he and\na friend, laden with knapsacks, ice-axes, coils of rope, and canteens of\nmilk, were just setting out. They would spend the night high up among\nthe snows, somewhere, and get up at two in the morning and finish the\nenterprise. I had a strong desire to go with them, but forced it down\u2014a\nfeat which Mr. Girdlestone, with all his fortitude, could not do.\n\n\n                            THE OLD MASTERS\n\nWe visited the picture galleries and the other regulation \u201csights\u201d of\nMilan\u2014not because I wanted to write about them again, but to see if I\nhad learned anything in twelve years. I afterwards visited the great\ngalleries of Rome and Florence for the same purpose. I found I had\nlearned one thing. When I wrote about the Old Masters before, I said the\ncopies were better than the originals. That was a mistake of large\ndimensions. The Old Masters were still unpleasing to me, but they were\ntruly divine contrasted with the copies. The copy is to the original as\nthe pallid, smart, inane new waxwork group is to the vigorous, earnest,\ndignified group of living men and women whom it professes to duplicate.\nThere is a mellow richness, a subdued color, in the old pictures, which\nis to the eye what muffled and mellowed sound is to the ear. That is the\nmerit which is most loudly praised in the old picture, and is the one\nwhich the copy most conspicuously lacks, and which the copyist must not\nhope to compass. It was generally conceded by the artists with whom I\ntalked, that that subdued splendor, that mellow richness, is imparted to\nthe picture by _age_. Then why should we worship the Old Master for it,\nwho didn\u2019t impart it, instead of worshiping Old Time, who did? Perhaps\nthe picture was a clanging bell, until time muffled it and sweetened it.\n\nIn conversation with an artist in Venice, I asked,\n\n\u201cWhat is it that people see in Old Masters? I have been in the Doge\u2019s\npalace and I saw several acres of very bad drawing, very bad\nperspective, and very incorrect proportions. Paul Veronese\u2019s dogs do not\nresemble dogs; all the horses look like bladders on legs; one man had a\n_right_ leg on the left side of his body; in the large picture where the\nEmperor (Barbarossa?) is prostrate before the Pope, there are three men\nin the foreground who are over thirty feet high, if one may judge by the\nsize of a kneeling little boy in the center of the foreground; and\naccording to the same scale, the Pope is 7 feet high and the Doge is a\nshriveled dwarf of 4 feet.\u201d\n\nThe artist said:\n\n\u201cYes, the Old Masters often drew badly; they did not care much for truth\nand exactness in minor details; but after all, in spite of bad drawing,\nbad perspective, bad proportions, and a choice of subjects which no\nlonger appeal to people as strongly as they did three hundred years ago,\nthere is a _something_ about their pictures which is divine\u2014a something\nwhich is above and beyond the art of any epoch since\u2014a something which\nwould be the despair of artists but that they never hope or expect to\nattain it, and therefore do not worry about it.\u201d\n\nThat is what he said\u2014and he said what he believed; and not only\nbelieved, but felt.\n\nReasoning\u2014especially reasoning without technical knowledge\u2014must be put\naside, in cases of this kind. It cannot assist the inquirer. It will\nlead him, in the most logical progression, to what, in the eyes of the\nartists, would be a most illogical conclusion. Thus: bad drawing, bad\nproportions, bad perspective, indifference to truthful detail, color\nwhich gets its merit from time, and not from the artist\u2014these things\nconstitute the Old Master; conclusion, the Old Master was a bad painter,\nthe Old Master was not an Old Master at all, but an Old Apprentice. Your\nfriend the artist will grant your premises, but deny your conclusion; he\nwill maintain that notwithstanding this formidable list of confessed\ndefects, there is still a something that is divine and unapproachable\nabout the Old Master, and that there is no arguing the fact away by any\nsystem of reasoning whatever.\n\nI can believe that. There are women who have an indefinable charm in\ntheir faces which makes them beautiful to their intimates; but a cold\nstranger who tried to reason the matter out and find this beauty would\nfail. He would say of one of these women: This chin is too short, this\nnose is too long, this forehead is too high, this hair is too red, this\ncomplexion is too pallid, the perspective of the entire composition is\nincorrect; conclusion, the woman is not beautiful. But her nearest\nfriend might say, and say truly, \u201cYour premises are right, your logic is\nfaultless, but your conclusion is wrong, nevertheless; she is an Old\nMaster\u2014she is beautiful, but only to such as know her; it is a beauty\nwhich cannot be formulated, but it is there just the same.\u201d\n\nI found more pleasure in contemplating the Old Masters this time than I\ndid when I was in Europe in former years, but still it was a calm\npleasure; there was nothing overheated about it.\n\n\n\n\n               _FROM_ \u201cLIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI\u201d (1874\u20135)\n\n\n                         THE PERMANENT AMBITION\n\nWhen I was a boy, there was but one permanent ambition among my comrades\nin our village on the west bank of the Mississippi River. That was to be\na steamboatman. We had transient ambitions of other sorts, but they were\nonly transient. When a circus came and went, it left us all burning to\nbecome clowns; the first negro minstrel show that ever came to our\nsection left us all suffering to try that kind of life; now and then we\nhad a hope that, if we lived and were good, God would permit us to be\npirates. These ambitions faded out, each in its turn; but the ambition\nto be a steamboatman always remained.\n\nMy father was a justice of the peace, and I supposed he possessed the\npower of life and death over all men, and could hang anybody that\noffended him. This was distinction enough for me as a general thing; but\nthe desire to be a steamboatman kept intruding, nevertheless. I first\nwanted to be a cabin-boy, so that I could come out with a white apron on\nand shake a tablecloth over the side, where all my old comrades could\nsee me; later I thought I would rather be the deckhand who stood on the\nend of the stage-plank with the coil of rope in his hand, because he was\nparticularly conspicuous. But these were only day-dreams\u2014they were too\nheavenly to be contemplated as real possibilities. By and by one of our\nboys went away. He was not heard of for a long time. At last he turned\nup as apprentice engineer or \u201cstriker\u201d on a steamboat. This thing shook\nthe bottom out of all my Sunday-school teachings. That boy had been\nnotoriously worldly, and I just the reverse; yet he was exalted to this\neminence, and I left in obscurity and misery.\n\nThis creature\u2019s career could produce but one result, and it speedily\nfollowed. Boy after boy managed to get on the river. The minister\u2019s son\nbecame an engineer. The doctor\u2019s and the postmaster\u2019s sons became \u201cmud\nclerks\u201d; the wholesale liquor dealer\u2019s son became a barkeeper on a boat;\nfour sons of the chief merchant, and two sons of the county judge,\nbecame pilots. Pilot was the grandest position of all. The pilot, even\nin those days of trivial wages, had a princely salary\u2014from a hundred and\nfifty to two hundred and fifty dollars a month, and no board to pay. Two\nmonths of his wages would pay a preacher\u2019s salary for a year. Now some\nof us were left disconsolate. We could not get on the river\u2014at least our\nparents would not let us.\n\nSo, by and by, I ran away. I said I would never come home again till I\nwas a pilot and could come in glory.\n\n\n                       FIRST LESSONS IN PILOTING\n\nThe boat backed out from New Orleans at four in the afternoon, and it\nwas \u201cour watch\u201d until eight. Mr. Bixby, my chief, \u201cstraightened her up,\u201d\nploughed her along past the sterns of the other boats that lay at the\nLevee, and then said, \u201cHere, take her; shave those steamships as close\nas you\u2019d peel an apple.\u201d I took the wheel, and my heart-beat fluttered\nup into the hundreds; for it seemed to me that we were about to scrape\nthe side of every ship in the line, we were so close. I held my breath\nand began to claw the boat away from the danger; and I had my own\nopinion of the pilot who had known no better than to get us into such\nperil, but I was too wise to express it. In half a minute I had a wide\nmargin of safety intervening between the _Paul Jones_ and the ships; and\nwithin ten seconds more I was set aside in disgrace, and Mr. Bixby was\ngoing into danger again and flaying me alive with abuse of my cowardice.\nI was stung, but I was obliged to admire the easy confidence with which\nmy chief loafed from side to side of his wheel, and trimmed the ships so\nclosely that disaster seemed ceaselessly imminent. When he had cooled a\nlittle he told me that the easy water was close ashore and the current\noutside, and therefore we must hug the bank, up-stream, to get the\nbenefit of the former, and stay well out, down-stream, to take advantage\nof the latter. In my own mind I resolved to be a down-stream pilot and\nleave the up-streaming to people dead to prudence.\n\nNow and then Mr. Bixby called my attention to certain things. Said he,\n\u201cThis is Six-Mile Point.\u201d I assented. It was pleasant enough\ninformation, but I could not see the bearing of it. I was not conscious\nthat it was a matter of any interest to me. Another time he said, \u201cThis\nis Nine-Mile Point.\u201d Later he said, \u201cThis is Twelve-Mile Point.\u201d They\nwere all about level with the water\u2019s edge; they all looked about alike\nto me; they were monotonously unpicturesque. I hoped Mr. Bixby would\nchange the subject. But no; he would crowd up around a point, hugging\nthe shore with affection, and then say: \u201cThe slack water ends here,\nabreast this bunch of China-trees; now we cross over.\u201d So he crossed\nover. He gave me the wheel once or twice, but I had no luck. I either\ncame near chipping off the edge of a sugar plantation, or I yawed too\nfar from shore, and so dropped back into disgrace again and got abused.\n\nThe watch was ended at last, and we took supper and went to bed. At\nmidnight the glare of a lantern shone in my eyes, and the night watchman\nsaid:\n\n\u201cCome, turn out!\u201d\n\nAnd then he left. I could not understand this extraordinary procedure;\nso I presently gave up trying to, and dozed off to sleep. Pretty soon\nthe watchman was back again, and this time he was gruff. I was annoyed.\nI said:\n\n\u201cWhat do you want to come bothering around here in the middle of the\nnight for? Now, as like as not, I\u2019ll not get to sleep again to-night.\u201d\n\nThe watchman said:\n\n\u201cWell, if this ain\u2019t good, I\u2019m blessed.\u201d\n\nThe \u201coff-watch\u201d was just turning in, and I heard some brutal laughter\nfrom them, and such remarks as, \u201cHello, watchman! ain\u2019t the new cub\nturned out yet? He\u2019s delicate likely. Give him some sugar in a rag, and\nsend for the chambermaid to sing \u2018Rock-a-bye Baby,\u2019 to him.\u201d\n\nAbout this time Mr. Bixby appeared on the scene. Something like a minute\nlater I was climbing the pilot-house steps with some of my clothes on\nand the rest in my arms. Mr. Bixby was close behind, commenting. Here\nwas something fresh\u2014this thing of getting up in the middle of the night\nto go to work. It was a detail in piloting that had never occurred to me\nat all. I knew that boats ran all night, but somehow I had never\nhappened to reflect that somebody had to get up out of a warm bed to run\nthem. I began to fear that piloting was not quite so romantic as I had\nimagined it was; there was something very real and worklike about this\nnew phase of it.\n\nIt was rather a dingy night, although a fair number of stars were out.\nThe big mate was at the wheel, and he had the old tub pointed at a star\nand was holding her straight up the middle of the river. The shores on\neither hand were not much more than half a mile apart, but they seemed\nwonderfully far away and ever so vague and indistinct. The mate said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to land at Jones\u2019s plantation, sir.\u201d\n\nThe vengeful spirit in me exulted. I said to myself, \u201cI wish you joy of\nyour job, Mr. Bixby; you\u2019ll have a good time finding Mr. Jones\u2019s\nplantation such a night as this; and I hope you never _will_ find it as\nlong as you live.\u201d\n\nMr. Bixby said to the mate:\n\n\u201cUpper end of the plantation, or the lower?\u201d\n\n\u201cUpper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it. The stumps there are out of the water at this stage.\nIt\u2019s no great distance to the lower, and you\u2019ll have to get along with\nthat.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, sir. If Jones don\u2019t like it, he\u2019ll have to lump it, I\nreckon.\u201d\n\nAnd then the mate left. My exultation began to cool and my wonder to\ncome up. Here was a man who not only proposed to find this plantation on\nsuch a night, but to find either end of it you preferred. I dreadfully\nwanted to ask a question, but I was carrying about as many short answers\nas my cargo-room would admit of, so I held my peace. All I desired to\nask Mr. Bixby was the simple question whether he was ass enough to\nreally imagine he was going to find that plantation on a night when all\nplantations were exactly alike, and all the same color. But I held in. I\nused to have fine inspirations of prudence in those days.\n\nMr. Bixby made for the shore and soon was scraping it, just the same as\nif it had been daylight. And not only that but singing:\n\n             \u201cFather in heaven, the day is declining,\u201d etc.\n\nIt seemed to me that I had put my life into the keeping of a peculiarly\nreckless outcast. Presently he turned on me and said:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the first point above New Orleans?\u201d\n\nI was gratified to be able to answer promptly, and I did. I said I\ndidn\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t _know_?\u201d\n\nThis manner jolted me. I was down at the foot again, in a moment. But I\nhad to say just what I had said before.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re a smart one!\u201d said Mr. Bixby. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the\n_next_ point?\u201d\n\nOnce more I didn\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cWell, this beats anything. Tell me the name of any point or place I\ntold you.\u201d\n\nI studied a while and decided that I couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cLook here! What do you start out from, above Twelve-Mile Point, to\ncross over?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2014you\u2014don\u2019t know?\u201d mimicking my drawling manner of speech. \u201cWhat _do_\nyou know?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014nothing, for certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the great C\u00e6sar\u2019s ghost, I believe you! You\u2019re the stupidest\ndunderhead I ever saw or ever heard of, so help me Moses! The idea of\n_you_ being a pilot\u2014_you_! Why you don\u2019t know enough to pilot a cow down\na lane.\u201d\n\nOh, but his wrath was up! He was a nervous man, and he shuffled from one\nside of his wheel to the other as if the floor was hot. He would boil a\nwhile to himself, and then overflow and scald me again.\n\n\u201cLook here! What do you suppose I told you the names of those points\nfor?\u201d\n\nI tremblingly considered a moment, and the devil of temptation provoked\nme to say:\n\n\u201cWell\u2014to\u2014to\u2014be entertaining, I thought.\u201d\n\nThis was a red flag to the bull. He raged and stormed so (he was\ncrossing the river at the time) that I judge it made him blind, because\nhe ran over the steering-gear of a trading-scow. Of course the traders\nsent up a volley of red-hot profanity. Never was a man so grateful as\nMr. Bixby was; because he was brimful, and here were subjects who could\n_talk back_. He threw open a window, thrust his head out and such an\neruption followed as I never had heard before. The fainter and farther\naway the scowmen\u2019s curses drifted, the higher Mr. Bixby lifted his voice\nand the weightier his adjectives grew. When he closed the window he was\nempty. You could have drawn a seine through his system and not caught\ncurses enough to disturb your mother with. Presently he said to me in\nthe gentlest way:\n\n\u201cMy boy, you must get a little memorandum book; and every time I tell\nyou a thing, put it down right away. There\u2019s only one way to be a pilot,\nand that is to get this entire river by heart. You have to know it just\nlike A B C.\u201d\n\nThat was a dismal revelation to me; for my memory was never loaded with\nanything but blank cartridges. However, I did not feel discouraged long.\nI judged that it was best to make allowances, for doubtless Mr. Bixby\nwas \u201cstretching.\u201d Presently he pulled a rope and struck a few strokes on\nthe big bell. The stars were all gone now, and the night was as black as\nink. I could hear the wheels churn along the bank, but I was not\nentirely certain that I could see the shore. The voice of the invisible\nwatchman called up from the hurricane deck:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cJones\u2019s plantation.\u201d\n\nI said to myself, \u201cI wish that I might venture to offer a small bet that\nit isn\u2019t,\u201d But I did not chirp. I only waited to see. Mr. Bixby handled\nthe engine bells, and in due time the boat\u2019s nose came to the land, a\ntorch glowed from the forecastle, a man skipped ashore, a darkey\u2019s voice\non the bank said, \u201cGimme de k\u2019yarpet bag, Mass\u2019 Jones,\u201d and the next\nmoment we were standing up the river again, all serene. I reflected\ndeeply a while, and then said\u2014but not aloud\u2014\u201cWell, the finding of that\nplantation was the luckiest accident that ever happened; but it couldn\u2019t\nhappen again in a hundred years.\u201d\n\n\n                           PERPLEXING LESSONS\n\nAt the end of what seemed a tedious while, I had managed to pack my head\nfull of islands, towns, bars, \u201cpoints,\u201d and bends, and a curiously\ninanimate mass of lumber it was, too. However, inasmuch as I could shut\nmy eyes and reel off a good long string of these names without leaving\nout more than ten miles of river in every fifty, I began to feel that I\ncould take a boat down to New Orleans if I could make her skip those\nlittle gaps. But of course my complacency could hardly get start enough\nto lift my nose a trifle into the air, before Mr. Bixby would think of\nsomething to fetch it down again. One day he turned on me suddenly with\nthis settler:\n\n\u201cWhat is the shape of Walnut Bend?\u201d\n\nHe might as well have asked me my grandmother\u2019s opinion of protoplasm. I\nreflected respectfully, and then said I didn\u2019t know it had any\nparticular shape. My gunpowdery chief went off with a bang, of course,\nand then went on loading and firing until he was out of adjectives.\n\nI had learned long ago that he only carried just so many rounds of\nammunition and was sure to subside into a very placable and even\nremorseful old smoothbore as soon as they were all gone. That word \u201cold\u201d\nis merely affectionate; he was not more than thirty-four. I waited. By\nand by he said:\n\n\u201cMy boy, you\u2019ve got to know the _shape_ of the river perfectly. It is\nall there is left to steer by on a very dark night. Everything else is\nblotted out and gone. But mind you, it hasn\u2019t the same shape in the\nnight that it has in the daytime.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow on earth am I ever going to learn it then?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you follow a hall at home in the dark? Because you know the\nshape of it. You can\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean to say that I\u2019ve got to know all the million trifling\nvariations of shape in the banks of this interminable river as well as I\nknow the shape of the front hall at home?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn my honor, you\u2019ve got to know them _better_ than any man ever did\nknow the shapes of the halls in his own house.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I was dead!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, I don\u2019t want to discourage you, but\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, pile it on me; I might as well have it now as another time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see, this has got to be learned; there isn\u2019t any getting around it.\nA clear starlight night throws such heavy shadows that, if you didn\u2019t\nknow the shape of a shore perfectly, you would claw away from every\nbunch of timber, because you would take the black shadow of it for a\nsolid cape; and you see you would be getting scared to death every\nfifteen minutes by the watch. You would be fifty yards from shore all\nthe time when you ought to be within fifty feet of it. You can\u2019t see a\nsnag in one of those shadows, but you know exactly where it is, and the\nshape of the river tells you when you are coming to it. Then there\u2019s\nyour pitch-dark night; the river is a very different shape on a\npitch-dark night from what it is on a starlight night. All shores seem\nto be straight lines, then, and mighty dim ones, too; and you\u2019d _run_\nthem for straight lines, only you know better. You boldly drive your\nboat right into what seems to be a solid, straight wall (you knowing\nvery well that in reality there is a curve there), and that wall falls\nback and makes way for you. Then there\u2019s your gray mist. You take a\nnight when there\u2019s one of these grisly drizzly, gray mists, and then\nthere isn\u2019t _any_ particular shape to a shore. A gray mist would tangle\nthe head of the oldest man that ever lived. Well, then, different kinds\nof _moonlight_ change the shape of the river in different ways. You\nsee\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t say any more, please! Have I got to learn the shape of the\nriver according to all these five hundred thousand different ways? If I\ntried to carry all that cargo in my head it would make me\nstoop-shouldered.\u201d\n\n\u201c_No!_ you only learn the shape of _the_ river; and you learn it with\nsuch absolute certainty that you can always steer by the shape that\u2019s\n_in your head_, and never the one that\u2019s before your eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll try it; but, after I have learned it, can I depend on\nit? Will it keep the same form and not go fooling around?\u201d\n\nBefore Mr. Bixby could answer, Mr. W. came in to take the watch and he\nsaid:\n\n\u201cBixby, you\u2019ll have to look out for President\u2019s Island, and all that\ncountry clear away up above the Old Hen and Chickens. The banks are\ncaving and the shape of the shore changing like everything. Why you\nwouldn\u2019t know the point above 40. You can go up inside the old sycamore\nsnag, now.\u201d\n\nSo that question was answered. Here were leagues of shore changing\nshape. My spirits were down in the mud again. Two things seemed pretty\napparent to me. One was, that in order to be a pilot a man has got to\nlearn more than any one man ought to be allowed to know; and the other\nwas, that he must learn it all over again in a different way every\ntwenty-four hours.\n\nThat night we had the watch until twelve. Now it was an ancient river\ncustom for the two pilots to chat a bit when the watch changed. While\nthe relieving pilot put on his gloves and lit his cigar, his partner,\nthe retiring pilot, would say something like this:\n\n\u201cI judge the upper bar is making down a little at Hale\u2019s Point; had\nquarter twain with the lower lead and mark twain with the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I thought it was making down a little, last trip. Meet any boats?\u201d\n\n\u201cMet one abreast the head of 21, but she was away over hugging the bar,\nand I couldn\u2019t make her out entirely. I took her for the _Sunny\nSouth_\u2014hadn\u2019t any skylight forward of the chimneys.\u201d\n\nAnd so on. And as the relieving pilot took the wheel his partner would\nmention that we were in such-and-such a bend, and say we were abreast of\nsuch a man\u2019s woodyard or plantation. This was courtesy; I supposed it\nwas _necessity_. But Mr. W. came on watch full twelve minutes late on\nthis particular night\u2014a tremendous breach of etiquette; in fact, it is\nthe unpardonable sin among pilots. So Mr. Bixby gave him no greeting\nwhatever, but simply surrendered the wheel and marched out of the\npilot-house without a word. I was appalled; it was a villainous night\nfor blackness, we were in a particularly wide and blind part of the\nriver, where there was no shape or substance to anything, and it seemed\nincredible that Mr. Bixby should have left that poor fellow to kill the\nboat trying to find out where he was. But I resolved that I would stand\nby him anyway. He should find that he was not wholly friendless. So I\nstood around, and waited to be asked where we were. But Mr. W. plunged\non serenely through the solid firmament of black cats that stood for an\natmosphere and never opened his mouth. \u201cHe is a proud devil!\u201d thought I;\n\u201chere is a limb of Satan that would rather send us all to destruction\nthan put himself under obligations to me, because I am not yet one of\nthe salt of the earth and privileged to snub captains and lord it over\neverything dead and alive in a steamboat.\u201d I presently climbed up on the\nbench; I did not think it was safe to go to sleep while this lunatic was\non watch.\n\nHowever, I must have gone to sleep in the course of time, because the\nnext thing I was aware of was the fact that day was breaking, Mr. W.\ngone, and Mr. Bixby at the wheel again. So it was four o\u2019clock and all\nwell\u2014but me; I felt like a skinful of dry bones, and all of them trying\nto ache at once.\n\nMr. Bixby asked me what I had stayed up there for. I confessed that it\nwas to do Mr. W. a benevolence\u2014tell him where he was. It took five\nminutes for the entire preposterousness of the thing to filter into Mr.\nBixby\u2019s system, and then I judged it filled him nearly up to the chin;\nbecause he paid me a compliment\u2014and not much of a one either. He said:\n\n\u201cWell, taking you by and large, you seem to be more different kinds of\nan ass than any creature I ever saw before. What did you suppose he\nwanted to know for?\u201d\n\nI said I thought it might be a convenience to him.\n\n\u201cConvenience! D\u2014\u2014nation! Didn\u2019t I tell you that a man\u2019s got to know the\nriver in the night the same as he\u2019d know his front hall?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I can follow the front hall in the dark if I know it _is_ the\nfront hall; but suppose you set me down in the middle of it in the dark\nand did not tell me which hall it is; how am I to know?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve _got_ to, on the river!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right. Then I\u2019m glad I never said anything to Mr. W.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should say so! Why, he\u2019d have slammed you through the window and\nutterly ruined a hundred dollars\u2019 worth of window-sash and stuff.\u201d\n\nI was glad this damage had been saved, for it would have made me\nunpopular with the owners. They always hated anybody who had the name of\nbeing careless and injuring things.\n\nI went to work now to learn the shape of the river; and of all the\neluding and ungraspable objects that ever I tried to get mind or hands\non, that was the chief. I would fasten my eyes upon a sharp, wooded\npoint that projected far into the river some miles ahead of me, and go\nlaboriously photographing its shape into my brain; and just as I was\nbeginning to succeed to my satisfaction, we would draw up toward it and\nthe exasperating thing would begin to melt away and fold back into the\nbank! If there had been a conspicuous dead tree standing up in the very\npoint of the cape, I would find that tree inconspicuously merged into\nthe general forest, and occupying the middle of a straight shore, when I\ngot abreast of it! No prominent hill would stick to its shape long\nenough for me to make up my mind what its form really was, but it was as\ndissolving and changeful as if it had been a mountain of butter in the\nhottest corner of the tropics. Nothing ever had the same shape when I\nwas coming down-stream that it had borne when I went up. I mentioned\nthese little difficulties to Mr. Bixby. He said:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the very main virtue of the thing. If the shapes didn\u2019t change\nevery three seconds they wouldn\u2019t be of any use. Take this place where\nwe are now, for instance. As long as that hill over yonder is only one\nhill, I can boom right along the way I\u2019m going; but the moment it splits\nat the top and forms a V, I know I\u2019ve got to scratch to starboard in a\nhurry, or I\u2019ll bang this boat\u2019s brains out against a rock; and then the\nmoment one of the prongs of the V swings behind the other, I\u2019ve got to\nwaltz to larboard again, or I\u2019ll have a misunderstanding with a snag\nthat would snatch the keelson out of this steamboat as neatly as if it\nwere a sliver in your hand. If that hill didn\u2019t change its shape on bad\nnights there would be an awful steamboat graveyard around here inside of\na year.\u201d\n\nIt was plain that I had got to learn the shape of the river in all the\ndifferent ways that could be thought of,\u2014upside down, wrong end first,\ninside out, fore-and-aft, and \u201cthortships,\u201d\u2014and then know what to do on\ngray nights when it hadn\u2019t any shape at all. So I set about it. In the\ncourse of time I began to get the best of this knotty lesson, and my\nself-complacency moved to the front once more. Mr. Bixby was all fixed,\nand ready to start it to the rear again. He opened on me in this\nfashion:\n\n\u201cHow much water did we have in the middle crossing at Hole-in-the-Wall,\ntrip before last?\u201d\n\nI considered this an outrage. I said:\n\n\u201cEvery trip, down and up, the leadsmen are singing through that tangled\nplace for three-quarters of an hour on a stretch. How do you reckon I\ncan remember such a mess as that?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy boy, you\u2019ve got to remember it. You\u2019ve got to remember the exact\nspot and the exact marks the boat lay in when we had the shoalest water,\nin every one of the five hundred shoal places between St. Louis and New\nOrleans; and you mustn\u2019t get the shoal soundings and marks of one trip\nmixed up with the shoal soundings and marks of another, either, for\nthey\u2019re not often twice alike. You must keep them separate.\u201d\n\nWhen I came to myself again, I said:\n\n\u201cWhen I get so that I can do that, I\u2019ll be able to raise the dead, and\nthen I won\u2019t have to pilot a steamboat to make a living. I want to\nretire from this business. I want a slush-bucket and a brush; I\u2019m only\nfit for a roustabout. I haven\u2019t got brains enough to be a pilot; and if\nI had I wouldn\u2019t have strength enough to carry them around unless I went\non crutches.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, drop that! When I say I\u2019ll learn a man the river, I mean it. And\nyou can depend on it, I\u2019ll learn him or kill him.\u201d\n\n\n                           A TEST OF COURAGE\n\nThe growth of courage in the pilot-house is steady all the time, but it\ndoes not reach a high and satisfactory condition until sometime after\nthe young pilot has been \u201cstanding his own watch\u201d alone and under the\nstaggering weight of all the responsibilities connected with the\nposition. When an apprentice has become pretty thoroughly acquainted\nwith the river, he goes clattering along so fearlessly with his\nsteamboat, night or day, that he presently begins to imagine that it is\n_his_ courage that animates him; but the first time the pilot steps out\nand leaves him to his own devices he finds out it was the other man\u2019s.\nHe discovers that the article has been left out of his own cargo\naltogether. The whole river is bristling with exigencies in a moment; he\nis not prepared for them; he does not know how to meet them; all his\nknowledge forsakes him; and within fifteen minutes he is as white as a\nsheet and scared almost to death. Therefore, pilots wisely train these\ncubs by various strategic tricks to look danger in the face a little\nmore calmly. A favorite way of theirs is to play a friendly swindle upon\nthe candidate.\n\nMr. Bixby served me in this fashion once, and for years afterward I used\nto blush, even in my sleep, when I thought of it. I had become a good\nsteersman; so good, indeed, that I had all the work to do on our watch,\nnight and day. Mr. Bixby seldom made a suggestion to me; all he ever did\nwas to take the wheel on particularly bad nights or in particularly bad\ncrossings, land the boat when she needed to be landed, play gentleman of\nleisure nine-tenths of the watch, and collect the wages. The lower river\nwas about bank-full, and if anybody had questioned my ability to run any\ncrossing between Cairo and New Orleans without help or instruction, I\nshould have felt irreparably hurt. The idea of being afraid of any\ncrossing in the lot, in the _daytime_, was a thing too preposterous for\ncontemplation. Well, one matchless summer\u2019s day I was bowling down the\nbend above Island 66, brim full of self-conceit and carrying my nose as\nhigh as a giraffe\u2019s, when Mr. Bixby said:\n\n\u201cI am going below a while. I suppose you know the next crossing?\u201d\n\nThis was almost an affront. It was about the plainest and simplest\ncrossing in the whole river. One couldn\u2019t come to any harm, whether he\nran it right or not; and as for depth, there never had been any bottom\nthere. I knew all this perfectly well.\n\n\u201cKnow how to _run_ it? Why, I can run it with my eyes shut.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much water is there in it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that is an odd question. I couldn\u2019t get bottom there with a\nchurch steeple.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think so, do you?\u201d\n\nThe very tone of the question shook my confidence. That was what Mr.\nBixby was expecting. He left, without saying anything more. I began to\nimagine all sorts of things. Mr. Bixby, unknown to me, of course, sent\nsomebody down to the forecastle with some mysterious instructions to the\nleadsmen, another messenger was sent to whisper among the officers, and\nthen Mr. Bixby went into hiding behind a smoke-stack where he could\nobserve results. Presently the captain stepped out on the hurricane\ndeck; next the chief mate appeared; then a clerk. Every moment or two a\nstraggler was added to my audience; and before I got to the head of the\nisland I had fifteen or twenty people assembled down there under my\nnose. I began to wonder what the trouble was. As I started across, the\ncaptain glanced aloft at me and said, with a sham uneasiness in his\nvoice:\n\n\u201cWhere is Mr. Bixby?\u201d\n\n\u201cGone below, sir.\u201d\n\nBut that did the business for me. My imagination began to construct\ndangers out of nothing, and they multiplied faster than I could keep the\nrun of them. All at once I imagined I saw shoal water ahead! The wave of\ncoward agony that surged through me then came near dislocating every\njoint in me. All my confidence in that crossing vanished. I seized the\nbell-rope; dropped it, ashamed; seized it again; dropped it once more;\nclutched it tremblingly once again, and pulled it so feebly that I could\nhardly hear the stroke myself. Captain and mate sang out instantly, and\nboth together:\n\n\u201cStarboard lead there! and quick about it!\u201d This was another shock. I\nbegan to climb the wheel like a squirrel; but I would hardly get the\nboat started to port before I would see new dangers on that side, and\naway I would spin to the other; only to find perils accumulating to\nstarboard, and be crazy to get to port again. Then came the leadsman\u2019s\nsepulchral cry:\n\n\u201cD-e-e-p four!\u201d\n\nDeep four in a bottomless crossing! The terror of it took my breath\naway.\n\n\u201cM-a-r-k three! M-a-r-k three! Quarter-less-three! Half twain!\u201d\n\nThis was frightful! I seized the bell-rope and stopped the engines.\n\n\u201cQuarter twain! Quarter twain! _Mark_ twain!\u201d\n\nI was helpless. I did not know what in the world to do. I was quaking\nfrom head to foot, and I could have hung my hat on my eyes, they stuck\nout so far.\n\n\u201cQuarter-_less_-twain! Nine-and-a-half!\u201d\n\nWe were _drawing_ nine! My hands were in a nerveless flutter. I could\nnot ring a bell intelligibly with them. I flew to the speaking-tube and\nshouted to the engineer:\n\n\u201cOh, Ben, if you love me, _back_ her! Quick, Ben! Oh, back the immortal\n_soul_ out of her!\u201d\n\nI heard the door close gently. I looked around, and there stood Mr.\nBixby, smiling, a bland, sweet smile. Then the audience on the hurricane\ndeck sent up a thundergust of humiliating laughter. I saw it all, now,\nand I felt meaner than the meanest man in human history. I laid in the\nlead, set the boat in her marks, came ahead on the engines, and said:\n\n\u201cIt was a fine trick to play on an orphan, _wasn\u2019t_ it? I suppose I\u2019ll\nnever hear the last of how I was ass enough to heave the lead at the\nhead of 66.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, no, you won\u2019t, maybe. In fact I hope you won\u2019t; for I want you to\nlearn something by that experience. Didn\u2019t you know there was no bottom\nin that crossing?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, then. You shouldn\u2019t have allowed me or anybody else to shake\nyour confidence in that knowledge. Try to remember that. And another\nthing: when you get into a dangerous place, don\u2019t turn coward. That\nisn\u2019t going to help matters any.\u201d\n\nIt was a good enough lesson, but pretty hardly learned. Yet about the\nhardest part of it was that for months I so often had to hear a phrase\nwhich I had conceived a particular distaste for. It was, \u201cOh, Ben, if\nyou love me, back her!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n              _FROM_ \u201cTHE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER\u201d (1877\u201380)\n\n\n                     BIRTHS OF HIGH AND LOW DEGREE\n\nIn the ancient city of London, on a certain autumn day, in the second\nquarter of the sixteenth century, a boy was born to a poor family of the\nname of Canty, who did not want him. On the same day another English\nchild was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him.\nAll England wanted him, too. England had so longed for him, and hoped\nfor him, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the\npeople went nearly mad for joy. Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed\neach other and cried. Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich\nand poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they\nkept this up for days and nights together. By day, London was a sight to\nsee, with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and\nsplendid pageants marching along. By night it was again a sight to see,\nwith its great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of revelers\nmaking merry around them. There was no talk in all England but of the\nnew baby, Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in silks and\nsatins, unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that great lords\nand ladies were tending him and watching over him\u2014and not caring,\neither. But there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty, lapped in\nhis poor rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had just come\nto trouble with his presence.\n\n\n                             THE CANTY HOME\n\nThe house which Tom\u2019s father lived in was up a foul little pocket called\nOffal Court, out of Pudding Lane. It was small, decayed, and rickety,\nbut it was packed full of wretchedly poor families. Canty\u2019s tribe\noccupied a room on the third floor. The mother and father had a sort of\nbedstead in the corner; but Tom, his grandmother, and his two sisters,\nBet and Nan, were not restricted\u2014they had all the floor to themselves,\nand might sleep where they chose. There were the remains of a blanket or\ntwo, and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw, but these could not\nrightly be called beds, for they were not organized; they were kicked\ninto a general pile mornings, and selections made from the mass at\nnight, for service.\n\n\n                             LONDON BRIDGE\n\nThis structure, which had stood for six hundred years, and had been a\nnoisy and populous thoroughfare all that time, was a curious affair, for\na closely packed rank of stores and shops, with family quarters\noverhead, stretched along both sides of it, from one bank of the river\nto the other. The Bridge was a sort of a town to itself; it had its inn,\nits beer houses, its bakeries, its haberdasheries, its food markets, its\nmanufacturing industries and even its church. It looked upon the two\nneighbors which it linked together\u2014London and Southwark\u2014as being well\nenough, as suburbs, but not otherwise particularly important. It was a\nclose corporation, so to speak; it was a narrow town, of a single street\na fifth of a mile long, its population was but a village population, and\neverybody in it knew all his fellow townsmen intimately, and had known\ntheir fathers and mothers before them\u2014and all their little family\naffairs into the bargain. It had its aristocracy, of course\u2014its fine old\nfamilies of butchers, and bakers, and what-not, who had occupied the\nsame old premises for five or six hundred years, and knew the great\nhistory of the Bridge from beginning to end, and all its strange\nlegends; and who always talked bridgy talk, and thought bridgy thoughts,\nand lied in a long, level, direct, substantial bridgy way.\n\n\n                            TOM CANTY, KING\n\nHe opened his eyes\u2014the richly clad First Lord of the Bedchamber was\nkneeling by his couch. The gladness of the lying dream faded away\u2014the\npoor boy recognized that he was still a captive and a king. The room was\nfilled with courtiers clothed in purple mantles\u2014the mourning\ncolor[1]\u2014and with noble servants of the monarch. Tom sat up in bed and\ngazed out from the heavy silken curtains upon this fine company.\n\nThe weighty business of dressing began, and one courtier after another\nknelt and paid his court and offered to the little king his condolences\nupon his heavy loss, while the dressing proceeded. In the beginning, a\nshirt was taken up by the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who passed it to the\nFirst Lord of the Buckhounds, who passed it to the Second Gentleman of\nthe Bedchamber, who passed it to the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest, who\npassed it to the Third Groom of the Stole, who passed it to the\nChancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, who passed it to the Master\nof the Wardrobe, who passed it to Norroy King-at-Arms, who passed it to\nthe Constable of the Tower, who passed it to the Chief Steward of the\nHousehold, who passed it to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, who passed it\nto the Lord High Admiral of England, who passed it to the Archbishop of\nCanterbury, who passed it to the First Lord of the Bedchamber, who took\nwhat was left of it and put it on Tom. Poor little wondering chap, it\nreminded him of passing buckets at a fire....\n\nA secretary of state presented an order of the Council appointing the\nmorrow at eleven for the reception of the foreign ambassadors, and\ndesired the king\u2019s assent.\n\nTom turned an inquiring look toward Hertford, who whispered:\n\n\u201cYour majesty will signify consent. They come to testify their royal\nmasters\u2019 sense of the heavy calamity which hath visited your grace and\nthe realm of England.\u201d\n\nTom did as he was bidden. Another secretary began to read a preamble\nconcerning the expenses of the late king\u2019s household, which had amounted\nto \u00a328,000 during the preceding six months\u2014a sum so vast that it made\nTom Canty gasp; he gasped again when the fact appeared that \u00a320,000 of\nthis money were still owing and unpaid; and once more when it appeared\nthat the king\u2019s coffers were about empty, and his twelve hundred\nservants much embarrassed for lack of the wages due them. Tom spoke out,\nwith lively apprehension.\n\n\u201cWe be going to the dogs, \u2019tis plain. \u2019Tis meet and necessary that we\ntake a smaller house and set the servants at large, sith they be of no\nvalue but to make delay, and trouble one with offices that harass the\nspirit and shame the soul, they misbecoming any but a doll, that hath\nnor brains nor hands to help itself withal. I remember me of a small\nhouse that standeth over against the fish-market, by Billingsgate\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nA sharp pressure upon Tom\u2019s arm stopped his foolish tongue and sent a\nblush to his face; but no countenance there betrayed any sign that this\nstrange speech had been remarked or given concern.\n\n\n                       THE LITTLE KING IN PRISON\n\nHendon\u2019s[2] arts all failed with the king\u2014he could not be comforted, but\na couple of women who were chained near him, succeeded better. Under\ntheir gentle ministrations he found peace and learned a degree of\npatience. He was very grateful, and came to love them dearly and to\ndelight in the sweet and soothing influence of their presence. He asked\nthem why they were in prison, and when they said they were Baptists, he\nsmiled and inquired:\n\n\u201cIs that a crime to be shut up for in a prison? Now I grieve, for I\nshall lose ye\u2014they will not keep ye long for such a little thing.\u201d\n\nThey did not answer; and something in their faces made him uneasy. He\nsaid, eagerly:\n\n\u201cYou do not speak\u2014be good to me, and tell me\u2014there will be no other\npunishment? Prithee, tell me there is no fear of that.\u201d\n\nThey tried to change the topic, but his fears were aroused, and he\npursued it:\n\n\u201cWill they scourge thee? No, no, they would not be so cruel! Say they\nwould not. Come, they _will_ not, will they?\u201d\n\nThe women betrayed confusion and distress, but there was no avoiding an\nanswer, so one of them said, in a voice choked with emotion:\n\n\u201cOh, thou\u2019lt break our hearts, thou gentle spirit! God will help us to\nbear our\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a confession!\u201d the king broke in. \u201cThen they _will_ scourge thee,\nthe stony-hearted wretches. But oh, thou must not weep, I cannot bear\nit. Keep up thy courage\u2014I shall come to my own in time to save thee from\nthis bitter thing and I will do it!\u201d\n\nWhen the king awoke in the morning, the women were gone.\n\n\u201cThey are saved!\u201d he said, joyfully; then added, despondently, \u201cbut woe\nis me!\u2014for they were my comforters.\u201d\n\nEach of them had left a shred of ribbon pinned to his clothing, in token\nof remembrance. He said he would keep these things always; and that soon\nhe would seek out these dear good friends of his and take them under his\nprotection.\n\nJust then the jailer came in with some subordinates and commanded that\nthe prisoners be conducted to the jail-yard. The king was overjoyed\u2014it\nwould be a blessed thing to see the blue sky and breathe the fresh air\nonce more. He fretted and chafed at the slowness of the officers, but\nhis turn came at last and he was released from his staple and ordered to\nfollow the other prisoners, with Hendon.\n\nThe court, or quadrangle, was stone-paved, and open to the sky. The\nprisoners entered it through a massive archway of masonry, and were\nplaced in file, standing, with their backs against the wall. A rope was\nstretched in front of them, and they were also guarded by their\nofficers. It was a chill and lowering morning, and a light snow which\nhad fallen during the night whitened the great empty space and added to\nthe general dismalness of its aspect. Now and then a wintry wind\nshivered through the place and sent the snow eddying hither and thither.\n\nIn the center of the court stood two women, chained to posts. A glance\nshowed the king that these were his good friends. He shuddered, and said\nto himself, \u201cAlack, they are not gone free, as I had thought. To think\nthat such as these should know the lash!\u2014in England! Ay, there\u2019s the\nshame of it\u2014not in Heathenesse, but Christian England! They will be\nscourged; and I, whom they have comforted and kindly entreated, must\nlook on and see the great wrong done; it is strange, so strange! that I,\nthe very source of power in this broad realm, am helpless to protect\nthem. But let these miscreants look well to themselves, for there is a\nday coming when I will require of them a heavy reckoning for this work.\nFor every blow they strike now they shall feel a hundred then.\u201d\n\nA great gate swung open and a crowd of citizens poured in. They flocked\naround the two women, and hid them from the king\u2019s view. A clergyman\nentered and passed through the crowd, and he also was hidden. The king\nnow heard talking, back and forth, as if questions were being asked and\nanswered, but he could not make out what was said. Next there was a deal\nof bustle and preparation, and much passing and repassing of officials\nthrough that part of the crowd that stood on the further side of the\nwomen; and while this proceeded a deep hush gradually fell upon the\npeople.\n\nNow, by command, the masses parted and fell aside, and the king saw a\nspectacle that froze the marrow in his bones. Fagots had been piled\nabout the two women, and a kneeling man was lighting them!\n\nThe women bowed their heads, and covered their faces with their hands;\nthe yellow flames began to climb upward among the snapping and crackling\nfagots, and wreaths of blue smoke to stream away on the wind; the\nclergyman lifted his hands and began a prayer\u2014just then two young girls\ncame flying through the great gate, uttering piercing screams, and threw\nthemselves upon the women at the stake. Instantly they were torn away by\nthe officers, and one of them was kept in a tight grip, but the other\nbroke loose, saying she would die with her mother; and before she could\nbe stopped she had flung her arms about her mother\u2019s neck again. She was\ntorn away once more, and with her gown on fire. Two or three men held\nher, and the burning portion of her gown was snatched off and thrown\nflaming aside, she struggling all the while to free herself, and saying\nshe would be alone in the world now, and begging to be allowed to die\nwith her mother. Both the girls screamed continually, and fought for\nfreedom; but suddenly this tumult was drowned under a volley of\nheart-piercing shrieks of mortal agony. The king glanced from the\nfrantic girls to the stake, then turned away and leaned his ashen face\nagainst the wall, and looked no more. He said, \u201cThat which I have seen,\nin that one little moment, will never go out from my memory, but will\nabide there; and I shall see it all the days, and dream of it all the\nnights, till I die. Would God I had been blind!\u201d\n\nHendon was watching the king. He said to himself, with satisfaction,\n\u201cHis disorder mendeth; he hath changed, and groweth gentler. If he had\nfollowed his wont, he would have stormed at these varlets, and said he\nwas king, and commanded that the women be turned loose unscathed. Soon\nhis delusion will pass away and be forgotten, and his poor mind will be\nwhole again. God speed the day!\u201d\n\nThat same day several prisoners were brought in to remain over night,\nwho were being conveyed, under guard, to various places in the kingdom,\nto undergo punishment for crimes committed. The king conversed with\nthese,\u2014he had made it a point, from the beginning, to instruct himself\nfor the kingly office by questioning prisoners whenever the opportunity\noffered\u2014and the tale of their woes wrung his heart. One of them was a\npoor half-witted woman who had stolen a yard or two of cloth from a\nweaver\u2014she was to be hanged for it. Another was a man who had been\naccused of stealing a horse; he said the proof had failed, and he had\nimagined that he was safe from the halter; but no\u2014he was hardly free\nbefore he was arraigned for killing a deer in the king\u2019s park; this was\nproved against him, and now he was on his way to the gallows. There was\na tradesman\u2019s apprentice whose case particularly distressed the king;\nthis youth said he found a hawk one evening that had escaped from its\nowner, and he took it home with him, imagining himself entitled to it;\nbut the court convicted him of stealing it, and sentenced him to death.\n\nThe king was furious over these inhumanities, and wanted Hendon to break\njail and fly with him to Westminster, so that he could mount his throne\nand hold out his scepter in mercy over these unfortunate people and save\ntheir lives. \u201cPoor child,\u201d sighed Hendon, \u201cthese woeful tales have\nbrought his malady upon him again\u2014alack, but for this evil hap, he would\nhave been well in a little time.\u201d\n\nAmong these prisoners was an old lawyer\u2014a man with a strong face and a\ndauntless mien. Three years past, he had written a pamphlet against the\nLord Chancellor, accusing him of injustice, and had been punished for it\nby the loss of his ears in the pillory and degradation from the bar, and\nin addition had been fined \u00a33,000 and sentenced to imprisonment for\nlife. Lately he had repeated his offense; and in consequence was now\nunder sentence to lose _what remained of his ears_, pay a fine of\n\u00a35,000, be branded on both cheeks, and remain in prison for life.\n\n\u201cThese be honorable scars,\u201d he said, and turned back his gray hair and\nshowed the mutilated stubs of what had once been his ears.\n\nThe king\u2019s eyes burned with passion. He said: \u201cNone believe in\nme\u2014neither wilt thou. But no matter\u2014within the compass of a month thou\nshalt be free; and more, the laws that have dishonored thee, and shamed\nthe English name, shall be swept from the statute books. The world is\nmade wrong, kings should go to school to their own laws at times, and so\nlearn mercy.\u201d\n\n\n                          TOM CANTY THE FIRST\n\nWhilst the true king wandered about the land, poorly clad, poorly fed,\ncuffed and derided by tramps one while, herding with thieves and\nmurderers in a jail another, and called idiot and impostor by all\nimpartially, the mock King Tom Canty enjoyed a quite different\nexperience.\n\nWhen we saw him last, royalty was just beginning to have a bright side\nfor him. This bright side went on brightening more and more every day;\nin a very little while it was become almost all sunshine and\ndelightfulness. He lost his fears! his misgivings faded out and died;\nhis embarrassments departed, and gave place to an easy and confident\nbearing.\n\nHe ordered my Lady Elizabeth and my Lady Jane Gray into his presence\nwhen he wanted to play or talk, and dismissed them when he was done with\nthem, with the air of one familiarly accustomed to such performances. It\nno longer confused him to have these lofty personages kiss his hand at\nparting.\n\nHe came to enjoy being conducted to bed in state at night, and dressed\nwith intricate and solemn ceremony in the morning. It came to be a proud\npleasure to march to dinner attended by a glittering procession of\nofficers of state and gentlemen-at-arms; insomuch, indeed, that he\ndoubled his guard of gentlemen-at-arms, and made them a hundred. He\nliked to hear the bugles sounding down the long corridors, and the\ndistant voices responding, \u201cWay for the king!\u201d\n\nHe even learned to enjoy sitting in throned state in council, and\nseeming to be something more than the Lord Protector\u2019s mouthpiece. He\nliked to receive great ambassadors and their gorgeous trains, and listen\nto the affectionate messages they brought from illustrious monarchs who\ncalled him \u201cbrother.\u201d\n\nOh, happy Tom Canty, late of Offal Court!\n\n\n                           TOM IS RECOGNIZED\n\nThe great pageant moved on, and still on, under one triumphal arch after\nanother, and past a bewildering succession of spectacular and symbolical\ntableaux, each of which typified and exalted some virtue, or talent, or\nmerit, of the little king\u2019s. Throughout the whole of Cheapside, from\nevery penthouse and window, hung banners and streamers; and the richest\ncarpets, stuffs, and cloth-of-gold tapestried the streets,\u2014specimens of\nthe great wealth of the stores within; and the splendor of this\nthroughfare was equaled in the other streets, and in some even\nsurpassed.\n\n\u201cAnd all these wonders and these marvels are to welcome me\u2014me!\u201d murmured\nTom Canty.\n\nThe mock king\u2019s cheeks were flushed with excitement, his eyes were\nflashing, his senses swam in a delirium of pleasure. At this point, just\nas he was raising his hand to fling another rich largess, he caught\nsight of a pale, astounded face which was strained forward out of the\nsecond rank of the crowd, its intense eyes riveted upon him. A sickening\nconsternation struck through him; he recognized his mother! and up flew\nhis hand, palm outward, before his eyes,\u2014that old involuntary gesture,\nborn of a forgotten episode, and perpetuated by habit. In an instant\nmore she had torn her way out of the press, and past the guards, and was\nat his side. She embraced his leg, she covered it with kisses, she\ncried, \u201cO, my child, my darling!\u201d lifting toward him a face that was\ntransfigured with joy and love. The same instant an officer of the\nKing\u2019s Guard snatched her away with a curse, and sent her reeling back\nwhence she came, with a vigorous impulse from his strong arm. The words,\n\u201cI do not know you, woman!\u201d were falling from Tom Canty\u2019s lips when this\npiteous thing occurred; but it smote him to the heart to see her treated\nso; and as she turned for a last glimpse of him, whilst the crowd was\nswallowing her from his sight, she seemed so wounded, so broken-hearted,\nthat a shame fell upon him which consumed his pride to ashes, and\nwithered his stolen royalty. His grandeurs were stricken valueless; they\nseemed to fall away from him like rotten rags.\n\nThe procession moved on, and still on, through ever augmenting splendors\nand ever augmenting tempests of welcome; but to Tom Canty they were as\nif they had not been. He neither saw nor heard. Royalty had lost its\ngrace and sweetness; its pomps were become a reproach. Remorse was\neating his heart out. He said, \u201cWould God I were free of my captivity!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n         _FROM_ \u201cTHE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN\u201d (1876\u201383)\n\n\n            HUCK AND NIGGER JIM[3] START ON THEIR LONG DRIFT\n\nWhen it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the\ncottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;\nso Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug\nwigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things\ndry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above\nthe level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps were out of\nreach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a\nlayer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for\nto hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather\nor chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra\nsteering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag\nor something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern\non, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat\ncoming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn\u2019t have\nto light it for the up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they\ncall a \u201ccrossing\u201d; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks\nbeing still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn\u2019t always run\nthe channel, but hunted easy water.\n\nThis second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current\nthat was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked, and\nwe took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of\nsolemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking\nup at the stars, and we didn\u2019t ever feel like talking loud, and it\nwarn\u2019t often that we laughed\u2014only a little kind of a low chuckle. We had\nmighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us\nat all\u2014that night, nor the next, nor the next.\n\nEvery night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,\nnothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The\nfifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.\nIn St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand\npeople in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful\nspread of lights at two o\u2019clock that still night. There warn\u2019t a sound\nthere; everybody was asleep.\n\nEvery night now I used to slip ashore toward ten o\u2019clock at some little\nvillage, and buy ten or fifteen cents\u2019 worth of meal or bacon or other\nstuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn\u2019t roosting\ncomfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when\nyou get a chance, because if you don\u2019t want him yourself you can easy\nfind somebody that does, and a good deed aint ever forgot. I never see\npap when he didn\u2019t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to\nsay, anyway.\n\n\n                  THE GRANGERFORD-SHEPHERDSON FEUD[4]\n\nCol. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman all over;\nand so was his family. He was well born, as the saying is, and that\u2019s\nworth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said,\nand nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our\ntown; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn\u2019t no more quality\nthan a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and\nhad a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was\nclean-shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the\nthinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high\nnose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep\nback that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as\nyou may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was gray and straight\nand hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every day of\nhis life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made\nout of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he\nwore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. He carried a mahogany\ncane with a silver head to it. There warn\u2019t no frivolishness about him,\nnot a bit, and he warn\u2019t ever loud. He was as kind as he could be\u2014you\ncould feel that, you know, and so you had confidence. Sometimes he\nsmiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like\na liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his\neyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter\nwas afterwards. He didn\u2019t ever have to tell anybody to mind their\nmanners\u2014everybody was always good-mannered where he was. Everybody loved\nto have him around, too; he was sunshine most always\u2014I mean he made it\nseem like good weather. When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful\ndark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn\u2019t nothing go\nwrong for a week.\n\nWhen him and the old lady came down in the morning all the family got up\nout of their chairs and give them good day, and didn\u2019t set down again\ntill _they_ had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where\nthe decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and\nhe held it in his hand and waited till Tom\u2019s and Bob\u2019s was mixed, and\nthen they bowed and said, \u201cOur duty to you, sir, and madam\u201d; and _they_\nbowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank,\nall three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and\nthe mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and\ngive it to me and Buck,[5] and we drank to the old people too.\n\nBob was the oldest and Tom next\u2014tall, beautiful men with very broad\nshoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. They\ndressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and\nwore broad Panama hats.\n\nThen there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud\nand grand, but as good as she could be when she warn\u2019t stirred up; but\nwhen she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,\nlike her father. She was beautiful.\n\nSo was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. She was\ngentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.\n\nEach person had their own nigger to wait on them\u2014Buck too. My nigger had\na monstrous easy time, because I warn\u2019t used to having anybody do\nanything for me, but Buck\u2019s was on the jump most of the time.\n\nThis was all there was of the family now, but there used to be\nmore\u2014three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.\n\nThe old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.\nSometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or\nfifteen miles around, and stay five or six days, and have such\njunketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the\nwoods daytimes, and balls at the house nights. These people was mostly\nkinfolks of the family. The men brought their guns with them. It was a\nhandsome lot of quality, I tell you.\n\nThere was another clan of aristocracy around there\u2014five or six\nfamilies\u2014mostly of the name of Shepherdson. They was as high-toned and\nwell born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords. The\nShepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat-landing, which was\nabout two miles above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with\na lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on\ntheir fine horses.\n\nOne day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse\ncoming. We was crossing the road. Buck says:\n\n\u201cQuick! Jump for the woods!\u201d\n\nWe done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves. Pretty\nsoon a splendid young man came galloping down the road, setting his\nhorse easy and looking like a soldier. He had his gun across his pommel.\nI had seen him before. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I heard Buck\u2019s\ngun go off at my ear, and Harney\u2019s hat tumbled off from his head. He\ngrabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid. But we\ndidn\u2019t wait. We started through the woods on a run. The woods warn\u2019t\nthick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet, and twice I\nseen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away the way he\ncame\u2014to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn\u2019t see. We never stopped\nrunning till we got home. The old gentleman\u2019s eyes blazed a minute\u2014\u2019twas\npleasure, mainly, I judged\u2014then his face sort of smoothed down, and he\nsays, kind of gentle:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like that shooting from behind a bush. Why didn\u2019t you step into\nthe road, my boy?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Shepherdsons don\u2019t, father. They always take advantage.\u201d\n\nMiss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling\nhis tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped. The two young\nmen looked dark, but never said nothing. Miss Sophia she turned pale,\nbut the color come back when she found the man warn\u2019t hurt.\n\nSoon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by\nourselves, I says:\n\n\u201cDid you want to kill him, Buck?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I bet I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHim? He never done nothing to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, what did you want to kill him for?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, nothing\u2014only it\u2019s on account of the feud.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a feud?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, where was you raised? Don\u2019t you know what a feud is?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever heard of it before\u2014tell me about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Buck, \u201ca feud is this way: A man has a quarrel with another\nman, and kills him; then that other man\u2019s brother kills _him_; then the\nother brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the _cousins_\nchip in\u2014and by and by everybody\u2019s killed off, and there ain\u2019t no more\nfeud. But it\u2019s kind of slow, and takes a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas this one been going on long, Buck?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I should _reckon_! It started thirty year ago, or som\u2019ers along\nthere. There was trouble \u2019bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle\nit; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the man\nthat won the suit\u2014which he would naturally do, of course. Anybody\nwould.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was the trouble about, Buck?\u2014land?\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon maybe\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, who done the shooting? Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?\u201d\n\n\u201cLaws, how do _I_ know? It was so long ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t anybody know?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they\ndon\u2019t know now what the row was about in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas there been many killed, Buck?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; right smart chance of funerals. But they don\u2019t always kill. Pa\u2019s\ngot a few buckshot in him; but he don\u2019t mind it \u2019cuz he don\u2019t weigh\nmuch, anyway. Bob\u2019s been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom\u2019s been\nhurt once or twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas anybody been killed this year, Buck?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we got one and they got one. \u2019Bout three months ago my cousin Bud,\nfourteen years old, was riding through the woods on t\u2019other side of the\nriver, and didn\u2019t have no weapon with him, which was blame\u2019 foolishness,\nand in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind him, and sees\nold Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin\u2019 after him with his gun in his hand and\nhis white hair a-flying in the wind; and \u2019stead of jumping off and\ntaking to the brush, Bud \u2019lowed he could outrun him; so they had it, nip\nand tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all the time; so\nat last Bud seen it warn\u2019t any use, so he stopped and faced around so as\nto have the bullet-holes in front, you know, and the old man he rode up\nand shot him down. But he didn\u2019t get much chance to enjoy his luck, for\ninside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon that old man a coward, Buck.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon he _warn\u2019t_ a coward. Not by a blame\u2019 sight. There ain\u2019t a\ncoward amongst them Shepherdsons\u2014not a one. And there ain\u2019t no cowards\namongst the Grangerfords either. Why, that old man kep\u2019 up his end in a\nfight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come out\nwinner. They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got behind\na little woodpile, and kep\u2019 his horse before him to stop the bullets;\nbut the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old\nman, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them. Him and his\nhorse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the Grangerfords had\nto be _fetched_ home\u2014and one of \u2019em was dead, and another died the next\nday. No, sir; if a body\u2019s out hunting for cowards he don\u2019t want to fool\naway any time amongst them Shepherdsons becuz they don\u2019t breed any of\nthat _kind_.\u201d\n\nNext Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody\na-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept them\nbetween their knees or stood them handy against the wall. The\nShepherdsons done the same. It was pretty ornery preaching\u2014all about\nbrotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was a\ngood sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such a\npowerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and\npreforeordestination, and I don\u2019t know what all, that it did seem to me\nto be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.\n\nAbout an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their\nchairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. Buck and a\ndog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. I went up to\nour room, and judged I would take a nap myself. I found that sweet Miss\nSophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took me in\nher room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her, and I\nsaid I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and not\ntell anybody, and I said I would. Then she said she\u2019d forgot her\nTestament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books,\nand would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say\nnothing to nobody. I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the\nroad, and there warn\u2019t anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two,\nfor there warn\u2019t any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor\nin summertime because it\u2019s cool. If you notice, most folks don\u2019t go to\nchurch only when they\u2019ve got to; but a hog is different.\n\nSays I to myself, something\u2019s up; it ain\u2019t natural for a girl to be in\nsuch a sweat about a Testament. So I give it a shake, and out drops a\nlittle piece of paper with \u201c_Half-past two_\u201d wrote on it with a pencil.\nI ransacked it, but couldn\u2019t find anything else. I couldn\u2019t make\nanything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I\ngot home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me.\nShe pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament\ntill she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad;\nand before a body could think she grabbed me and gave me a squeeze, and\nsaid I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. She was\nmighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it\nmade her powerful pretty. I was a good deal astonished, but when I got\nmy breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I\nhad read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing,\nand I told her \u201cno, only coarse-hand,\u201d and then she said the paper\nwarn\u2019t anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and\nplay now.\n\nI went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon\nI noticed that my nigger was following along behind. When we was out of\nsight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes\na-running and says:\n\n\u201cMars Jawge,[6] if you\u2019ll come down into de swamp I\u2019ll show you a whole\nstack o\u2019 water-moccasins.\u201d\n\nThinks I, that\u2019s mighty curious; he said that yesterday. He oughter to\nknow a body don\u2019t love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for\nthem. What is he up to, anyway? So I says:\n\n\u201cAll right; trot ahead.\u201d\n\nI followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded\nankle-deep as much as another half-mile. We come to a little flat piece\nof land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines,\nand he says:\n\n\u201cYou shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; Dah\u2019s whah dey is.\nI\u2019s seed \u2019m befo\u2019; I don\u2019t k\u2019yer to see \u2019em no mo\u2019.\u201d\n\nThen he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid\nhim. I poked into the place a ways and come to a little open patch as\nbig as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man lying there\nasleep\u2014and, by jings, it was my old Jim!\n\nI waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to\nhim to see me again, but it warn\u2019t. He nearly cried he was so glad, but\nhe warn\u2019t surprised. Said he swum along behind me that night, and heard\nme yell every time, but dasn\u2019t answer, because he didn\u2019t want nobody to\npick _him_ up and take him into slavery again. Says he:\n\n\u201cI got hurt a little, en couldn\u2019t swim fas\u2019, so I wuz a considerable\nways behine you towards de las\u2019; when you landed I reck\u2019ned I could\nketch up wid you on de lan\u2019 \u2019dout havin\u2019 to shout at you, but when I see\ndat house I begin to go slow. I \u2019uz off too far to hear what dey say to\nyou\u2014I wuz \u2019fraid o\u2019 de dogs; but when it \u2019uz all quiet ag\u2019in I knowed\nyou\u2019s in de house, so I struck out for de woods to wait for day. Early\nin de mawnin\u2019 some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en dey\ntuk me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can\u2019t track me on accounts\no\u2019 de water, end dey brings me truck to eat every night, en tells me how\nyou\u2019s a-gittin\u2019 along.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, \u2019twarn\u2019t no use to \u2019sturb you, Huck, tell we could do sumfn\u2014but\nwe\u2019s all right, now. I ben a buyin\u2019 pots en pans en vittles, as I got a\nchanst, en a-patchin\u2019 up de raf\u2019, nights, when\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c_What_ raft, Jim?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur ole raf\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean to say our old raft warn\u2019t smashed all to flinders?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she warn\u2019t. She was tore up a good deal\u2014one en\u2019 of her was; but dey\nwarn\u2019t no great harm done, on\u2019y our traps was mos\u2019 all los\u2019. Ef we hadn\u2019\ndive\u2019 so deep en swum so fur under water, en de night hadn\u2019t ben so\ndark, en we warn\u2019t so sk\u2019yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin\u2019\nis, we\u2019d a seed de raf\u2019. But it\u2019s jis\u2019 as well we didn\u2019t, \u2019kase now\nshe\u2019s all fixed up ag\u2019in mos\u2019 as good as new, en we\u2019s got a new lot o\u2019\nstuff, in the place o\u2019 what \u2019uz los\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim\u2014did you catch her?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods? No; some er de niggers\nfoun\u2019 her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben\u2019, en dey hid her in a\ncrick \u2019mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin\u2019 \u2019bout which un \u2019um\nshe b\u2019long to de mos\u2019 dat I come to heah \u2019bout it pooty soon, so I ups\nen settles de trouble by tellin\u2019 \u2019um she don\u2019t b\u2019long to none uv \u2019um,\nbut to you en me; en I ast \u2019m if dey gwyne to grab a young white\ngenlman\u2019s propaty, en git a hid\u2019n for it? Den I gin \u2019m ten cents apiece,\nen dey \u2019uz mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo\u2019 raf\u2019s \u2019ud come along\nen make \u2019m rich ag\u2019in. Dey\u2019s mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en\nwhatever I wants \u2019m to do fur me I doan\u2019 have to ast \u2019m twice, honey.\nDat Jack\u2019s a good nigger, en pooty smart.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he is. He ain\u2019t ever told me you was here; told me to come, and\nhe\u2019d show me a lot of water-moccasins. If anything happens _he_ ain\u2019t\nmixed up in it. He can say he never seen us together, and it\u2019ll be the\ntruth.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t want to talk much about the next day. I reckon I\u2019ll cut it\npretty short. I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over and go\nto sleep again when I noticed how still it was\u2014didn\u2019t seem to be anybody\nstirring. That warn\u2019t usual. Next I noticed that Buck was up and gone.\nWell, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down-stairs\u2014nobody around;\neverything as still as a mouse. Just the same outside. Thinks I, what\ndoes it mean? Down by the woodpile I comes across my Jack and says:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it all about?\u201d\n\nSays he:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know, Mars Jawge?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d says I, \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, den, Miss Sophia\u2019s run off! \u2019deed she has. She run off in de\nnight some time\u2014nobody don\u2019t know jis when; run off to get married to\ndat young Harney Shepherdson, you know\u2014leastways, so dey \u2019spec. De\nfambly foun\u2019 it out \u2019bout half an hour ago\u2014maybe a little mo\u2019\u2014en\u2019 I\n_tell_ you dey warn\u2019t no time los\u2019. Sich another hurryin\u2019 up guns en\nhosses _you_ never see! De women folks has gone for to stir up de\nrelations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de river\nroad for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him \u2019fo\u2019 he kin git\nacrost de river wid Miss Sophia. I reck\u2019n dey\u2019s gwyne to be mighty rough\ntimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuck went off \u2019thout waking me up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I reck\u2019n he _did_! Dey warn\u2019t gwyne to mix you up in it. Mars\nBuck loaded up his gun en \u2019lowed he\u2019s gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson\nor bust. Well, dey\u2019ll be plenty un \u2019m dah, I reck\u2019n, en you bet you\nhe\u2019ll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.\u201d\n\nI took up the river road as hard as I could put. By and by I begin to\nhear guns a good ways off. When I came into sight of the log store and\nthe woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees\nand brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the forks\nof a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched. There was a\nwood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I\nwas going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn\u2019t.\n\nThere was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open\nplace before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at a\ncouple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the\nsteamboat-landing\u2014but they couldn\u2019t come it. Every time one of them\nshowed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at. The two\nboys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch\nboth ways.\n\nBy and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. They started\nriding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady\nbead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. All\nthe men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started\nto carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the\nrun. They got half-way to the tree I was in before the men noticed. Then\nthe men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after them.\nThey gained on the boys, but it didn\u2019t do no good, the boys had too good\na start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree, and\nslipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again. One of\nthe boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen\nyears old.\n\nThe men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. As soon as they was\nout of sight I sung out to Buck and told him. He didn\u2019t know what to\nmake of my voice coming out of the tree at first. He was awful\nsurprised. He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men\ncome in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or\nother\u2014wouldn\u2019t be gone long. I wished I was out of that tree, but I\ndasn\u2019t come down. Buck begun to cry and rip, and \u2019lowed that him and his\ncousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this day\nyet. He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two or\nthree of the enemy. Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush. Buck\nsaid his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations\u2014the\nShepherdsons was too strong for them. I asked him what was become of\nyoung Harney and Miss Sophia. He said they\u2019d got across the river and\nwas safe. I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take on because he\ndidn\u2019t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him\u2014I hain\u2019t never\nheard anything like it.\n\nAll of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns\u2014the men had\nslipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their\nhorses! The boys jumped for the river\u2014both of them hurt\u2014and as they swum\ndown the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing\nout, \u201cKill them, kill them!\u201d It made me so sick I most fell out of the\ntree. I ain\u2019t a-going to tell _all_ that happened\u2014it would make me sick\nagain if I was to do that. I wished I hadn\u2019t ever come ashore that night\nto see such things. I ain\u2019t ever going to get shut of them\u2014lots of times\nI dream about them.\n\nI stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.\nSometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little\ngangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the\ntrouble was still a-going on. I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my\nmind I wouldn\u2019t ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I was\nto blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss\nSophia was to meet Harney some-wheres at half-past two, and run off; and\nI judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way\nshe acted, and then maybe he would \u2019a\u2019 locked her up, and this awful\nmess wouldn\u2019t ever happened.\n\nWhen I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a\npiece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and\ntugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces,\nand got away as quick as I could. I cried a little when I was covering\nup Buck\u2019s face, for he was mighty good to me.\n\nIt was just dark now. I never went near the house, but struck through\nthe woods and made for the swamp. Jim warn\u2019t on his island, so I tramped\noff in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows, red-hot\nto jump aboard and get out of that awful country. The raft was gone! My\nsouls, but I was scared! I couldn\u2019t get my breath for most a minute.\nThen I raised a yell. A voice not twenty-five foot from me, says:\n\n\u201cGood lan\u2019! is dat you, honey? Doan\u2019 make no noise.\u201d\n\nIt was Jim\u2019s voice\u2014nothing ever sounded so good before. I run along the\nbank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was\nso glad to see me. He says:\n\n\u201cLaws bless you, chile, I \u2019uz right down sho\u2019 you\u2019s dead ag\u2019in. Jack\u2019s\nbeen heah; he say he reck\u2019n you\u2019s been shot, kase you didn\u2019t come home\nno mo\u2019; so I\u2019s jes\u2019 dis minute a-startin\u2019 er raf\u2019 down towards de mouf\ner de crick, so\u2019s to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack\ncomes ag\u2019in en tells me for certain you _is_ dead. Lawdy, I\u2019s mighty\nglad to git you back ag\u2019in, honey.\u201d\n\nI says:\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014that\u2019s mighty good; they won\u2019t find me, and they\u2019ll think\nI\u2019ve been killed, and floated down the river\u2014there\u2019s something up there\nthat\u2019ll help them think so\u2014so don\u2019t you lose no time, Jim, but just\nshove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.\u201d\n\nI never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the\nmiddle of the Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal lantern, and\njudged that we was free and safe once more. I hadn\u2019t had a bite to eat\nsince yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk, and\npork and cabbage and greens\u2014there ain\u2019t nothing in the world so good\nwhen it\u2019s cooked right\u2014and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a\ngood time. I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was\nJim to get away from the swamp. We said there warn\u2019t no home like a\nraft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a\nraft don\u2019t. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.\n\n\n\n\n     _FROM_ \u201cA CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR\u2019S COURT\u201d (1886\u20137)\n\n\n                           MEETING THE YANKEE\n\nIt was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I\nam going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid\nsimplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the\nrestfulness of his company\u2014for he did all the talking. We fell together,\nas modest people will, in the tail of the herd that was being shown\nthrough, and he at once began to say things which interested me. As he\ntalked along, softly, pleasantly, flowingly, he seemed to drift away\nimperceptibly out of this world and time, and into some remote era and\nold forgotten country; and so he gradually wove such a spell about me\nthat I seemed to move among the specters and shadows and dust and mold\nof a gray antiquity, holding speech with a relic of it! Exactly as I\nwould speak of my nearest personal friends or enemies, or my most\nfamiliar neighbors, he spoke of Sir Bedivere, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir\nLauncelot of the Lake, Sir Galahad, and all the other great names of the\nTable Round\u2014and how old, old, unspeakably old and faded and dry and\nmusty and ancient he came to look as he went on! Presently he turned to\nme and said, just as one might speak of the weather, or any other common\nmatter\u2014\n\n\u201cYou know about transmigration of souls; do you know about transposition\nof epochs\u2014and bodies?\u201d\n\nI said I had not heard of it. He was so little interested\u2014just as when\npeople speak of the weather\u2014that he did not notice whether I made him\nany answer or not. There was half a moment of silence, immediately\ninterrupted by the droning voice of the salaried cicerone:\n\n\u201cAncient hauberk, date of the sixth century, time of King Arthur and the\nRound Table; said to have belonged to the knight Sir Sagramor le\nDesirous; observe the round hole through the chain-mail in the left\nbreast; can\u2019t be accounted for; supposed to have been done with a bullet\nsince invention of firearms\u2014perhaps maliciously by Cromwell\u2019s soldiers.\u201d\n\nMy acquaintance smiled\u2014not a modern smile, but one that must have gone\nout of general use many, many centuries ago\u2014and muttered, apparently to\nhimself:\n\n\u201cWit ye well, _I saw it done_.\u201d Then, after a pause, added: \u201cI did it\nmyself.\u201d\n\nBy the time I had recovered from the electric surprise of this remark,\nhe was gone.\n\nAll that evening I sat by my fire at the Warwick Arms, steeped in a\ndream of the olden time, while the rain beat upon the windows, and the\nwind roared about the eaves and corners. From time to time I dipped into\nold Sir Thomas Malory\u2019s enchanting book, and fed at its rich feast of\nprodigies and adventures, breathed in the fragrance of its obsolete\nnames, and dreamed again.\n\nAs I laid the book down there was a knock at the door, and my stranger\ncame in. I gave him a pipe and a chair, and made him welcome. I also\ncomforted him with a hot Scotch whisky; gave him another one; then still\nanother\u2014hoping always for his story. After a fourth persuader, he\ndrifted into it himself, in a quite simple and natural way:\n\n\n                         THE STRANGER\u2019S HISTORY\n\nI am an American. I was born and reared in Hartford, in the State of\nConnecticut\u2014anyway, just over the river, in the country. So I am a\nYankee of the Yankees\u2014and practical, yes, and nearly barren of\nsentiment, I suppose\u2014or poetry, in other words. My father was a\nblacksmith, my uncle was a horse doctor, and I was both, along at first.\nThen I went over to the great arms factory and learned my real trade;\nlearned all there was to it; learned to make everything: guns,\nrevolvers, cannon, boilers, engines, all sorts of labor-saving\nmachinery. Why, I could make anything a body wanted\u2014anything in the\nworld, it didn\u2019t make any difference what; and if there wasn\u2019t any quick\nnew-fangled way to make a thing, I could invent one\u2014and do it as easy as\nrolling off a log. I became head superintendent; had a couple of\nthousand men under me.\n\nWell, a man like that is a man that is full of fight\u2014that goes without\nsaying. With a couple of thousand men under one, one has plenty of that\nsort of amusement. I had, anyway. At last I met my match, and I got my\ndose. It was during a misunderstanding conducted with crowbars with a\nfellow we used to call Hercules. He laid me out with a crusher alongside\nthe head that made everything crack, and seemed to spring every joint in\nmy skull and make it overlap its neighbor. Then the world went out in\ndarkness, and I didn\u2019t feel anything more, and didn\u2019t know anything at\nall\u2014at least for a while.\n\nWhen I came to again, I was sitting under an oak tree, on the grass,\nwith a whole beautiful and broad country landscape all to myself\u2014nearly.\nNot entirely; for there was a fellow on a horse, looking down at me\u2014a\nfellow fresh out of a picture-book. He was in old-time iron armor from\nhead to heel, with a helmet on his head the shape of a nail-keg with\nslits in it; and he had a shield, and a sword, and a prodigious spear;\nand his horse had armor on, too, and a steel horn projecting from his\nforehead, and gorgeous red and green silk trappings that hung down all\naround him like a bedquilt, nearly to the ground.\n\n\u201cFair sir, will ye just?\u201d said this fellow.\n\n\u201cWill I which?\u201d\n\n\u201cWill ye try a passage of arms for land or lady or for\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you giving me?\u201d I said. \u201cGet along back to your circus, or\nI\u2019ll report you.\u201d\n\nNow what does this man do but fall back a couple of hundred yards and\nthen come rushing at me as hard as he could tear, with his nail-keg bent\ndown nearly to his horse\u2019s neck and his long spear pointed straight\nahead. I saw he meant business, so I was up the tree when he arrived.\n\nHe allowed that I was his property, the captive of his spear. There was\nargument on his side\u2014and the bulk of the advantage\u2014so I judged it best\nto humor him. We fixed up an agreement whereby I was to go with him and\nhe was not to hurt me. I came down, and we started away, I walking by\nthe side of his horse. We marched comfortably along, through glades and\nover brooks which I could not remember to have seen before\u2014which puzzled\nme and made me wonder\u2014and yet we did not come to any circus or sign of a\ncircus. So I gave up the idea of a circus, and concluded he was from an\nasylum. But we never came to an asylum\u2014so I was up a stump, as you may\nsay. I asked him how far we were from Hartford. He said he had never\nheard of the place; which I took to be a lie, but allowed it to go at\nthat. At the end of an hour we saw a far-away town sleeping in a valley\nby a winding river; and beyond it on a hill, a vast gray fortress, with\ntowers and turrets, the first I had ever seen out of a picture.\n\n\u201cBridgeport,\u201d said I, pointing.\n\n\u201cCamelot,\u201d said he.\n\nMy stranger had been showing signs of sleepiness. He caught himself\nnodding, now, and smiled one of those pathetic, obsolete smiles of his,\nand said:\n\n\u201cI find I can\u2019t go on; but come with me, I\u2019ve got it all written out,\nand you can read it, if you like.\u201d\n\nIn his chamber, he said: \u201cFirst, I kept a journal; then by and by, after\nyears, I took the journal and turned it into a book. How long ago that\nwas!\u201d\n\nHe handed me his manuscript, and pointed out the place where I should\nbegin:\n\n\u201cBegin here\u2014I\u2019ve already told you what goes before.\u201d He was steeped in\ndrowsiness by this time. As I went out at his door I heard him murmur\nsleepily: \u201cGive you good den, fair sir.\u201d\n\nI sat down by my fire and examined my treasure. The first part of it\u2014the\ngreat bulk of it\u2014was parchment, and yellow with age. I scanned a leaf\nparticularly and saw that it was a palimpsest. Under the old dim writing\nof the Yankee historian appeared traces of a penmanship which was older\nand dimmer still\u2014Latin words and sentences: fragments from old monkish\nlegends, evidently. I turned to the place indicated by my stranger and\nbegan to read.\n\n\n                           THE ROUND TABLE[7]\n\nIn the middle of this groined and vaulted public square was an oaken\ntable which was called the Table Round. It was as large as a circus\nring; and around it sat a great company of men dressed in such various\nand splendid colors that it hurt one\u2019s eyes to look at them. They wore\ntheir plumed hats, right along, except that whenever one addressed\nhimself directly to the king, he lifted his hat a trifle just as he was\nbeginning his remark.\n\nMainly they were drinking\u2014from entire ox horns; but a few were still\nmunching bread or gnawing beef bones. There was about an average of two\ndogs to one man; and these sat in expectant attitudes till a spent bone\nwas flung to them, and then they went for it by brigades and divisions,\nwith a rush, and there ensued a fight which filled the prospect with a\ntumultuous chaos of plunging heads and bodies and flashing tails, and\nthe storm of howlings and barkings deafened all speech for the time; but\nthat was no matter, for the dog-fight was always a bigger interest\nanyway; the men rose, sometimes, to observe it the better and bet on it,\nand the ladies and the musicians stretched themselves out over their\nbalusters with the same object; and all broke into delighted\nejaculation, from time to time. In the end, the winning dog stretched\nhimself out comfortably with his bone between his paws, and proceeded to\ngrowl over it, and gnaw it, and grease the floor with it, just as fifty\nothers were already doing; and the rest of the court resumed their\nprevious industries and entertainments.\n\nAs a rule, the speech and behavior of these people were gracious and\ncourtly; and I noticed that they were good and serious listeners when\nanybody was telling anything\u2014I mean in a dog-fightless interval. And\nplainly, too, they were a childlike and innocent lot; telling lies of\nthe stateliest pattern with a most gentle and winning naivet\u00e9, and ready\nand willing to listen to anybody else\u2019s lie, and believe it, too. It was\nhard to associate them with anything cruel or dreadful; and yet they\ndealt in tales of blood and suffering with a guileless relish that made\nme almost forget to shudder.\n\nMainly the Round Table talk was monologues\u2014narrative accounts of the\nadventures in which these prisoners were captured and their friends and\nbackers killed and stripped of their steeds and armor. As a general\nthing\u2014as far as I could make out\u2014these murderous adventures were not\nforays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor to settle old disputes or\nsudden fallings out; no, as a rule they were simple duels between\nstrangers\u2014duels between people who had never even been introduced to\neach other, and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever. Many\na time I had seen a couple of boys, strangers, meet by chance, and say\nsimultaneously, \u201cI can lick you,\u201d and go at it on the spot; but I had\nalways imagined until now that that sort of thing belonged to children\nonly, and was a sign and mark of childhood; but here were these big\nboobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age,\nand beyond. Yet there was something very engaging about these great\nsimple-hearted creatures, something attractive and lovable. There did\nnot seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to bait\na fish-hook with; but you didn\u2019t seem to mind that; after a little, you\nsoon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that, and indeed\nwould have marred it, spoiled its symmetry\u2014perhaps rendered its\nexistence impossible.\n\n\n                          THE YANKEE REFLECTS\n\nWhy, dear me, _any_ kind of royalty, howsoever modified, _any_ kind of\naristocracy, howsoever pruned, is rightly an insult; but if you are born\nand brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably never find it\nout for yourself, and don\u2019t believe it when somebody else tells you. It\nis enough to make a body ashamed of his race to think of the sort of\nfroth that has always occupied its thrones without shadow of right or\nreason, and the seventh-rate people that have always figured as its\naristocracies\u2014a company of monarchs and nobles who, as a rule, would\nhave achieved only poverty and obscurity if left, like their betters, to\ntheir own exertions.\n\n\n                           PERFECT GOVERNMENT\n\nThe despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect government. An\nearthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect earthly government, if\nthe conditions were the same, namely, the despot the perfectest\nindividual of the human race, and his lease of life perpetual. But as a\nperishable perfect man must die, and leave his despotism in the hands of\nan imperfect successor, an earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of\ngovernment, it is the worst form that is possible.\n\n\n                           MAIDS IN DISTRESS\n\nThere never was such a country for wandering liars; and they were of\nboth sexes. Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving;\nand generally loaded with a tale about some princess or other wanting\nhelp to get her out of some far-away castle where she was held in\ncaptivity by a lawless scoundrel, usually a giant. Now you would think\nthat the first thing the king would do after listening to such a\nnovelette from an entire stranger, would be to ask for credentials\u2014yes,\nand a pointer or two as to locality of castle, best route to it, and so\non. But nobody ever thought of so simple and common-sense a thing as\nthat. No, everybody swallowed these people\u2019s lies whole, and never asked\na question of any sort or about anything. Well, one day when I was not\naround, one of these people came along\u2014it was a she one, this time\u2014and\ntold a tale of the usual pattern. Her mistress was a captive in a vast\nand gloomy castle, along with forty-four other young and beautiful\ngirls, pretty much all of them princesses; they had been languishing in\nthat cruel captivity for twenty-six years; the masters of the castle\nwere three stupendous brothers, each with four arms and one eye\u2014the eye\nin the center of the forehead, and as big as a fruit. Sort of fruit not\nmentioned; their usual slovenliness in statistics.\n\nWould you believe it? The king and the whole Round Table were in\nraptures over this preposterous opportunity for adventure. Every knight\nof the Table jumped for the chance, and begged for it; but to their\nvexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me, who had not asked\nfor it at all.\n\n\n                           A KNIGHT\u2019S AVERAGE\n\nIf knights errant were to be believed, not all castles were desirable\nplaces to seek hospitality in. As a matter of fact, knights errant were\n_not_ persons to be believed\u2014that is, measured by modern standards of\nveracity; yet, measured by the standards of their own time, and scaled\naccordingly, you got the truth. It was very simple: you discounted a\nstatement ninety-seven per cent.; the rest was fact.\n\n\n                         SIXTH CENTURY KINGDOMS\n\n\u201cKings\u201d and \u201cKingdoms\u201d were as thick in Britain as they had been in\nlittle Palestine in Joshua\u2019s time, when people had to sleep with their\nknees pulled up because they couldn\u2019t stretch out without a passport.\n\n\n                                 NATURE\n\nTraining\u2014training is everything; training is all there is _to_ a person.\nWe speak of nature; what we call by that misleading name is heredity and\ntraining. We have no thoughts of our own, no opinions of our own; they\nare transmitted to us, trained into us. All that is original in us, and\ntherefore fairly creditable or discreditable to us, can be covered up\nand hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the rest being atoms\ncontributed by, and inherited from, a procession of ancestors that\nstretches back a billion years to the Adam-clam or grasshopper or monkey\nfrom whom our race has been so tediously and ostentatiously and\nunprofitably developed.\n\n\n                               CONSCIENCE\n\nIf I had the remaking of man, he wouldn\u2019t have any conscience. It is one\nof the most disagreeable things connected with a person; and although it\ncertainly does a great deal of good, it cannot be said to pay, in the\nlong run; it would be much better to have less good and more comfort.\nStill, this is only my opinion, and I am only one man; others, with less\nexperience, may think differently. They have a right to their views. I\nonly stand to this; I have noticed my conscience for many years, and I\nknow it is more trouble and bother to me than anything else I started\nwith. I suppose that in the beginning I prized it, because we prize\nanything that is ours; and yet how foolish it was to think so. If we\nlook at it in another way we see how absurd it is: if I had an anvil in\nme would I prize it? Of course not. And yet when you come to think,\nthere is no real difference between a conscience and an anvil\u2014I mean for\ncomfort. I have noticed it a thousand times. And you could dissolve an\nanvil with acids, when you couldn\u2019t stand it any longer; but there isn\u2019t\nany way that you can work off a conscience\u2014at least, so it will stay\nworked off; not that I know of, anyway.\n\n\n                          THE GERMAN TONGUE[8]\n\nI was gradually coming to have a mysterious and shuddery reverence for\nthis girl; nowadays whenever she pulled out from the station and got her\ntrain fairly started on one of those horizonless transcontinental\nsentences of hers, it was borne in upon me that I was standing in the\nawful presence of the Mother of the German Language. I was so impressed\nwith this, that sometimes when she began to empty one of these sentences\non me I unconsciously took the very attitude of reverence, and stood\nuncovered; and if words had been water, I had been drowned, sure. She\nhad exactly the German way; whatever was in her mind to be delivered,\nwhether a mere remark, or a sermon, or a cyclop\u00e6dia, or the history of a\nwar, she would get it into a single sentence or die. Whenever the\nliterary German dives into a sentence, that is the last you are going to\nsee of him till he emerges on the other side of his Atlantic with his\nverb in his mouth.\n\n\n                        GOVERNMENT BY THE PEOPLE\n\nThere is a phrase which has grown so common in the world\u2019s mouth that it\nhas come to seem to have sense and meaning\u2014the sense and meaning implied\nwhen it is used; that is the phrase which refers to this or that or the\nother nation as possibly being \u201ccapable of self-government\u201d; and the\nimplied sense of it is, that there has been a nation somewhere, some\ntime or other which _wasn\u2019t_ capable of it\u2014wasn\u2019t as able to govern\nitself as some self-appointed specialists were, or would be, to govern\nit. The master minds of all nations, in all ages, have sprung in\naffluent multitude from the mass of the nation, and from the mass of the\nnation only\u2014not from its privileged classes; and so, no matter what the\nnation\u2019s intellectual grade was, whether high or low, the bulk of its\nability was in the long ranks of its nameless and its poor, and so it\nnever saw the day that it had not the material in abundance whereby to\ngovern itself. Which is to assert an always self-proven fact; that even\nthe best governed and most free and most enlightened monarchy is still\nbehind the best condition attainable by its people; and that the same is\ntrue of kindred governments of lower grades, all the way down to the\nlowest.\n\n\n                                PROPHECY\n\nA prophet doesn\u2019t have to have any brains. They are good to have, of\ncourse, for the ordinary exigencies of life, but they are of no use in\nprofessional work. It is the restfullest vocation there is. When the\nspirit of prophecy comes upon you, you merely take your intellect and\nlay it off in a cool place for a rest, and unship your jaw and leave it\nalone; it will work itself: the result is prophecy.\n\n\n                               HARD WORK\n\nWords realize nothing, vivify nothing to you, unless you have suffered\nin your own person the thing which the words try to describe. There are\nwise people who talk ever so knowingly and complacently about \u201cthe\nworking classes,\u201d and satisfy themselves that a day\u2019s hard intellectual\nwork is very much harder than a day\u2019s hard manual toil, and is\nrighteously entitled to much bigger pay. Why, they really think that,\nyou know, because they know all about the one, but haven\u2019t tried the\nother. But I know all about both; and so far as I am concerned, there\nisn\u2019t money enough in the universe to hire me to swing a pick-axe thirty\ndays, but I will do the hardest kind of intellectual work for just as\nnear nothing as you can cipher it down\u2014and I will be satisfied, too.\n\n\n                               STILL HOPE\n\nYes, there is plenty good enough material for a republic in the most\ndegraded people that ever existed\u2014even the Russians; plenty of manhood\nin them\u2014even in the Germans\u2014if one could but force it out of its timid\nand suspicious privacy, to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne\nthat ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it.\n\n\n                             THE HUMAN RACE\n\nToward the shaven monk who trudged along with his cowl tilted back and\nthe sweat washing down his fat jowls, the coal-burner was deeply\nreverent; to the gentleman he was abject; with the small farmer and the\nfree mechanic he was cordial and gossipy; and when a slave passed by\nwith a countenance respectfully lowered, this chap\u2019s nose was in the\nair\u2014he couldn\u2019t even see him. Well, there are times when one would like\nto hang the whole human race and finish the farce.\n\n\n                         THE KING IN SLAVERY[9]\n\nWe had a rough time for a month, tramping to and fro in the earth, and\nsuffering. And what Englishman was the most interested in the slavery\nquestion by that time? His grace, the king! Yes; from being the most\nindifferent, he was become the most interested. He was become the\nbitterest hater of the institution I had ever heard talk....\n\nNow and then we had an adventure. One night we were overtaken by a\nsnow-storm while still a mile from the village we were making for.\nAlmost instantly we were shut up as in a fog, the driving snow was so\nthick. You couldn\u2019t see a thing, and we were soon lost. The slave-driver\nlashed us desperately, for he saw ruin before him, but his lashings only\nmade matters worse, for they drove us further from the road and from\nlikelihood of succor. So we had to stop at last and slump down in the\nsnow where we were. The storm continued until toward midnight, then\nceased. By this time two of our feebler men and three of our women were\ndead, and others past moving and threatened with death. Our master was\nnearly beside himself. He stirred up the living and made us stand, jump,\nslap ourselves, to restore our circulation, and he helped as well as he\ncould with his whip.\n\nNow came a diversion. We heard shrieks and yells, and soon a woman came\nrunning and crying; and seeing our group, she flung herself into our\nmidst and begged for protection. A mob of people came tearing after her,\nsome with torches, and they said she was a witch who had caused several\ncows to die by a strange disease, and practiced her arts by help of a\ndevil in the form of a black cat. This poor woman had been stoned until\nshe hardly looked human, she was so battered and bloody. The mob wanted\nto burn her.\n\nWell, now, what do you suppose our master did? When we closed around\nthis poor creature to shelter her, he saw his chance. He said, burn her\nhere, or they shouldn\u2019t have her at all. Imagine that! They were\nwilling. They fastened her to a post; they brought wood and piled it\nabout her; they applied the torch, while she shrieked and pleaded and\nstrained her two young daughters to her breast; and our brute, with a\nheart solely for business, lashed us into position about the stake and\nwarmed us into life and commercial value by the same fire which took\naway the innocent life of that poor harmless mother. That was the sort\nof master we had. I took _his_ number. That snow-storm cost him nine of\nhis flock; and he was more brutal to us than ever, after that, for many\ndays together, he was so enraged over his loss.\n\n\n\n\n          _FROM_ \u201cRAMBLING NOTES OF AN IDLE EXCURSION\u201d (1877)\n\n\n                         WHAT WE SAW IN BERMUDA\n\nWe saw no bugs or reptiles to speak of, and so I was thinking of saying\nin print in a general way, that there were none at all; but one night\nafter I had gone to bed, the Reverend came into my room carrying\nsomething, and asked, \u201cIs this your boot?\u201d I said it was, and he said he\nhad met a spider going off with it. Next morning he stated that just at\ndawn the same spider raised his window and was coming in to get his\nshirt, but saw him and fled.\n\nI inquired, \u201cDid he get the shirt?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you know it was a shirt he was after?\u201d\n\n\u201cI could see it in his eyes.\u201d\n\nWe inquired around, but could hear of no Bermudian spider capable of\ndoing these things. Citizens said that their largest spiders could not\nmore than spread their legs over an ordinary saucer, and that they had\nalways been considered honest. Here was testimony of a clergyman against\nthe testimony of mere worldlings\u2014interested ones, too. On the whole, I\njudged it best to lock up my things.\n\nHere and there on the country roads we found lemon, papaw, orange, lime,\nand fig-trees; also several sorts of palms, among them the cocoa, the\ndate, and the palmetto. We saw some bamboos forty feet high, with stems\nas thick as a man\u2019s arm. Jungles of the mangrove-tree stood up out of\nswamps, propped on their interlacing roots, as upon a tangle of stilts.\nIn dryer places the noble tamarind sent down its grateful cloud of\nshade. Here and there the blossomy tamarisk adorned the roadside. There\nwas a curious gnarled and twisted black tree, without a single leaf on\nit. It might have passed itself off for a dead apple tree but for the\nfact that it had a star-like, red-hot flower sprinkled sparsely over its\nperson. It had the scattery red glow that a constellation might have\nwhen glimpsed through smoked glass....\n\nWe saw a tree that bears grapes, and just as calmly and unostentatiously\nas a vine would do it. We saw an india-rubber-tree, but out of season,\npossibly, so there were no shoes on it, nor suspenders, nor anything\nthat a person would properly expect to find there. This gave it an\nimpressively fraudulent look. There was exactly one mahogany tree on the\nisland. I know this to be reliable, because I saw a man who said he had\ncounted it many a time and could not be mistaken. He was a man with a\nharelip and a pure heart, and everybody said he was as true as steel.\nSuch men are all too few.\n\n\n\n\n             _FROM_ \u201cPUDD\u2019NHEAD WILSON\u2019S CALENDAR\u201d (1892\u20133)\n\n\nTell the truth or trump\u2014but get the trick.\n\n\nAdam was but human\u2014this explains it all.

Thousands entered the war, got\njust a taste of it, and then stepped out again permanently....\n\nIn that summer\u2014of 1861\u2014the first wash of the wave of war broke upon the\nshores of Missouri. Our state was invaded by the Union forces. They took\npossession of St. Louis, Jefferson Barracks, and some other points. The\nGovernor, Calib Jackson, issued his proclamation calling out fifty\nthousand militia to repel the invader.\n\nI was visiting in the small town where my boyhood had been\nspent\u2014Hannibal, Marion County. Several of us got together in a secret\nplace by night and formed ourselves into a military company. One Tom\nLyman, a young fellow of a good deal of spirit but of no military\nexperience, was made captain; I was made second lieutenant. We had no\nfirst lieutenant; I do not know why; it was long ago. There were fifteen\nof us. By the advice of an innocent connected with the organization we\ncalled ourselves the Marion Rangers. I do not remember that any one\nfound fault with the name. I did not; I thought it sounded quite well.\nThe young fellow who proposed this title was perhaps a fair sample of\nthe kind of stuff we were made of. He was young, ignorant, good-natured,\nwell-meaning, trivial, full of romance, and given to reading chivalric\nnovels and singing forlorn love ditties. He had some pathetic little\nnickel-plated aristocratic instincts, and detested his name, which was\nDunlap; detested it partly because it was nearly as common in that\nregion as Smith, but mainly because it had a plebeian sound to his ear.\nSo he tried to ennoble it by writing it in this way: _d\u2019Unlap_. That\ncontented his eye, but left his ear unsatisfied, for people gave the new\nname the same old pronunciation\u2014emphasis on the front end of it. He then\ndid the bravest thing that can be imagined\u2014a thing to make one shiver\nwhen one remembers how the world is given to resenting shams and\naffectations; he began to write his name so: _d\u2019Un Lap_. And he waited\npatiently through the long storm of mud that was flung at this work of\nart, and he had his reward at last; for he lived to see that name\naccepted, and the emphasis put where he wanted it by people who had\nknown him all his life, and to whom the tribe of Dunlaps had been as\nfamiliar as the rain and sunshine for forty years. So sure of victory at\nlast is the courage that can wait. He said he had found, by consulting\nsome ancient French chronicles, that the name was rightly and originally\nwritten d\u2019Un Lap; and said that if it were translated into English it\nwould mean Peterson: _Lap_, Latin or Greek, he said, for stone or rock,\nsame as the French _pierre_, that is to say Peter; _d\u2019_ of or from;\n_un_, a or one; hence, d\u2019Un Lap, of or from a stone or a Peter; that is\nto say, one who is the son of a stone, the son of a Peter\u2014Peterson. Our\nmilitia company were not learned, and the explanation confused them; so\nthey called him Peterson Dunlap. He proved useful to us in his way; he\nnamed our camps for us, and he generally struck a name that was \u201cno\nslouch,\u201d as the boys said.\n\nThat is one sample of us. Another was Ed Stevens, son of the town\njeweler\u2014trim built, handsome, graceful, neat as a cat; bright, educated,\nbut given over entirely to fun. There was nothing serious in life to\nhim. As far as he was concerned, this military expedition of ours was\nsimply a holiday. I should say that about half of us looked upon it in\nthe same way; not consciously perhaps, but unconsciously. We did not\nthink; we were not capable of it. As for myself, I was full of\nunreasoning joy to be done with turning out of bed at midnight and four\nin the morning for a while; grateful to have a change, new scenes, new\noccupations, a new interest. In my thoughts that was as far as I went; I\ndid not go into the details; as a rule, one doesn\u2019t at twenty-four.\n\nAnother sample was Smith, the blacksmith\u2019s apprentice. This vast donkey\nhad some pluck, of a slow and sluggish nature, but a soft heart; at one\ntime he would knock a horse down for some impropriety, and at another he\nwould get homesick and cry. However, he had one ultimate credit to his\naccount which some of us hadn\u2019t; he stuck to the war, and was killed in\nbattle at last.\n\nJo Bowers, another sample, was a huge, good-natured, flax-headed lubber;\nlazy, sentimental, full of harmless brag, a grumbler by nature; an\nexperienced, industrious, ambitious, and often quite picturesque liar,\nand yet not a successful one, for he had had no intelligent training,\nbut was allowed to come up just anyway. This life was serious enough to\nhim, and seldom satisfactory. But he was a good fellow, anyway, and the\nboys all liked him. He was made orderly sergeant; Stevens was made\ncorporal.\n\nThese samples will answer\u2014and they are quite fair ones. Well, this herd\nof cattle started for the war. What could you expect of them? They did\nas well as they knew how; but really what was justly to be expected of\nthem? Nothing, I should say. That is what they did....\n\nFor a time life was idly delicious, it was perfect; there was nothing to\nmar it. Then came some farmers with an alarm one day. They said it was\nrumored that the enemy were advancing in our direction from over Hyde\u2019s\nPrairie. The result was a sharp stir among us and general consternation.\nIt was a rude awakening from our pleasant trance. The rumor was but a\nrumor\u2014nothing definite about it; so, in the confusion, we did not know\nwhich way to retreat. Lyman was for not retreating at all, in these\nuncertain circumstances; but he found that if he tried to maintain that\nattitude he would fare badly, for the command were in no humor to put up\nwith insubordination. So he yielded the point and called a council of\nwar\u2014to consist of himself and the three other officers; but the privates\nmade such a fuss about being left out that we had to allow them to\nremain, for they were already present, and doing the most of the\ntalking, too. The question was, which way to retreat; but all were so\nflurried that nobody seemed to have even a guess to offer. Except Lyman.\nHe explained in a few calm words that, inasmuch as the enemy was\napproaching from over Hyde\u2019s Prairie, our course was simple; all we had\nto do was not to retreat _towards_ him; any other direction would answer\nour needs perfectly. Everybody saw in a moment how true this was, and\nhow wise; so Lyman got a great many compliments. It was now decided that\nwe should fall back on Mason\u2019s farm.\n\nIt was after dark by this time, and as we could not know how soon the\nenemy might arrive, it did not seem best to try to take the horses and\nthings with us; so we only took the guns and ammunition, and started at\nonce.\n\nWe heard a sound, and held our breath and listened, and it seemed to be\nthe enemy coming, though it could have been a cow, for it had a cough\nlike a cow; but we did not wait, but left a couple of guns behind and\nstruck out for Mason\u2019s again, as briskly as we could scramble along in\nthe dark. But we got lost presently among the rugged little ravines, and\nwasted a deal of time finding the way again, so it was after nine\no\u2019clock when we reached Mason\u2019s stile at last; and then before we could\nopen our mouths to give the countersign several dogs came bounding over\nthe fence, with great riot and noise, and each of them took a soldier by\nthe slack of his trousers and began to back away with him. We could not\nshoot the dogs without endangering the persons they were attached to; so\nwe had to look on helplessly, at what was perhaps the most mortifying\nspectacle of the Civil War. There was light enough, and to spare, for\nthe Masons had now run out on the porch with candles in their hands. The\nold man and his son came and undid the dogs without difficulty, all but\nBowers\u2019s; but they couldn\u2019t undo his dog, they didn\u2019t know his\ncombination; he was of the bull kind, and seemed to be set with a Yale\ntime-lock; but they got him loose at last with some scalding water, of\nwhich Bowers got his share and returned thanks.\n\n\n\n\n           _FROM_ \u201cTHE PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS OF JOAN OF ARC\u201d\n\n\n                                  JOAN\n\nTo arrive at a just estimate of a renowned man\u2019s character one must\njudge it by the standards of his time, not ours. Judged by the standards\nof one century, the noblest characters of an earlier one lose much of\ntheir luster; judged by the standards of to-day, there is probably no\nillustrious man of four or five centuries ago whose character could meet\nthe test at all points. But the character of Joan of Arc is unique. It\ncan be measured by the standards of all times without misgiving or\napprehension as to the result. Judged by any of them, judged by all of\nthem, it is still flawless, it is still ideally perfect; it still\noccupies the loftiest place possible to human attainment, a loftier one\nthan has been reached by any other mere mortal.\n\nWhen we reflect that her century was the brutalest, the wickedest, the\nrottenest in history since the darkest ages, we are lost in wonder at\nthe miracle of such a product from such a soil. The contrast between her\nand her century is the contrast between day and night. She was truthful\nwhen lying was the common speech of men; she was honest when honesty was\nbecome a lost virtue; she was a keeper of promises when the keeping of a\npromise was expected of no one; she gave her great mind to great\nthoughts and great purposes when other great minds wasted themselves\nupon pretty fancies or upon poor ambitions; she was modest, and fine,\nand delicate, when to be loud and coarse might be said to be universal;\nshe was full of pity when a merciless cruelty was the rule; she was\nsteadfast when stability was unknown, and honorable in an age which had\nforgotten what honor was; she was a rock of convictions in a time when\nmen believed in nothing and scoffed at all things; she was unfailingly\ntrue in an age that was false to the core; she maintained her personal\ndignity unimpaired in an age of fawnings and servilities; she was of a\ndauntless courage when hope and courage had perished in the hearts of\nher nation; she was spotlessly pure in mind and body when society in the\nhighest places was foul in both\u2014she was all these things in an age when\ncrime was the common business of lords and princes, and when the highest\npersonages in Christendom were able to astonish even that infamous era\nand make it stand aghast at the spectacle of their atrocious lives black\nwith unimaginable treacheries, butcheries, and bestialities.\n\nShe was perhaps the only entirely unselfish person whose name has a\nplace in profane history. No vestige or suggestion of self-seeking can\nbe found in any word or deed of hers. When she had rescued her king from\nhis vagabondage, and set his crown upon his head she was offered rewards\nand honors, but she refused them all, and would take nothing. All she\nwould take for herself\u2014if the king would grant it\u2014was leave to go back\nto her village home, and tend her sheep again, and feel her mother\u2019s\narms about her, and be her housemaid and helper. The selfishness of this\nunspoiled general of victorious army, companion of princes, an idol of\nan applauding and grateful nation, reached but that far and no farther.\n\n\n                             THE FAIRY TREE\n\nIn a noble open space carpeted with grass on the high ground toward\nVaucouleur stood a most majestic beech tree with wide-reaching arms and\na grand spread of shade, and by it a limpid spring of cold water; and on\nsummer days the children went there\u2014oh, every summer for more than five\nhundred years\u2014went there and sang and danced around the tree for hours\ntogether, refreshing themselves at the spring from time to time, and it\nwas most lovely and enjoyable. Also they made wreaths of flowers and\nhung them upon the tree and about the spring to please the fairies that\nlived there; for they liked that, being idle innocent little creatures,\nas all fairies are and fond of anything delicate and pretty like wild\nflowers put together in that way. And in return for this attention the\nfairies did any friendly thing they could for the children, such as\nkeeping the spring always full and clear and cold, and driving away\nserpents and insects that sting; and so there was never any unkindness\nbetween the fairies and the children during more than five hundred\nyears\u2014tradition said a thousand\u2014but only the warmest affection and the\nmost perfect trust and confidence; and whenever a child died the fairies\nmourned just as that child\u2019s playmates did, and the sign of it was there\nto see; for before the dawn on the day of the funeral they hung a little\nimmortelle over the place where the child was used to sit under the\ntree. I know this to be true by my own eyes; it is not hearsay. And the\nreason it was known that the fairies did it was this\u2014that it was made\nall of black flowers of a sort not known in France anywhere.\n\nNow from time immemorial all children reared in Domremy were called the\nChildren of the Tree; and they loved that name, for it carried with it a\nmystic privilege not granted to any other of the children of this world.\nWhich was this: whenever one of these came to die, then beyond the vague\nand formless images drifting through his darkening mind rose soft and\nrich and fair a vision of the tree\u2014if all was well with his soul. That\nwas what some said. Others said the vision came in two ways: once as a\nwarning, one or two years in advance of death, when the soul was the\ncaptive of sin, and then the tree appeared in its desolate winter\naspect\u2014then that soul was smitten with an awful fear. If repentance\ncame, and purity of life the vision came again, this time summer-clad\nand beautiful; but if it were otherwise with that soul the vision was\nwithheld, and it passed from life knowing its doom. Still others said\nthat the vision came but once and then only to the sinless dying forlorn\nin distant lands and pitifully longing for some last dear reminder of\ntheir home. And what reminder of it could go to their hearts like the\npicture of the tree that was the darling of their love and the comrade\nof their joys and comforter of their small griefs all through the divine\ndays of their vanished youth?\n\nNow the several traditions were as I have said, some believing one and\nsome another. One of them I know to be the truth, and that was the last\none. I do not say anything against the others; I think they were true,\nbut I only _know_ that the last one was; and it is my thought that if\none keep to the things he knows, and not trouble about the things which\nhe cannot be sure about, he will have the steadier mind for it\u2014and there\nis profit in that. I know that when the children of the tree die in a\nfar land, then\u2014if they be at peace with God\u2014they turn their longing eyes\ntoward home, and there, far-shining, as through a rift in a cloud that\ncurtains heaven, they see the soft picture of the fairy tree, clothed in\na dream of golden light; and they see the blooming meads sloping away to\nthe river, and to their perishing nostrils is blown faint and sweet the\nfragrance of the flowers of home. And then the vision fades and\npasses\u2014but _they_ know, _they_ know! and by their transfigured faces you\nknow also, you stand looking on; yes, you know the message that has\ncome, and that it has come from heaven.\n\nJoan and I believed alike about this matter. But Pierre Morel, and\nJacques d\u2019Arc and many others believed that the vision appeared twice\u2014to\na sinner. In fact, they and many others said they _knew_ it. Probably\nbecause their fathers had known it and had told them; for one gets most\nthings at second hand in this world....\n\nAlways, from the remotest times, when the children joined hands and\ndanced around the fairy tree they sang the song which was the tree\u2019s\nsong, the song of _L\u2019Arbre F\u00e9e de Bourlemont_. They sang it to a quaint\nsweet air\u2014a solacing sweet air which has gone murmuring through my\ndreaming spirit all my life when I was weary and troubled, resting me\nand carrying me through night and distance home again. No stranger can\nknow or feel what that song has been through the drifting centuries to\nexiled Children of the Tree, homeless and heavy of heart in countries\nforeign to their speech and ways. You will think it a simple thing, that\nsong, and poor, perchance; but if you will remember what it was to us,\nand what it brought before our eyes when it floated through our\nmemories, then you will respect it.

Huzza after huzza swept the army from\nvan to rear; and as for Joan of Arc, there where she sat her horse,\ngazing, clothed all in white armor, dreamy, beautiful, and in her face a\ndeep, deep joy, a joy not of earth, oh, she was not flesh, she was a\nspirit! Her sublime mission was closing\u2014closing in flawless triumph.\nTo-morrow she could say, \u201cIt is finished\u2014let me go free.\u201d\n\n\n                             JOAN\u2019S REWARD\n\nThe fantastic dream, the incredible dream, the impossible dream of the\npeasant child stood fulfilled; the English power was broken, the heir of\nFrance was crowned.\n\nShe was like one transfigured, so divine was the joy that shone in her\nface as she sank to her knees at the king\u2019s feet and looked up at him\nthrough her tears. Her lips were quivering, and her words came soft and\nlow and broken:\n\n\u201cNow, O gentle king, is the pleasure of God accomplished according to\nhis command that you should come to Rheims and receive the crown that\nbelongeth of right to you, and unto none other. My work which was given\nme to do is finished; give me your peace, and let me go back to my\nmother, who is poor and old, and has need of me.\u201d\n\nThe king raised her up, and there before all that host he praised her\ngreat deeds in most noble terms; and there he confirmed her nobility and\ntitles, making her the equal of a count in rank, and also appointed a\nhousehold and officers for her according to her dignity; and then he\nsaid:\n\n\u201cYou have saved the crown. Speak\u2014require\u2014demand; and whatsoever grace\nyou ask it shall be granted, though it make the kingdom poor to meet\nit.\u201d\n\nNow that was fine, that was loyal. Joan was on her knees again\nstraightway, and said:\n\n\u201cThen, O gentle king, if out of your compassion you will speak the word,\nI pray you give commandment that my village, poor and hard-pressed by\nreason of the war, may have its taxes remitted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is so commanded. Say on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is all.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll? Nothing but that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is all. I have no other desire.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that is nothing\u2014less than nothing. Ask\u2014do not be afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, I cannot, gentle king. Do not press me. I will not have aught\nelse, but only this alone.\u201d\n\nThe king seemed nonplussed, and stood still a moment, as if trying to\ncomprehend and realize the full stature of this strange unselfishness.\nThen he raised his head and said:\n\n\u201cShe has won a kingdom and crowned its king; and all she asks and all\nshe will take is this poor grace\u2014and even this is for others, not for\nherself. And it is well; her act being proportioned to the dignity of\none who carries in her head and heart riches which outvalue any that any\nking could add, though he gave his all. She shall have her way. Now,\ntherefore, it is decreed that from this day forth Domremy, natal village\nof Joan of Arc, Deliverer of France, called the Maid of Orleans, is\nfreed from all taxation _forever_.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                   _FROM_ \u201cSAINT JOAN OF ARC\u201d (1899)\n\n\nThere is no one to compare her with, none to measure her by; for all\nothers among the illustrious _grew_ towards their high place in an\natmosphere and surroundings which discovered their gift to them and\nnourished it and promoted it, intentionally or unconsciously.

It suggests a nebulous dim puff of star dust lost in the\nblaze of the Milky Way. Properly the Jew ought hardly to be heard of;\nbut he is heard of, has always been heard of. He is as prominent on the\nplanet as any other people, and his commercial importance is\nextravagantly out of proportion to the smallness of his bulk. His\ncontributions to the world\u2019s list of great names in literature, science,\nart, music, finance, medicine, and abstruse learning are always away out\nof proportion to the weakness of his numbers. He has made a marvelous\nfight in this world, in all the ages; and has done it with his hands\ntied behind him. He could be vain of himself, and be excused for it. The\nEgyptian, the Babylonian, and the Persian rose, filled the planet with\nsound and splendor then faded to dream-stuff and passed away; the Greek\nand the Roman followed, and made a vast noise, and were gone; other\npeople have sprung up and held their torch high for a time, but it\nburned out, and they sit in twilight now, or have vanished. The Jew saw\nthem all, beat them all, and is now what he always was, exhibiting no\ndecadence, no infirmities of age, no weakening of his parts, no slowing\nof his energies, no dulling of his alert and aggressive mind. All things\nare mortal but the Jew; all other forces pass, but he remains. What is\nthe secret of his immortality?\n\n\n\n\n                   _FROM_ \u201cCHRISTIAN SCIENCE\u201d (1898)\n\n\n                            THE C. S. HEALER\n\nShe was middle-aged, and large and bony, and erect, and had an austere\nface and a resolute jaw and a Roman beak and was a widow in the third\ndegree, and her name was Fuller. I was eager to get to business and find\nrelief, but she was distressingly deliberate. She unpinned and unhooked\nand uncoupled her upholsteries one by one, abolished the wrinkles with a\nflirt of her hand, and hung the articles up; peeled off her gloves and\ndisposed of them, got a book out of her hand-bag, then drew a chair to\nthe bedside, descended into it without hurry and I hung out my tongue.\nShe said, with pity but without passion:\n\n\u201cReturn it to its receptacle. We deal with the mind only, not with its\ndumb servants.\u201d\n\nI could not offer my pulse, because the connection was broken; but she\ndetected the apology before I could word it, and indicated by a negative\ntilt of her head that the pulse was another dumb servant that she had no\nuse for. Then I thought I would tell her my symptoms and how I felt, so\nthat she would understand the case; but that was another inconsequence,\nshe did not need to know those things; moreover, my remark about how I\nfelt was an abuse of language, a misapplication of terms.\n\n\u201cOne does not _feel_\u201d she explained; \u201cthere is no such thing as feeling:\ntherefore, to speak of a non-existent thing as existent is a\ncontradiction. Matter has no existence; nothing exists but mind; the\nmind cannot feel pain, it can only imagine it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if it hurts, just the same\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. A thing which is unreal cannot exercise the functions of\nreality. Pain is unreal; hence, pain cannot hurt.\u201d\n\nIn making a sweeping gesture to indicate the act of shooing the illusion\nof pain out of the mind, she raked her hand on a pin in her dress, said\n\u201cOuch!\u201d and went tranquilly on with her talk. \u201cYou should never allow\nyourself to speak of how you feel, nor permit others to ask you how you\nare feeling; you should never concede that you are ill, nor permit\nothers to talk about disease or pain or death or similar non-existences\nin your presence. Such talk only encourages the mind to continue its\nempty imaginings.\u201d\n\nJust at that point the _Stubenm\u00e4dchen_ trod on the cat\u2019s tail, and the\ncat let fly a frenzy of cat profanity. I asked, with caution:\n\n\u201cIs a cat\u2019s opinion about pain valuable?\u201d\n\n\u201cA cat has no opinion; opinions proceed from mind only; the lower\nanimals being eternally perishable, have not been granted mind; without\nmind, opinion is impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe merely _imagined_ she felt a pain\u2014the cat?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe cannot imagine a pain, for imagining is an effect of mind; without\nmind there is no imagination. A cat has no imagination.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen she had a _real_ pain?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have already told you there is no such _thing_ as real pain.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is strange and interesting.

You can never be absolutely sure\nof the meaning of anything you read in such circumstances; you are\nchasing an alert and gamy riddle all the time, and the baffling turns\nand dodges of the prey make the life of the hunt. A dictionary would\nsoil it. Sometimes a single word of doubtful purport will cast a vale of\ndreamy and golden uncertainty over a whole paragraph of cold and\npractical certainties, and leave steeped in a haunting and adorable\nmystery an incident which had been vulgar and commonplace but for the\nbenefaction.

Some of them will turn out a disappointment; the belemnites and\nthe amalekites and such will be failures, and they will die out and\nbecome extinct in the course of the nineteen million years covered by\nthe experiment; but all is not lost, for the jubusites will develop\ngradually into encrinites and stalactites and blatherskites, and one\nthing and another, as the mighty ages creep on and the periods pile\ntheir lofty crags in the primordial seas, and at last the first grand\nstages in the preparation of the world for man stands completed, the\noyster is done. Now an oyster has hardly any more reasoning power than a\nman has, so it is probable that this one jumped to the conclusion that\nthe nineteen million years was a preparation for _him_. That would be\njust like an oyster, and, anyway, this one could not know at that early\ndate that he was only an incident in the scheme, and that there was some\nmore to the scheme yet. (Mark Twain\u2014A Biography).\n\n\n                        THE FATALITY OF SEQUENCE\n\nWhen the first living atom found itself afloat on the great Laurentian\nsea the first act of that first atom led to the _second_ act of that\nfirst atom, and so on down through the succeeding ages of all life,\nuntil, if the steps could be traced, it would be shown that the first\nact of that first atom has led inevitably to the act of my standing in\nmy dressing gown at this instant, talking to you. (Mark Twain\u2014A\nBiography).\n\n\n                          LIFE\u2019S TURNING POINT\n\nNecessarily the scene of the real turning-point of my life (and of\nyours) was the Garden of Eden. It was there that the first link was\nforged of the chain that was ultimately to lead to the emptying of me\ninto the literary guild. Adam\u2019s _temperament_ was the first command the\nDeity ever issued to a human being on this planet. And it was the only\ncommand Adam would _never_ be able to disobey. It said, \u201cBe weak, be\nwater, be characterless, be cheaply persuadable.\u201d The later command, to\nlet the fruit alone was certain to be disobeyed. Not by Adam himself,\nbut by his _temperament_\u2014which he did not create and had no authority\nover. For the _temperament_ is the man; the thing tricked out with\nclothes and named Man is merely its shadow, nothing more. The law of the\ntiger\u2019s temperament is, Thou shalt kill; the law of the sheep\u2019s\ntemperament is, Thou shalt not kill. To issue later commands requiring\nthe tiger to let the fat stranger alone, and requiring the sheep to\nimbue its hands in the blood of the lion is not worth while, for those\ncommands _can\u2019t_ be obeyed. They would invite to violations of the law\nof _temperament_, which is supreme, and takes precedence of all other\nauthorities. I cannot help feeling disappointed in Adam and Eve. That\nis, in their temperaments. Not in _them_, poor helpless young\ncreatures\u2014afflicted with temperaments made out of butter; which butter\nwas commanded to get into contact with fire and _be melted_. What I\ncannot help wishing is, that Adam and Eve had been postponed, and Martin\nLuther and Joan of Arc put in their place. That splendid pair equipped\nwith temperaments not made of butter, but of asbestos. By neither sugary\npersuasions nor by hell fire could Satan have beguiled _them_ to eat the\napple.\n\n\n                  CLOSE OF SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY SPEECH\n\nThreescore years and ten!\n\nIt is the scriptural statute of limitations. After that you owe no\nactive duties; for you the strenuous life is over. You are a\ntime-expired man, to use Kipling\u2019s military phrase; you have served your\nterm, well or less well, and you are mustered out. You are become an\nhonorary member of the republic, you are emancipated, compulsions are\nnot for you, nor any bugle call but \u201clights out.\u201d You pay the time-worn\nduty bills if you choose, or decline if you prefer\u2014and without\nprejudice\u2014for they are not legally collectible.\n\nThe previous-engagement plea, which in forty years has cost you so many\ntwinges, you can lay aside forever; on this side of the grave you will\nnever need it again. If you shrink at thought of night, and winter, and\nthe late homecomings from the banquet and the lights and laughter\nthrough the deserted street\u2014a desolation which would not remind you now,\nas for a generation it did, that your friends are sleeping and you must\ncreep in a-tiptoe and not disturb them, but would only remind you that\nyou need not tiptoe, you can never disturb them more\u2014if you shrink at\nthe thought of these things you need only reply, \u201cYour invitation honors\nme and pleases me because you still keep me in your remembrance, but I\nam seventy; seventy, and would nestle in the chimney corner and smoke my\npipe, and read my book, and take my rest, wishing you well in all\naffection, and that when you in your turn shall arrive at Pier 70 you\nmay step aboard your waiting ship with a reconciled spirit, and lay your\ncourse toward the sinking sun with a contented heart.\u201d\n\n\n                            THE FUTURE LIFE\n\n(Mark Twain often allowed his fancy to play with the idea of the\northodox heaven, its curiosities of architecture and its employments of\ncontinuous prayer, psalm-singing, and harpistry).\n\n\u201cWhat a childish notion it was,\u201d he said, \u201cand how curious that only a\nlittle while ago human beings were so willing to accept such fragile\nevidences about a place of so much importance. If we should find\nsomewhere to-day an ancient book containing an account of a beautiful\nand blooming tropical paradise secreted in the center of eternal\nicebergs\u2014an account written by men who did not even claim to have seen\nit themselves\u2014no geographical society on earth would take any stock in\nthat book, yet that account would be quite as authentic as any we have\nof heaven. If God has such a place prepared for us, and really wanted us\nto know it, He could have found some better way than a book, so liable\nto alterations and misinterpretations. God has had no trouble to prove\nto man the laws of the constellations and the construction of the world,\nand such things as that, none of which agree with His so-called book. As\nto a hereafter, we have not the slightest evidence that there is\nany\u2014_no_ evidence that appeals to logic and reason. I have never seen\nwhat to me seemed an atom of proof that there is a future life.\u201d\n\nThen, after a long pause, he added:\n\n\u201cAnd yet\u2014I am strongly inclined to expect one.\u201d (Mark Twain\u2014A\nBiography).\n\n\n                                RELIGION\n\nI would not interfere with any one\u2019s religion, either to strengthen it\nor to weaken it. I am not able to believe one\u2019s religion can affect his\nhereafter one way or the other, no matter what that religion may be. But\nit may easily be a great comfort to him in this life\u2014hence it is a\nvaluable possession to him.\n\n\n\n\n                       _FROM_ \u201cTHE DEATH OF JEAN\u201d\n                                 (1909)\n\n\nIt is the time appointed. The funeral has begun. Four hundred miles\naway, but I can see it all, just as if I were there. The scene is the\nlibrary in the Langdon homestead. Jean\u2019s coffin stands where her mother\nand I stood, forty years ago, and were married; and where Susy\u2019s coffin\nstood thirteen years ago; where her mother\u2019s stood five years and a half\nago; and where mine will stand, after a little time.\n\n\n\n\n                  _FROM_ \u201cONE OF HIS LATEST MEMORANDA\u201d\n                                 (1909)\n\n\n                          THE IMPARTIAL FRIEND\n\nDeath\u2014the only immortal who treats us all alike, whose pity and whose\npeace and whose refuge are for all\u2014the soiled and the pure\u2014the rich and\nthe poor\u2014the loved and the unloved.\n\n-----\n\nFootnote 1:\n\n  Through an exchange of clothing with the little prince Tom Canty\n  suddenly found himself royalty, and upon the death of Henry VIII is\n  now king.\n\nFootnote 2:\n\n  Miles Hendon, who has taken the real prince\u2014now a wanderer\u2014under his\n  protection.

That is to say, it was diligence-time--the half-dozen\nbig diligences would soon be arriving from Geneva, and the village was\ninterested, in many ways, in knowing how many people were coming and\nwhat sort of folk they might be. It was altogether the livest-looking\nstreet we had seen in any village on the continent.\n\nThe hotel was by the side of a booming torrent, whose music was loud\nand strong; we could not see this torrent, for it was dark, now, but\none could locate it without a light. There was a large enclosed yard in\nfront of the hotel, and this was filled with groups of villagers waiting\nto see the diligences arrive, or to hire themselves to excursionists for\nthe morrow. A telescope stood in the yard, with its huge barrel canted\nup toward the lustrous evening star. The long porch of the hotel was\npopulous with tourists, who sat in shawls and wraps under the vast\novershadowing bulk of Mont Blanc, and gossiped or meditated.\n\n\n\nNever did a mountain seem so close; its big sides seemed at one's very\nelbow, and its majestic dome, and the lofty cluster of slender minarets\nthat were its neighbors, seemed to be almost over one's head. It was\nnight in the streets, and the lamps were sparkling everywhere; the broad\nbases and shoulders of the mountains were in a deep gloom, but their\nsummits swam in a strange rich glow which was really daylight, and yet\nhad a mellow something about it which was very different from the hard\nwhite glare of the kind of daylight I was used to. Its radiance was\nstrong and clear, but at the same time it was singularly soft, and\nspiritual, and benignant. No, it was not our harsh, aggressive,\nrealistic daylight; it seemed properer to an enchanted land--or to\nheaven.\n\nI had seen moonlight and daylight together before, but I had not seen\ndaylight and black night elbow to elbow before. At least I had not seen\nthe daylight resting upon an object sufficiently close at hand, before,\nto make the contrast startling and at war with nature.\n\nThe daylight passed away. Presently the moon rose up behind some of\nthose sky-piercing fingers or pinnacles of bare rock of which I have\nspoken--they were a little to the left of the crest of Mont Blanc,\nand right over our heads--but she couldn't manage to climb high enough\ntoward heaven to get entirely above them. She would show the glittering\narch of her upper third, occasionally, and scrape it along behind the\ncomblike row; sometimes a pinnacle stood straight up, like a statuette\nof ebony, against that glittering white shield, then seemed to glide out\nof it by its own volition and power, and become a dim specter, while the\nnext pinnacle glided into its place and blotted the spotless disk with\nthe black exclamation-point of its presence. The top of one pinnacle\ntook the shapely, clean-cut form of a rabbit's head, in the inkiest\nsilhouette, while it rested against the moon. The unillumined peaks and\nminarets, hovering vague and phantom-like above us while the others\nwere painfully white and strong with snow and moonlight, made a peculiar\neffect.\n\nBut when the moon, having passed the line of pinnacles, was hidden\nbehind the stupendous white swell of Mont Blanc, the masterpiece of the\nevening was flung on the canvas. A rich greenish radiance sprang into\nthe sky from behind the mountain, and in this some airy shreds and\nribbons of vapor floated about, and being flushed with that strange\ntint, went waving to and fro like pale green flames. After a while,\nradiating bars--vast broadening fan-shaped shadows--grew up and\nstretched away to the zenith from behind the mountain. It was a\nspectacle to take one's breath, for the wonder of it, and the sublimity.\n\nIndeed, those mighty bars of alternate light and shadow streaming up\nfrom behind that dark and prodigious form and occupying the half of the\ndull and opaque heavens, was the most imposing and impressive marvel I\nhad ever looked upon. There is no simile for it, for nothing is like\nit. If a child had asked me what it was, I should have said, \"Humble\nyourself, in this presence, it is the glory flowing from the hidden head\nof the Creator.\" One falls shorter of the truth than that, sometimes, in\ntrying to explain mysteries to the little people. I could have found\nout the cause of this awe-compelling miracle by inquiring, for it is not\ninfrequent at Mont Blanc,--but I did not wish to know. We have not the\nreverent feeling for the rainbow that a savage has, because we know how\nit is made. We have lost as much as we gained by prying into the matter.\n\nWe took a walk down street, a block or two, and a place where four\nstreets met and the principal shops were clustered, found the groups\nof men in the roadway thicker than ever--for this was the Exchange of\nChamonix. These men were in the costumes of guides and porters, and were\nthere to be hired.\n\nThe office of that great personage, the Guide-in-Chief of the Chamonix\nGuild of Guides, was near by. This guild is a close corporation, and is\ngoverned by strict laws. There are many excursion routes, some dangerous\nand some not, some that can be made safely without a guide, and some\nthat cannot. The bureau determines these things. Where it decides that a\nguide is necessary, you are forbidden to go without one. Neither are you\nallowed to be a victim of extortion: the law states what you are to pay.\nThe guides serve in rotation; you cannot select the man who is to take\nyour life into his hands, you must take the worst in the lot, if it is\nhis turn. A guide's fee ranges all the way up from a half-dollar (for\nsome trifling excursion of a few rods) to twenty dollars, according to\nthe distance traversed and the nature of the ground. A guide's fee\nfor taking a person to the summit of Mont Blanc and back, is twenty\ndollars--and he earns it. The time employed is usually three days, and\nthere is enough early rising in it to make a man far more \"healthy and\nwealthy and wise\" than any one man has any right to be. The porter's\nfee for the same trip is ten dollars. Several fools--no, I mean several\ntourists--usually go together, and divide up the expense, and thus make\nit light; for if only one f--tourist, I mean--went, he would have to\nhave several guides and porters, and that would make the matter costly.\n\nWe went into the Chief's office. There were maps of mountains on the\nwalls; also one or two lithographs of celebrated guides, and a portrait\nof the scientist De Saussure.\n\nIn glass cases were some labeled fragments of boots and batons, and\nother suggestive relics and remembrances of casualties on Mount Blanc.\nIn a book was a record of all the ascents which have ever been made,\nbeginning with Nos. 1 and 2--being those of Jacques Balmat and De\nSaussure, in 1787, and ending with No. 685, which wasn't cold yet. In\nfact No. 685 was standing by the official table waiting to receive the\nprecious official diploma which should prove to his German household and\nto his descendants that he had once been indiscreet enough to climb to\nthe top of Mont Blanc. He looked very happy when he got his document; in\nfact, he spoke up and said he WAS happy.\n\n\n\nI tried to buy a diploma for an invalid friend at home who had never\ntraveled, and whose desire all his life has been to ascend Mont Blanc,\nbut the Guide-in-Chief rather insolently refused to sell me one. I was\nvery much offended. I said I did not propose to be discriminated against\non the account of my nationality; that he had just sold a diploma to\nthis German gentleman, and my money was a good as his; I would see to\nit that he couldn't keep his shop for Germans and deny his produce to\nAmericans; I would have his license taken away from him at the dropping\nof a handkerchief; if France refused to break him, I would make an\ninternational matter of it and bring on a war; the soil should be\ndrenched with blood; and not only that, but I would set up an opposition\nshow and sell diplomas at half price.\n\n\n\nFor two cents I would have done these things, too; but nobody offered me\ntwo cents. I tried to move that German's feelings, but it could not be\ndone; he would not give me his diploma, neither would he sell it to me.\nI TOLD him my friend was sick and could not come himself, but he said\nhe did not care a VERDAMMTES PFENNIG, he wanted his diploma for\nhimself--did I suppose he was going to risk his neck for that thing and\nthen give it to a sick stranger? Indeed he wouldn't, so he wouldn't. I\nresolved, then, that I would do all I could to injure Mont Blanc.\n\nIn the record-book was a list of all the fatal accidents which happened\non the mountain. It began with the one in 1820 when the Russian Dr.\nHamel's three guides were lost in a crevice of the glacier, and it\nrecorded the delivery of the remains in the valley by the slow-moving\nglacier forty-one years later. The latest catastrophe bore the date\n1877.\n\nWe stepped out and roved about the village awhile. In front of the\nlittle church was a monument to the memory of the bold guide Jacques\nBalmat, the first man who ever stood upon the summit of Mont Blanc. He\nmade that wild trip solitary and alone. He accomplished the ascent\na number of times afterward. A stretch of nearly half a century lay\nbetween his first ascent and his last one. At the ripe old age of\nseventy-two he was climbing around a corner of a lofty precipice of the\nPic du Midi--nobody with him--when he slipped and fell. So he died in\nthe harness.\n\nHe had grown very avaricious in his old age, and used to go off\nstealthily to hunt for non-existent and impossible gold among those\nperilous peaks and precipices. He was on a quest of that kind when he\nlost his life. There was a statue to him, and another to De Saussure, in\nthe hall of our hotel, and a metal plate on the door of a room upstairs\nbore an inscription to the effect that that room had been occupied\nby Albert Smith. Balmat and De Saussure discovered Mont Blanc--so to\nspeak--but it was Smith who made it a paying property. His articles in\nBLACKWOOD and his lectures on Mont Blanc in London advertised it and\nmade people as anxious to see it as if it owed them money.\n\nAs we strolled along the road we looked up and saw a red signal-light\nglowing in the darkness of the mountainside. It seemed but a trifling\nway up--perhaps a hundred yards, a climb of ten minutes. It was a lucky\npiece of sagacity in us that we concluded to stop a man whom we met and\nget a light for our pipes from him instead of continuing the climb to\nthat lantern to get a light, as had been our purpose. The man said that\nthat lantern was on the Grands Mulets, some sixty-five hundred feet\nabove the valley! I know by our Riffelberg experience, that it would\nhave taken us a good part of a week to go up there. I would sooner not\nsmoke at all, than take all that trouble for a light.\n\nEven in the daytime the foreshadowing effect of this mountain's close\nproximity creates curious deceptions. For instance, one sees with the\nnaked eye a cabin up there beside the glacier, and a little above and\nbeyond he sees the spot where that red light was located; he thinks he\ncould throw a stone from the one place to the other. But he couldn't,\nfor the difference between the two altitudes is more than three thousand\nfeet. It looks impossible, from below, that this can be true, but it is\ntrue, nevertheless.\n\nWhile strolling around, we kept the run of the moon all the time, and we\nstill kept an eye on her after we got back to the hotel portico. I had\na theory that the gravitation of refraction, being subsidiary to\natmospheric compensation, the refrangibility of the earth's surface\nwould emphasize this effect in regions where great mountain ranges\noccur, and possibly so even-handed impact the odic and idyllic forces\ntogether, the one upon the other, as to prevent the moon from rising\nhigher than 12,200 feet above sea-level. This daring theory had been\nreceived with frantic scorn by some of my fellow-scientists, and with\nan eager silence by others. Among the former I may mention Prof. H----y;\nand among the latter Prof. T----l. Such is professional jealousy; a\nscientist will never show any kindness for a theory which he did not\nstart himself. There is no feeling of brotherhood among these people.\nIndeed, they always resent it when I call them brother. To show how far\ntheir ungenerosity can carry them, I will state that I offered to let\nProf. H----y publish my great theory as his own discovery; I even begged\nhim to do it; I even proposed to print it myself as his theory. Instead\nof thanking me, he said that if I tried to fasten that theory on him he\nwould sue me for slander. I was going to offer it to Mr. Darwin, whom\nI understood to be a man without prejudices, but it occurred to me\nthat perhaps he would not be interested in it since it did not concern\nheraldry.\n\nBut I am glad now, that I was forced to father my intrepid theory\nmyself, for, on the night of which I am writing, it was triumphantly\njustified and established. Mont Blanc is nearly sixteen thousand feet\nhigh; he hid the moon utterly; near him is a peak which is 12,216 feet\nhigh; the moon slid along behind the pinnacles, and when she approached\nthat one I watched her with intense interest, for my reputation as a\nscientist must stand or fall by its decision. I cannot describe the\nemotions which surged like tidal waves through my breast when I saw the\nmoon glide behind that lofty needle and pass it by without exposing more\nthan two feet four inches of her upper rim above it; I was secure, then.\nI knew she could rise no higher, and I was right. She sailed behind all\nthe peaks and never succeeded in hoisting her disk above a single one of\nthem.\n\nWhile the moon was behind one of those sharp fingers, its shadow was\nflung athwart the vacant heavens--a long, slanting, clean-cut, dark\nray--with a streaming and energetic suggestion of FORCE about it, such\nas the ascending jet of water from a powerful fire-engine affords. It\nwas curious to see a good strong shadow of an earthly object cast upon\nso intangible a field as the atmosphere.\n\nWe went to bed, at last, and went quickly to sleep, but I woke up,\nafter about three hours, with throbbing temples, and a head which was\nphysically sore, outside and in. I was dazed, dreamy, wretched, seedy,\nunrefreshed. I recognized the occasion of all this: it was that torrent.\nIn the mountain villages of Switzerland, and along the roads, one has\nalways the roar of the torrent in his ears. He imagines it is music, and\nhe thinks poetic things about it; he lies in his comfortable bed and is\nlulled to sleep by it. But by and by he begins to notice that his\nhead is very sore--he cannot account for it; in solitudes where the\nprofoundest silence reigns, he notices a sullen, distant, continuous\nroar in his ears, which is like what he would experience if he had\nsea-shells pressed against them--he cannot account for it; he is drowsy\nand absent-minded; there is no tenacity to his mind, he cannot keep hold\nof a thought and follow it out; if he sits down to write, his vocabulary\nis empty, no suitable words will come, he forgets what he started to do,\nand remains there, pen in hand, head tilted up, eyes closed, listening\npainfully to the muffled roar of a distant train in his ears; in his\nsoundest sleep the strain continues, he goes on listening, always\nlistening intently, anxiously, and wakes at last, harassed, irritable,\nunrefreshed. He cannot manage to account for these things.\n\n\n\nDay after day he feels as if he had spent his nights in a sleeping-car.\nIt actually takes him weeks to find out that it is those persecuting\ntorrents that have been making all the mischief. It is time for him\nto get out of Switzerland, then, for as soon as he has discovered the\ncause, the misery is magnified several fold. The roar of the torrent is\nmaddening, then, for his imagination is assisting; the physical pain\nit inflicts is exquisite. When he finds he is approaching one of those\nstreams, his dread is so lively that he is disposed to fly the track and\navoid the implacable foe.\n\n\n\nEight or nine months after the distress of the torrents had departed\nfrom me, the roar and thunder of the streets of Paris brought it all\nback again. I moved to the sixth story of the hotel to hunt for peace.\nAbout midnight the noises dulled away, and I was sinking to sleep,\nwhen I heard a new and curious sound; I listened: evidently some joyous\nlunatic was softly dancing a \"double shuffle\" in the room over my head.\nI had to wait for him to get through, of course. Five long, long minutes\nhe smoothly shuffled away--a pause followed, then something fell with\na thump on the floor. I said to myself \"There--he is pulling off his\nboots--thank heavens he is done.\" Another slight pause--he went to\nshuffling again! I said to myself, \"Is he trying to see what he can do\nwith only one boot on?\" Presently came another pause and another thump\non the floor. I said \"Good, he has pulled off his other boot--NOW he is\ndone.\" But he wasn't. The next moment he was shuffling again. I said,\n\"Confound him, he is at it in his slippers!\" After a little came that\nsame old pause, and right after it that thump on the floor once more. I\nsaid, \"Hang him, he had on TWO pair of boots!\" For an hour that magician\nwent on shuffling and pulling off boots till he had shed as many as\ntwenty-five pair, and I was hovering on the verge of lunacy. I got\nmy gun and stole up there. The fellow was in the midst of an acre of\nsprawling boots, and he had a boot in his hand, shuffling it--no, I mean\nPOLISHING it. The mystery was explained. He hadn't been dancing. He was\nthe \"Boots\" of the hotel, and was attending to business.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\n[I Scale Mont Blanc--by Telescope]\n\n\nAfter breakfast, that next morning in Chamonix, we went out in the yard\nand watched the gangs of excursioning tourists arriving and departing\nwith their mules and guides and porters; then we took a look through\nthe telescope at the snowy hump of Mont Blanc. It was brilliant with\nsunshine, and the vast smooth bulge seemed hardly five hundred yards\naway. With the naked eye we could dimly make out the house at the Pierre\nPointue, which is located by the side of the great glacier, and is more\nthan three thousand feet above the level of the valley; but with the\ntelescope we could see all its details. While I looked, a woman rode by\nthe house on a mule, and I saw her with sharp distinctness; I could have\ndescribed her dress. I saw her nod to the people of the house, and rein\nup her mule, and put her hand up to shield her eyes from the sun. I was\nnot used to telescopes; in fact, I had never looked through a good one\nbefore; it seemed incredible to me that this woman could be so far away.\nI was satisfied that I could see all these details with my naked\neye; but when I tried it, that mule and those vivid people had wholly\nvanished, and the house itself was become small and vague. I tried\nthe telescope again, and again everything was vivid. The strong black\nshadows of the mule and the woman were flung against the side of the\nhouse, and I saw the mule's silhouette wave its ears.\n\nThe telescopulist--or the telescopulariat--I do not know which is\nright--said a party were making a grand ascent, and would come in sight\non the remote upper heights, presently; so we waited to observe this\nperformance. Presently I had a superb idea. I wanted to stand with a\nparty on the summit of Mont Blanc, merely to be able to say I had done\nit, and I believed the telescope could set me within seven feet of the\nuppermost man. The telescoper assured me that it could. I then asked him\nhow much I owed him for as far as I had got? He said, one franc. I asked\nhim how much it would cost to make the entire ascent? Three francs. I at\nonce determined to make the entire ascent. But first I inquired if there\nwas any danger? He said no--not by telescope; said he had taken a great\nmany parties to the summit, and never lost a man. I asked what he would\ncharge to let my agent go with me, together with such guides and porters\nas might be necessary. He said he would let Harris go for two francs;\nand that unless we were unusually timid, he should consider guides and\nporters unnecessary; it was not customary to take them, when going by\ntelescope, for they were rather an encumbrance than a help. He said that\nthe party now on the mountain were approaching the most difficult part,\nand if we hurried we should overtake them within ten minutes, and could\nthen join them and have the benefit of their guides and porters without\ntheir knowledge, and without expense to us.\n\n\n\nI then said we would start immediately. I believe I said it calmly,\nthough I was conscious of a shudder and of a paling cheek, in view of\nthe nature of the exploit I was so unreflectingly engaged in. But the\nold daredevil spirit was upon me, and I said that as I had committed\nmyself I would not back down; I would ascend Mont Blanc if it cost me\nmy life. I told the man to slant his machine in the proper direction and\nlet us be off.\n\nHarris was afraid and did not want to go, but I heartened him up and\nsaid I would hold his hand all the way; so he gave his consent, though\nhe trembled a little at first. I took a last pathetic look upon the\npleasant summer scene about me, then boldly put my eye to the glass and\nprepared to mount among the grim glaciers and the everlasting snows.\n\nWe took our way carefully and cautiously across the great Glacier des\nBossons, over yawning and terrific crevices and among imposing crags\nand buttresses of ice which were fringed with icicles of gigantic\nproportions. The desert of ice that stretched far and wide about us was\nwild and desolate beyond description, and the perils which beset us were\nso great that at times I was minded to turn back. But I pulled my pluck\ntogether and pushed on.\n\nWe passed the glacier safely and began to mount the steeps beyond, with\ngreat alacrity. When we were seven minutes out from the starting-point,\nwe reached an altitude where the scene took a new aspect; an apparently\nlimitless continent of gleaming snow was tilted heavenward before our\nfaces. As my eye followed that awful acclivity far away up into the\nremote skies, it seemed to me that all I had ever seen before of\nsublimity and magnitude was small and insignificant compared to this.\n\n\n\nWe rested a moment, and then began to mount with speed. Within three\nminutes we caught sight of the party ahead of us, and stopped to observe\nthem. They were toiling up a long, slanting ridge of snow--twelve\npersons, roped together some fifteen feet apart, marching in single\nfile, and strongly marked against the clear blue sky. One was a woman.\nWe could see them lift their feet and put them down; we saw them swing\ntheir alpenstocks forward in unison, like so many pendulums, and then\nbear their weight upon them; we saw the lady wave her handkerchief. They\ndragged themselves upward in a worn and weary way, for they had been\nclimbing steadily from the Grand Mulets, on the Glacier des Bossons,\nsince three in the morning, and it was eleven, now. We saw them sink\ndown in the snow and rest, and drink something from a bottle. After a\nwhile they moved on, and as they approached the final short dash of the\nhome-stretch we closed up on them and joined them.\n\nPresently we all stood together on the summit! What a view was spread\nout below! Away off under the northwestern horizon rolled the silent\nbillows of the Farnese Oberland, their snowy crests glinting softly in\nthe subdued lights of distance; in the north rose the giant form of the\nWobblehorn, draped from peak to shoulder in sable thunder-clouds; beyond\nhim, to the right, stretched the grand processional summits of the\nCisalpine Cordillera, drowned in a sensuous haze; to the east loomed the\ncolossal masses of the Yodelhorn, the Fuddelhorn, and the Dinnerhorn,\ntheir cloudless summits flashing white and cold in the sun; beyond\nthem shimmered the faint far line of the Ghauts of Jubbelpore and the\nAiguilles des Alleghenies; in the south towered the smoking peak\nof Popocatapetl and the unapproachable altitudes of the peerless\nScrabblehorn; in the west-south the stately range of the Himalayas lay\ndreaming in a purple gloom; and thence all around the curving horizon\nthe eye roved over a troubled sea of sun-kissed Alps, and noted,\nhere and there, the noble proportions and the soaring domes of the\nBottlehorn, and the Saddlehorn, and the Shovelhorn, and the Powderhorn,\nall bathed in the glory of noon and mottled with softly gliding blots,\nthe shadows flung from drifting clouds.\n\nOvercome by the scene, we all raised a triumphant, tremendous shout, in\nunison. A startled man at my elbow said:\n\n\"Confound you, what do you yell like that for, right here in the\nstreet?\"\n\n\n\nThat brought me down to Chamonix, like a flirt. I gave that man some\nspiritual advice and disposed of him, and then paid the telescope man\nhis full fee, and said that we were charmed with the trip and would\nremain down, and not reascend and require him to fetch us down by\ntelescope. This pleased him very much, for of course we could have\nstepped back to the summit and put him to the trouble of bringing us\nhome if we wanted to.\n\nI judged we could get diplomas, now, anyhow; so we went after them, but\nthe Chief Guide put us off, with one pretext or another, during all the\ntime we stayed in Chamonix, and we ended by never getting them at all.\nSo much for his prejudice against people's nationality. However, we\nworried him enough to make him remember us and our ascent for some\ntime. He even said, once, that he wished there was a lunatic asylum\nin Chamonix. This shows that he really had fears that we were going to\ndrive him mad. It was what we intended to do, but lack of time defeated\nit.\n\nI cannot venture to advise the reader one way or the other, as to\nascending Mont Blanc. I say only this: if he is at all timid, the\nenjoyments of the trip will hardly make up for the hardships and\nsufferings he will have to endure. But, if he has good nerve, youth,\nhealth, and a bold, firm will, and could leave his family comfortably\nprovided for in case the worst happened, he would find the ascent a\nwonderful experience, and the view from the top a vision to dream about,\nand tell about, and recall with exultation all the days of his life.\n\nWhile I do not advise such a person to attempt the ascent, I do not\nadvise him against it. But if he elects to attempt it, let him be warily\ncareful of two things: chose a calm, clear day; and do not pay the\ntelescope man in advance. There are dark stories of his getting advance\npayers on the summit and then leaving them there to rot.\n\nA frightful tragedy was once witnessed through the Chamonix telescopes.\nThink of questions and answers like these, on an inquest:\n\nCORONER. You saw deceased lose his life?\n\nWITNESS. I did.\n\nC. Where was he, at the time?\n\nW. Close to the summit of Mont Blanc.\n\nC. Where were you?\n\nW. In the main street of Chamonix.\n\nC. What was the distance between you?\n\nW. A LITTLE OVER FIVE MILES, as the bird flies.\n\nThis accident occurred in 1866, a year and a month after the disaster\non the Matterhorn. Three adventurous English gentlemen, [1] of great\nexperience in mountain-climbing, made up their minds to ascend Mont\nBlanc without guides or porters. All endeavors to dissuade them from\ntheir project failed. Powerful telescopes are numerous in Chamonix.\nThese huge brass tubes, mounted on their scaffoldings and pointed\nskyward from every choice vantage-ground, have the formidable look of\nartillery, and give the town the general aspect of getting ready\nto repel a charge of angels. The reader may easily believe that the\ntelescopes had plenty of custom on that August morning in 1866, for\neverybody knew of the dangerous undertaking which was on foot, and\nall had fears that misfortune would result. All the morning the tubes\nremained directed toward the mountain heights, each with its anxious\ngroup around it; but the white deserts were vacant.\n\n1. Sir George Young and his brothers James and Albert.\n\nAt last, toward eleven o'clock, the people who were looking through the\ntelescopes cried out \"There they are!\"--and sure enough, far up, on\nthe loftiest terraces of the Grand Plateau, the three pygmies appeared,\nclimbing with remarkable vigor and spirit. They disappeared in the\n\"Corridor,\" and were lost to sight during an hour. Then they reappeared,\nand were presently seen standing together upon the extreme summit\nof Mont Blanc. So, all was well. They remained a few minutes on that\nhighest point of land in Europe, a target for all the telescopes, and\nwere then seen to begin descent. Suddenly all three vanished. An instant\nafter, they appeared again, TWO THOUSAND FEET BELOW!\n\nEvidently, they had tripped and been shot down an almost perpendicular\nslope of ice to a point where it joined the border of the upper glacier.\nNaturally, the distant witness supposed they were now looking upon three\ncorpses; so they could hardly believe their eyes when they presently saw\ntwo of the men rise to their feet and bend over the third. During\ntwo hours and a half they watched the two busying themselves over the\nextended form of their brother, who seemed entirely inert. Chamonix's\naffairs stood still; everybody was in the street, all interest was\ncentered upon what was going on upon that lofty and isolated stage\nfive miles away. Finally the two--one of them walking with great\ndifficulty--were seen to begin descent, abandoning the third, who was no\ndoubt lifeless. Their movements were followed, step by step, until they\nreached the \"Corridor\" and disappeared behind its ridge. Before they had\nhad time to traverse the \"Corridor\" and reappear, twilight was come, and\nthe power of the telescope was at an end.\n\nThe survivors had a most perilous journey before them in the gathering\ndarkness, for they must get down to the Grands Mulets before they would\nfind a safe stopping-place--a long and tedious descent, and perilous\nenough even in good daylight. The oldest guides expressed the opinion\nthat they could not succeed; that all the chances were that they would\nlose their lives.\n\n\n\nYet those brave men did succeed. They reached the Grands Mulets in\nsafety. Even the fearful shock which their nerves had sustained was not\nsufficient to overcome their coolness and courage. It would appear from\nthe official account that they were threading their way down through\nthose dangers from the closing in of twilight until two o'clock in the\nmorning, or later, because the rescuing party from Chamonix reached\nthe Grand Mulets about three in the morning and moved thence toward the\nscene of the disaster under the leadership of Sir George Young, \"who had\nonly just arrived.\"\n\nAfter having been on his feet twenty-four hours, in the exhausting work\nof mountain-climbing, Sir George began the reascent at the head of the\nrelief party of six guides, to recover the corpse of his brother. This\nwas considered a new imprudence, as the number was too few for the\nservice required. Another relief party presently arrived at the cabin\non the Grands Mulets and quartered themselves there to await events. Ten\nhours after Sir George's departure toward the summit, this new relief\nwere still scanning the snowy altitudes above them from their own high\nperch among the ice deserts ten thousand feet above the level of the\nsea, but the whole forenoon had passed without a glimpse of any living\nthing appearing up there.\n\nThis was alarming. Half a dozen of their number set out, then early in\nthe afternoon, to seek and succor Sir George and his guides. The persons\nremaining at the cabin saw these disappear, and then ensued another\ndistressing wait. Four hours passed, without tidings. Then at five\no'clock another relief, consisting of three guides, set forward from\nthe cabin. They carried food and cordials for the refreshment of their\npredecessors; they took lanterns with them, too; night was coming on,\nand to make matters worse, a fine, cold rain had begun to fall.\n\nAt the same hour that these three began their dangerous ascent, the\nofficial Guide-in-Chief of the Mont Blanc region undertook the dangerous\ndescent to Chamonix, all alone, to get reinforcements. However, a couple\nof hours later, at 7 P.M., the anxious solicitude came to an end, and\nhappily. A bugle note was heard, and a cluster of black specks was\ndistinguishable against the snows of the upper heights. The watchers\ncounted these specks eagerly--fourteen--nobody was missing. An hour and\na half later they were all safe under the roof of the cabin. They had\nbrought the corpse with them. Sir George Young tarried there but a few\nminutes, and then began the long and troublesome descent from the cabin\nto Chamonix. He probably reached there about two or three o'clock in the\nmorning, after having been afoot among the rocks and glaciers during two\ndays and two nights. His endurance was equal to his daring.\n\n\n\nThe cause of the unaccountable delay of Sir George and the relief\nparties among the heights where the disaster had happened was a thick\nfog--or, partly that and partly the slow and difficult work of conveying\nthe dead body down the perilous steeps.\n\nThe corpse, upon being viewed at the inquest, showed no bruises, and it\nwas some time before the surgeons discovered that the neck was broken.\nOne of the surviving brothers had sustained some unimportant injuries,\nbut the other had suffered no hurt at all. How these men could fall two\nthousand feet, almost perpendicularly, and live afterward, is a most\nstrange and unaccountable thing.\n\nA great many women have made the ascent of Mont Blanc. An English girl,\nMiss Stratton, conceived the daring idea, two or three years ago, of\nattempting the ascent in the middle of winter. She tried it--and she\nsucceeded. Moreover, she froze two of her fingers on the way up, she\nfell in love with her guide on the summit, and she married him when she\ngot to the bottom again. There is nothing in romance, in the way of a\nstriking \"situation,\" which can beat this love scene in midheaven on\nan isolated ice-crest with the thermometer at zero and an Artic gale\nblowing.\n\n\n\nThe first woman who ascended Mont Blanc was a girl aged\ntwenty-two--Mlle. Maria Paradis--1809. Nobody was with her but her\nsweetheart, and he was not a guide. The sex then took a rest for about\nthirty years, when a Mlle. d'Angeville made the ascent --1838. In\nChamonix I picked up a rude old lithograph of that day which pictured\nher \"in the act.\"\n\nHowever, I value it less as a work of art than as a fashion-plate. Miss\nd'Angeville put on a pair of men's pantaloons to climb it, which was\nwise; but she cramped their utility by adding her petticoat, which was\nidiotic.\n\nOne of the mournfulest calamities which men's disposition to climb\ndangerous mountains has resulted in, happened on Mont Blanc in September\n1870. M. D'Arve tells the story briefly in his HISTOIRE DU MONT BLANC.\nIn the next chapter I will copy its chief features.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\nA Catastrophe Which Cost Eleven Lives\n\n\nOn the 5th of September, 1870, a caravan of eleven persons departed\nfrom Chamonix to make the ascent of Mont Blanc. Three of the party\nwere tourists; Messrs. Randall and Bean, Americans, and Mr. George\nCorkindale, a Scotch gentleman; there were three guides and five\nporters. The cabin on the Grands Mulets was reached that day; the ascent\nwas resumed early the next morning, September 6th. The day was fine\nand clear, and the movements of the party were observed through the\ntelescopes of Chamonix; at two o'clock in the afternoon they were seen\nto reach the summit. A few minutes later they were seen making the first\nsteps of the descent; then a cloud closed around them and hid them from\nview.\n\nEight hours passed, the cloud still remained, night came, no one had\nreturned to the Grands Mulets. Sylvain Couttet, keeper of the cabin\nthere, suspected a misfortune, and sent down to the valley for help. A\ndetachment of guides went up, but by the time they had made the tedious\ntrip and reached the cabin, a raging storm had set in. They had to wait;\nnothing could be attempted in such a tempest.\n\nThe wild storm lasted MORE THAN A WEEK, without ceasing; but on the\n17th, Couttet, with several guides, left the cabin and succeeded in\nmaking the ascent. In the snowy wastes near the summit they came upon\nfive bodies, lying upon their sides in a reposeful attitude which\nsuggested that possibly they had fallen asleep there, while exhausted\nwith fatigue and hunger and benumbed with cold, and never knew when\ndeath stole upon them. Couttet moved a few steps further and discovered\nfive more bodies. The eleventh corpse--that of a porter--was not found,\nalthough diligent search was made for it.\n\nIn the pocket of Mr. Bean, one of the Americans, was found a note-book\nin which had been penciled some sentences which admit us, in flesh and\nspirit, as it were, to the presence of these men during their last hours\nof life, and to the grisly horrors which their fading vision looked upon\nand their failing consciousness took cognizance of:\n TUESDAY, SEPT. 6. I have made the ascent of Mont Blanc, with ten\npersons--eight guides, and Mr. Corkindale and Mr. Randall. We reached\nthe summit at half past 2. Immediately after quitting it, we were\nenveloped in clouds of snow. We passed the night in a grotto hollowed in\nthe snow, which afforded us but poor shelter, and I was ill all night.\n\nSEPT. 7--MORNING. The cold is excessive. The snow falls heavily and\nwithout interruption. The guides take no rest.\n\nEVENING. My Dear Hessie, we have been two days on Mont Blanc, in the\nmidst of a terrible hurricane of snow, we have lost our way, and are\nin a hole scooped in the snow, at an altitude of 15,000 feet. I have no\nlonger any hope of descending.\n\nThey had wandered around, and around, in the blinding snow-storm,\nhopelessly lost, in a space only a hundred yards square; and when cold\nand fatigue vanquished them at last, they scooped their cave and lay\ndown there to die by inches, UNAWARE THAT FIVE STEPS MORE WOULD HAVE\nBROUGHT THEM INTO THE TRUTH PATH. They were so near to life and safety\nas that, and did not suspect it. The thought of this gives the sharpest\npang that the tragic story conveys.\n\nThe author of the HISTOIRE DU MONT BLANC introduced the closing\nsentences of Mr. Bean's pathetic record thus:\n\n\"Here the characters are large and unsteady; the hand which traces them\nis become chilled and torpid; but the spirit survives, and the faith and\nresignation of the dying man are expressed with a sublime simplicity.\"\n\nPerhaps this note-book will be found and sent to you. We have nothing to\neat, my feet are already frozen, and I am exhausted; I have strength to\nwrite only a few words more. I have left means for C's education; I know\nyou will employ them wisely. I die with faith in God, and with loving\nthoughts of you. Farewell to all. We shall meet again, in Heaven. ... I\nthink of you always.\n\nIt is the way of the Alps to deliver death to their victims with a\nmerciful swiftness, but here the rule failed. These men suffered\nthe bitterest death that has been recorded in the history of those\nmountains, freighted as that history is with grisly tragedies.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\n[Meeting a Hog on a Precipice]\n\n\nMr. Harris and I took some guides and porters and ascended to the Hotel\ndes Pyramides, which is perched on the high moraine which borders the\nGlacier des Bossons. The road led sharply uphill, all the way, through\ngrass and flowers and woods, and was a pleasant walk, barring the\nfatigue of the climb.\n\nFrom the hotel we could view the huge glacier at very close range. After\na rest we followed down a path which had been made in the steep inner\nfrontage of the moraine, and stepped upon the glacier itself. One of the\nshows of the place was a tunnel-like cavern, which had been hewn in the\nglacier. The proprietor of this tunnel took candles and conducted us\ninto it. It was three or four feet wide and about six feet high. Its\nwalls of pure and solid ice emitted a soft and rich blue light that\nproduced a lovely effect, and suggested enchanted caves, and that sort\nof thing. When we had proceeded some yards and were entering darkness,\nwe turned about and had a dainty sunlit picture of distant woods and\nheights framed in the strong arch of the tunnel and seen through the\ntender blue radiance of the tunnel's atmosphere.\n\nThe cavern was nearly a hundred yards long, and when we reached its\ninner limit the proprietor stepped into a branch tunnel with his candles\nand left us buried in the bowels of the glacier, and in pitch-darkness.\nWe judged his purpose was murder and robbery; so we got out our matches\nand prepared to sell our lives as dearly as possible by setting the\nglacier on fire if the worst came to the worst--but we soon perceived\nthat this man had changed his mind; he began to sing, in a deep,\nmelodious voice, and woke some curious and pleasing echoes. By and by he\ncame back and pretended that that was what he had gone behind there for.\nWe believed as much of that as we wanted to.\n\nThus our lives had been once more in imminent peril, but by the exercise\nof the swift sagacity and cool courage which had saved us so often, we\nhad added another escape to the long list. The tourist should visit that\nice-cavern, by all means, for it is well worth the trouble; but I would\nadvise him to go only with a strong and well-armed force. I do not\nconsider artillery necessary, yet it would not be unadvisable to take\nit along, if convenient. The journey, going and coming, is about three\nmiles and a half, three of which are on level ground. We made it in\nless than a day, but I would counsel the unpracticed--if not pressed\nfor time--to allow themselves two. Nothing is gained in the Alps by\nover-exertion; nothing is gained by crowding two days' work into one for\nthe poor sake of being able to boast of the exploit afterward. It will\nbe found much better, in the long run, to do the thing in two days, and\nthen subtract one of them from the narrative. This saves fatigue, and\ndoes not injure the narrative. All the more thoughtful among the Alpine\ntourists do this.\n\n\n\nWe now called upon the Guide-in-Chief, and asked for a squadron of\nguides and porters for the ascent of the Montanvert. This idiot glared\nat us, and said:\n\n\"You don't need guides and porters to go to the Montanvert.\"\n\n\"What do we need, then?\"\n\n\"Such as YOU?--an ambulance!\"\n\nI was so stung by this brutal remark that I took my custom elsewhere.\n\nBetimes, next morning, we had reached an altitude of five thousand feet\nabove the level of the sea. Here we camped and breakfasted. There was\na cabin there--the spot is called the Caillet--and a spring of ice-cold\nwater. On the door of the cabin was a sign, in French, to the effect\nthat \"One may here see a living chamois for fifty centimes.\" We did not\ninvest; what we wanted was to see a dead one.\n\nA little after noon we ended the ascent and arrived at the new hotel on\nthe Montanvert, and had a view of six miles, right up the great glacier,\nthe famous Mer de Glace. At this point it is like a sea whose deep\nswales and long, rolling swells have been caught in mid-movement and\nfrozen solid; but further up it is broken up into wildly tossing billows\nof ice.\n\n\n\nWe descended a ticklish path in the steep side of the moraine, and\ninvaded the glacier. There were tourists of both sexes scattered far and\nwide over it, everywhere, and it had the festive look of a skating-rink.\n\nThe Empress Josephine came this far, once. She ascended the Montanvert\nin 1810--but not alone; a small army of men preceded her to clear the\npath--and carpet it, perhaps--and she followed, under the protection of\nSIXTY-EIGHT guides.\n\nHer successor visited Chamonix later, but in far different style.\n\nIt was seven weeks after the first fall of the Empire, and poor Marie\nLouise, ex-Empress was a fugitive. She came at night, and in a storm,\nwith only two attendants, and stood before a peasant's hut, tired,\nbedraggled, soaked with rain, \"the red print of her lost crown still\ngirdling her brow,\" and implored admittance--and was refused! A few days\nbefore, the adulations and applauses of a nation were sounding in her\nears, and now she was come to this!\n\nWe crossed the Mer de Glace in safety, but we had misgivings. The\ncrevices in the ice yawned deep and blue and mysterious, and it made one\nnervous to traverse them. The huge round waves of ice were slippery and\ndifficult to climb, and the chances of tripping and sliding down them\nand darting into a crevice were too many to be comfortable.\n\nIn the bottom of a deep swale between two of the biggest of the\nice-waves, we found a fraud who pretended to be cutting steps to insure\nthe safety of tourists. He was \"soldiering\" when we came upon him, but\nhe hopped up and chipped out a couple of steps about big enough for a\ncat, and charged us a franc or two for it. Then he sat down again, to\ndoze till the next party should come along.\n\n\n\nHe had collected blackmail from two or three hundred people already,\nthat day, but had not chipped out ice enough to impair the glacier\nperceptibly. I have heard of a good many soft sinecures, but it seems\nto me that keeping toll-bridge on a glacier is the softest one I have\nencountered yet.\n\nThat was a blazing hot day, and it brought a persistent and persecuting\nthirst with it. What an unspeakable luxury it was to slake that thirst\nwith the pure and limpid ice-water of the glacier! Down the sides of\nevery great rib of pure ice poured limpid rills in gutters carved by\ntheir own attrition; better still, wherever a rock had lain, there was\nnow a bowl-shaped hole, with smooth white sides and bottom of ice, and\nthis bowl was brimming with water of such absolute clearness that the\ncareless observer would not see it at all, but would think the bowl was\nempty. These fountains had such an alluring look that I often stretched\nmyself out when I was not thirsty and dipped my face in and drank till\nmy teeth ached. Everywhere among the Swiss mountains we had at hand the\nblessing--not to be found in Europe EXCEPT in the mountains--of water\ncapable of quenching thirst. Everywhere in the Swiss highlands brilliant\nlittle rills of exquisitely cold water went dancing along by the\nroadsides, and my comrade and I were always drinking and always\ndelivering our deep gratitude.\n\nBut in Europe everywhere except in the mountains, the water is flat and\ninsipid beyond the power of words to describe. It is served lukewarm;\nbut no matter, ice could not help it; it is incurably flat, incurably\ninsipid. It is only good to wash with; I wonder it doesn't occur to\nthe average inhabitant to try it for that. In Europe the people say\ncontemptuously, \"Nobody drinks water here.\" Indeed, they have a sound\nand sufficient reason. In many places they even have what may be called\nprohibitory reasons. In Paris and Munich, for instance, they say, \"Don't\ndrink the water, it is simply poison.\"\n\nEither America is healthier than Europe, notwithstanding her \"deadly\"\nindulgence in ice-water, or she does not keep the run of her death-rate\nas sharply as Europe does. I think we do keep up the death statistics\naccurately; and if we do, our cities are healthier than the cities of\nEurope. Every month the German government tabulates the death-rate of\nthe world and publishes it. I scrap-booked these reports during several\nmonths, and it was curious to see how regular and persistently each city\nrepeated its same death-rate month after month. The tables might as well\nhave been stereotyped, they varied so little. These tables were\nbased upon weekly reports showing the average of deaths in each 1,000\npopulation for a year. Munich was always present with her 33 deaths in\neach 1,000 of her population (yearly average), Chicago was as constant\nwith her 15 or 17, Dublin with her 48--and so on.\n\nOnly a few American cities appear in these tables, but they are\nscattered so widely over the country that they furnish a good general\naverage of CITY health in the United States; and I think it will be\ngranted that our towns and villages are healthier than our cities.\n\nHere is the average of the only American cities reported in the German\ntables:\n\nChicago, deaths in 1,000 population annually, 16; Philadelphia, 18; St.\nLouis, 18; San Francisco, 19; New York (the Dublin of America), 23.\n\nSee how the figures jump up, as soon as one arrives at the transatlantic\nlist:\n\nParis, 27; Glasgow, 27; London, 28; Vienna, 28; Augsburg, 28;\nBraunschweig, 28; K\u00f6nigsberg, 29; Cologne, 29; Dresden, 29; Hamburg, 29;\nBerlin, 30; Bombay, 30; Warsaw, 31; Breslau, 31; Odessa, 32; Munich, 33;\nStrasburg, 33, Pesth, 35; Cassel, 35; Lisbon, 36; Liverpool, 36;\nPrague, 37; Madras, 37; Bucharest, 39; St. Petersburg, 40; Trieste, 40;\nAlexandria (Egypt), 43; Dublin, 48; Calcutta, 55.\n\nEdinburgh is as healthy as New York--23; but there is no CITY in the\nentire list which is healthier, except Frankfort-on-the-Main--20. But\nFrankfort is not as healthy as Chicago, San Francisco, St. Louis, or\nPhiladelphia.\n\nPerhaps a strict average of the world might develop the fact that where\none in 1,000 of America's population dies, two in 1,000 of the other\npopulations of the earth succumb.\n\nI do not like to make insinuations, but I do think the above statistics\ndarkly suggest that these people over here drink this detestable water\n\"on the sly.\"\n\nWe climbed the moraine on the opposite side of the glacier, and then\ncrept along its sharp ridge a hundred yards or so, in pretty constant\ndanger of a tumble to the glacier below. The fall would have been only\none hundred feet, but it would have closed me out as effectually as one\nthousand, therefore I respected the distance accordingly, and was\nglad when the trip was done. A moraine is an ugly thing to assault\nhead-first. At a distance it looks like an endless grave of fine sand,\naccurately shaped and nicely smoothed; but close by, it is found to be\nmade mainly of rough boulders of all sizes, from that of a man's head to\nthat of a cottage.\n\nBy and by we came to the Mauvais Pas, or the Villainous Road, to\ntranslate it feelingly. It was a breakneck path around the face of a\nprecipice forty or fifty feet high, and nothing to hang on to but some\niron railings. I got along, slowly, safely, and uncomfortably, and\nfinally reached the middle. My hopes began to rise a little, but they\nwere quickly blighted; for there I met a hog--a long-nosed, bristly\nfellow, that held up his snout and worked his nostrils at me\ninquiringly. A hog on a pleasure excursion in Switzerland--think of it!\nIt is striking and unusual; a body might write a poem about it. He\ncould not retreat, if he had been disposed to do it. It would have been\nfoolish to stand upon our dignity in a place where there was hardly room\nto stand upon our feet, so we did nothing of the sort. There were twenty\nor thirty ladies and gentlemen behind us; we all turned about and went\nback, and the hog followed behind. The creature did not seem set up by\nwhat he had done; he had probably done it before.\n\n\n\nWe reached the restaurant on the height called the Chapeau at four in\nthe afternoon. It was a memento-factory, and the stock was large, cheap,\nand varied. I bought the usual paper-cutter to remember the place by,\nand had Mont Blanc, the Mauvais Pas, and the rest of the region branded\non my alpenstock; then we descended to the valley and walked home\nwithout being tied together. This was not dangerous, for the valley was\nfive miles wide, and quite level.\n\nWe reached the hotel before nine o'clock. Next morning we left for\nGeneva on top of the diligence, under shelter of a gay awning. If I\nremember rightly, there were more than twenty people up there. It was\nso high that the ascent was made by ladder. The huge vehicle was full\neverywhere, inside and out. Five other diligences left at the same time,\nall full. We had engaged our seats two days beforehand, to make sure,\nand paid the regulation price, five dollars each; but the rest of the\ncompany were wiser; they had trusted Baedeker, and waited; consequently\nsome of them got their seats for one or two dollars. Baedeker knows\nall about hotels, railway and diligence companies, and speaks his mind\nfreely. He is a trustworthy friend of the traveler.\n\n\n\nWe never saw Mont Blanc at his best until we were many miles away; then\nhe lifted his majestic proportions high into the heavens, all white\nand cold and solemn, and made the rest of the world seem little and\nplebeian, and cheap and trivial.\n\nAs he passed out of sight at last, an old Englishman settled himself in\nhis seat and said:\n\n\"Well, I am satisfied, I have seen the principal features of Swiss\nscenery--Mont Blanc and the goiter--now for home!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\n[Queer European Manners]\n\n\nWe spent a few pleasant restful days at Geneva, that delightful city\nwhere accurate time-pieces are made for all the rest of the world, but\nwhose own clocks never give the correct time of day by any accident.\n\nGeneva is filled with pretty shops, and the shops are filled with the\nmost enticing gimcrackery, but if one enters one of these places he is\nat once pounced upon, and followed up, and so persecuted to buy this,\nthat, and the other thing, that he is very grateful to get out again,\nand is not at all apt to repeat his experiment. The shopkeepers of the\nsmaller sort, in Geneva, are as troublesome and persistent as are\nthe salesmen of that monster hive in Paris, the Grands Magasins du\nLouvre--an establishment where ill-mannered pestering, pursuing, and\ninsistence have been reduced to a science.\n\nIn Geneva, prices in the smaller shops are very elastic--that is another\nbad feature. I was looking in at a window at a very pretty string of\nbeads, suitable for a child. I was only admiring them; I had no use for\nthem; I hardly ever wear beads. The shopwoman came out and offered them\nto me for thirty-five francs. I said it was cheap, but I did not need\nthem.\n\n\"Ah, but monsieur, they are so beautiful!\"\n\nI confessed it, but said they were not suitable for one of my age and\nsimplicity of character. She darted in and brought them out and tried to\nforce them into my hands, saying:\n\n\"Ah, but only see how lovely they are! Surely monsieur will take them;\nmonsieur shall have them for thirty francs. There, I have said it--it is\na loss, but one must live.\"\n\nI dropped my hands, and tried to move her to respect my unprotected\nsituation. But no, she dangled the beads in the sun before my face,\nexclaiming, \"Ah, monsieur CANNOT resist them!\" She hung them on my coat\nbutton, folded her hand resignedly, and said: \"Gone,--and for thirty\nfrancs, the lovely things--it is incredible!--but the good God will\nsanctify the sacrifice to me.\"\n\nI removed them gently, returned them, and walked away, shaking my head\nand smiling a smile of silly embarrassment while the passers-by halted\nto observe. The woman leaned out of her door, shook the beads, and\nscreamed after me:\n\n\"Monsieur shall have them for twenty-eight!\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"Twenty-seven! It is a cruel loss, it is ruin--but take them, only take\nthem.\"\n\nI still retreated, still wagging my head.\n\n\"MON DIEU, they shall even go for twenty-six! There, I have said it.\nCome!\"\n\nI wagged another negative. A nurse and a little English girl had been\nnear me, and were following me, now. The shopwoman ran to the nurse,\nthrust the beads into her hands, and said:\n\n\"Monsieur shall have them for twenty-five! Take them to the hotel--he\nshall send me the money tomorrow--next day--when he likes.\" Then to the\nchild: \"When thy father sends me the money, come thou also, my angel,\nand thou shall have something oh so pretty!\"\n\n\n\nI was thus providentially saved. The nurse refused the beads squarely\nand firmly, and that ended the matter.\n\nThe \"sights\" of Geneva are not numerous. I made one attempt to hunt up\nthe houses once inhabited by those two disagreeable people, Rousseau and\nCalvin, but I had no success. Then I concluded to go home. I found\nit was easier to propose to do that than to do it; for that town is a\nbewildering place. I got lost in a tangle of narrow and crooked streets,\nand stayed lost for an hour or two. Finally I found a street which\nlooked somewhat familiar, and said to myself, \"Now I am at home, I\njudge.\" But I was wrong; this was \"HELL street.\" Presently I found\nanother place which had a familiar look, and said to myself, \"Now I am\nat home, sure.\" It was another error. This was \"PURGATORY street.\" After\na little I said, \"NOW I've got the right place, anyway ... no, this is\n'PARADISE street'; I'm further from home than I was in the beginning.\"\nThose were queer names--Calvin was the author of them, likely.\n\"Hell\" and \"Purgatory\" fitted those two streets like a glove, but the\n\"Paradise\" appeared to be sarcastic.\n\nI came out on the lake-front, at last, and then I knew where I was.\nI was walking along before the glittering jewelry shops when I saw a\ncurious performance. A lady passed by, and a trim dandy lounged across\nthe walk in such an apparently carefully timed way as to bring himself\nexactly in front of her when she got to him; he made no offer to step\nout of the way; he did not apologize; he did not even notice her. She\nhad to stop still and let him lounge by. I wondered if he had done that\npiece of brutality purposely. He strolled to a chair and seated himself\nat a small table; two or three other males were sitting at similar\ntables sipping sweetened water. I waited; presently a youth came by, and\nthis fellow got up and served him the same trick. Still, it did not seem\npossible that any one could do such a thing deliberately. To satisfy my\ncuriosity I went around the block, and, sure enough, as I approached, at\na good round speed, he got up and lounged lazily across my path, fouling\nmy course exactly at the right moment to receive all my weight. This\nproved that his previous performances had not been accidental, but\nintentional.\n\n\n\nI saw that dandy's curious game played afterward, in Paris, but not\nfor amusement; not with a motive of any sort, indeed, but simply from a\nselfish indifference to other people's comfort and rights. One does not\nsee it as frequently in Paris as he might expect to, for there the law\nsays, in effect, \"It is the business of the weak to get out of the way\nof the strong.\" We fine a cabman if he runs over a citizen; Paris fines\nthe citizen for being run over. At least so everybody says--but I saw\nsomething which caused me to doubt; I saw a horseman run over an old\nwoman one day--the police arrested him and took him away. That looked as\nif they meant to punish him.\n\nIt will not do for me to find merit in American manners--for are they\nnot the standing butt for the jests of critical and polished Europe?\nStill, I must venture to claim one little matter of superiority in our\nmanners; a lady may traverse our streets all day, going and coming as\nshe chooses, and she will never be molested by any man; but if a lady,\nunattended, walks abroad in the streets of London, even at noonday, she\nwill be pretty likely to be accosted and insulted--and not by drunken\nsailors, but by men who carry the look and wear the dress of gentlemen.\nIt is maintained that these people are not gentlemen, but are a lower\nsort, disguised as gentlemen. The case of Colonel Valentine Baker\nobstructs that argument, for a man cannot become an officer in the\nBritish army except he hold the rank of gentleman. This person, finding\nhimself alone in a railway compartment with an unprotected girl--but\nit is an atrocious story, and doubtless the reader remembers it well\nenough. London must have been more or less accustomed to Bakers, and the\nways of Bakers, else London would have been offended and excited. Baker\nwas \"imprisoned\"--in a parlor; and he could not have been more visited,\nor more overwhelmed with attentions, if he had committed six murders and\nthen--while the gallows was preparing--\"got religion\"--after the manner\nof the holy Charles Peace, of saintly memory. Arkansaw--it seems a\nlittle indelicate to be trumpeting forth our own superiorities, and\ncomparisons are always odious, but still--Arkansaw would certainly have\nhanged Baker. I do not say she would have tried him first, but she would\nhave hanged him, anyway.\n\nEven the most degraded woman can walk our streets unmolested, her sex\nand her weakness being her sufficient protection. She will encounter\nless polish than she would in the old world, but she will run across\nenough humanity to make up for it.\n\nThe music of a donkey awoke us early in the morning, and we rose up and\nmade ready for a pretty formidable walk--to Italy; but the road was so\nlevel that we took the train.. We lost a good deal of time by this, but\nit was no matter, we were not in a hurry. We were four hours going to\nChamb`ery. The Swiss trains go upward of three miles an hour, in places,\nbut they are quite safe.\n\nThat aged French town of Chamb\u00e8ry was as quaint and crooked as\nHeilbronn. A drowsy reposeful quiet reigned in the back streets which\nmade strolling through them very pleasant, barring the almost unbearable\nheat of the sun. In one of these streets, which was eight feet wide,\ngracefully curved, and built up with small antiquated houses, I saw\nthree fat hogs lying asleep, and a boy (also asleep) taking care of\nthem.\n\n\n\nFrom queer old-fashioned windows along the curve projected boxes of\nbright flowers, and over the edge of one of these boxes hung the head\nand shoulders of a cat--asleep. The five sleeping creatures were the\nonly living things visible in that street. There was not a sound;\nabsolute stillness prevailed. It was Sunday; one is not used to\nsuch dreamy Sundays on the continent. In our part of the town it was\ndifferent that night. A regiment of brown and battered soldiers had\narrived home from Algiers, and I judged they got thirsty on the way.\nThey sang and drank till dawn, in the pleasant open air.\n\nWe left for Turin at ten the next morning by a railway which was\nprofusely decorated with tunnels. We forgot to take a lantern along,\nconsequently we missed all the scenery. Our compartment was full. A\nponderous tow-headed Swiss woman, who put on many fine-lady airs, but\nwas evidently more used to washing linen than wearing it, sat in a\ncorner seat and put her legs across into the opposite one, propping them\nintermediately with her up-ended valise. In the seat thus pirated, sat\ntwo Americans, greatly incommoded by that woman's majestic coffin-clad\nfeet. One of them begged, politely, to remove them. She opened her wide\neyes and gave him a stare, but answered nothing. By and by he proferred\nhis request again, with great respectfulness. She said, in good English,\nand in a deeply offended tone, that she had paid her passage and was not\ngoing to be bullied out of her \"rights\" by ill-bred foreigners, even if\nshe was alone and unprotected.\n\n\n\n\"But I have rights, also, madam. My ticket entitles me to a seat, but\nyou are occupying half of it.\"\n\n\"I will not talk with you, sir. What right have you to speak to me? I\ndo not know you. One would know you came from a land where there are no\ngentlemen. No GENTLEMAN would treat a lady as you have treated me.\"\n\n\"I come from a region where a lady would hardly give me the same\nprovocation.\"\n\n\"You have insulted me, sir! You have intimated that I am not a lady--and\nI hope I am NOT one, after the pattern of your country.\"\n\n\"I beg that you will give yourself no alarm on that head, madam; but at\nthe same time I must insist--always respectfully--that you let me have\nmy seat.\"\n\nHere the fragile laundress burst into tears and sobs.\n\n\"I never was so insulted before! Never, never! It is shameful, it is\nbrutal, it is base, to bully and abuse an unprotected lady who has\nlost the use of her limbs and cannot put her feet to the floor without\nagony!\"\n\n\"Good heavens, madam, why didn't you say that at first! I offer a\nthousand pardons. And I offer them most sincerely. I did not know--I\nCOULD not know--anything was the matter. You are most welcome to the\nseat, and would have been from the first if I had only known. I am truly\nsorry it all happened, I do assure you.\"\n\nBut he couldn't get a word of forgiveness out of her. She simply sobbed\nand sniffed in a subdued but wholly unappeasable way for two long hours,\nmeantime crowding the man more than ever with her undertaker-furniture\nand paying no sort of attention to his frequent and humble little\nefforts to do something for her comfort. Then the train halted at the\nItalian line and she hopped up and marched out of the car with as firm a\nleg as any washerwoman of all her tribe! And how sick I was, to see how\nshe had fooled me.\n\n\n\nTurin is a very fine city. In the matter of roominess it transcends\nanything that was ever dreamed of before, I fancy. It sits in the midst\nof a vast dead-level, and one is obliged to imagine that land may be\nhad for the asking, and no taxes to pay, so lavishly do they use it. The\nstreets are extravagantly wide, the paved squares are prodigious, the\nhouses are huge and handsome, and compacted into uniform blocks that\nstretch away as straight as an arrow, into the distance. The sidewalks\nare about as wide as ordinary European STREETS, and are covered over\nwith a double arcade supported on great stone piers or columns. One\nwalks from one end to the other of these spacious streets, under shelter\nall the time, and all his course is lined with the prettiest of shops\nand the most inviting dining-houses.\n\nThere is a wide and lengthy court, glittering with the most wickedly\nenticing shops, which is roofed with glass, high aloft overhead, and\npaved with soft-toned marbles laid in graceful figures; and at night\nwhen the place is brilliant with gas and populous with a sauntering and\nchatting and laughing multitude of pleasure-seekers, it is a spectacle\nworth seeing.\n\nEverything is on a large scale; the public buildings, for instance--and\nthey are architecturally imposing, too, as well as large. The big\nsquares have big bronze monuments in them. At the hotel they gave us\nrooms that were alarming, for size, and parlor to match. It was well the\nweather required no fire in the parlor, for I think one might as well\nhave tried to warm a park. The place would have a warm look, though, in\nany weather, for the window-curtains were of red silk damask, and the\nwalls were covered with the same fire-hued goods--so, also, were the\nfour sofas and the brigade of chairs. The furniture, the ornaments, the\nchandeliers, the carpets, were all new and bright and costly. We did not\nneed a parlor at all, but they said it belonged to the two bedrooms and\nwe might use it if we chose. Since it was to cost nothing, we were not\naverse to using it, of course.\n\nTurin must surely read a good deal, for it has more book-stores to the\nsquare rod than any other town I know of. And it has its own share of\nmilitary folk. The Italian officers' uniforms are very much the most\nbeautiful I have ever seen; and, as a general thing, the men in them\nwere as handsome as the clothes. They were not large men, but they had\nfine forms, fine features, rich olive complexions, and lustrous black\neyes.\n\nFor several weeks I had been culling all the information I could about\nItaly, from tourists. The tourists were all agreed upon one thing--one\nmust expect to be cheated at every turn by the Italians. I took an\nevening walk in Turin, and presently came across a little Punch and Judy\nshow in one of the great squares. Twelve or fifteen people constituted\nthe audience. This miniature theater was not much bigger than a man's\ncoffin stood on end; the upper part was open and displayed a\ntinseled parlor--a good-sized handkerchief would have answered for a\ndrop-curtain; the footlights consisted of a couple of candle-ends an\ninch long; various manikins the size of dolls appeared on the stage and\nmade long speeches at each other, gesticulating a good deal, and they\ngenerally had a fight before they got through. They were worked by\nstrings from above, and the illusion was not perfect, for one saw not\nonly the strings but the brawny hand that manipulated them--and the\nactors and actresses all talked in the same voice, too. The audience\nstood in front of the theater, and seemed to enjoy the performance\nheartily.\n\nWhen the play was done, a youth in his shirt-sleeves started around with\na small copper saucer to make a collection. I did not know how much to\nput in, but thought I would be guided by my predecessors. Unluckily, I\nonly had two of these, and they did not help me much because they did\nnot put in anything. I had no Italian money, so I put in a small Swiss\ncoin worth about ten cents. The youth finished his collection trip and\nemptied the result on the stage; he had some very animated talk with\nthe concealed manager, then he came working his way through the little\ncrowd--seeking me, I thought. I had a mind to slip away, but concluded\nI wouldn't; I would stand my ground, and confront the villainy, whatever\nit was. The youth stood before me and held up that Swiss coin, sure\nenough, and said something. I did not understand him, but I judged he\nwas requiring Italian money of me. The crowd gathered close, to listen.\nI was irritated, and said--in English, of course:\n\n\"I know it's Swiss, but you'll take that or none. I haven't any other.\"\n\n\n\nHe tried to put the coin in my hand, and spoke again. I drew my hand\naway, and said:\n\n\"NO, sir. I know all about you people. You can't play any of your\nfraudful tricks on me. If there is a discount on that coin, I am sorry,\nbut I am not going to make it good. I noticed that some of the audience\ndidn't pay you anything at all. You let them go, without a word, but you\ncome after me because you think I'm a stranger and will put up with\nan extortion rather than have a scene. But you are mistaken this\ntime--you'll take that Swiss money or none.\"\n\nThe youth stood there with the coin in his fingers, nonplused and\nbewildered; of course he had not understood a word. An English-speaking\nItalian spoke up, now, and said:\n\n\"You are misunderstanding the boy. He does not mean any harm. He did\nnot suppose you gave him so much money purposely, so he hurried back to\nreturn you the coin lest you might get away before you discovered your\nmistake. Take it, and give him a penny--that will make everything smooth\nagain.\"\n\nI probably blushed, then, for there was occasion. Through the\ninterpreter I begged the boy's pardon, but I nobly refused to take back\nthe ten cents. I said I was accustomed to squandering large sums in that\nway--it was the kind of person I was. Then I retired to make a note to\nthe effect that in Italy persons connected with the drama do not cheat.\n\nThe episode with the showman reminds me of a dark chapter in my history.\nI once robbed an aged and blind beggar-woman of four dollars--in a\nchurch. It happened this way. When I was out with the Innocents Abroad,\nthe ship stopped in the Russian port of Odessa and I went ashore, with\nothers, to view the town. I got separated from the rest, and wandered\nabout alone, until late in the afternoon, when I entered a Greek church\nto see what it was like. When I was ready to leave, I observed two\nwrinkled old women standing stiffly upright against the inner wall, near\nthe door, with their brown palms open to receive alms. I contributed to\nthe nearer one, and passed out. I had gone fifty yards, perhaps, when it\noccurred to me that I must remain ashore all night, as I had heard that\nthe ship's business would carry her away at four o'clock and keep her\naway until morning. It was a little after four now. I had come ashore\nwith only two pieces of money, both about the same size, but differing\nlargely in value--one was a French gold piece worth four dollars, the\nother a Turkish coin worth two cents and a half. With a sudden and\nhorrified misgiving, I put my hand in my pocket, now, and sure enough, I\nfetched out that Turkish penny!\n\nHere was a situation. A hotel would require pay in advance --I must walk\nthe street all night, and perhaps be arrested as a suspicious character.\nThere was but one way out of the difficulty--I flew back to the church,\nand softly entered. There stood the old woman yet, and in the palm of\nthe nearest one still lay my gold piece. I was grateful. I crept\nclose, feeling unspeakably mean; I got my Turkish penny ready, and was\nextending a trembling hand to make the nefarious exchange, when I heard\na cough behind me. I jumped back as if I had been accused, and stood\nquaking while a worshiper entered and passed up the aisle.\n\nI was there a year trying to steal that money; that is, it seemed a\nyear, though, of course, it must have been much less. The worshipers\nwent and came; there were hardly ever three in the church at once, but\nthere was always one or more. Every time I tried to commit my crime\nsomebody came in or somebody started out, and I was prevented; but at\nlast my opportunity came; for one moment there was nobody in the church\nbut the two beggar-women and me. I whipped the gold piece out of the\npoor old pauper's palm and dropped my Turkish penny in its place. Poor\nold thing, she murmured her thanks--they smote me to the heart. Then I\nsped away in a guilty hurry, and even when I was a mile from the church\nI was still glancing back, every moment, to see if I was being pursued.\n\nThat experience has been of priceless value and benefit to me; for I\nresolved then, that as long as I lived I would never again rob a blind\nbeggar-woman in a church; and I have always kept my word. The most\npermanent lessons in morals are those which come, not of booky teaching,\nbut of experience.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII\n\n[Beauty of Women--and of Old Masters]\n\n\nIn Milan we spent most of our time in the vast and beautiful Arcade or\nGallery, or whatever it is called. Blocks of tall new buildings of the\nmost sumptuous sort, rich with decoration and graced with statues, the\nstreets between these blocks roofed over with glass at a great height,\nthe pavements all of smooth and variegated marble, arranged in tasteful\npatterns--little tables all over these marble streets, people sitting\nat them, eating, drinking, or smoking--crowds of other people strolling\nby--such is the Arcade. I should like to live in it all the time. The\nwindows of the sumptuous restaurants stand open, and one breakfasts\nthere and enjoys the passing show.\n\nWe wandered all over the town, enjoying whatever was going on in the\nstreets. We took one omnibus ride, and as I did not speak Italian and\ncould not ask the price, I held out some copper coins to the conductor,\nand he took two. Then he went and got his tariff card and showed me\nthat he had taken only the right sum. So I made a note--Italian omnibus\nconductors do not cheat.\n\nNear the Cathedral I saw another instance of probity. An old man was\npeddling dolls and toy fans. Two small American children bought fans,\nand one gave the old man a franc and three copper coins, and both\nstarted away; but they were called back, and the franc and one of the\ncoppers were restored to them. Hence it is plain that in Italy, parties\nconnected with the drama and the omnibus and the toy interests do not\ncheat.\n\n\n\nThe stocks of goods in the shops were not extensive, generally. In the\nvestibule of what seemed to be a clothing store, we saw eight or ten\nwooden dummies grouped together, clothed in woolen business suits and\neach marked with its price. One suit was marked forty-five francs--nine\ndollars. Harris stepped in and said he wanted a suit like that. Nothing\neasier: the old merchant dragged in the dummy, brushed him off with a\nbroom, stripped him, and shipped the clothes to the hotel. He said he\ndid not keep two suits of the same kind in stock, but manufactured a\nsecond when it was needed to reclothe the dummy.\n\n\n\nIn another quarter we found six Italians engaged in a violent quarrel.\nThey danced fiercely about, gesticulating with their heads, their arms,\ntheir legs, their whole bodies; they would rush forward occasionally\nwith a sudden access of passion and shake their fists in each other's\nvery faces. We lost half an hour there, waiting to help cord up the\ndead, but they finally embraced each other affectionately, and the\ntrouble was over. The episode was interesting, but we could not have\nafforded all the time to it if we had known nothing was going to come of\nit but a reconciliation. Note made--in Italy, people who quarrel cheat\nthe spectator.\n\nWe had another disappointment afterward. We approached a deeply\ninterested crowd, and in the midst of it found a fellow wildly\nchattering and gesticulating over a box on the ground which was covered\nwith a piece of old blanket. Every little while he would bend down\nand take hold of the edge of the blanket with the extreme tips of his\nfingertips, as if to show there was no deception--chattering away all\nthe while--but always, just as I was expecting to see a wonder feat of\nlegerdemain, he would let go the blanket and rise to explain further.\nHowever, at last he uncovered the box and got out a spoon with a liquid\nin it, and held it fair and frankly around, for people to see that it\nwas all right and he was taking no advantage--his chatter became more\nexcited than ever. I supposed he was going to set fire to the liquid\nand swallow it, so I was greatly wrought up and interested. I got a cent\nready in one hand and a florin in the other, intending to give him the\nformer if he survived and the latter if he killed himself--for his loss\nwould be my gain in a literary way, and I was willing to pay a fair\nprice for the item --but this impostor ended his intensely moving\nperformance by simply adding some powder to the liquid and polishing\nthe spoon! Then he held it aloft, and he could not have shown a wilder\nexultation if he had achieved an immortal miracle. The crowd applauded\nin a gratified way, and it seemed to me that history speaks the truth\nwhen it says these children of the south are easily entertained.\n\nWe spent an impressive hour in the noble cathedral, where long shafts\nof tinted light were cleaving through the solemn dimness from the lofty\nwindows and falling on a pillar here, a picture there, and a kneeling\nworshiper yonder. The organ was muttering, censers were swinging,\ncandles were glinting on the distant altar and robed priests were filing\nsilently past them; the scene was one to sweep all frivolous thoughts\naway and steep the soul in a holy calm. A trim young American lady\npaused a yard or two from me, fixed her eyes on the mellow sparks\nflecking the far-off altar, bent her head reverently a moment, then\nstraightened up, kicked her train into the air with her heel, caught it\ndeftly in her hand, and marched briskly out.\n\n\n\nWe visited the picture-galleries and the other regulation \"sights\" of\nMilan--not because I wanted to write about them again, but to see if\nI had learned anything in twelve years. I afterward visited the great\ngalleries of Rome and Florence for the same purpose. I found I had\nlearned one thing. When I wrote about the Old Masters before, I said\nthe copies were better than the originals. That was a mistake of large\ndimensions. The Old Masters were still unpleasing to me, but they were\ntruly divine contrasted with the copies. The copy is to the original as\nthe pallid, smart, inane new wax-work group is to the vigorous, earnest,\ndignified group of living men and women whom it professes to duplicate.\nThere is a mellow richness, a subdued color, in the old pictures, which\nis to the eye what muffled and mellowed sound is to the ear. That is the\nmerit which is most loudly praised in the old picture, and is the one\nwhich the copy most conspicuously lacks, and which the copyist must not\nhope to compass. It was generally conceded by the artists with whom I\ntalked, that that subdued splendor, that mellow richness, is imparted\nto the picture by AGE. Then why should we worship the Old Master for it,\nwho didn't impart it, instead of worshiping Old Time, who did? Perhaps\nthe picture was a clanging bell, until Time muffled it and sweetened it.\n\n\n\nIn conversation with an artist in Venice, I asked: \"What is it that\npeople see in the Old Masters? I have been in the Doge's palace and I\nsaw several acres of very bad drawing, very bad perspective, and very\nincorrect proportions. Paul Veronese's dogs to not resemble dogs; all\nthe horses look like bladders on legs; one man had a RIGHT leg on\nthe left side of his body; in the large picture where the Emperor\n(Barbarossa?) is prostrate before the Pope, there are three men in the\nforeground who are over thirty feet high, if one may judge by the size\nof a kneeling little boy in the center of the foreground; and according\nto the same scale, the Pope is seven feet high and the Doge is a\nshriveled dwarf of four feet.\"\n\nThe artist said:\n\n\"Yes, the Old Masters often drew badly; they did not care much for truth\nand exactness in minor details; but after all, in spite of bad drawing,\nbad perspective, bad proportions, and a choice of subjects which no\nlonger appeal to people as strongly as they did three hundred years ago,\nthere is a SOMETHING about their pictures which is divine--a something\nwhich is above and beyond the art of any epoch since--a something which\nwould be the despair of artists but that they never hope or expect to\nattain it, and therefore do not worry about it.\"\n\nThat is what he said--and he said what he believed; and not only\nbelieved, but felt.\n\nReasoning--especially reasoning, without technical knowledge--must be\nput aside, in cases of this kind. It cannot assist the inquirer. It\nwill lead him, in the most logical progression, to what, in the eyes of\nartists, would be a most illogical conclusion. Thus: bad drawing, bad\nproportion, bad perspective, indifference to truthful detail, color\nwhich gets its merit from time, and not from the artist--these things\nconstitute the Old Master; conclusion, the Old Master was a bad painter,\nthe Old Master was not an Old Master at all, but an Old Apprentice. Your\nfriend the artist will grant your premises, but deny your conclusion;\nhe will maintain that notwithstanding this formidable list of confessed\ndefects, there is still a something that is divine and unapproachable\nabout the Old Master, and that there is no arguing the fact away by any\nsystem of reasoning whatsoever.\n\nI can believe that. There are women who have an indefinable charm in\ntheir faces which makes them beautiful to their intimates, but a cold\nstranger who tried to reason the matter out and find this beauty would\nfail. He would say of one of these women: This chin is too short, this\nnose is too long, this forehead is too high, this hair is too red, this\ncomplexion is too pallid, the perspective of the entire composition\nis incorrect; conclusion, the woman is not beautiful. But her nearest\nfriend might say, and say truly, \"Your premises are right, your logic\nis faultless, but your conclusion is wrong, nevertheless; she is an Old\nMaster--she is beautiful, but only to such as know her; it is a beauty\nwhich cannot be formulated, but it is there, just the same.\"\n\n\n\nI found more pleasure in contemplating the Old Masters this time than\nI did when I was in Europe in former years, but still it was a calm\npleasure; there was nothing overheated about it. When I was in Venice\nbefore, I think I found no picture which stirred me much, but this time\nthere were two which enticed me to the Doge's palace day after day, and\nkept me there hours at a time. One of these was Tintoretto's three-acre\npicture in the Great Council Chamber. When I saw it twelve years ago\nI was not strongly attracted to it--the guide told me it was an\ninsurrection in heaven--but this was an error.\n\nThe movement of this great work is very fine. There are ten thousand\nfigures, and they are all doing something. There is a wonderful \"go\"\nto the whole composition. Some of the figures are driving headlong\ndownward, with clasped hands, others are swimming through the\ncloud-shoals--some on their faces, some on their backs--great\nprocessions of bishops, martyrs, and angels are pouring swiftly\ncenterward from various outlying directions--everywhere is enthusiastic\njoy, there is rushing movement everywhere. There are fifteen or twenty\nfigures scattered here and there, with books, but they cannot keep their\nattention on their reading--they offer the books to others, but no one\nwishes to read, now. The Lion of St. Mark is there with his book; St.\nMark is there with his pen uplifted; he and the Lion are looking\neach other earnestly in the face, disputing about the way to spell a\nword--the Lion looks up in rapt admiration while St. Mark spells. This\nis wonderfully interpreted by the artist. It is the master-stroke of\nthis imcomparable painting.\n\n\n\nI visited the place daily, and never grew tired of looking at that\ngrand picture. As I have intimated, the movement is almost unimaginably\nvigorous; the figures are singing, hosannahing, and many are blowing\ntrumpets. So vividly is noise suggested, that spectators who become\nabsorbed in the picture almost always fall to shouting comments in each\nother's ears, making ear-trumpets of their curved hands, fearing they\nmay not otherwise be heard. One often sees a tourist, with the eloquent\ntears pouring down his cheeks, funnel his hands at his wife's ear, and\nhears him roar through them, \"OH, TO BE THERE AND AT REST!\"\n\n\n\nNone but the supremely great in art can produce effects like these with\nthe silent brush.\n\nTwelve years ago I could not have appreciated this picture. One year ago\nI could not have appreciated it. My study of Art in Heidelberg has been\na noble education to me. All that I am today in Art, I owe to that.\n\nThe other great work which fascinated me was Bassano's immortal Hair\nTrunk. This is in the Chamber of the Council of Ten. It is in one of\nthe three forty-foot pictures which decorate the walls of the room.\nThe composition of this picture is beyond praise. The Hair Trunk is not\nhurled at the stranger's head--so to speak--as the chief feature of an\nimmortal work so often is; no, it is carefully guarded from prominence,\nit is subordinated, it is restrained, it is most deftly and cleverly\nheld in reserve, it is most cautiously and ingeniously led up to, by the\nmaster, and consequently when the spectator reaches it at last, he\nis taken unawares, he is unprepared, and it bursts upon him with a\nstupefying surprise.\n\nOne is lost in wonder at all the thought and care which this elaborate\nplanning must have cost. A general glance at the picture could never\nsuggest that there was a hair trunk in it; the Hair Trunk is not\nmentioned in the title even--which is, \"Pope Alexander III. and the Doge\nZiani, the Conqueror of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa\"; you see,\nthe title is actually utilized to help divert attention from the Trunk;\nthus, as I say, nothing suggests the presence of the Trunk, by any hint,\nyet everything studiedly leads up to it, step by step. Let us examine\ninto this, and observe the exquisitely artful artlessness of the plan.\n\nAt the extreme left end of the picture are a couple of women, one of\nthem with a child looking over her shoulder at a wounded man sitting\nwith bandaged head on the ground. These people seem needless, but no,\nthey are there for a purpose; one cannot look at them without seeing\nthe gorgeous procession of grandees, bishops, halberdiers, and\nbanner-bearers which is passing along behind them; one cannot see the\nprocession without feeling the curiosity to follow it and learn whither\nit is going; it leads him to the Pope, in the center of the picture, who\nis talking with the bonnetless Doge--talking tranquilly, too, although\nwithin twelve feet of them a man is beating a drum, and not far from the\ndrummer two persons are blowing horns, and many horsemen are plunging\nand rioting about--indeed, twenty-two feet of this great work is all a\ndeep and happy holiday serenity and Sunday-school procession, and then\nwe come suddenly upon eleven and one-half feet of turmoil and racket and\ninsubordination. This latter state of things is not an accident, it has\nits purpose. But for it, one would linger upon the Pope and the Doge,\nthinking them to be the motive and supreme feature of the picture;\nwhereas one is drawn along, almost unconsciously, to see what the\ntrouble is about. Now at the very END of this riot, within four feet of\nthe end of the picture, and full thirty-six feet from the beginning\nof it, the Hair Trunk bursts with an electrifying suddenness upon the\nspectator, in all its matchless perfection, and the great master's\ntriumph is sweeping and complete. From that moment no other thing in\nthose forty feet of canvas has any charm; one sees the Hair Trunk, and\nthe Hair Trunk only--and to see it is to worship it. Bassano even placed\nobjects in the immediate vicinity of the Supreme Feature whose pretended\npurpose was to divert attention from it yet a little longer and thus\ndelay and augment the surprise; for instance, to the right of it he has\nplaced a stooping man with a cap so red that it is sure to hold the eye\nfor a moment--to the left of it, some six feet away, he has placed a\nred-coated man on an inflated horse, and that coat plucks your eye\nto that locality the next moment--then, between the Trunk and the red\nhorseman he has intruded a man, naked to his waist, who is carrying\na fancy flour-sack on the middle of his back instead of on his\nshoulder--this admirable feat interests you, of course--keeps you at\nbay a little longer, like a sock or a jacket thrown to the pursuing\nwolf--but at last, in spite of all distractions and detentions, the eye\nof even the most dull and heedless spectator is sure to fall upon the\nWorld's Masterpiece, and in that moment he totters to his chair or leans\nupon his guide for support.\n\n\n\nDescriptions of such a work as this must necessarily be imperfect, yet\nthey are of value. The top of the Trunk is arched; the arch is a perfect\nhalf-circle, in the Roman style of architecture, for in the then\nrapid decadence of Greek art, the rising influence of Rome was already\nbeginning to be felt in the art of the Republic. The Trunk is bound or\nbordered with leather all around where the lid joins the main body. Many\ncritics consider this leather too cold in tone; but I consider this its\nhighest merit, since it was evidently made so to emphasize by contrast\nthe impassioned fervor of the hasp. The highlights in this part of the\nwork are cleverly managed, the MOTIF is admirably subordinated to the\nground tints, and the technique is very fine. The brass nail-heads are\nin the purest style of the early Renaissance. The strokes, here, are\nvery firm and bold--every nail-head is a portrait. The handle on the\nend of the Trunk has evidently been retouched--I think, with a piece of\nchalk--but one can still see the inspiration of the Old Master in the\ntranquil, almost too tranquil, hang of it. The hair of this Trunk is\nREAL hair--so to speak--white in patches, brown in patches. The details\nare finely worked out; the repose proper to hair in a recumbent and\ninactive attitude is charmingly expressed. There is a feeling about this\npart of the work which lifts it to the highest altitudes of art; the\nsense of sordid realism vanishes away--one recognizes that there is SOUL\nhere.\n\nView this Trunk as you will, it is a gem, it is a marvel, it is a\nmiracle. Some of the effects are very daring, approaching even to\nthe boldest flights of the rococo, the sirocco, and the Byzantine\nschools--yet the master's hand never falters--it moves on, calm,\nmajestic, confident--and, with that art which conceals art, it finally\ncasts over the TOUT ENSEMBLE, by mysterious methods of its own, a subtle\nsomething which refines, subdues, etherealizes the arid components and\nendures them with the deep charm and gracious witchery of poesy.\n\nAmong the art-treasures of Europe there are pictures which approach the\nHair Trunk--there are two which may be said to equal it, possibly--but\nthere is none that surpasses it. So perfect is the Hair Trunk that it\nmoves even persons who ordinarily have no feeling for art. When an Erie\nbaggagemaster saw it two years ago, he could hardly keep from checking\nit; and once when a customs inspector was brought into its presence,\nhe gazed upon it in silent rapture for some moments, then slowly and\nunconsciously placed one hand behind him with the palm uppermost, and\ngot out his chalk with the other. These facts speak for themselves.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\n[Hanged with a Golden Rope]\n\n\nOne lingers about the Cathedral a good deal, in Venice. There is a\nstrong fascination about it--partly because it is so old, and partly\nbecause it is so ugly. Too many of the world's famous buildings fail of\none chief virtue--harmony; they are made up of a methodless mixture\nof the ugly and the beautiful; this is bad; it is confusing, it is\nunrestful. One has a sense of uneasiness, of distress, without knowing\nwhy. But one is calm before St. Mark's, one is calm within it, one\nwould be calm on top of it, calm in the cellar; for its details are\nmasterfully ugly, no misplaced and impertinent beauties are intruded\nanywhere; and the consequent result is a grand harmonious whole, of\nsoothing, entrancing, tranquilizing, soul-satisfying ugliness. One's\nadmiration of a perfect thing always grows, never declines; and this is\nthe surest evidence to him that it IS perfect. St. Mark's is perfect. To\nme it soon grew to be so nobly, so augustly ugly, that it was difficult\nto stay away from it, even for a little while. Every time its squat\ndomes disappeared from my view, I had a despondent feeling; whenever\nthey reappeared, I felt an honest rapture--I have not known any happier\nhours than those I daily spent in front of Florian's, looking across the\nGreat Square at it. Propped on its long row of low thick-legged columns,\nits back knobbed with domes, it seemed like a vast warty bug taking a\nmeditative walk.\n\nSt. Mark's is not the oldest building in the world, of course, but it\nseems the oldest, and looks the oldest--especially inside.\n\nWhen the ancient mosaics in its walls become damaged, they are repaired\nbut not altered; the grotesque old pattern is preserved. Antiquity has\na charm of its own, and to smarten it up would only damage it. One day\nI was sitting on a red marble bench in the vestibule looking up at an\nancient piece of apprentice-work, in mosaic, illustrative of the command\nto \"multiply and replenish the earth.\" The Cathedral itself had seemed\nvery old; but this picture was illustrating a period in history which\nmade the building seem young by comparison. But I presently found an\nantique which was older than either the battered Cathedral or the date\nassigned to the piece of history; it was a spiral-shaped fossil as large\nas the crown of a hat; it was embedded in the marble bench, and had\nbeen sat upon by tourists until it was worn smooth. Contrasted with the\ninconceivable antiquity of this modest fossil, those other things were\nflippantly modern--jejune--mere matters of day-before-yesterday. The\nsense of the oldness of the Cathedral vanished away under the influence\nof this truly venerable presence.\n\nSt. Mark's is monumental; it is an imperishable remembrancer of the\nprofound and simple piety of the Middle Ages. Whoever could ravish a\ncolumn from a pagan temple, did it and contributed his swag to this\nChristian one. So this fane is upheld by several hundred acquisitions\nprocured in that peculiar way. In our day it would be immoral to go on\nthe highway to get bricks for a church, but it was no sin in the old\ntimes. St. Mark's was itself the victim of a curious robbery once. The\nthing is set down in the history of Venice, but it might be smuggled\ninto the Arabian Nights and not seem out of place there:\n\nNearly four hundred and fifty years ago, a Candian named Stammato, in\nthe suite of a prince of the house of Este, was allowed to view the\nriches of St. Mark's. His sinful eye was dazzled and he hid himself\nbehind an altar, with an evil purpose in his heart, but a priest\ndiscovered him and turned him out. Afterward he got in again--by false\nkeys, this time. He went there, night after night, and worked hard and\npatiently, all alone, overcoming difficulty after difficulty with his\ntoil, and at last succeeded in removing a great brick of the marble\npaneling which walled the lower part of the treasury; this block he\nfixed so that he could take it out and put it in at will. After\nthat, for weeks, he spent all his midnights in his magnificent mine,\ninspecting it in security, gloating over its marvels at his leisure, and\nalways slipping back to his obscure lodgings before dawn, with a\nduke's ransom under his cloak. He did not need to grab, haphazard, and\nrun--there was no hurry. He could make deliberate and well-considered\nselections; he could consult his esthetic tastes. One comprehends how\nundisturbed he was, and how safe from any danger of interruption,\nwhen it is stated that he even carried off a unicorn's horn--a mere\ncuriosity--which would not pass through the egress entire, but had to\nbe sawn in two--a bit of work which cost him hours of tedious labor. He\ncontinued to store up his treasures at home until his occupation lost\nthe charm of novelty and became monotonous; then he ceased from it,\ncontented. Well he might be; for his collection, raised to modern\nvalues, represented nearly fifty million dollars!\n\n\n\nHe could have gone home much the richest citizen of his country, and\nit might have been years before the plunder was missed; but he was\nhuman--he could not enjoy his delight alone, he must have somebody to\ntalk about it with. So he exacted a solemn oath from a Candian noble\nnamed Crioni, then led him to his lodgings and nearly took his breath\naway with a sight of his glittering hoard. He detected a look in his\nfriend's face which excited his suspicion, and was about to slip a\nstiletto into him when Crioni saved himself by explaining that that look\nwas only an expression of supreme and happy astonishment. Stammato\nmade Crioni a present of one of the state's principal jewels--a huge\ncarbuncle, which afterward figured in the Ducal cap of state--and the\npair parted. Crioni went at once to the palace, denounced the criminal,\nand handed over the carbuncle as evidence. Stammato was arrested, tried,\nand condemned, with the old-time Venetian promptness. He was hanged\nbetween the two great columns in the Piazza--with a gilded rope, out of\ncompliment to his love of gold, perhaps. He got no good of his booty at\nall--it was ALL recovered.\n\nIn Venice we had a luxury which very seldom fell to our lot on the\ncontinent--a home dinner with a private family. If one could always stop\nwith private families, when traveling, Europe would have a charm which\nit now lacks. As it is, one must live in the hotels, of course, and that\nis a sorrowful business. A man accustomed to American food and American\ndomestic cookery would not starve to death suddenly in Europe; but I\nthink he would gradually waste away, and eventually die.\n\nHe would have to do without his accustomed morning meal. That is too\nformidable a change altogether; he would necessarily suffer from it. He\ncould get the shadow, the sham, the base counterfeit of that meal; but\nit would do him no good, and money could not buy the reality.\n\nTo particularize: the average American's simplest and commonest form of\nbreakfast consists of coffee and beefsteak; well, in Europe, coffee is\nan unknown beverage. You can get what the European hotel-keeper thinks\nis coffee, but it resembles the real thing as hypocrisy resembles\nholiness. It is a feeble, characterless, uninspiring sort of stuff, and\nalmost as undrinkable as if it had been made in an American hotel. The\nmilk used for it is what the French call \"Christian\" milk--milk which\nhas been baptized.\n\n\n\nAfter a few months' acquaintance with European \"coffee,\" one's mind\nweakens, and his faith with it, and he begins to wonder if the rich\nbeverage of home, with its clotted layer of yellow cream on top of it,\nis not a mere dream, after all, and a thing which never existed.\n\nNext comes the European bread--fair enough, good enough, after a\nfashion, but cold; cold and tough, and unsympathetic; and never any\nchange, never any variety--always the same tiresome thing.\n\nNext, the butter--the sham and tasteless butter; no salt in it, and made\nof goodness knows what.\n\nThen there is the beefsteak. They have it in Europe, but they don't know\nhow to cook it. Neither will they cut it right. It comes on the table in\na small, round pewter platter. It lies in the center of this platter,\nin a bordering bed of grease-soaked potatoes; it is the size, shape, and\nthickness of a man's hand with the thumb and fingers cut off. It is a\nlittle overdone, is rather dry, it tastes pretty insipidly, it rouses no\nenthusiasm.\n\nImagine a poor exile contemplating that inert thing; and imagine an\nangel suddenly sweeping down out of a better land and setting before him\na mighty porterhouse steak an inch and a half thick, hot and sputtering\nfrom the griddle; dusted with a fragrant pepper; enriched with\nlittle melting bits of butter of the most unimpeachable freshness and\ngenuineness; the precious juices of the meat trickling out and joining\nthe gravy, archipelagoed with mushrooms; a township or two of tender,\nyellowish fat gracing an outlying district of this ample county of\nbeefsteak; the long white bone which divides the sirloin from the\ntenderloin still in its place; and imagine that the angel also adds a\ngreat cup of American home-made coffee, with a cream a-froth on top,\nsome real butter, firm and yellow and fresh, some smoking hot-biscuits,\na plate of hot buckwheat cakes, with transparent syrup--could words\ndescribe the gratitude of this exile?\n\nThe European dinner is better than the European breakfast, but it has\nits faults and inferiorities; it does not satisfy. He comes to the table\neager and hungry; he swallows his soup--there is an undefinable\nlack about it somewhere; thinks the fish is going to be the thing he\nwants--eats it and isn't sure; thinks the next dish is perhaps the one\nthat will hit the hungry place--tries it, and is conscious that there\nwas a something wanting about it, also. And thus he goes on, from dish\nto dish, like a boy after a butterfly which just misses getting caught\nevery time it alights, but somehow doesn't get caught after all; and at\nthe end the exile and the boy have fared about alike; the one is full,\nbut grievously unsatisfied, the other has had plenty of exercise, plenty\nof interest, and a fine lot of hopes, but he hasn't got any butterfly.\nThere is here and there an American who will say he can remember rising\nfrom a European table d'h\u00f4te perfectly satisfied; but we must not\noverlook the fact that there is also here and there an American who will\nlie.\n\nThe number of dishes is sufficient; but then it is such a monotonous\nvariety of UNSTRIKING dishes. It is an inane dead-level of\n\"fair-to-middling.\" There is nothing to ACCENT it. Perhaps if the roast\nof mutton or of beef--a big, generous one--were brought on the table and\ncarved in full view of the client, that might give the right sense of\nearnestness and reality to the thing; but they don't do that, they pass\nthe sliced meat around on a dish, and so you are perfectly calm, it does\nnot stir you in the least. Now a vast roast turkey, stretched on the\nbroad of his back, with his heels in the air and the rich juices oozing\nfrom his fat sides ... but I may as well stop there, for they would not\nknow how to cook him. They can't even cook a chicken respectably; and as\nfor carving it, they do that with a hatchet.\n\n\n\nThis is about the customary table d'h\u00f4te bill in summer:\n\n  Soup (characterless).\n\n  Fish--sole, salmon, or whiting--usually tolerably good.\n\n  Roast--mutton or beef--tasteless--and some last year's potatoes.\n\n  A pate, or some other made dish--usually good--\"considering.\"\n\n  One vegetable--brought on in state, and all alone--usually insipid\n                      lentils, or string-beans, or indifferent asparagus.\n\n  Roast chicken, as tasteless as paper.\n\n  Lettuce-salad--tolerably good.\n\n  Decayed strawberries or cherries.\n\n  Sometimes the apricots and figs are fresh, but this is no advantage,\n                      as these fruits are of no account anyway.\n\n  The grapes are generally good, and sometimes there is a tolerably\n                      good peach, by mistake.\n\nThe variations of the above bill are trifling. After a fortnight one\ndiscovers that the variations are only apparent, not real; in the third\nweek you get what you had the first, and in the fourth the week you get\nwhat you had the second. Three or four months of this weary sameness\nwill kill the robustest appetite.\n\nIt has now been many months, at the present writing, since I have had\na nourishing meal, but I shall soon have one--a modest, private affair,\nall to myself. I have selected a few dishes, and made out a little bill\nof fare, which will go home in the steamer that precedes me, and be hot\nwhen I arrive--as follows:\n\n    Radishes.

They will find it an\nexcellent thing to get up an appetite with, in the dispiriting presence\nof the squalid table d'h\u00f4te.\n\nForeigners cannot enjoy our food, I suppose, any more than we can\nenjoy theirs. It is not strange; for tastes are made, not born. I might\nglorify my bill of fare until I was tired; but after all, the Scotchman\nwould shake his head and say, \"Where's your haggis?\" and the Fijian\nwould sigh and say, \"Where's your missionary?\"\n\nI have a neat talent in matters pertaining to nourishment. This has\nmet with professional recognition. I have often furnished recipes for\ncook-books. Here are some designs for pies and things, which I recently\nprepared for a friend's projected cook-book, but as I forgot to furnish\ndiagrams and perspectives, they had to be left out, of course.\n\nRECIPE FOR AN ASH-CAKE Take a lot of water and add to it a lot of coarse\nIndian-meal and about a quarter of a lot of salt. Mix well together,\nknead into the form of a \"pone,\" and let the pone stand awhile--not on\nits edge, but the other way. Rake away a place among the embers, lay it\nthere, and cover it an inch deep with hot ashes. When it is done, remove\nit; blow off all the ashes but one layer; butter that one and eat.\n\nN.B.--No household should ever be without this talisman. It has been\nnoticed that tramps never return for another ash-cake. ----------\n\nRECIPE FOR NEW ENGLISH PIE To make this excellent breakfast dish,\nproceed as follows: Take a sufficiency of water and a sufficiency of\nflour, and construct a bullet-proof dough. Work this into the form of\na disk, with the edges turned up some three-fourths of an inch. Toughen\nand kiln-dry in a couple days in a mild but unvarying temperature.\nConstruct a cover for this redoubt in the same way and of the same\nmaterial. Fill with stewed dried apples; aggravate with cloves,\nlemon-peel, and slabs of citron; add two portions of New Orleans sugars,\nthen solder on the lid and set in a safe place till it petrifies. Serve\ncold at breakfast and invite your enemy. ----------\n\nRECIPE FOR GERMAN COFFEE Take a barrel of water and bring it to a boil;\nrub a chicory berry against a coffee berry, then convey the former into\nthe water. Continue the boiling and evaporation until the intensity of\nthe flavor and aroma of the coffee and chicory has been diminished to\na proper degree; then set aside to cool. Now unharness the remains of a\nonce cow from the plow, insert them in a hydraulic press, and when you\nshall have acquired a teaspoon of that pale-blue juice which a German\nsuperstition regards as milk, modify the malignity of its strength in a\nbucket of tepid water and ring up the breakfast. Mix the beverage in a\ncold cup, partake with moderation, and keep a wet rag around your head\nto guard against over-excitement.\n\n\n\nTO CARVE FOWLS IN THE GERMAN FASHION Use a club, and avoid the joints.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\n[Titian Bad and Titian Good]\n\n\nI wonder why some things are? For instance, Art is allowed as much\nindecent license today as in earlier times--but the privileges of\nLiterature in this respect have been sharply curtailed within the\npast eighty or ninety years. Fielding and Smollett could portray the\nbeastliness of their day in the beastliest language; we have plenty\nof foul subjects to deal with in our day, but we are not allowed to\napproach them very near, even with nice and guarded forms of speech.\nBut not so with Art. The brush may still deal freely with any subject,\nhowever revolting or indelicate. It makes a body ooze sarcasm at every\npore, to go about Rome and Florence and see what this last generation\nhas been doing with the statues. These works, which had stood in\ninnocent nakedness for ages, are all fig-leaved now. Yes, every one of\nthem. Nobody noticed their nakedness before, perhaps; nobody can help\nnoticing it now, the fig-leaf makes it so conspicuous. But the comical\nthing about it all, is, that the fig-leaf is confined to cold and pallid\nmarble, which would be still cold and unsuggestive without this sham and\nostentatious symbol of modesty, whereas warm-blood paintings which do\nreally need it have in no case been furnished with it.\n\nAt the door of the Uffizzi, in Florence, one is confronted by statues\nof a man and a woman, noseless, battered, black with accumulated\ngrime--they hardly suggest human beings--yet these ridiculous creatures\nhave been thoughtfully and conscientiously fig-leaved by this fastidious\ngeneration. You enter, and proceed to that most-visited little gallery\nthat exists in the world--the Tribune--and there, against the wall,\nwithout obstructing rag or leaf, you may look your fill upon the\nfoulest, the vilest, the obscenest picture the world possesses--Titian's\nVenus. It isn't that she is naked and stretched out on a bed--no, it is\nthe attitude of one of her arms and hand. If I ventured to describe\nthat attitude, there would be a fine howl--but there the Venus lies, for\nanybody to gloat over that wants to--and there she has a right to lie,\nfor she is a work of art, and Art has its privileges. I saw young\ngirls stealing furtive glances at her; I saw young men gaze long and\nabsorbedly at her; I saw aged, infirm men hang upon her charms with a\npathetic interest. How I should like to describe her--just to see what\na holy indignation I could stir up in the world--just to hear the\nunreflecting average man deliver himself about my grossness and\ncoarseness, and all that. The world says that no worded description of\na moving spectacle is a hundredth part as moving as the same spectacle\nseen with one's own eyes--yet the world is willing to let its son\nand its daughter and itself look at Titian's beast, but won't stand\na description of it in words. Which shows that the world is not as\nconsistent as it might be.\n\nThere are pictures of nude women which suggest no impure thought--I\nam well aware of that. I am not railing at such. What I am trying to\nemphasize is the fact that Titian's Venus is very far from being one of\nthat sort. Without any question it was painted for a bagnio and it was\nprobably refused because it was a trifle too strong. In truth, it is too\nstrong for any place but a public Art Gallery. Titian has two Venuses in\nthe Tribune; persons who have seen them will easily remember which one I\nam referring to.\n\nIn every gallery in Europe there are hideous pictures of blood,\ncarnage, oozing brains, putrefaction--pictures portraying intolerable\nsuffering--pictures alive with every conceivable horror, wrought out in\ndreadful detail--and similar pictures are being put on the canvas every\nday and publicly exhibited--without a growl from anybody--for they\nare innocent, they are inoffensive, being works of art. But suppose\na literary artist ventured to go into a painstaking and elaborate\ndescription of one of these grisly things--the critics would skin him\nalive. Well, let it go, it cannot be helped; Art retains her privileges,\nLiterature has lost hers. Somebody else may cipher out the whys and the\nwherefores and the consistencies of it--I haven't got time.\n\nTitian's Venus defiles and disgraces the Tribune, there is no softening\nthat fact, but his \"Moses\" glorifies it. The simple truthfulness of\nits noble work wins the heart and the applause of every visitor, be he\nlearned or ignorant. After wearying one's self with the acres of stuffy,\nsappy, expressionless babies that populate the canvases of the Old\nMasters of Italy, it is refreshing to stand before this peerless child\nand feel that thrill which tells you you are at last in the presence of\nthe real thing. This is a human child, this is genuine. You have seen\nhim a thousand times--you have seen him just as he is here--and you\nconfess, without reserve, that Titian WAS a Master. The doll-faces of\nother painted babes may mean one thing, they may mean another, but\nwith the \"Moses\" the case is different. The most famous of all the\nart-critics has said, \"There is no room for doubt, here--plainly this\nchild is in trouble.\"\n\nI consider that the \"Moses\" has no equal among the works of the Old\nMasters, except it be the divine Hair Trunk of Bassano. I feel sure that\nif all the other Old Masters were lost and only these two preserved, the\nworld would be the gainer by it.\n\n\n\nMy sole purpose in going to Florence was to see this immortal \"Moses,\"\nand by good fortune I was just in time, for they were already preparing\nto remove it to a more private and better-protected place because a\nfashion of robbing the great galleries was prevailing in Europe at the\ntime.\n\nI got a capable artist to copy the picture; Pannemaker, the engraver of\nDor\u00e9's books, engraved it for me, and I have the pleasure of laying it\nbefore the reader in this volume.\n\nWe took a turn to Rome and some other Italian cities--then to Munich,\nand thence to Paris--partly for exercise, but mainly because these\nthings were in our projected program, and it was only right that we\nshould be faithful to it.\n\nFrom Paris I branched out and walked through Holland and Belgium,\nprocuring an occasional lift by rail or canal when tired, and I had\na tolerably good time of it \"by and large.\" I worked Spain and other\nregions through agents to save time and shoe-leather.\n\nWe crossed to England, and then made the homeward passage in the\nCunarder GALLIA, a very fine ship. I was glad to get home--immeasurably\nglad; so glad, in fact, that it did not seem possible that anything\ncould ever get me out of the country again. I had not enjoyed a pleasure\nabroad which seemed to me to compare with the pleasure I felt in seeing\nNew York harbor again. Europe has many advantages which we have not, but\nthey do not compensate for a good many still more valuable ones which\nexist nowhere but in our own country. Then we are such a homeless lot\nwhen we are over there! So are Europeans themselves, for that matter.\nThey live in dark and chilly vast tombs--costly enough, maybe, but\nwithout conveniences. To be condemned to live as the average European\nfamily lives would make life a pretty heavy burden to the average\nAmerican family.\n\nOn the whole, I think that short visits to Europe are better for us than\nlong ones. The former preserve us from becoming Europeanized; they keep\nour pride of country intact, and at the same time they intensify our\naffection for our country and our people; whereas long visits have the\neffect of dulling those feelings--at least in the majority of cases. I\nthink that one who mixes much with Americans long resident abroad must\narrive at this conclusion.\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX   Nothing gives such weight and dignity to a book as an Appendix.\n                --HERODOTUS\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX A.\n\nThe Portier\n\nOmar Khay'am, the poet-prophet of Persia, writing more than eight\nhundred years ago, has said:\n\n\"In the four parts of the earth are many that are able to write learned\nbooks, many that are able to lead armies, and many also that are able to\ngovern kingdoms and empires; but few there be that can keep a hotel.\"\n\nA word about the European hotel PORTIER. He is a most admirable\ninvention, a most valuable convenience. He always wears a conspicuous\nuniform; he can always be found when he is wanted, for he sticks closely\nto his post at the front door; he is as polite as a duke; he speaks\nfrom four to ten languages; he is your surest help and refuge in time of\ntrouble or perplexity. He is not the clerk, he is not the landlord; he\nranks above the clerk, and represents the landlord, who is seldom seen.\nInstead of going to the clerk for information, as we do at home, you\ngo to the portier. It is the pride of our average hotel clerk to know\nnothing whatever; it is the pride of the portier to know everything. You\nask the portier at what hours the trains leave--he tells you instantly;\nor you ask him who is the best physician in town; or what is the hack\ntariff; or how many children the mayor has; or what days the galleries\nare open, and whether a permit is required, and where you are to get it,\nand what you must pay for it; or when the theaters open and close, what\nthe plays are to be, and the price of seats; or what is the newest thing\nin hats; or how the bills of mortality average; or \"who struck Billy\nPatterson.\" It does not matter what you ask him: in nine cases out of\nten he knows, and in the tenth case he will find out for you before you\ncan turn around three times. There is nothing he will not put his hand\nto. Suppose you tell him you wish to go from Hamburg to Peking by the\nway of Jericho, and are ignorant of routes and prices--the next morning\nhe will hand you a piece of paper with the whole thing worked out on it\nto the last detail. Before you have been long on European soil, you find\nyourself still SAYING you are relying on Providence, but when you come\nto look closer you will see that in reality you are relying on the\nportier. He discovers what is puzzling you, or what is troubling you,\nor what your need is, before you can get the half of it out, and he\npromptly says, \"Leave that to me.\" Consequently, you easily drift into\nthe habit of leaving everything to him. There is a certain embarrassment\nabout applying to the average American hotel clerk, a certain hesitancy,\na sense of insecurity against rebuff; but you feel no embarrassment in\nyour intercourse with the portier; he receives your propositions with an\nenthusiasm which cheers, and plunges into their accomplishment with an\nalacrity which almost inebriates. The more requirements you can pile\nupon him, the better he likes it. Of course the result is that you cease\nfrom doing anything for yourself. He calls a hack when you want one;\nputs you into it; tells the driver whither to take you; receives you\nlike a long-lost child when you return; sends you about your business,\ndoes all the quarreling with the hackman himself, and pays him his money\nout of his own pocket. He sends for your theater tickets, and pays for\nthem; he sends for any possible article you can require, be it a doctor,\nan elephant, or a postage stamp; and when you leave, at last, you will\nfind a subordinate seated with the cab-driver who will put you in your\nrailway compartment, buy your tickets, have your baggage weighed, bring\nyou the printed tags, and tell you everything is in your bill and paid\nfor. At home you get such elaborate, excellent, and willing service as\nthis only in the best hotels of our large cities; but in Europe you get\nit in the mere back country-towns just as well.\n\nWhat is the secret of the portier's devotion? It is very simple: he gets\nFEES, AND NO SALARY. His fee is pretty closely regulated, too. If you\nstay a week, you give him five marks--a dollar and a quarter, or about\neighteen cents a day. If you stay a month, you reduce this average\nsomewhat. If you stay two or three months or longer, you cut it down\nhalf, or even more than half. If you stay only one day, you give the\nportier a mark.\n\nThe head waiter's fee is a shade less than the portier's; the Boots, who\nnot only blacks your boots and brushes your clothes, but is usually the\nporter and handles your baggage, gets a somewhat smaller fee than the\nhead waiter; the chambermaid's fee ranks below that of the Boots. You\nfee only these four, and no one else. A German gentleman told me that\nwhen he remained a week in a hotel, he gave the portier five marks, the\nhead waiter four, the Boots three, and the chambermaid two; and if he\nstayed three months he divided ninety marks among them, in about the\nabove proportions. Ninety marks make $22.50.\n\nNone of these fees are ever paid until you leave the hotel, though it\nbe a year--except one of these four servants should go away in the mean\ntime; in that case he will be sure to come and bid you good-by and\ngive you the opportunity to pay him what is fairly coming to him. It\nis considered very bad policy to fee a servant while you are still to\nremain longer in the hotel, because if you gave him too little he might\nneglect you afterward, and if you gave him too much he might neglect\nsomebody else to attend to you. It is considered best to keep his\nexpectations \"on a string\" until your stay is concluded.\n\nI do not know whether hotel servants in New York get any wages or not,\nbut I do know that in some of the hotels there the feeing system in\nvogue is a heavy burden. The waiter expects a quarter at breakfast--and\ngets it. You have a different waiter at luncheon, and so he gets a\nquarter. Your waiter at dinner is another stranger--consequently he gets\na quarter. The boy who carries your satchel to your room and lights your\ngas fumbles around and hangs around significantly, and you fee him to\nget rid of him. Now you may ring for ice-water; and ten minutes later\nfor a lemonade; and ten minutes afterward, for a cigar; and by and by\nfor a newspaper--and what is the result? Why, a new boy has appeared\nevery time and fooled and fumbled around until you have paid him\nsomething. Suppose you boldly put your foot down, and say it is the\nhotel's business to pay its servants? You will have to ring your bell\nten or fifteen times before you get a servant there; and when he goes\noff to fill your order you will grow old and infirm before you see him\nagain. You may struggle nobly for twenty-four hours, maybe, if you are\nan adamantine sort of person, but in the mean time you will have been\nso wretchedly served, and so insolently, that you will haul down your\ncolors, and go to impoverishing yourself with fees.\n\n\n\nIt seems to me that it would be a happy idea to import the European\nfeeing system into America. I believe it would result in getting even\nthe bells of the Philadelphia hotels answered, and cheerful service\nrendered.\n\nThe greatest American hotels keep a number of clerks and a cashier, and\npay them salaries which mount up to a considerable total in the course\nof a year. The great continental hotels keep a cashier on a trifling\nsalary, and a portier WHO PAYS THE HOTEL A SALARY. By the latter system\nboth the hotel and the public save money and are better served than by\nour system. One of our consuls told me that a portier of a great Berlin\nhotel paid five thousand dollars a year for his position, and yet\ncleared six thousand dollars for himself. The position of portier in the\nchief hotels of Saratoga, Long Branch, New York, and similar centers of\nresort, would be one which the holder could afford to pay even more than\nfive thousand dollars for, perhaps.\n\nWhen we borrowed the feeing fashion from Europe a dozen years ago, the\nsalary system ought to have been discontinued, of course. We might make\nthis correction now, I should think. And we might add the portier, too.\nSince I first began to study the portier, I have had opportunities to\nobserve him in the chief cities of Germany, Switzerland, and Italy;\nand the more I have seen of him the more I have wished that he might be\nadopted in America, and become there, as he is in Europe, the stranger's\nguardian angel.\n\nYes, what was true eight hundred years ago, is just as true today: \"Few\nthere be that can keep a hotel.\" Perhaps it is because the landlords and\ntheir subordinates have in too many cases taken up their trade without\nfirst learning it. In Europe the trade of hotel-keeper is taught. The\napprentice begins at the bottom of the ladder and masters the several\ngrades one after the other. Just as in our country printing-offices the\napprentice first learns how to sweep out and bring water; then learns\nto \"roll\"; then to sort \"pi\"; then to set type; and finally rounds\nand completes his education with job-work and press-work; so the\nlandlord-apprentice serves as call-boy; then as under-waiter; then as\na parlor waiter; then as head waiter, in which position he often has to\nmake out all the bills; then as clerk or cashier; then as portier. His\ntrade is learned now, and by and by he will assume the style and dignity\nof landlord, and be found conducting a hotel of his own.\n\nNow in Europe, the same as in America, when a man has kept a hotel\nso thoroughly well during a number of years as to give it a great\nreputation, he has his reward. He can live prosperously on that\nreputation. He can let his hotel run down to the last degree of\nshabbiness and yet have it full of people all the time. For instance,\nthere is the Hotel de Ville, in Milan. It swarms with mice and fleas,\nand if the rest of the world were destroyed it could furnish dirt enough\nto start another one with. The food would create an insurrection in a\npoorhouse; and yet if you go outside to get your meals that hotel makes\nup its loss by overcharging you on all sorts of trifles--and without\nmaking any denials or excuses about it, either. But the Hotel de Ville's\nold excellent reputation still keeps its dreary rooms crowded with\ntravelers who would be elsewhere if they had only some wise friend to\nwarn them.\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX B.\n\nHeidelberg Castle Heidelberg Castle must have been very beautiful before\nthe French battered and bruised and scorched it two hundred years ago.\nThe stone is brown, with a pinkish tint, and does not seem to stain\neasily. The dainty and elaborate ornamentation upon its two chief fronts\nis as delicately carved as if it had been intended for the interior of\na drawing-room rather than for the outside of a house. Many fruit and\nflower clusters, human heads and grim projecting lions' heads are still\nas perfect in every detail as if they were new. But the statues which\nare ranked between the windows have suffered. These are life-size\nstatues of old-time emperors, electors, and similar grandees, clad in\nmail and bearing ponderous swords. Some have lost an arm, some a head,\nand one poor fellow is chopped off at the middle. There is a saying that\nif a stranger will pass over the drawbridge and walk across the court to\nthe castle front without saying anything, he can make a wish and it will\nbe fulfilled. But they say that the truth of this thing has never had\na chance to be proved, for the reason that before any stranger can walk\nfrom the drawbridge to the appointed place, the beauty of the palace\nfront will extort an exclamation of delight from him.\n\nA ruin must be rightly situated, to be effective. This one could not\nhave been better placed. It stands upon a commanding elevation, it is\nburied in green woods, there is no level ground about it, but, on the\ncontrary, there are wooded terraces upon terraces, and one looks down\nthrough shining leaves into profound chasms and abysses where twilight\nreigns and the sun cannot intrude. Nature knows how to garnish a ruin to\nget the best effect. One of these old towers is split down the middle,\nand one half has tumbled aside. It tumbled in such a way as to establish\nitself in a picturesque attitude. Then all it lacked was a fitting\ndrapery, and Nature has furnished that; she has robed the rugged mass in\nflowers and verdure, and made it a charm to the eye. The standing half\nexposes its arched and cavernous rooms to you, like open, toothless\nmouths; there, too, the vines and flowers have done their work of grace.\nThe rear portion of the tower has not been neglected, either, but is\nclothed with a clinging garment of polished ivy which hides the wounds\nand stains of time. Even the top is not left bare, but is crowned with a\nflourishing group of trees and shrubs. Misfortune has done for this old\ntower what it has done for the human character sometimes--improved it.\n\nA gentleman remarked, one day, that it might have been fine to live in\nthe castle in the day of its prime, but that we had one advantage which\nits vanished inhabitants lacked--the advantage of having a charming ruin\nto visit and muse over. But that was a hasty idea. Those people had the\nadvantage of US. They had the fine castle to live in, and they could\ncross the Rhine valley and muse over the stately ruin of Trifels\nbesides. The Trifels people, in their day, five hundred years ago, could\ngo and muse over majestic ruins that have vanished, now, to the last\nstone. There have always been ruins, no doubt; and there have always\nbeen pensive people to sigh over them, and asses to scratch upon them\ntheir names and the important date of their visit. Within a hundred\nyears after Adam left Eden, the guide probably gave the usual general\nflourish with his hand and said: \"Place where the animals were named,\nladies and gentlemen; place where the tree of the forbidden fruit stood;\nexact spot where Adam and Eve first met; and here, ladies and gentlemen,\nadorned and hallowed by the names and addresses of three generations of\ntourists, we have the crumbling remains of Cain's altar--fine old ruin!\"\nThen, no doubt, he taxed them a shekel apiece and let them go.\n\nAn illumination of Heidelberg Castle is one of the sights of Europe.\nThe Castle's picturesque shape; its commanding situation, midway up the\nsteep and wooded mountainside; its vast size--these features combine to\nmake an illumination a most effective spectacle. It is necessarily an\nexpensive show, and consequently rather infrequent. Therefore whenever\none of these exhibitions is to take place, the news goes about in the\npapers and Heidelberg is sure to be full of people on that night. I and\nmy agent had one of these opportunities, and improved it.\n\nAbout half past seven on the appointed evening we crossed the lower\nbridge, with some American students, in a pouring rain, and started up\nthe road which borders the Neunheim side of the river. This roadway was\ndensely packed with carriages and foot-passengers; the former of all\nages, and the latter of all ages and both sexes. This black and solid\nmass was struggling painfully onward, through the slop, the darkness,\nand the deluge. We waded along for three-quarters of a mile, and finally\ntook up a position in an unsheltered beer-garden directly opposite\nthe Castle. We could not SEE the Castle--or anything else, for that\nmatter--but we could dimly discern the outlines of the mountain over the\nway, through the pervading blackness, and knew whereabouts the Castle\nwas located. We stood on one of the hundred benches in the garden, under\nour umbrellas; the other ninety-nine were occupied by standing men and\nwomen, and they also had umbrellas. All the region round about, and up\nand down the river-road, was a dense wilderness of humanity hidden\nunder an unbroken pavement of carriage tops and umbrellas. Thus we stood\nduring two drenching hours. No rain fell on my head, but the converging\nwhalebone points of a dozen neighboring umbrellas poured little cooling\nsteams of water down my neck, and sometimes into my ears, and thus kept\nme from getting hot and impatient. I had the rheumatism, too, and\nhad heard that this was good for it. Afterward, however, I was led to\nbelieve that the water treatment is NOT good for rheumatism. There were\neven little girls in that dreadful place. A man held one in his arms,\njust in front of me, for as much as an hour, with umbrella-drippings\nsoaking into her clothing all the time.\n\nIn the circumstances, two hours was a good while for us to have to wait,\nbut when the illumination did at last come, we felt repaid. It came\nunexpectedly, of course--things always do, that have been long looked\nand longed for. With a perfectly breath-taking suddenness several mast\nsheaves of varicolored rockets were vomited skyward out of the black\nthroats of the Castle towers, accompanied by a thundering crash of\nsound, and instantly every detail of the prodigious ruin stood revealed\nagainst the mountainside and glowing with an almost intolerable splendor\nof fire and color. For some little time the whole building was a\nblinding crimson mass, the towers continued to spout thick columns of\nrockets aloft, and overhead the sky was radiant with arrowy bolts which\nclove their way to the zenith, paused, curved gracefully downward, then\nburst into brilliant fountain-sprays of richly colored sparks. The red\nfires died slowly down, within the Castle, and presently the shell grew\nnearly black outside; the angry glare that shone out through the broken\narches and innumerable sashless windows, now, reproduced the aspect\nwhich the Castle must have borne in the old time when the French\nspoilers saw the monster bonfire which they had made there fading and\nspoiling toward extinction.\n\nWhile we still gazed and enjoyed, the ruin was suddenly enveloped in\nrolling and rumbling volumes of vaporous green fire; then in dazzling\npurple ones; then a mixture of many colors followed, then drowned the\ngreat fabric in its blended splendors. Meantime the nearest bridge had\nbeen illuminated, and from several rafts anchored in the river, meteor\nshowers of rockets, Roman candles, bombs, serpents, and Catharine wheels\nwere being discharged in wasteful profusion into the sky--a marvelous\nsight indeed to a person as little used to such spectacles as I was. For\na while the whole region about us seemed as bright as day, and yet the\nrain was falling in torrents all the time. The evening's entertainment\npresently closed, and we joined the innumerable caravan of half-drowned\nstrangers, and waded home again.\n\nThe Castle grounds are very ample and very beautiful; and as they joined\nthe Hotel grounds, with no fences to climb, but only some nobly shaded\nstone stairways to descend, we spent a part of nearly every day in\nidling through their smooth walks and leafy groves. There was an\nattractive spot among the trees where were a great many wooden tables\nand benches; and there one could sit in the shade and pretend to sip at\nhis foamy beaker of beer while he inspected the crowd. I say pretend,\nbecause I only pretended to sip, without really sipping. That is the\npolite way; but when you are ready to go, you empty the beaker at a\ndraught. There was a brass band, and it furnished excellent music every\nafternoon. Sometimes so many people came that every seat was occupied,\nevery table filled. And never a rough in the assemblage--all nicely\ndressed fathers and mothers, young gentlemen and ladies and children;\nand plenty of university students and glittering officers; with here and\nthere a gray professor, or a peaceful old lady with her knitting; and\nalways a sprinkling of gawky foreigners. Everybody had his glass of\nbeer before him, or his cup of coffee, or his bottle of wine, or his\nhot cutlet and potatoes; young ladies chatted, or fanned themselves, or\nwrought at their crocheting or embroidering; the students fed sugar to\ntheir dogs, or discussed duels, or illustrated new fencing tricks\nwith their little canes; and everywhere was comfort and enjoyment, and\neverywhere peace and good-will to men. The trees were jubilant with\nbirds, and the paths with rollicking children. One could have a seat in\nthat place and plenty of music, any afternoon, for about eight cents, or\na family ticket for the season for two dollars.\n\nFor a change, when you wanted one, you could stroll to the Castle, and\nburrow among its dungeons, or climb about its ruined towers, or visit\nits interior shows--the great Heidelberg Tun, for instance. Everybody\nhas heard of the great Heidelberg Tun, and most people have seen it, no\ndoubt. It is a wine-cask as big as a cottage, and some traditions say\nit holds eighteen thousand bottles, and other traditions say it holds\neighteen hundred million barrels. I think it likely that one of these\nstatements is a mistake, and the other is a lie. However, the mere\nmatter of capacity is a thing of no sort of consequence, since the cask\nis empty, and indeed has always been empty, history says. An empty cask\nthe size of a cathedral could excite but little emotion in me.\n\n\n\nI do not see any wisdom in building a monster cask to hoard up emptiness\nin, when you can get a better quality, outside, any day, free of\nexpense. What could this cask have been built for? The more one studies\nover that, the more uncertain and unhappy he becomes. Some historians\nsay that thirty couples, some say thirty thousand couples, can dance on\nthe head of this cask at the same time. Even this does not seem to me\nto account for the building of it. It does not even throw light on it. A\nprofound and scholarly Englishman--a specialist--who had made the great\nHeidelberg Tun his sole study for fifteen years, told me he had at last\nsatisfied himself that the ancients built it to make German cream in.\nHe said that the average German cow yielded from one to two and half\nteaspoons of milk, when she was not worked in the plow or the hay-wagon\nmore than eighteen or nineteen hours a day. This milk was very sweet and\ngood, and a beautiful transparent bluish tint; but in order to get cream\nfrom it in the most economical way, a peculiar process was necessary.\nNow he believed that the habit of the ancients was to collect several\nmilkings in a teacup, pour it into the Great Tun, fill up with water,\nand then skim off the cream from time to time as the needs of the German\nEmpire demanded.\n\nThis began to look reasonable. It certainly began to account for the\nGerman cream which I had encountered and marveled over in so many hotels\nand restaurants. But a thought struck me--\n\n\"Why did not each ancient dairyman take his own teacup of milk and his\nown cask of water, and mix them, without making a government matter of\nit?'\n\n\"Where could he get a cask large enough to contain the right proportion\nof water?\"\n\nVery true. It was plain that the Englishman had studied the matter from\nall sides. Still I thought I might catch him on one point; so I asked\nhim why the modern empire did not make the nation's cream in the\nHeidelberg Tun, instead of leaving it to rot away unused. But he\nanswered as one prepared--\n\n\"A patient and diligent examination of the modern German cream had\nsatisfied me that they do not use the Great Tun now, because they have\ngot a BIGGER one hid away somewhere. Either that is the case or they\nempty the spring milkings into the mountain torrents and then skim the\nRhine all summer.\"\n\nThere is a museum of antiquities in the Castle, and among its most\ntreasured relics are ancient manuscripts connected with German history.\nThere are hundreds of these, and their dates stretch back through many\ncenturies. One of them is a decree signed and sealed by the hand of a\nsuccessor of Charlemagne, in the year 896. A signature made by a hand\nwhich vanished out of this life near a thousand years ago, is a more\nimpressive thing than even a ruined castle. Luther's wedding-ring was\nshown me; also a fork belonging to a time anterior to our era, and an\nearly bootjack. And there was a plaster cast of the head of a man who\nwas assassinated about sixty years ago. The stab-wounds in the face\nwere duplicated with unpleasant fidelity. One or two real hairs still\nremained sticking in the eyebrows of the cast. That trifle seemed to\nalmost change the counterfeit into a corpse.\n\nThere are many aged portraits--some valuable, some worthless; some of\ngreat interest, some of none at all. I bought a couple--one a gorgeous\nduke of the olden time, and the other a comely blue-eyed damsel,\na princess, maybe. I bought them to start a portrait-gallery of my\nancestors with. I paid a dollar and a half for the duke and a half for\nthe princess. One can lay in ancestors at even cheaper rates than these,\nin Europe, if he will mouse among old picture shops and look out for\nchances.\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX C.\n\nThe College Prison It seems that the student may break a good many of\nthe public laws without having to answer to the public authorities.\nHis case must come before the University for trial and punishment. If a\npoliceman catches him in an unlawful act and proceeds to arrest him,\nthe offender proclaims that he is a student, and perhaps shows his\nmatriculation card, whereupon the officer asks for his address, then\ngoes his way, and reports the matter at headquarters. If the offense is\none over which the city has no jurisdiction, the authorities report\nthe case officially to the University, and give themselves no further\nconcern about it. The University court send for the student, listen to\nthe evidence, and pronounce judgment. The punishment usually inflicted\nis imprisonment in the University prison. As I understand it, a\nstudent's case is often tried without his being present at all.\nThen something like this happens: A constable in the service of the\nUniversity visits the lodgings of the said student, knocks, is invited\nto come in, does so, and says politely--\n\n\"If you please, I am here to conduct you to prison.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" says the student, \"I was not expecting it. What have I been\ndoing?\"\n\n\"Two weeks ago the public peace had the honor to be disturbed by you.\"\n\n\"It is true; I had forgotten it. Very well: I have been complained of,\ntried, and found guilty--is that it?\"\n\n\"Exactly. You are sentenced to two days' solitary confinement in the\nCollege prison, and I am sent to fetch you.\"\n\nSTUDENT. \"O, I can't go today.\"\n\nOFFICER. \"If you please--why?\"\n\nSTUDENT. \"Because I've got an engagement.\"\n\nOFFICER. \"Tomorrow, then, perhaps?\"\n\nSTUDENT. \"No, I am going to the opera, tomorrow.\"\n\nOFFICER. \"Could you come Friday?\"\n\nSTUDENT. (Reflectively.) \"Let me see--Friday--Friday. I don't seem to\nhave anything on hand Friday.\"\n\nOFFICER. \"Then, if you please, I will expect you on Friday.\"\n\nSTUDENT. \"All right, I'll come around Friday.\"\n\nOFFICER. \"Thank you. Good day, sir.\"\n\nSTUDENT. \"Good day.\"\n\nSo on Friday the student goes to the prison of his own accord, and is\nadmitted.\n\nIt is questionable if the world's criminal history can show a custom\nmore odd than this. Nobody knows, now, how it originated. There have\nalways been many noblemen among the students, and it is presumed that\nall students are gentlemen; in the old times it was usual to mar the\nconvenience of such folk as little as possible; perhaps this indulgent\ncustom owes its origin to this.\n\nOne day I was listening to some conversation upon this subject when an\nAmerican student said that for some time he had been under sentence\nfor a slight breach of the peace and had promised the constable that he\nwould presently find an unoccupied day and betake himself to prison. I\nasked the young gentleman to do me the kindness to go to jail as soon\nas he conveniently could, so that I might try to get in there and visit\nhim, and see what college captivity was like. He said he would appoint\nthe very first day he could spare.\n\nHis confinement was to endure twenty-four hours. He shortly chose\nhis day, and sent me word. I started immediately. When I reached the\nUniversity Place, I saw two gentlemen talking together, and, as they\nhad portfolios under their arms, I judged they were tutors or elderly\nstudents; so I asked them in English to show me the college jail. I\nhad learned to take it for granted that anybody in Germany who knows\nanything, knows English, so I had stopped afflicting people with my\nGerman. These gentlemen seemed a trifle amused--and a trifle confused,\ntoo--but one of them said he would walk around the corner with me and\nshow me the place. He asked me why I wanted to get in there, and I said\nto see a friend--and for curiosity. He doubted if I would be admitted,\nbut volunteered to put in a word or two for me with the custodian.\n\nHe rang the bell, a door opened, and we stepped into a paved way and\nthen up into a small living-room, where we were received by a hearty\nand good-natured German woman of fifty. She threw up her hands with a\nsurprised \"ACH GOTT, HERR PROFESSOR!\" and exhibited a mighty deference\nfor my new acquaintance. By the sparkle in her eye I judged she was a\ngood deal amused, too. The \"Herr Professor\" talked to her in German, and\nI understood enough of it to know that he was bringing very plausible\nreasons to bear for admitting me. They were successful. So the Herr\nProfessor received my earnest thanks and departed. The old dame got her\nkeys, took me up two or three flights of stairs, unlocked a door, and\nwe stood in the presence of the criminal. Then she went into a jolly and\neager description of all that had occurred downstairs, and what the Herr\nProfessor had said, and so forth and so on. Plainly, she regarded it as\nquite a superior joke that I had waylaid a Professor and employed him\nin so odd a service. But I wouldn't have done it if I had known he was a\nProfessor; therefore my conscience was not disturbed.\n\nNow the dame left us to ourselves. The cell was not a roomy one; still\nit was a little larger than an ordinary prison cell. It had a window\nof good size, iron-grated; a small stove; two wooden chairs; two oaken\ntables, very old and most elaborately carved with names, mottoes, faces,\narmorial bearings, etc.--the work of several generations of imprisoned\nstudents; and a narrow wooden bedstead with a villainous straw mattress,\nbut no sheets, pillows, blankets, or coverlets--for these the student\nmust furnish at his own cost if he wants them. There was no carpet, of\ncourse.\n\nThe ceiling was completely covered with names, dates, and monograms,\ndone with candle-smoke. The walls were thickly covered with pictures and\nportraits (in profile), some done with ink, some with soot, some with a\npencil, and some with red, blue, and green chalks; and whenever an inch\nor two of space had remained between the pictures, the captives had\nwritten plaintive verses, or names and dates. I do not think I was ever\nin a more elaborately frescoed apartment.\n\nAgainst the wall hung a placard containing the prison laws. I made a\nnote of one or two of these. For instance: The prisoner must pay, for\nthe \"privilege\" of entering, a sum equivalent to 20 cents of our money;\nfor the privilege of leaving, when his term had expired, 20 cents; for\nevery day spent in the prison, 12 cents; for fire and light, 12 cents a\nday. The jailer furnishes coffee, mornings, for a small sum; dinners and\nsuppers may be ordered from outside if the prisoner chooses--and he is\nallowed to pay for them, too.\n\nHere and there, on the walls, appeared the names of American students,\nand in one place the American arms and motto were displayed in colored\nchalks.\n\nWith the help of my friend I translated many of the inscriptions.\n\nSome of them were cheerful, others the reverse. I will give the reader a\nfew specimens:\n\n\"In my tenth semester (my best one), I am cast here through the\ncomplaints of others. Let those who follow me take warning.\"\n\n\"III TAGE OHNE GRUND ANGEBLICH AUS NEUGIERDE.\" Which is to say, he had a\ncuriosity to know what prison life was like; so he made a breach in some\nlaw and got three days for it. It is more than likely that he never had\nthe same curiosity again.\n\n(TRANSLATION.) \"E. Glinicke, four days for being too eager a spectator\nof a row.\"\n\n\"F. Graf Bismarck--27-29, II, '74.\" Which means that Count Bismarck, son\nof the great statesman, was a prisoner two days in 1874.\n\n\n\n(TRANSLATION.) \"R. Diergandt--for Love--4 days.\" Many people in this\nworld have caught it heavier than for the same indiscretion.\n\nThis one is terse. I translate:\n\n\"Four weeks for MISINTERPRETED GALLANTRY.\" I wish the sufferer had\nexplained a little more fully. A four-week term is a rather serious\nmatter.\n\nThere were many uncomplimentary references, on the walls, to a certain\nunpopular dignitary. One sufferer had got three days for not saluting\nhim. Another had \"here two days slept and three nights lain awake,\"\non account of this same \"Dr. K.\" In one place was a picture of Dr. K.\nhanging on a gallows.\n\nHere and there, lonesome prisoners had eased the heavy time by altering\nthe records left by predecessors. Leaving the name standing, and the\ndate and length of the captivity, they had erased the description of the\nmisdemeanor, and written in its place, in staring capitals, \"FOR THEFT!\"\nor \"FOR MURDER!\" or some other gaudy crime. In one place, all by itself,\nstood this blood-curdling word:\n\n\"Rache!\" [1]\n\n1. \"Revenge!\"\n\nThere was no name signed, and no date. It was an inscription well\ncalculated to pique curiosity. One would greatly like to know the nature\nof the wrong that had been done, and what sort of vengeance was wanted,\nand whether the prisoner ever achieved it or not. But there was no way\nof finding out these things.\n\nOccasionally, a name was followed simply by the remark, \"II days, for\ndisturbing the peace,\" and without comment upon the justice or injustice\nof the sentence.\n\nIn one place was a hilarious picture of a student of the green cap\ncorps with a bottle of champagne in each hand; and below was the legend:\n\"These make an evil fate endurable.\"\n\nThere were two prison cells, and neither had space left on walls or\nceiling for another name or portrait or picture. The inside surfaces of\nthe two doors were completely covered with CARTES DE VISITE of former\nprisoners, ingeniously let into the wood and protected from dirt and\ninjury by glass.\n\nI very much wanted one of the sorry old tables which the prisoners had\nspent so many years in ornamenting with their pocket-knives, but red\ntape was in the way. The custodian could not sell one without an\norder from a superior; and that superior would have to get it from HIS\nsuperior; and this one would have to get it from a higher one--and so on\nup and up until the faculty should sit on the matter and deliver final\njudgment. The system was right, and nobody could find fault with it; but\nit did not seem justifiable to bother so many people, so I proceeded no\nfurther. It might have cost me more than I could afford, anyway; for\none of those prison tables, which was at the time in a private museum\nin Heidelberg, was afterward sold at auction for two hundred and fifty\ndollars. It was not worth more than a dollar, or possibly a dollar and\nhalf, before the captive students began their work on it. Persons who\nsaw it at the auction said it was so curiously and wonderfully carved\nthat it was worth the money that was paid for it.\n\nAmong them many who have tasted the college prison's dreary hospitality\nwas a lively young fellow from one of the Southern states of America,\nwhose first year's experience of German university life was rather\npeculiar. The day he arrived in Heidelberg he enrolled his name on the\ncollege books, and was so elated with the fact that his dearest hope\nhad found fruition and he was actually a student of the old and renowned\nuniversity, that he set to work that very night to celebrate the event\nby a grand lark in company with some other students. In the course of\nhis lark he managed to make a wide breach in one of the university's\nmost stringent laws. Sequel: before noon, next day, he was in the\ncollege prison--booked for three months. The twelve long weeks dragged\nslowly by, and the day of deliverance came at last. A great crowd of\nsympathizing fellow-students received him with a rousing demonstration\nas he came forth, and of course there was another grand lark--in the\ncourse of which he managed to make a wide breach of the CITY'S most\nstringent laws. Sequel: before noon, next day, he was safe in the city\nlockup--booked for three months. This second tedious captivity drew to\nan end in the course of time, and again a great crowd of sympathizing\nfellow students gave him a rousing reception as he came forth; but\nhis delight in his freedom was so boundless that he could not proceed\nsoberly and calmly, but must go hopping and skipping and jumping down\nthe sleety street from sheer excess of joy. Sequel: he slipped and broke\nhis leg, and actually lay in the hospital during the next three months!\n\nWhen he at last became a free man again, he said he believed he would\nhunt up a brisker seat of learning; the Heidelberg lectures might\nbe good, but the opportunities of attending them were too rare, the\neducational process too slow; he said he had come to Europe with the\nidea that the acquirement of an education was only a matter of time,\nbut if he had averaged the Heidelberg system correctly, it was rather a\nmatter of eternity.\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX D.\n\nThe Awful German Language\n\n   A little learning makes the whole world kin.\n                 --Proverbs xxxii, 7.\n\nI went often to look at the collection of curiosities in Heidelberg\nCastle, and one day I surprised the keeper of it with my German. I spoke\nentirely in that language. He was greatly interested; and after I had\ntalked a while he said my German was very rare, possibly a \"unique\"; and\nwanted to add it to his museum.\n\nIf he had known what it had cost me to acquire my art, he would also\nhave known that it would break any collector to buy it. Harris and I had\nbeen hard at work on our German during several weeks at that time, and\nalthough we had made good progress, it had been accomplished under great\ndifficulty and annoyance, for three of our teachers had died in the mean\ntime. A person who has not studied German can form no idea of what a\nperplexing language it is.\n\nSurely there is not another language that is so slipshod and systemless,\nand so slippery and elusive to the grasp. One is washed about in it,\nhither and thither, in the most helpless way; and when at last he thinks\nhe has captured a rule which offers firm ground to take a rest on amid\nthe general rage and turmoil of the ten parts of speech, he turns over\nthe page and reads, \"Let the pupil make careful note of the following\nEXCEPTIONS.\" He runs his eye down and finds that there are more\nexceptions to the rule than instances of it. So overboard he goes again,\nto hunt for another Ararat and find another quicksand. Such has been,\nand continues to be, my experience. Every time I think I have got one\nof these four confusing \"cases\" where I am master of it, a seemingly\ninsignificant preposition intrudes itself into my sentence, clothed with\nan awful and unsuspected power, and crumbles the ground from under\nme. For instance, my book inquires after a certain bird--(it is always\ninquiring after things which are of no sort of consequence to anybody):\n\"Where is the bird?\" Now the answer to this question--according to the\nbook--is that the bird is waiting in the blacksmith shop on account of\nthe rain. Of course no bird would do that, but then you must stick to\nthe book. Very well, I begin to cipher out the German for that answer. I\nbegin at the wrong end, necessarily, for that is the German idea. I\nsay to myself, \"REGEN (rain) is masculine--or maybe it is feminine--or\npossibly neuter--it is too much trouble to look now. Therefore, it\nis either DER (the) Regen, or DIE (the) Regen, or DAS (the) Regen,\naccording to which gender it may turn out to be when I look. In the\ninterest of science, I will cipher it out on the hypothesis that it is\nmasculine. Very well--then THE rain is DER Regen, if it is simply in\nthe quiescent state of being MENTIONED, without enlargement or\ndiscussion--Nominative case; but if this rain is lying around, in a kind\nof a general way on the ground, it is then definitely located, it is\nDOING SOMETHING--that is, RESTING (which is one of the German grammar's\nideas of doing something), and this throws the rain into the Dative\ncase, and makes it DEM Regen. However, this rain is not resting, but is\ndoing something ACTIVELY,--it is falling--to interfere with the bird,\nlikely--and this indicates MOVEMENT, which has the effect of sliding it\ninto the Accusative case and changing DEM Regen into DEN Regen.\"\nHaving completed the grammatical horoscope of this matter, I answer\nup confidently and state in German that the bird is staying in the\nblacksmith shop \"wegen (on account of) DEN Regen.\" Then the teacher lets\nme softly down with the remark that whenever the word \"wegen\" drops\ninto a sentence, it ALWAYS throws that subject into the GENITIVE case,\nregardless of consequences--and therefore this bird stayed in the\nblacksmith shop \"wegen DES Regens.\"\n\nN.B.--I was informed, later, by a higher authority, that there was\nan \"exception\" which permits one to say \"wegen DEN Regen\" in certain\npeculiar and complex circumstances, but that this exception is not\nextended to anything BUT rain.\n\nThere are ten parts of speech, and they are all troublesome. An average\nsentence, in a German newspaper, is a sublime and impressive curiosity;\nit occupies a quarter of a column; it contains all the ten parts of\nspeech--not in regular order, but mixed; it is built mainly of compound\nwords constructed by the writer on the spot, and not to be found in\nany dictionary--six or seven words compacted into one, without joint\nor seam--that is, without hyphens; it treats of fourteen or fifteen\ndifferent subjects, each enclosed in a parenthesis of its own, with here\nand there extra parentheses, making pens within pens: finally, all the\nparentheses and reparentheses are massed together between a couple\nof king-parentheses, one of which is placed in the first line of the\nmajestic sentence and the other in the middle of the last line of\nit--AFTER WHICH COMES THE VERB, and you find out for the first time what\nthe man has been talking about; and after the verb--merely by way of\nornament, as far as I can make out--the writer shovels in \"HABEN SIND\nGEWESEN GEHABT HAVEN GEWORDEN SEIN,\" or words to that effect, and the\nmonument is finished. I suppose that this closing hurrah is in the\nnature of the flourish to a man's signature--not necessary, but pretty.\nGerman books are easy enough to read when you hold them before\nthe looking-glass or stand on your head--so as to reverse the\nconstruction--but I think that to learn to read and understand a German\nnewspaper is a thing which must always remain an impossibility to a\nforeigner.\n\nYet even the German books are not entirely free from attacks of the\nParenthesis distemper--though they are usually so mild as to cover only\na few lines, and therefore when you at last get down to the verb it\ncarries some meaning to your mind because you are able to remember a\ngood deal of what has gone before. Now here is a sentence from a popular\nand excellent German novel--with a slight parenthesis in it. I will make\na perfectly literal translation, and throw in the parenthesis-marks and\nsome hyphens for the assistance of the reader--though in the original\nthere are no parenthesis-marks or hyphens, and the reader is left to\nflounder through to the remote verb the best way he can:\n\n\"But when he, upon the street, the\n(in-satin-and-silk-covered-now-very-unconstrained-after-the-newest-fashioned-dressed)\ngovernment counselor's wife MET,\" etc., etc. [1]\n\n1. Wenn er aber auf der Strasse der in Sammt und Seide gehuellten\njetz sehr ungenirt nach der neusten mode gekleideten Regierungsrathin\nbegegnet.\n\nThat is from THE OLD MAMSELLE'S SECRET, by Mrs. Marlitt. And that\nsentence is constructed upon the most approved German model. You observe\nhow far that verb is from the reader's base of operations; well, in a\nGerman newspaper they put their verb away over on the next page; and\nI have heard that sometimes after stringing along the exciting\npreliminaries and parentheses for a column or two, they get in a hurry\nand have to go to press without getting to the verb at all. Of course,\nthen, the reader is left in a very exhausted and ignorant state.\n\nWe have the Parenthesis disease in our literature, too; and one may see\ncases of it every day in our books and newspapers: but with us it is the\nmark and sign of an unpracticed writer or a cloudy intellect, whereas\nwith the Germans it is doubtless the mark and sign of a practiced pen\nand of the presence of that sort of luminous intellectual fog\nwhich stands for clearness among these people. For surely it is NOT\nclearness--it necessarily can't be clearness. Even a jury would have\npenetration enough to discover that. A writer's ideas must be a good\ndeal confused, a good deal out of line and sequence, when he starts out\nto say that a man met a counselor's wife in the street, and then right\nin the midst of this so simple undertaking halts these approaching\npeople and makes them stand still until he jots down an inventory of the\nwoman's dress. That is manifestly absurd. It reminds a person of those\ndentists who secure your instant and breathless interest in a tooth by\ntaking a grip on it with the forceps, and then stand there and\ndrawl through a tedious anecdote before they give the dreaded jerk.\nParentheses in literature and dentistry are in bad taste.\n\nThe Germans have another kind of parenthesis, which they make by\nsplitting a verb in two and putting half of it at the beginning of\nan exciting chapter and the OTHER HALF at the end of it. Can any one\nconceive of anything more confusing than that? These things are called\n\"separable verbs.\" The German grammar is blistered all over with\nseparable verbs; and the wider the two portions of one of them are\nspread apart, the better the author of the crime is pleased with his\nperformance. A favorite one is REISTE AB--which means departed. Here is\nan example which I culled from a novel and reduced to English:\n\n\"The trunks being now ready, he DE- after kissing his mother and\nsisters, and once more pressing to his bosom his adored Gretchen, who,\ndressed in simple white muslin, with a single tuberose in the ample\nfolds of her rich brown hair, had tottered feebly down the stairs, still\npale from the terror and excitement of the past evening, but longing to\nlay her poor aching head yet once again upon the breast of him whom she\nloved more dearly than life itself, PARTED.\"\n\nHowever, it is not well to dwell too much on the separable verbs. One is\nsure to lose his temper early; and if he sticks to the subject, and will\nnot be warned, it will at last either soften his brain or petrify\nit. Personal pronouns and adjectives are a fruitful nuisance in this\nlanguage, and should have been left out. For instance, the same sound,\nSIE, means YOU, and it means SHE, and it means HER, and it means IT,\nand it means THEY, and it means THEM. Think of the ragged poverty of\na language which has to make one word do the work of six--and a poor\nlittle weak thing of only three letters at that. But mainly, think of\nthe exasperation of never knowing which of these meanings the speaker is\ntrying to convey. This explains why, whenever a person says SIE to me, I\ngenerally try to kill him, if a stranger.\n\nNow observe the Adjective. Here was a case where simplicity would have\nbeen an advantage; therefore, for no other reason, the inventor of this\nlanguage complicated it all he could. When we wish to speak of our \"good\nfriend or friends,\" in our enlightened tongue, we stick to the one form\nand have no trouble or hard feeling about it; but with the German\ntongue it is different. When a German gets his hands on an adjective,\nhe declines it, and keeps on declining it until the common sense is all\ndeclined out of it. It is as bad as Latin. He says, for instance:\n\nSINGULAR\n\nNominative--Mein gutER Freund, my good friend. Genitives--MeinES GutEN\nFreundES, of my good friend. Dative--MeinEM gutEN Freund, to my good\nfriend. Accusative--MeinEN gutEN Freund, my good friend.\n\nPLURAL\n\nN.--MeinE gutEN FreundE, my good friends. G.--MeinER gutEN FreundE,\nof my good friends. D.--MeinEN gutEN FreundEN, to my good friends.\nA.--MeinE gutEN FreundE, my good friends.\n\nNow let the candidate for the asylum try to memorize those variations,\nand see how soon he will be elected. One might better go without friends\nin Germany than take all this trouble about them. I have shown what a\nbother it is to decline a good (male) friend; well this is only a third\nof the work, for there is a variety of new distortions of the adjective\nto be learned when the object is feminine, and still another when the\nobject is neuter. Now there are more adjectives in this language than\nthere are black cats in Switzerland, and they must all be as\nelaborately declined as the examples above suggested.\nDifficult?--troublesome?--these words cannot describe it. I heard a\nCalifornian student in Heidelberg say, in one of his calmest moods, that\nhe would rather decline two drinks than one German adjective.\n\nThe inventor of the language seems to have taken pleasure in\ncomplicating it in every way he could think of. For instance, if one is\ncasually referring to a house, HAUS, or a horse, PFERD, or a dog, HUND,\nhe spells these words as I have indicated; but if he is referring to\nthem in the Dative case, he sticks on a foolish and unnecessary E and\nspells them HAUSE, PFERDE, HUNDE. So, as an added E often signifies the\nplural, as the S does with us, the new student is likely to go on for a\nmonth making twins out of a Dative dog before he discovers his mistake;\nand on the other hand, many a new student who could ill afford loss,\nhas bought and paid for two dogs and only got one of them, because\nhe ignorantly bought that dog in the Dative singular when he really\nsupposed he was talking plural--which left the law on the seller's side,\nof course, by the strict rules of grammar, and therefore a suit for\nrecovery could not lie.\n\nIn German, all the Nouns begin with a capital letter. Now that is a good\nidea; and a good idea, in this language, is necessarily conspicuous from\nits lonesomeness. I consider this capitalizing of nouns a good idea,\nbecause by reason of it you are almost always able to tell a noun the\nminute you see it. You fall into error occasionally, because you mistake\nthe name of a person for the name of a thing, and waste a good deal of\ntime trying to dig a meaning out of it. German names almost always do\nmean something, and this helps to deceive the student. I translated a\npassage one day, which said that \"the infuriated tigress broke loose\nand utterly ate up the unfortunate fir forest\" (Tannenwald). When I was\ngirding up my loins to doubt this, I found out that Tannenwald in this\ninstance was a man's name.\n\nEvery noun has a gender, and there is no sense or system in the\ndistribution; so the gender of each must be learned separately and by\nheart. There is no other way. To do this one has to have a memory like a\nmemorandum-book. In German, a young lady has no sex, while a turnip has.\nThink what overwrought reverence that shows for the turnip, and what\ncallous disrespect for the girl. See how it looks in print--I translate\nthis from a conversation in one of the best of the German Sunday-school\nbooks:\n\n\"Gretchen. Wilhelm, where is the turnip?\n\n\"Wilhelm. She has gone to the kitchen.\n\n\"Gretchen. Where is the accomplished and beautiful English maiden?\n\n\"Wilhelm. It has gone to the opera.\"\n\nTo continue with the German genders: a tree is male, its buds are\nfemale, its leaves are neuter; horses are sexless, dogs are male, cats\nare female--tomcats included, of course; a person's mouth, neck, bosom,\nelbows, fingers, nails, feet, and body are of the male sex, and his head\nis male or neuter according to the word selected to signify it, and NOT\naccording to the sex of the individual who wears it--for in Germany all\nthe women wear either male heads or sexless ones; a person's nose, lips,\nshoulders, breast, hands, and toes are of the female sex; and his hair,\nears, eyes, chin, legs, knees, heart, and conscience haven't any sex\nat all. The inventor of the language probably got what he knew about a\nconscience from hearsay.\n\nNow, by the above dissection, the reader will see that in Germany a\nman may THINK he is a man, but when he comes to look into the matter\nclosely, he is bound to have his doubts; he finds that in sober truth\nhe is a most ridiculous mixture; and if he ends by trying to comfort\nhimself with the thought that he can at least depend on a third of this\nmess as being manly and masculine, the humiliating second thought will\nquickly remind him that in this respect he is no better off than any\nwoman or cow in the land.\n\nIn the German it is true that by some oversight of the inventor of\nthe language, a Woman is a female; but a Wife (Weib) is not--which is\nunfortunate. A Wife, here, has no sex; she is neuter; so, according\nto the grammar, a fish is HE, his scales are SHE, but a fishwife is\nneither. To describe a wife as sexless may be called under-description;\nthat is bad enough, but over-description is surely worse. A German\nspeaks of an Englishman as the ENGL\u00c4NNDER; to change the sex, he\nadds INN, and that stands for Englishwoman--ENGL\u00c4NDERINN. That seems\ndescriptive enough, but still it is not exact enough for a German; so he\nprecedes the word with that article which indicates that the creature to\nfollow is feminine, and writes it down thus: \"die Engl\u00e4nderinn,\"--which\nmeans \"the she-Englishwoman.\" I consider that that person is\nover-described.\n\nWell, after the student has learned the sex of a great number of nouns,\nhe is still in a difficulty, because he finds it impossible to persuade\nhis tongue to refer to things as \"he\" and \"she,\" and \"him\" and \"her,\"\nwhich it has been always accustomed to refer to as \"it.\" When he even\nframes a German sentence in his mind, with the hims and hers in the\nright places, and then works up his courage to the utterance-point, it\nis no use--the moment he begins to speak his tongue flies the track and\nall those labored males and females come out as \"its.\" And even when he\nis reading German to himself, he always calls those things \"it,\" whereas\nhe ought to read in this way:\n\nTALE OF THE FISHWIFE AND ITS SAD FATE [2]\n\n2. I capitalize the nouns, in the German (and ancient English) fashion.\n\nIt is a bleak Day. Hear the Rain, how he pours, and the Hail, how he\nrattles; and see the Snow, how he drifts along, and of the Mud, how\ndeep he is! Ah the poor Fishwife, it is stuck fast in the Mire; it has\ndropped its Basket of Fishes; and its Hands have been cut by the Scales\nas it seized some of the falling Creatures; and one Scale has even got\ninto its Eye, and it cannot get her out. It opens its Mouth to cry\nfor Help; but if any Sound comes out of him, alas he is drowned by the\nraging of the Storm. And now a Tomcat has got one of the Fishes and she\nwill surely escape with him. No, she bites off a Fin, she holds her in\nher Mouth--will she swallow her? No, the Fishwife's brave Mother-dog\ndeserts his Puppies and rescues the Fin--which he eats, himself, as his\nReward. O, horror, the Lightning has struck the Fish-basket; he sets him\non Fire; see the Flame, how she licks the doomed Utensil with her red\nand angry Tongue; now she attacks the helpless Fishwife's Foot--she\nburns him up, all but the big Toe, and even SHE is partly consumed; and\nstill she spreads, still she waves her fiery Tongues; she attacks the\nFishwife's Leg and destroys IT; she attacks its Hand and destroys HER\nalso; she attacks the Fishwife's Leg and destroys HER also; she attacks\nits Body and consumes HIM; she wreathes herself about its Heart and IT\nis consumed; next about its Breast, and in a Moment SHE is a Cinder; now\nshe reaches its Neck--He goes; now its Chin--IT goes; now its Nose--SHE\ngoes. In another Moment, except Help come, the Fishwife will be no more.\nTime presses--is there none to succor and save? Yes! Joy, joy,\nwith flying Feet the she-Englishwoman comes! But alas, the generous\nshe-Female is too late: where now is the fated Fishwife? It has ceased\nfrom its Sufferings, it has gone to a better Land; all that is left of\nit for its loved Ones to lament over, is this poor smoldering Ash-heap.\nAh, woeful, woeful Ash-heap! Let us take him up tenderly, reverently,\nupon the lowly Shovel, and bear him to his long Rest, with the Prayer\nthat when he rises again it will be a Realm where he will have one good\nsquare responsible Sex, and have it all to himself, instead of having a\nmangy lot of assorted Sexes scattered all over him in Spots.\n\nThere, now, the reader can see for himself that this pronoun business is\na very awkward thing for the unaccustomed tongue. I suppose that in all\nlanguages the similarities of look and sound between words which have\nno similarity in meaning are a fruitful source of perplexity to the\nforeigner. It is so in our tongue, and it is notably the case in the\nGerman. Now there is that troublesome word VERM\u00c4HLT: to me it has so\nclose a resemblance--either real or fancied--to three or four other\nwords, that I never know whether it means despised, painted, suspected,\nor married; until I look in the dictionary, and then I find it means the\nlatter. There are lots of such words and they are a great torment. To\nincrease the difficulty there are words which SEEM to resemble each\nother, and yet do not; but they make just as much trouble as if they\ndid. For instance, there is the word VERMIETHEN (to let, to lease, to\nhire); and the word VERHEIRATHEN (another way of saying to marry). I\nheard of an Englishman who knocked at a man's door in Heidelberg and\nproposed, in the best German he could command, to \"verheirathen\" that\nhouse. Then there are some words which mean one thing when you emphasize\nthe first syllable, but mean something very different if you throw the\nemphasis on the last syllable. For instance, there is a word which\nmeans a runaway, or the act of glancing through a book, according to the\nplacing of the emphasis; and another word which signifies to\nASSOCIATE with a man, or to AVOID him, according to where you put the\nemphasis--and you can generally depend on putting it in the wrong place\nand getting into trouble.\n\nThere are some exceedingly useful words in this language. SCHLAG, for\nexample; and ZUG. There are three-quarters of a column of SCHLAGS in the\ndictonary, and a column and a half of ZUGS. The word SCHLAG means Blow,\nStroke, Dash, Hit, Shock, Clap, Slap, Time, Bar, Coin, Stamp,\nKind, Sort, Manner, Way, Apoplexy, Wood-cutting, Enclosure, Field,\nForest-clearing. This is its simple and EXACT meaning--that is to say,\nits restricted, its fettered meaning; but there are ways by which\nyou can set it free, so that it can soar away, as on the wings of the\nmorning, and never be at rest. You can hang any word you please to\nits tail, and make it mean anything you want to. You can begin\nwith SCHLAG-ADER, which means artery, and you can hang on the whole\ndictionary, word by word, clear through the alphabet to SCHLAG-WASSER,\nwhich means bilge-water--and including SCHLAG-MUTTER, which means\nmother-in-law.\n\nJust the same with ZUG. Strictly speaking, ZUG means Pull, Tug, Draught,\nProcession, March, Progress, Flight, Direction, Expedition, Train,\nCaravan, Passage, Stroke, Touch, Line, Flourish, Trait of Character,\nFeature, Lineament, Chess-move, Organ-stop, Team, Whiff, Bias, Drawer,\nPropensity, Inhalation, Disposition: but that thing which it does NOT\nmean--when all its legitimate pennants have been hung on, has not been\ndiscovered yet.\n\nOne cannot overestimate the usefulness of SCHLAG and ZUG. Armed just\nwith these two, and the word ALSO, what cannot the foreigner on German\nsoil accomplish? The German word ALSO is the equivalent of the English\nphrase \"You know,\" and does not mean anything at all--in TALK, though\nit sometimes does in print. Every time a German opens his mouth an\nALSO falls out; and every time he shuts it he bites one in two that was\ntrying to GET out.\n\nNow, the foreigner, equipped with these three noble words, is master of\nthe situation. Let him talk right along, fearlessly; let him pour his\nindifferent German forth, and when he lacks for a word, let him heave a\nSCHLAG into the vacuum; all the chances are that it fits it like a\nplug, but if it doesn't let him promptly heave a ZUG after it; the two\ntogether can hardly fail to bung the hole; but if, by a miracle, they\nSHOULD fail, let him simply say ALSO! and this will give him a moment's\nchance to think of the needful word. In Germany, when you load your\nconversational gun it is always best to throw in a SCHLAG or two and a\nZUG or two, because it doesn't make any difference how much the rest of\nthe charge may scatter, you are bound to bag something with THEM. Then\nyou blandly say ALSO, and load up again. Nothing gives such an air\nof grace and elegance and unconstraint to a German or an English\nconversation as to scatter it full of \"Also's\" or \"You knows.\"\n\nIn my note-book I find this entry:\n\nJuly 1.--In the hospital yesterday, a word of thirteen syllables was\nsuccessfully removed from a patient--a North German from near Hamburg;\nbut as most unfortunately the surgeons had opened him in the wrong\nplace, under the impression that he contained a panorama, he died. The\nsad event has cast a gloom over the whole community.\n\nThat paragraph furnishes a text for a few remarks about one of the most\ncurious and notable features of my subject--the length of German words.\nSome German words are so long that they have a perspective. Observe\nthese examples:\n\nFreundschaftsbezeigungen.\n\nDilettantenaufdringlichkeiten.\n\nStadtverordnetenversammlungen.\n\nThese things are not words, they are alphabetical processions. And they\nare not rare; one can open a German newspaper at any time and see them\nmarching majestically across the page--and if he has any imagination\nhe can see the banners and hear the music, too. They impart a martial\nthrill to the meekest subject. I take a great interest in these\ncuriosities. Whenever I come across a good one, I stuff it and put it in\nmy museum. In this way I have made quite a valuable collection. When I\nget duplicates, I exchange with other collectors, and thus increase the\nvariety of my stock. Here are some specimens which I lately bought at an\nauction sale of the effects of a bankrupt bric-a-brac hunter:\n\nGeneralstaatsverordnetenversammlungen.\n\nAlterthumswissenschaften.\n\nKinderbewahrungsanstalten.\n\nUnabh\u00e4ngigkeitserkl\u00e4rungen.\n\nWiedererstellungbestrebungen.\n\nWaffenstillstandsunterhandlungen.\n\n\n\nOf course when one of these grand mountain ranges goes stretching across\nthe printed page, it adorns and ennobles that literary landscape--but at\nthe same time it is a great distress to the new student, for it blocks\nup his way; he cannot crawl under it, or climb over it, or tunnel\nthrough it. So he resorts to the dictionary for help, but there is no\nhelp there. The dictionary must draw the line somewhere--so it leaves\nthis sort of words out. And it is right, because these long things are\nhardly legitimate words, but are rather combinations of words, and the\ninventor of them ought to have been killed. They are compound words with\nthe hyphens left out. The various words used in building them are in\nthe dictionary, but in a very scattered condition; so you can hunt the\nmaterials out, one by one, and get at the meaning at last, but it is a\ntedious and harassing business. I have tried this process upon some of\nthe above examples. \"Freundshaftsbezeigungen\" seems to be \"Friendship\ndemonstrations,\" which is only a foolish and clumsy way of saying\n\"demonstrations of friendship.\" \"Unabh\u00e4ngigkeitserkl\u00e4rungen\" seems to be\n\"Independencedeclarations,\" which is no improvement upon\n\"Declarations of Independence,\" so far as I can see.\n\"Generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen\" seems to be\n\"General-statesrepresentativesmeetings,\" as nearly as I can get at it--a\nmere rhythmical, gushy euphemism for \"meetings of the legislature,\"\nI judge. We used to have a good deal of this sort of crime in our\nliterature, but it has gone out now. We used to speak of a thing as a\n\"never-to-be-forgotten\" circumstance, instead of cramping it into the\nsimple and sufficient word \"memorable\" and then going calmly about our\nbusiness as if nothing had happened. In those days we were not content\nto embalm the thing and bury it decently, we wanted to build a monument\nover it.\n\nBut in our newspapers the compounding-disease lingers a little to the\npresent day, but with the hyphens left out, in the German fashion. This\nis the shape it takes: instead of saying \"Mr. Simmons, clerk of the\ncounty and district courts, was in town yesterday,\" the new form puts\nit thus: \"Clerk of the County and District Courts Simmons was in town\nyesterday.\" This saves neither time nor ink, and has an awkward\nsound besides. One often sees a remark like this in our papers: \"MRS.\nAssistant District Attorney Johnson returned to her city residence\nyesterday for the season.\" That is a case of really unjustifiable\ncompounding; because it not only saves no time or trouble, but confers\na title on Mrs. Johnson which she has no right to. But these little\ninstances are trifles indeed, contrasted with the ponderous and dismal\nGerman system of piling jumbled compounds together. I wish to submit the\nfollowing local item, from a Mannheim journal, by way of illustration:\n\n\"In the daybeforeyesterdayshortlyaftereleveno'clock Night, the\ninthistownstandingtavern called 'The Wagoner' was downburnt. When the\nfire to the onthedownburninghouseresting Stork's Nest reached, flew the\nparent Storks away. But when the bytheraging, firesurrounded Nest ITSELF\ncaught Fire, straightway plunged the quickreturning Mother-Stork into\nthe Flames and died, her Wings over her young ones outspread.\"\n\nEven the cumbersome German construction is not able to take the pathos\nout of that picture--indeed, it somehow seems to strengthen it. This\nitem is dated away back yonder months ago. I could have used it sooner,\nbut I was waiting to hear from the Father-stork. I am still waiting.\n\n\"ALSO!\" If I had not shown that the German is a difficult language, I\nhave at least intended to do so. I have heard of an American student\nwho was asked how he was getting along with his German, and who answered\npromptly: \"I am not getting along at all. I have worked at it hard for\nthree level months, and all I have got to show for it is one solitary\nGerman phrase--'ZWEI GLAS'\" (two glasses of beer). He paused for a\nmoment, reflectively; then added with feeling: \"But I've got that\nSOLID!\"\n\nAnd if I have not also shown that German is a harassing and infuriating\nstudy, my execution has been at fault, and not my intent. I heard lately\nof a worn and sorely tried American student who used to fly to a certain\nGerman word for relief when he could bear up under his aggravations no\nlonger--the only word whose sound was sweet and precious to his ear and\nhealing to his lacerated spirit. This was the word DAMIT. It was only\nthe SOUND that helped him, not the meaning; [3] and so, at last, when he\nlearned that the emphasis was not on the first syllable, his only stay\nand support was gone, and he faded away and died.\n\n3. It merely means, in its general sense, \"herewith.\"\n\nI think that a description of any loud, stirring, tumultuous episode\nmust be tamer in German than in English. Our descriptive words of this\ncharacter have such a deep, strong, resonant sound, while their German\nequivalents do seem so thin and mild and energyless. Boom, burst, crash,\nroar, storm, bellow, blow, thunder, explosion; howl, cry, shout, yell,\ngroan; battle, hell. These are magnificent words; the have a force and\nmagnitude of sound befitting the things which they describe. But their\nGerman equivalents would be ever so nice to sing the children to sleep\nwith, or else my awe-inspiring ears were made for display and not for\nsuperior usefulness in analyzing sounds. Would any man want to die in a\nbattle which was called by so tame a term as a SCHLACHT? Or would not\na comsumptive feel too much bundled up, who was about to go out, in\na shirt-collar and a seal-ring, into a storm which the bird-song word\nGEWITTER was employed to describe? And observe the strongest of the\nseveral German equivalents for explosion--AUSBRUCH. Our word Toothbrush\nis more powerful than that. It seems to me that the Germans could\ndo worse than import it into their language to describe particularly\ntremendous explosions with. The German word for hell--Hoelle--sounds\nmore like HELLY than anything else; therefore, how necessarily chipper,\nfrivolous, and unimpressive it is. If a man were told in German to go\nthere, could he really rise to thee dignity of feeling insulted?\n\nHaving pointed out, in detail, the several vices of this language, I\nnow come to the brief and pleasant task of pointing out its virtues. The\ncapitalizing of the nouns I have already mentioned. But far before this\nvirtue stands another--that of spelling a word according to the sound of\nit. After one short lesson in the alphabet, the student can tell how any\nGerman word is pronounced without having to ask; whereas in our language\nif a student should inquire of us, \"What does B, O, W, spell?\" we should\nbe obliged to reply, \"Nobody can tell what it spells when you set if off\nby itself; you can only tell by referring to the context and finding out\nwhat it signifies--whether it is a thing to shoot arrows with, or a nod\nof one's head, or the forward end of a boat.\"\n\nThere are some German words which are singularly and powerfully\neffective. For instance, those which describe lowly, peaceful, and\naffectionate home life; those which deal with love, in any and all\nforms, from mere kindly feeling and honest good will toward the passing\nstranger, clear up to courtship; those which deal with outdoor Nature,\nin its softest and loveliest aspects--with meadows and forests, and\nbirds and flowers, the fragrance and sunshine of summer, and the\nmoonlight of peaceful winter nights; in a word, those which deal with\nany and all forms of rest, repose, and peace; those also which deal with\nthe creatures and marvels of fairyland; and lastly and chiefly, in\nthose words which express pathos, is the language surpassingly rich\nand affective. There are German songs which can make a stranger to the\nlanguage cry. That shows that the SOUND of the words is correct--it\ninterprets the meanings with truth and with exactness; and so the ear is\ninformed, and through the ear, the heart.\n\nThe Germans do not seem to be afraid to repeat a word when it is the\nright one. They repeat it several times, if they choose. That is\nwise. But in English, when we have used a word a couple of times in a\nparagraph, we imagine we are growing tautological, and so we are weak\nenough to exchange it for some other word which only approximates\nexactness, to escape what we wrongly fancy is a greater blemish.\nRepetition may be bad, but surely inexactness is worse.\n\n\nThere are people in the world who will take a great deal of trouble to\npoint out the faults in a religion or a language, and then go blandly\nabout their business without suggesting any remedy. I am not that kind\nof person. I have shown that the German language needs reforming. Very\nwell, I am ready to reform it. At least I am ready to make the proper\nsuggestions. Such a course as this might be immodest in another; but I\nhave devoted upward of nine full weeks, first and last, to a careful and\ncritical study of this tongue, and thus have acquired a confidence in\nmy ability to reform it which no mere superficial culture could have\nconferred upon me.\n\nIn the first place, I would leave out the Dative case. It confuses the\nplurals; and, besides, nobody ever knows when he is in the Dative case,\nexcept he discover it by accident--and then he does not know when or\nwhere it was that he got into it, or how long he has been in it, or\nhow he is ever going to get out of it again. The Dative case is but an\nornamental folly--it is better to discard it.\n\nIn the next place, I would move the Verb further up to the front. You\nmay load up with ever so good a Verb, but I notice that you never really\nbring down a subject with it at the present German range--you only\ncripple it. So I insist that this important part of speech should be\nbrought forward to a position where it may be easily seen with the naked\neye.\n\nThirdly, I would import some strong words from the English tongue--to\nswear with, and also to use in describing all sorts of vigorous things\nin a vigorous way. [4]\n\n1. \"Verdammt,\" and its variations and enlargements, are words which\nhave plenty of meaning, but the SOUNDS are so mild and ineffectual that\nGerman ladies can use them without sin. German ladies who could not be\ninduced to commit a sin by any persuasion or compulsion, promptly rip\nout one of these harmless little words when they tear their dresses or\ndon't like the soup. It sounds about as wicked as our \"My gracious.\"\nGerman ladies are constantly saying, \"Ach! Gott!\" \"Mein Gott!\" \"Gott in\nHimmel!\" \"Herr Gott\" \"Der Herr Jesus!\" etc. They think our ladies have\nthe same custom, perhaps; for I once heard a gentle and lovely old\nGerman lady say to a sweet young American girl: \"The two languages are\nso alike--how pleasant that is; we say 'Ach! Gott!' you say 'Goddamn.'\"\n\nFourthly, I would reorganizes the sexes, and distribute them accordingly\nto the will of the creator. This as a tribute of respect, if nothing\nelse.\n\nFifthly, I would do away with those great long compounded words; or\nrequire the speaker to deliver them in sections, with intermissions for\nrefreshments. To wholly do away with them would be best, for ideas are\nmore easily received and digested when they come one at a time than when\nthey come in bulk. Intellectual food is like any other; it is pleasanter\nand more beneficial to take it with a spoon than with a shovel.\n\nSixthly, I would require a speaker to stop when he is done, and not\nhang a string of those useless \"haven sind gewesen gehabt haben geworden\nseins\" to the end of his oration. This sort of gewgaws undignify a\nspeech, instead of adding a grace. They are, therefore, an offense, and\nshould be discarded.\n\nSeventhly, I would discard the Parenthesis. Also the reparenthesis, the\nre-reparenthesis, and the re-re-re-re-re-reparentheses, and likewise\nthe final wide-reaching all-enclosing king-parenthesis. I would require\nevery individual, be he high or low, to unfold a plain straightforward\ntale, or else coil it and sit on it and hold his peace. Infractions of\nthis law should be punishable with death.\n\nAnd eighthly, and last, I would retain ZUG and SCHLAG, with their\npendants, and discard the rest of the vocabulary. This would simplify\nthe language.\n\nI have now named what I regard as the most necessary and important\nchanges. These are perhaps all I could be expected to name for nothing;\nbut there are other suggestions which I can and will make in case my\nproposed application shall result in my being formally employed by the\ngovernment in the work of reforming the language.\n\nMy philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to\nlearn English (barring spelling and pronouncing) in thirty hours, French\nin thirty days, and German in thirty years. It seems manifest, then,\nthat the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired. If it is\nto remain as it is, it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among\nthe dead languages, for only the dead have time to learn it.\n\nA FOURTH OF JULY ORATION IN THE GERMAN TONGUE, DELIVERED AT A BANQUET OF\nTHE ANGLO-AMERICAN CLUB OF STUDENTS BY THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK\n\nGentlemen: Since I arrived, a month ago, in this old wonderland, this\nvast garden of Germany, my English tongue has so often proved a useless\npiece of baggage to me, and so troublesome to carry around, in a country\nwhere they haven't the checking system for luggage, that I finally set\nto work, and learned the German language. Also! Es freut mich dass dies\nso ist, denn es muss, in ein haupts\u00e4chlich degree, h\u00f6flich sein, dass\nman auf ein occasion like this, sein Rede in die Sprache des Landes\nworin he boards, aussprechen soll. Dafuer habe ich, aus reinische\nVerlegenheit--no, Vergangenheit--no, I mean H\u00f6flichkeit--aus reinishe\nH\u00f6flichkeit habe ich resolved to tackle this business in the German\nlanguage, um Gottes willen! Also! Sie muessen so freundlich sein, und\nverzeih mich die interlarding von ein oder zwei Englischer Worte, hie\nund da, denn ich finde dass die deutsche is not a very copious language,\nand so when you've really got anything to say, you've got to draw on a\nlanguage that can stand the strain.\n\nWenn haber man kann nicht meinem Rede Verstehen, so werde ich ihm sp\u00e4ter\ndasselbe uebersetz, wenn er solche Dienst verlangen wollen haben werden\nsollen sein h\u00e4tte. (I don't know what wollen haben werden sollen sein\nh\u00e4tte means, but I notice they always put it at the end of a German\nsentence--merely for general literary gorgeousness, I suppose.)\n\nThis is a great and justly honored day--a day which is worthy of the\nveneration in which it is held by the true patriots of all climes and\nnationalities--a day which offers a fruitful theme for thought and\nspeech; und meinem Freunde--no, meinEN FreundEN--meinES FreundES--well,\ntake your choice, they're all the same price; I don't know which one is\nright--also! ich habe gehabt haben worden gewesen sein, as Goethe says\nin his Paradise Lost--ich--ich--that is to say--ich--but let us change\ncars.\n\nAlso!

May this good-fellowship endure;\nmay these banners here blended in amity so remain; may they never\nany more wave over opposing hosts, or be stained with blood which was\nkindred, is kindred, and always will be kindred, until a line drawn upon\na map shall be able to say: \"THIS bars the ancestral blood from flowing\nin the veins of the descendant!\"\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX E.\n\nLegend of the Castles Called the \"Swallow's Nest\" and \"The Brothers,\" as\nCondensed from the Captain's Tale\n\nIn the neighborhood of three hundred years ago the Swallow's Nest and\nthe larger castle between it and Neckarsteinach were owned and occupied\nby two old knights who were twin brothers, and bachelors. They had no\nrelatives. They were very rich. They had fought through the wars and\nretired to private life--covered with honorable scars. They were honest,\nhonorable men in their dealings, but the people had given them a couple\nof nicknames which were very suggestive--Herr Givenaught and Herr\nHeartless. The old knights were so proud of these names that if a\nburgher called them by their right ones they would correct them.\n\nThe most renowned scholar in Europe, at the time, was the Herr Doctor\nFranz Reikmann, who lived in Heidelberg. All Germany was proud of the\nvenerable scholar, who lived in the simplest way, for great scholars are\nalways poor. He was poor, as to money, but very rich in his sweet young\ndaughter Hildegarde and his library. He had been all his life collecting\nhis library, book and book, and he lived it as a miser loves his hoarded\ngold. He said the two strings of his heart were rooted, the one in his\ndaughter, the other in his books; and that if either were severed he\nmust die. Now in an evil hour, hoping to win a marriage portion for his\nchild, this simple old man had intrusted his small savings to a sharper\nto be ventured in a glittering speculation. But that was not the worst\nof it: he signed a paper--without reading it. That is the way with poets\nand scholars; they always sign without reading. This cunning paper made\nhim responsible for heaps of things. The rest was that one night he\nfound himself in debt to the sharper eight thousand pieces of gold!--an\namount so prodigious that it simply stupefied him to think of it. It was\na night of woe in that house.\n\n\"I must part with my library--I have nothing else. So perishes one\nheartstring,\" said the old man.\n\n\"What will it bring, father?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"Nothing! It is worth seven hundred pieces of gold; but by auction it\nwill go for little or nothing.\"\n\n\"Then you will have parted with the half of your heart and the joy of\nyour life to no purpose, since so mighty a burden of debt will remain\nbehind.\"\n\n\"There is no help for it, my child. Our darlings must pass under the\nhammer. We must pay what we can.\"\n\n\"My father, I have a feeling that the dear Virgin will come to our help.\nLet us not lose heart.\"\n\n\"She cannot devise a miracle that will turn NOTHING into eight thousand\ngold pieces, and lesser help will bring us little peace.\"\n\n\"She can do even greater things, my father. She will save us, I know she\nwill.\"\n\nToward morning, while the old man sat exhausted and asleep in his chair\nwhere he had been sitting before his books as one who watches by his\nbeloved dead and prints the features on his memory for a solace in the\naftertime of empty desolation, his daughter sprang into the room and\ngently woke him, saying--\n\n\"My presentiment was true! She will save us. Three times has she\nappeared to me in my dreams, and said, 'Go to the Herr Givenaught, go to\nthe Herr Heartless, ask them to come and bid.' There, did I not tell you\nshe would save us, the thrice blessed Virgin!\"\n\nSad as the old man was, he was obliged to laugh.\n\n\"Thou mightest as well appeal to the rocks their castles stand upon as\nto the harder ones that lie in those men's breasts, my child. THEY bid\non books writ in the learned tongues!--they can scarce read their own.\"\n\nBut Hildegarde's faith was in no wise shaken. Bright and early she was\non her way up the Neckar road, as joyous as a bird.\n\nMeantime Herr Givenaught and Herr Heartless were having an early\nbreakfast in the former's castle--the Sparrow's Nest--and flavoring\nit with a quarrel; for although these twins bore a love for each other\nwhich almost amounted to worship, there was one subject upon which they\ncould not touch without calling each other hard names--and yet it was\nthe subject which they oftenest touched upon.\n\n\"I tell you,\" said Givenaught, \"you will beggar yourself yet with your\ninsane squanderings of money upon what you choose to consider poor and\nworthy objects. All these years I have implored you to stop this foolish\ncustom and husband your means, but all in vain. You are always lying\nto me about these secret benevolences, but you never have managed to\ndeceive me yet. Every time a poor devil has been set upon his feet I\nhave detected your hand in it--incorrigible ass!\"\n\n\"Every time you didn't set him on his feet yourself, you mean. Where I\ngive one unfortunate a little private lift, you do the same for a dozen.\nThe idea of YOUR swelling around the country and petting yourself with\nthe nickname of Givenaught--intolerable humbug! Before I would be such\na fraud as that, I would cut my right hand off. Your life is a continual\nlie. But go on, I have tried MY best to save you from beggaring yourself\nby your riotous charities--now for the thousandth time I wash my hands\nof the consequences. A maundering old fool! that's what you are.\"\n\n\"And you a blethering old idiot!\" roared Givenaught, springing up.\n\n\"I won't stay in the presence of a man who has no more delicacy than to\ncall me such names. Mannerless swine!\"\n\nSo saying, Herr Heartless sprang up in a passion. But some lucky\naccident intervened, as usual, to change the subject, and the daily\nquarrel ended in the customary daily living reconciliation. The\ngray-headed old eccentrics parted, and Herr Heartless walked off to his\nown castle.\n\nHalf an hour later, Hildegarde was standing in the presence of Herr\nGivenaught. He heard her story, and said--\n\n\"I am sorry for you, my child, but I am very poor, I care nothing for\nbookish rubbish, I shall not be there.\"\n\nHe said the hard words kindly, but they nearly broke poor Hildegarde's\nheart, nevertheless. When she was gone the old heartbreaker muttered,\nrubbing his hands--\n\n\"It was a good stroke. I have saved my brother's pocket this time,\nin spite of him. Nothing else would have prevented his rushing off to\nrescue the old scholar, the pride of Germany, from his trouble. The poor\nchild won't venture near HIM after the rebuff she has received from his\nbrother the Givenaught.\"\n\nBut he was mistaken. The Virgin had commanded, and Hildegarde would\nobey. She went to Herr Heartless and told her story. But he said\ncoldly--\n\n\"I am very poor, my child, and books are nothing to me. I wish you well,\nbut I shall not come.\"\n\nWhen Hildegarde was gone, he chuckled and said--\n\n\"How my fool of a soft-headed soft-hearted brother would rage if he knew\nhow cunningly I have saved his pocket. How he would have flown to the\nold man's rescue! But the girl won't venture near him now.\"\n\nWhen Hildegarde reached home, her father asked her how she had\nprospered. She said--\n\n\"The Virgin has promised, and she will keep her word; but not in the way\nI thought. She knows her own ways, and they are best.\"\n\nThe old man patted her on the head, and smiled a doubting smile, but he\nhonored her for her brave faith, nevertheless.\n\nII\n\nNext day the people assembled in the great hall of the Ritter tavern,\nto witness the auction--for the proprietor had said the treasure of\nGermany's most honored son should be bartered away in no meaner place.\nHildegarde and her father sat close to the books, silent and sorrowful,\nand holding each other's hands. There was a great crowd of people\npresent. The bidding began--\n\n\"How much for this precious library, just as it stands, all complete?\"\ncalled the auctioneer.\n\n\"Fifty pieces of gold!\"\n\n\"A hundred!\"\n\n\"Two hundred.\"\n\n\"Three!\"\n\n\"Four!\"\n\n\"Five hundred!\"\n\n\"Five twenty-five.\"\n\nA brief pause.\n\n\"Five forty!\"\n\nA longer pause, while the auctioneer redoubled his persuasions.\n\n\"Five-forty-five!\"\n\nA heavy drag--the auctioneer persuaded, pleaded, implored--it was\nuseless, everybody remained silent--\n\n\"Well, then--going, going--one--two--\"\n\n\"Five hundred and fifty!\"\n\nThis in a shrill voice, from a bent old man, all hung with rags, and\nwith a green patch over his left eye. Everybody in his vicinity\nturned and gazed at him. It was Givenaught in disguise. He was using a\ndisguised voice, too.\n\n\"Good!\" cried the auctioneer. \"Going, going--one--two--\"\n\n\"Five hundred and sixty!\"\n\nThis, in a deep, harsh voice, from the midst of the crowd at the other\nend of the room. The people near by turned, and saw an old man, in a\nstrange costume, supporting himself on crutches. He wore a long white\nbeard, and blue spectacles. It was Herr Heartless, in disguise, and\nusing a disguised voice.\n\n\"Good again! Going, going--one--\"\n\n\"Six hundred!\"\n\nSensation. The crowd raised a cheer, and some one cried out, \"Go it,\nGreen-patch!\" This tickled the audience and a score of voices shouted,\n\"Go it, Green-patch!\"\n\n\"Going--going--going--third and last call--one--two--\"\n\n\"Seven hundred!\"\n\n\"Huzzah!--well done, Crutches!\" cried a voice. The crowd took it up, and\nshouted altogether, \"Well done, Crutches!\"\n\n\"Splendid, gentlemen! you are doing magnificently. Going, going--\"\n\n\"A thousand!\"\n\n\"Three cheers for Green-patch! Up and at him, Crutches!\"\n\n\"Going--going--\"\n\n\"Two thousand!\"\n\nAnd while the people cheered and shouted, \"Crutches\" muttered, \"Who can\nthis devil be that is fighting so to get these useless books?--But no\nmatter, he sha'n't have them. The pride of Germany shall have his books\nif it beggars me to buy them for him.\"\n\n\"Going, going, going--\"\n\n\"Three thousand!\"\n\n\"Come, everybody--give a rouser for Green-patch!\"\n\nAnd while they did it, \"Green-patch\" muttered, \"This cripple is plainly\na lunatic; but the old scholar shall have his books, nevertheless,\nthough my pocket sweat for it.\"\n\n\"Going--going--\"\n\n\"Four thousand!\"\n\n\"Huzza!\"\n\n\"Five thousand!\"\n\n\"Huzza!\"\n\n\"Six thousand!\"\n\n\"Huzza!\"\n\n\"Seven thousand!\"\n\n\"Huzza!\"\n\n\"EIGHT thousand!\"\n\n\"We are saved, father! I told you the Holy Virgin would keep her word!\"\n\"Blessed be her sacred name!\" said the old scholar, with emotion. The\ncrowd roared, \"Huzza, huzza, huzza--at him again, Green-patch!\"\n\n\"Going--going--\"\n\n\"TEN thousand!\" As Givenaught shouted this, his excitement was so\ngreat that he forgot himself and used his natural voice. His brother\nrecognized it, and muttered, under cover of the storm of cheers--\n\n\"Aha, you are there, are you, besotted old fool? Take the books, I know\nwhat you'll do with them!\"\n\nSo saying, he slipped out of the place and the auction was at an end.\nGivenaught shouldered his way to Hildegarde, whispered a word in\nher ear, and then he also vanished. The old scholar and his daughter\nembraced, and the former said, \"Truly the Holy Mother has done more\nthan she promised, child, for she has given you a splendid marriage\nportion--think of it, two thousand pieces of gold!\"\n\n\"And more still,\" cried Hildegarde, \"for she has given you back your\nbooks; the stranger whispered me that he would none of them--'the\nhonored son of Germany must keep them,' so he said. I would I might have\nasked his name and kissed his hand and begged his blessing; but he was\nOur Lady's angel, and it is not meet that we of earth should venture\nspeech with them that dwell above.\"\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX F.\n\nGerman Journals The daily journals of Hamburg, Frankfort, Baden, Munich,\nand Augsburg are all constructed on the same general plan. I speak of\nthese because I am more familiar with them than with any other German\npapers. They contain no \"editorials\" whatever; no \"personals\"--and this\nis rather a merit than a demerit, perhaps; no funny-paragraph column;\nno police-court reports; no reports of proceedings of higher courts;\nno information about prize-fights or other dog-fights, horse-races,\nwalking-machines, yachting-contents, rifle-matches, or other sporting\nmatters of any sort; no reports of banquet speeches; no department of\ncurious odds and ends of floating fact and gossip; no \"rumors\" about\nanything or anybody; no prognostications or prophecies about anything or\nanybody; no lists of patents granted or sought, or any reference to\nsuch things; no abuse of public officials, big or little, or complaints\nagainst them, or praises of them; no religious columns Saturdays, no\nrehash of cold sermons Mondays; no \"weather indications\"; no \"local\nitem\" unveiling of what is happening in town--nothing of a local nature,\nindeed, is mentioned, beyond the movements of some prince, or the\nproposed meeting of some deliberative body.\n\nAfter so formidable a list of what one can't find in a German daily,\nthe question may well be asked, What CAN be found in it? It is easily\nanswered: A child's handful of telegrams, mainly about European national\nand international political movements; letter-correspondence about the\nsame things; market reports. There you have it. That is what a German\ndaily is made of. A German daily is the slowest and saddest and\ndreariest of the inventions of man. Our own dailies infuriate the\nreader, pretty often; the German daily only stupefies him. Once a\nweek the German daily of the highest class lightens up its heavy\ncolumns--that is, it thinks it lightens them up--with a profound, an\nabysmal, book criticism; a criticism which carries you down, down, down\ninto the scientific bowels of the subject--for the German critic is\nnothing if not scientific--and when you come up at last and scent the\nfresh air and see the bonny daylight once more, you resolve without a\ndissenting voice that a book criticism is a mistaken way to lighten up\na German daily. Sometimes, in place of the criticism, the first-class\ndaily gives you what it thinks is a gay and chipper essay--about ancient\nGrecian funeral customs, or the ancient Egyptian method of tarring a\nmummy, or the reasons for believing that some of the peoples who existed\nbefore the flood did not approve of cats. These are not unpleasant\nsubjects; they are not uninteresting subjects; they are even exciting\nsubjects--until one of these massive scientists gets hold of them. He\nsoon convinces you that even these matters can be handled in such a way\nas to make a person low-spirited.\n\nAs I have said, the average German daily is made up solely of\ncorrespondences--a trifle of it by telegraph, the rest of it by mail.\nEvery paragraph has the side-head, \"London,\" \"Vienna,\" or some other\ntown, and a date. And always, before the name of the town, is placed\na letter or a sign, to indicate who the correspondent is, so that the\nauthorities can find him when they want to hang him. Stars, crosses,\ntriangles, squares, half-moons, suns--such are some of the signs used by\ncorrespondents.\n\nSome of the dailies move too fast, others too slowly. For instance, my\nHeidelberg daily was always twenty-four hours old when it arrived at\nthe hotel; but one of my Munich evening papers used to come a full\ntwenty-four hours before it was due.\n\nSome of the less important dailies give one a tablespoonful of a\ncontinued story every day; it is strung across the bottom of the page,\nin the French fashion. By subscribing for the paper for five years I\njudge that a man might succeed in getting pretty much all of the story.\n\nIf you ask a citizen of Munich which is the best Munich daily journal,\nhe will always tell you that there is only one good Munich daily, and\nthat it is published in Augsburg, forty or fifty miles away. It is like\nsaying that the best daily paper in New York is published out in New\nJersey somewhere. Yes, the Augsburg ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG is \"the best\nMunich paper,\" and it is the one I had in my mind when I was describing\na \"first-class German daily\" above. The entire paper, opened out, is not\nquite as large as a single page of the New York HERALD. It is printed on\nboth sides, of course; but in such large type that its entire contents\ncould be put, in HERALD type, upon a single page of the HERALD--and\nthere would still be room enough on the page for the ZEITUNG's\n\"supplement\" and some portion of the ZEITUNG's next day's contents.\n\nSuch is the first-class daily. The dailies actually printed in Munich\nare all called second-class by the public. If you ask which is the best\nof these second-class papers they say there is no difference; one is as\ngood as another. I have preserved a copy of one of them; it is\ncalled the M\u00dcNCHENER TAGES-ANZEIGER, and bears date January 25, 1879.\nComparisons are odious, but they need not be malicious; and without any\nmalice I wish to compare this journal, published in a German city of\n170,000 inhabitants, with journals of other countries. I know of no\nother way to enable the reader to \"size\" the thing.\n\nA column of an average daily paper in America contains from 1,800 to\n2,500 words; the reading-matter in a single issue consists of from\n25,000 to 50,000 words. The reading-matter in my copy of the Munich\njournal consists of a total of 1,654 words --for I counted them. That\nwould be nearly a column of one of our dailies. A single issue of the\nbulkiest daily newspaper in the world--the London TIMES--often contains\n100,000 words of reading-matter. Considering that the DAILY ANZEIGER\nissues the usual twenty-six numbers per month, the reading matter in a\nsingle number of the London TIMES would keep it in \"copy\" two months and\na half.\n\nThe ANZEIGER is an eight-page paper; its page is one inch wider and one\ninch longer than a foolscap page; that is to say, the dimensions of its\npage are somewhere between those of a schoolboy's slate and a lady's\npocket handkerchief. One-fourth of the first page is taken up with the\nheading of the journal; this gives it a rather top-heavy appearance;\nthe rest of the first page is reading-matter; all of the second page is\nreading-matter; the other six pages are devoted to advertisements.\n\nThe reading-matter is compressed into two hundred and five small-pica\nlines, and is lighted up with eight pica headlines. The bill of fare\nis as follows: First, under a pica headline, to enforce attention and\nrespect, is a four-line sermon urging mankind to remember that, although\nthey are pilgrims here below, they are yet heirs of heaven; and that\n\"When they depart from earth they soar to heaven.\" Perhaps a four-line\nsermon in a Saturday paper is the sufficient German equivalent of the\neight or ten columns of sermons which the New-Yorkers get in their\nMonday morning papers. The latest news (two days old) follows the\nfour-line sermon, under the pica headline \"Telegrams\"--these are\n\"telegraphed\" with a pair of scissors out of the AUGSBURGER ZEITUNG of\nthe day before. These telegrams consist of fourteen and two-thirds lines\nfrom Berlin, fifteen lines from Vienna, and two and five-eights lines\nfrom Calcutta. Thirty-three small-pica lines of telegraphic news in a\ndaily journal in a King's Capital of one hundred and seventy thousand\ninhabitants is surely not an overdose. Next we have the pica heading,\n\"News of the Day,\" under which the following facts are set forth: Prince\nLeopold is going on a visit to Vienna, six lines; Prince Arnulph is\ncoming back from Russia, two lines; the Landtag will meet at ten o'clock\nin the morning and consider an election law, three lines and one word\nover; a city government item, five and one-half lines; prices of tickets\nto the proposed grand Charity Ball, twenty-three lines--for this one\nitem occupies almost one-fourth of the entire first page; there is to be\na wonderful Wagner concert in Frankfurt-on-the-Main, with an orchestra\nof one hundred and eight instruments, seven and one-half lines. That\nconcludes the first page. Eighty-five lines, altogether, on that page,\nincluding three headlines. About fifty of those lines, as one perceives,\ndeal with local matters; so the reporters are not overworked.\n\nExactly one-half of the second page is occupied with an opera criticism,\nfifty-three lines (three of them being headlines), and \"Death Notices,\"\nten lines.\n\nThe other half of the second page is made up of two paragraphs under\nthe head of \"Miscellaneous News.\" One of these paragraphs tells about a\nquarrel between the Czar of Russia and his eldest son, twenty-one and\na half lines; and the other tells about the atrocious destruction of a\npeasant child by its parents, forty lines, or one-fifth of the total of\nthe reading-matter contained in the paper.\n\nConsider what a fifth part of the reading-matter of an American daily\npaper issued in a city of one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants\namounts to! Think what a mass it is. Would any one suppose I could so\nsnugly tuck away such a mass in a chapter of this book that it would be\ndifficult to find it again if the reader lost his place? Surely not.\nI will translate that child-murder word for word, to give the reader a\nrealizing sense of what a fifth part of the reading-matter of a Munich\ndaily actually is when it comes under measurement of the eye:\n\n\"From Oberkreuzberg, January 21st, the DONAU ZEITUNG receives a long\naccount of a crime, which we shortened as follows: In Rametuach,\na village near Eppenschlag, lived a young married couple with two\nchildren, one of which, a boy aged five, was born three years before the\nmarriage. For this reason, and also because a relative at Iggensbach had\nbequeathed M400 ($100) to the boy, the heartless father considered him\nin the way; so the unnatural parents determined to sacrifice him in the\ncruelest possible manner. They proceeded to starve him slowly to death,\nmeantime frightfully maltreating him--as the village people now make\nknown, when it is too late. The boy was shut in a hole, and when\npeople passed by he cried, and implored them to give him bread. His\nlong-continued tortures and deprivations destroyed him at last, on the\nthird of January. The sudden (sic) death of the child created suspicion,\nthe more so as the body was immediately clothed and laid upon the bier.\nTherefore the coroner gave notice, and an inquest was held on the 6th.\nWhat a pitiful spectacle was disclosed then! The body was a complete\nskeleton. The stomach and intestines were utterly empty; they contained\nnothing whatsoever. The flesh on the corpse was not as thick as the back\nof a knife, and incisions in it brought not one drop of blood. There\nwas not a piece of sound skin the size of a dollar on the whole body;\nwounds, scars, bruises, discolored extravasated blood, everywhere--even\non the soles of the feet there were wounds. The cruel parents asserted\nthat the boy had been so bad that they had been obliged to use severe\npunishments, and that he finally fell over a bench and broke his neck.\nHowever, they were arrested two weeks after the inquest and put in the\nprison at Deggendorf.\"\n\nYes, they were arrested \"two weeks after the inquest.\" What a home sound\nthat has. That kind of police briskness rather more reminds me of my\nnative land than German journalism does.\n\nI think a German daily journal doesn't do any good to speak of, but at\nthe same time it doesn't do any harm. That is a very large merit, and\nshould not be lightly weighted nor lightly thought of.\n\nThe German humorous papers are beautifully printed upon fine paper, and\nthe illustrations are finely drawn, finely engraved, and are not vapidly\nfunny, but deliciously so. So also, generally speaking, are the two or\nthree terse sentences which accompany the pictures. I remember one of\nthese pictures: A most dilapidated tramp is ruefully contemplating some\ncoins which lie in his open palm. He says: \"Well, begging is getting\nplayed out. Only about five marks ($1.25) for the whole day; many an\nofficial makes more!\" And I call to mind a picture of a commercial\ntraveler who is about to unroll his samples:\n\nMERCHANT (pettishly).--NO, don't. I don't want to buy anything!\n\nDRUMMER.--If you please, I was only going to show you--\n\nMERCHANT.--But I don't wish to see them!\n\nDRUMMER (after a pause, pleadingly).--But do you you mind letting ME\nlook at them! I haven't seen them for three weeks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's A Tramp Abroad, by Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)\n\n\n\n"}

The birth of the Prince and the Pauper.\n\nIn the ancient city of London, on a certain autumn day in the second\nquarter of the sixteenth century, a boy was born to a poor family of the\nname of Canty, who did not want him.  On the same day another English\nchild was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him.\nAll England wanted him too.  England had so longed for him, and hoped for\nhim, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the\npeople went nearly mad for joy.  Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed\neach other and cried. Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich\nand poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they kept\nthis up for days and nights together.  By day, London was a sight to see,\nwith gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and splendid\npageants marching along.  By night, it was again a sight to see, with its\ngreat bonfires at every corner, and its troops of revellers making merry\naround them.  There was no talk in all England but of the new baby,\nEdward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in silks and satins,\nunconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that great lords and ladies\nwere tending him and watching over him--and not caring, either.  But\nthere was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty, lapped in his poor\nrags, except among the family of paupers whom he had just come to trouble\nwith his presence.\n\n\n\nChapter II. Tom's early life.\n\nLet us skip a number of years.\n\nLondon was fifteen hundred years old, and was a great town--for that day.\nIt had a hundred thousand inhabitants--some think double as many.  The\nstreets were very narrow, and crooked, and dirty, especially in the part\nwhere Tom Canty lived, which was not far from London Bridge.  The houses\nwere of wood, with the second story projecting over the first, and the\nthird sticking its elbows out beyond the second.  The higher the houses\ngrew, the broader they grew.  They were skeletons of strong criss-cross\nbeams, with solid material between, coated with plaster.  The beams were\npainted red or blue or black, according to the owner's taste, and this\ngave the houses a very picturesque look.  The windows were small, glazed\nwith little diamond-shaped panes, and they opened outward, on hinges,\nlike doors.\n\nThe house which Tom's father lived in was up a foul little pocket called\nOffal Court, out of Pudding Lane.  It was small, decayed, and rickety,\nbut it was packed full of wretchedly poor families. Canty's tribe\noccupied a room on the third floor.  The mother and father had a sort of\nbedstead in the corner; but Tom, his grandmother, and his two sisters,\nBet and Nan, were not restricted--they had all the floor to themselves,\nand might sleep where they chose.  There were the remains of a blanket or\ntwo, and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw, but these could not\nrightly be called beds, for they were not organised; they were kicked\ninto a general pile, mornings, and selections made from the mass at\nnight, for service.\n\nBet and Nan were fifteen years old--twins.  They were good-hearted girls,\nunclean, clothed in rags, and profoundly ignorant.  Their mother was like\nthem.  But the father and the grandmother were a couple of fiends.  They\ngot drunk whenever they could; then they fought each other or anybody\nelse who came in the way; they cursed and swore always, drunk or sober;\nJohn Canty was a thief, and his mother a beggar.  They made beggars of\nthe children, but failed to make thieves of them.  Among, but not of, the\ndreadful rabble that inhabited the house, was a good old priest whom the\nKing had turned out of house and home with a pension of a few farthings,\nand he used to get the children aside and teach them right ways secretly.\nFather Andrew also taught Tom a little Latin, and how to read and write;\nand would have done the same with the girls, but they were afraid of the\njeers of their friends, who could not have endured such a queer\naccomplishment in them.\n\nAll Offal Court was just such another hive as Canty's house. Drunkenness,\nriot and brawling were the order, there, every night and nearly all night\nlong.  Broken heads were as common as hunger in that place.  Yet little\nTom was not unhappy.  He had a hard time of it, but did not know it.  It\nwas the sort of time that all the Offal Court boys had, therefore he\nsupposed it was the correct and comfortable thing.  When he came home\nempty-handed at night, he knew his father would curse him and thrash him\nfirst, and that when he was done the awful grandmother would do it all\nover again and improve on it; and that away in the night his starving\nmother would slip to him stealthily with any miserable scrap or crust she\nhad been able to save for him by going hungry herself, notwithstanding\nshe was often caught in that sort of treason and soundly beaten for it by\nher husband.\n\nNo, Tom's life went along well enough, especially in summer.  He only\nbegged just enough to save himself, for the laws against mendicancy were\nstringent, and the penalties heavy; so he put in a good deal of his time\nlistening to good Father Andrew's charming old tales and legends about\ngiants and fairies, dwarfs and genii, and enchanted castles, and gorgeous\nkings and princes.  His head grew to be full of these wonderful things,\nand many a night as he lay in the dark on his scant and offensive straw,\ntired, hungry, and smarting from a thrashing, he unleashed his\nimagination and soon forgot his aches and pains in delicious picturings\nto himself of the charmed life of a petted prince in a regal palace.  One\ndesire came in time to haunt him day and night:  it was to see a real\nprince, with his own eyes.  He spoke of it once to some of his Offal\nCourt comrades; but they jeered him and scoffed him so unmercifully that\nhe was glad to keep his dream to himself after that.\n\nHe often read the priest's old books and got him to explain and enlarge\nupon them.  His dreamings and readings worked certain changes in him,\nby-and-by.  His dream-people were so fine that he grew to lament his shabby\nclothing and his dirt, and to wish to be clean and better clad.  He went\non playing in the mud just the same, and enjoying it, too; but, instead\nof splashing around in the Thames solely for the fun of it, he began to\nfind an added value in it because of the washings and cleansings it\nafforded.\n\nTom could always find something going on around the Maypole in Cheapside,\nand at the fairs; and now and then he and the rest of London had a chance\nto see a military parade when some famous unfortunate was carried\nprisoner to the Tower, by land or boat. One summer's day he saw poor Anne\nAskew and three men burned at the stake in Smithfield, and heard an\nex-Bishop preach a sermon to them which did not interest him.  Yes, Tom's\nlife was varied and pleasant enough, on the whole.\n\nBy-and-by Tom's reading and dreaming about princely life wrought such a\nstrong effect upon him that he began to ACT the prince, unconsciously.\nHis speech and manners became curiously ceremonious and courtly, to the\nvast admiration and amusement of his intimates.  But Tom's influence\namong these young people began to grow now, day by day; and in time he\ncame to be looked up to, by them, with a sort of wondering awe, as a\nsuperior being.  He seemed to know so much! and he could do and say such\nmarvellous things! and withal, he was so deep and wise!  Tom's remarks,\nand Tom's performances, were reported by the boys to their elders; and\nthese, also, presently began to discuss Tom Canty, and to regard him as a\nmost gifted and extraordinary creature.  Full-grown people brought their\nperplexities to Tom for solution, and were often astonished at the wit\nand wisdom of his decisions.  In fact he was become a hero to all who\nknew him except his own family--these, only, saw nothing in him.\n\nPrivately, after a while, Tom organised a royal court!  He was the\nprince; his special comrades were guards, chamberlains, equerries, lords\nand ladies in waiting, and the royal family.  Daily the mock prince was\nreceived with elaborate ceremonials borrowed by Tom from his romantic\nreadings; daily the great affairs of the mimic kingdom were discussed in\nthe royal council, and daily his mimic highness issued decrees to his\nimaginary armies, navies, and viceroyalties.\n\nAfter which, he would go forth in his rags and beg a few farthings, eat\nhis poor crust, take his customary cuffs and abuse, and then stretch\nhimself upon his handful of foul straw, and resume his empty grandeurs in\nhis dreams.\n\nAnd still his desire to look just once upon a real prince, in the flesh,\ngrew upon him, day by day, and week by week, until at last it absorbed\nall other desires, and became the one passion of his life.\n\nOne January day, on his usual begging tour, he tramped despondently up\nand down the region round about Mincing Lane and Little East Cheap, hour\nafter hour, bare-footed and cold, looking in at cook-shop windows and\nlonging for the dreadful pork-pies and other deadly inventions displayed\nthere--for to him these were dainties fit for the angels; that is,\njudging by the smell, they were--for it had never been his good luck to\nown and eat one. There was a cold drizzle of rain; the atmosphere was\nmurky; it was a melancholy day.  At night Tom reached home so wet and\ntired and hungry that it was not possible for his father and grandmother\nto observe his forlorn condition and not be moved--after their fashion;\nwherefore they gave him a brisk cuffing at once and sent him to bed.  For\na long time his pain and hunger, and the swearing and fighting going on\nin the building, kept him awake; but at last his thoughts drifted away to\nfar, romantic lands, and he fell asleep in the company of jewelled and\ngilded princelings who live in vast palaces, and had servants salaaming\nbefore them or flying to execute their orders.  And then, as usual, he\ndreamed that HE was a princeling himself.\n\nAll night long the glories of his royal estate shone upon him; he moved\namong great lords and ladies, in a blaze of light, breathing perfumes,\ndrinking in delicious music, and answering the reverent obeisances of the\nglittering throng as it parted to make way for him, with here a smile,\nand there a nod of his princely head.\n\nAnd when he awoke in the morning and looked upon the wretchedness about\nhim, his dream had had its usual effect--it had intensified the\nsordidness of his surroundings a thousandfold.  Then came bitterness, and\nheart-break, and tears.\n\n\n\nChapter III. Tom's meeting with the Prince.\n\nTom got up hungry, and sauntered hungry away, but with his thoughts busy\nwith the shadowy splendours of his night's dreams. He wandered here and\nthere in the city, hardly noticing where he was going, or what was\nhappening around him.  People jostled him, and some gave him rough\nspeech; but it was all lost on the musing boy.  By-and-by he found\nhimself at Temple Bar, the farthest from home he had ever travelled in\nthat direction.  He stopped and considered a moment, then fell into his\nimaginings again, and passed on outside the walls of London.  The Strand\nhad ceased to be a country-road then, and regarded itself as a street,\nbut by a strained construction; for, though there was a tolerably compact\nrow of houses on one side of it, there were only some scattered great\nbuildings on the other, these being palaces of rich nobles, with ample\nand beautiful grounds stretching to the river--grounds that are now\nclosely packed with grim acres of brick and stone.\n\nTom discovered Charing Village presently, and rested himself at the\nbeautiful cross built there by a bereaved king of earlier days; then\nidled down a quiet, lovely road, past the great cardinal's stately\npalace, toward a far more mighty and majestic palace beyond--Westminster.\nTom stared in glad wonder at the vast pile of masonry, the wide-spreading\nwings, the frowning bastions and turrets, the huge stone gateway, with\nits gilded bars and its magnificent array of colossal granite lions, and\nother the signs and symbols of English royalty.  Was the desire of his\nsoul to be satisfied at last?  Here, indeed, was a king's palace.  Might\nhe not hope to see a prince now--a prince of flesh and blood, if Heaven\nwere willing?\n\nAt each side of the gilded gate stood a living statue--that is to say, an\nerect and stately and motionless man-at-arms, clad from head to heel in\nshining steel armour.  At a respectful distance were many country folk,\nand people from the city, waiting for any chance glimpse of royalty that\nmight offer.  Splendid carriages, with splendid people in them and\nsplendid servants outside, were arriving and departing by several other\nnoble gateways that pierced the royal enclosure.\n\nPoor little Tom, in his rags, approached, and was moving slowly and\ntimidly past the sentinels, with a beating heart and a rising hope, when\nall at once he caught sight through the golden bars of a spectacle that\nalmost made him shout for joy.  Within was a comely boy, tanned and brown\nwith sturdy outdoor sports and exercises, whose clothing was all of\nlovely silks and satins, shining with jewels; at his hip a little\njewelled sword and dagger; dainty buskins on his feet, with red heels;\nand on his head a jaunty crimson cap, with drooping plumes fastened with\na great sparkling gem.  Several gorgeous gentlemen stood near--his\nservants, without a doubt.  Oh! he was a prince--a prince, a living\nprince, a real prince--without the shadow of a question; and the prayer\nof the pauper-boy's heart was answered at last.\n\nTom's breath came quick and short with excitement, and his eyes grew big\nwith wonder and delight.  Everything gave way in his mind instantly to\none desire:  that was to get close to the prince, and have a good,\ndevouring look at him.  Before he knew what he was about, he had his face\nagainst the gate-bars.  The next instant one of the soldiers snatched him\nrudely away, and sent him spinning among the gaping crowd of country\ngawks and London idlers.  The soldier said,--\n\n\"Mind thy manners, thou young beggar!\"\n\nThe crowd jeered and laughed; but the young prince sprang to the gate\nwith his face flushed, and his eyes flashing with indignation, and cried\nout,--\n\n\"How dar'st thou use a poor lad like that?  How dar'st thou use the King\nmy father's meanest subject so?  Open the gates, and let him in!\"\n\nYou should have seen that fickle crowd snatch off their hats then. You\nshould have heard them cheer, and shout, \"Long live the Prince of Wales!\"\n\nThe soldiers presented arms with their halberds, opened the gates, and\npresented again as the little Prince of Poverty passed in, in his\nfluttering rags, to join hands with the Prince of Limitless Plenty.\n\nEdward Tudor said--\n\n\"Thou lookest tired and hungry:  thou'st been treated ill.  Come with\nme.\"\n\nHalf a dozen attendants sprang forward to--I don't know what; interfere,\nno doubt.  But they were waved aside with a right royal gesture, and they\nstopped stock still where they were, like so many statues.  Edward took\nTom to a rich apartment in the palace, which he called his cabinet.  By\nhis command a repast was brought such as Tom had never encountered before\nexcept in books.  The prince, with princely delicacy and breeding, sent\naway the servants, so that his humble guest might not be embarrassed by\ntheir critical presence; then he sat near by, and asked questions while\nTom ate.\n\n\"What is thy name, lad?\"\n\n\"Tom Canty, an' it please thee, sir.\"\n\n\"'Tis an odd one.  Where dost live?\"\n\n\"In the city, please thee, sir.  Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane.\"\n\n\"Offal Court!  Truly 'tis another odd one.  Hast parents?\"\n\n\"Parents have I, sir, and a grand-dam likewise that is but indifferently\nprecious to me, God forgive me if it be offence to say it--also twin\nsisters, Nan and Bet.\"\n\n\"Then is thy grand-dam not over kind to thee, I take it?\"\n\n\"Neither to any other is she, so please your worship.  She hath a wicked\nheart, and worketh evil all her days.\"\n\n\"Doth she mistreat thee?\"\n\n\"There be times that she stayeth her hand, being asleep or overcome with\ndrink; but when she hath her judgment clear again, she maketh it up to me\nwith goodly beatings.\"\n\nA fierce look came into the little prince's eyes, and he cried out--\n\n\"What!  Beatings?\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed, yes, please you, sir.\"\n\n\"BEATINGS!--and thou so frail and little.  Hark ye:  before the night\ncome, she shall hie her to the Tower.  The King my father\"--\n\n\"In sooth, you forget, sir, her low degree.  The Tower is for the great\nalone.\"\n\n\"True, indeed.  I had not thought of that.  I will consider of her\npunishment.  Is thy father kind to thee?\"\n\n\"Not more than Gammer Canty, sir.\"\n\n\"Fathers be alike, mayhap.  Mine hath not a doll's temper.  He smiteth\nwith a heavy hand, yet spareth me:  he spareth me not always with his\ntongue, though, sooth to say.  How doth thy mother use thee?\"\n\n\"She is good, sir, and giveth me neither sorrow nor pain of any sort.\nAnd Nan and Bet are like to her in this.\"\n\n\"How old be these?\"\n\n\"Fifteen, an' it please you, sir.\"\n\n\"The Lady Elizabeth, my sister, is fourteen, and the Lady Jane Grey, my\ncousin, is of mine own age, and comely and gracious withal; but my sister\nthe Lady Mary, with her gloomy mien and--Look you:  do thy sisters forbid\ntheir servants to smile, lest the sin destroy their souls?\"\n\n\"They?  Oh, dost think, sir, that THEY have servants?\"\n\nThe little prince contemplated the little pauper gravely a moment, then\nsaid--\n\n\"And prithee, why not?  Who helpeth them undress at night?  Who attireth\nthem when they rise?\"\n\n\"None, sir.  Would'st have them take off their garment, and sleep\nwithout--like the beasts?\"\n\n\"Their garment!  Have they but one?\"\n\n\"Ah, good your worship, what would they do with more?  Truly they have\nnot two bodies each.\"\n\n\"It is a quaint and marvellous thought!  Thy pardon, I had not meant to\nlaugh.  But thy good Nan and thy Bet shall have raiment and lackeys enow,\nand that soon, too:  my cofferer shall look to it.  No, thank me not;\n'tis nothing.  Thou speakest well; thou hast an easy grace in it.  Art\nlearned?\"\n\n\"I know not if I am or not, sir.  The good priest that is called Father\nAndrew taught me, of his kindness, from his books.\"\n\n\"Know'st thou the Latin?\"\n\n\"But scantly, sir, I doubt.\"\n\n\"Learn it, lad:  'tis hard only at first.  The Greek is harder; but\nneither these nor any tongues else, I think, are hard to the Lady\nElizabeth and my cousin.  Thou should'st hear those damsels at it!  But\ntell me of thy Offal Court.  Hast thou a pleasant life there?\"\n\n\"In truth, yes, so please you, sir, save when one is hungry. There be\nPunch-and-Judy shows, and monkeys--oh such antic creatures! and so\nbravely dressed!--and there be plays wherein they that play do shout and\nfight till all are slain, and 'tis so fine to see, and costeth but a\nfarthing--albeit 'tis main hard to get the farthing, please your\nworship.\"\n\n\"Tell me more.\"\n\n\"We lads of Offal Court do strive against each other with the cudgel,\nlike to the fashion of the 'prentices, sometimes.\"\n\nThe prince's eyes flashed.  Said he--\n\n\"Marry, that would not I mislike.  Tell me more.\"\n\n\"We strive in races, sir, to see who of us shall be fleetest.\"\n\n\"That would I like also.  Speak on.\"\n\n\"In summer, sir, we wade and swim in the canals and in the river, and\neach doth duck his neighbour, and splatter him with water, and dive and\nshout and tumble and--\"\n\n\"'Twould be worth my father's kingdom but to enjoy it once! Prithee go\non.\"\n\n\"We dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside; we play in the sand,\neach covering his neighbour up; and times we make mud pastry--oh the\nlovely mud, it hath not its like for delightfulness in all the world!--we\ndo fairly wallow in the mud, sir, saving your worship's presence.\"\n\n\"Oh, prithee, say no more, 'tis glorious!  If that I could but clothe me\nin raiment like to thine, and strip my feet, and revel in the mud once,\njust once, with none to rebuke me or forbid, meseemeth I could forego the\ncrown!\"\n\n\"And if that I could clothe me once, sweet sir, as thou art clad--just\nonce--\"\n\n\"Oho, would'st like it?  Then so shall it be.  Doff thy rags, and don\nthese splendours, lad!  It is a brief happiness, but will be not less\nkeen for that.  We will have it while we may, and change again before any\ncome to molest.\"\n\nA few minutes later the little Prince of Wales was garlanded with Tom's\nfluttering odds and ends, and the little Prince of Pauperdom was tricked\nout in the gaudy plumage of royalty.  The two went and stood side by side\nbefore a great mirror, and lo, a miracle: there did not seem to have been\nany change made!  They stared at each other, then at the glass, then at\neach other again.  At last the puzzled princeling said--\n\n\"What dost thou make of this?\"\n\n\"Ah, good your worship, require me not to answer.  It is not meet that\none of my degree should utter the thing.\"\n\n\"Then will _I_ utter it.  Thou hast the same hair, the same eyes, the\nsame voice and manner, the same form and stature, the same face and\ncountenance that I bear.  Fared we forth naked, there is none could say\nwhich was you, and which the Prince of Wales.  And, now that I am clothed\nas thou wert clothed, it seemeth I should be able the more nearly to feel\nas thou didst when the brute soldier--Hark ye, is not this a bruise upon\nyour hand?\"\n\n\"Yes; but it is a slight thing, and your worship knoweth that the poor\nman-at-arms--\"\n\n\"Peace!  It was a shameful thing and a cruel!\" cried the little prince,\nstamping his bare foot.  \"If the King--Stir not a step till I come again!\nIt is a command!\"\n\nIn a moment he had snatched up and put away an article of national\nimportance that lay upon a table, and was out at the door and flying\nthrough the palace grounds in his bannered rags, with a hot face and\nglowing eyes.  As soon as he reached the great gate, he seized the bars,\nand tried to shake them, shouting--\n\n\"Open!  Unbar the gates!\"\n\nThe soldier that had maltreated Tom obeyed promptly; and as the prince\nburst through the portal, half-smothered with royal wrath, the soldier\nfetched him a sounding box on the ear that sent him whirling to the\nroadway, and said--\n\n\"Take that, thou beggar's spawn, for what thou got'st me from his\nHighness!\"\n\nThe crowd roared with laughter.  The prince picked himself out of the\nmud, and made fiercely at the sentry, shouting--\n\n\"I am the Prince of Wales, my person is sacred; and thou shalt hang for\nlaying thy hand upon me!\"\n\nThe soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and said mockingly--\n\n\"I salute your gracious Highness.\"  Then angrily--\"Be off, thou crazy\nrubbish!\"\n\nHere the jeering crowd closed round the poor little prince, and hustled\nhim far down the road, hooting him, and shouting--\n\n\"Way for his Royal Highness!  Way for the Prince of Wales!\"\n\n\n\nChapter IV. The Prince's troubles begin.\n\nAfter hours of persistent pursuit and persecution, the little prince was\nat last deserted by the rabble and left to himself.  As long as he had\nbeen able to rage against the mob, and threaten it royally, and royally\nutter commands that were good stuff to laugh at, he was very\nentertaining; but when weariness finally forced him to be silent, he was\nno longer of use to his tormentors, and they sought amusement elsewhere.\nHe looked about him, now, but could not recognise the locality.  He was\nwithin the city of London--that was all he knew.  He moved on, aimlessly,\nand in a little while the houses thinned, and the passers-by were\ninfrequent.  He bathed his bleeding feet in the brook which flowed then\nwhere Farringdon Street now is; rested a few moments, then passed on, and\npresently came upon a great space with only a few scattered houses in it,\nand a prodigious church.  He recognised this church.  Scaffoldings were\nabout, everywhere, and swarms of workmen; for it was undergoing elaborate\nrepairs.  The prince took heart at once--he felt that his troubles were\nat an end, now.  He said to himself, \"It is the ancient Grey Friars'\nChurch, which the king my father hath taken from the monks and given for\na home for ever for poor and forsaken children, and new-named it Christ's\nChurch.  Right gladly will they serve the son of him who hath done so\ngenerously by them--and the more that that son is himself as poor and as\nforlorn as any that be sheltered here this day, or ever shall be.\"\n\nHe was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running, jumping,\nplaying at ball and leap-frog, and otherwise disporting themselves, and\nright noisily, too.  They were all dressed alike, and in the fashion\nwhich in that day prevailed among serving-men and 'prentices{1}--that is\nto say, each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the size\nof a saucer, which was not useful as a covering, it being of such scanty\ndimensions, neither was it ornamental; from beneath it the hair fell,\nunparted, to the middle of the forehead, and was cropped straight around;\na clerical band at the neck; a blue gown that fitted closely and hung as\nlow as the knees or lower; full sleeves; a broad red belt; bright yellow\nstockings, gartered above the knees; low shoes with large metal buckles.\nIt was a sufficiently ugly costume.\n\nThe boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince, who said with\nnative dignity--\n\n\"Good lads, say to your master that Edward Prince of Wales desireth\nspeech with him.\"\n\nA great shout went up at this, and one rude fellow said--\n\n\"Marry, art thou his grace's messenger, beggar?\"\n\nThe prince's face flushed with anger, and his ready hand flew to his hip,\nbut there was nothing there.  There was a storm of laughter, and one boy\nsaid--\n\n\"Didst mark that?  He fancied he had a sword--belike he is the prince\nhimself.\"\n\nThis sally brought more laughter.  Poor Edward drew himself up proudly\nand said--\n\n\"I am the prince; and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the king my\nfather's bounty to use me so.\"\n\nThis was vastly enjoyed, as the laughter testified.  The youth who had\nfirst spoken, shouted to his comrades--\n\n\"Ho, swine, slaves, pensioners of his grace's princely father, where be\nyour manners?  Down on your marrow bones, all of ye, and do reverence to\nhis kingly port and royal rags!\"\n\nWith boisterous mirth they dropped upon their knees in a body and did\nmock homage to their prey.  The prince spurned the nearest boy with his\nfoot, and said fiercely--\n\n\"Take thou that, till the morrow come and I build thee a gibbet!\"\n\nAh, but this was not a joke--this was going beyond fun.  The laughter\nceased on the instant, and fury took its place.  A dozen shouted--\n\n\"Hale him forth!  To the horse-pond, to the horse-pond!  Where be the\ndogs?  Ho, there, Lion! ho, Fangs!\"\n\nThen followed such a thing as England had never seen before--the sacred\nperson of the heir to the throne rudely buffeted by plebeian hands, and\nset upon and torn by dogs.\n\nAs night drew to a close that day, the prince found himself far down in\nthe close-built portion of the city.  His body was bruised, his hands\nwere bleeding, and his rags were all besmirched with mud.  He wandered on\nand on, and grew more and more bewildered, and so tired and faint he\ncould hardly drag one foot after the other.  He had ceased to ask\nquestions of anyone, since they brought him only insult instead of\ninformation.  He kept muttering to himself, \"Offal Court--that is the\nname; if I can but find it before my strength is wholly spent and I drop,\nthen am I saved--for his people will take me to the palace and prove that\nI am none of theirs, but the true prince, and I shall have mine own\nagain.\"  And now and then his mind reverted to his treatment by those\nrude Christ's Hospital boys, and he said, \"When I am king, they shall not\nhave bread and shelter only, but also teachings out of books; for a full\nbelly is little worth where the mind is starved, and the heart.  I will\nkeep this diligently in my remembrance, that this day's lesson be not\nlost upon me, and my people suffer thereby; for learning softeneth the\nheart and breedeth gentleness and charity.\" {1}\n\nThe lights began to twinkle, it came on to rain, the wind rose, and a raw\nand gusty night set in.  The houseless prince, the homeless heir to the\nthrone of England, still moved on, drifting deeper into the maze of\nsqualid alleys where the swarming hives of poverty and misery were massed\ntogether.\n\nSuddenly a great drunken ruffian collared him and said--\n\n\"Out to this time of night again, and hast not brought a farthing home, I\nwarrant me!  If it be so, an' I do not break all the bones in thy lean\nbody, then am I not John Canty, but some other.\"\n\nThe prince twisted himself loose, unconsciously brushed his profaned\nshoulder, and eagerly said--\n\n\"Oh, art HIS father, truly?  Sweet heaven grant it be so--then wilt thou\nfetch him away and restore me!\"\n\n\"HIS father?  I know not what thou mean'st; I but know I am THY father,\nas thou shalt soon have cause to--\"\n\n\"Oh, jest not, palter not, delay not!--I am worn, I am wounded, I can\nbear no more.  Take me to the king my father, and he will make thee rich\nbeyond thy wildest dreams.  Believe me, man, believe me!--I speak no lie,\nbut only the truth!--put forth thy hand and save me!  I am indeed the\nPrince of Wales!\"\n\nThe man stared down, stupefied, upon the lad, then shook his head and\nmuttered--\n\n\"Gone stark mad as any Tom o' Bedlam!\"--then collared him once more, and\nsaid with a coarse laugh and an oath, \"But mad or no mad, I and thy\nGammer Canty will soon find where the soft places in thy bones lie, or\nI'm no true man!\"\n\nWith this he dragged the frantic and struggling prince away, and\ndisappeared up a front court followed by a delighted and noisy swarm of\nhuman vermin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Clemens)\n\n                           Part 2.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nMERLIN'S TOWER\n\nInasmuch as I was now the second personage in the Kingdom, as far\nas political power and authority were concerned, much was made\nof me.  My raiment was of silks and velvets and cloth of gold,\nand by consequence was very showy, also uncomfortable.  But habit\nwould soon reconcile me to my clothes; I was aware of that.  I was\ngiven the choicest suite of apartments in the castle, after\nthe king's.  They were aglow with loud-colored silken hangings,\nbut the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet,\nand they were misfit rushes at that, being not all of one breed.\nAs for conveniences, properly speaking, there weren't any.  I mean\n_little_ conveniences; it is the little conveniences that make\nthe real comfort of life.  The big oaken chairs, graced with rude\ncarvings, were well enough, but that was the stopping place.\nThere was no soap, no matches, no looking-glass--except a metal\none, about as powerful as a pail of water.  And not a chromo.\nI had been used to chromos for years, and I saw now that without\nmy suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the fabric\nof my being, and was become a part of me.  It made me homesick\nto look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness\nand remember that in our house in East Hartford, all unpretending\nas it was, you couldn't go into a room but you would find an\ninsurance-chromo, or at least a three-color God-Bless-Our-Home\nover the door; and in the parlor we had nine.  But here, even in\nmy grand room of state, there wasn't anything in the nature of\na picture except a thing the size of a bedquilt, which was either\nwoven or knitted (it had darned places in it), and nothing in it\nwas the right color or the right shape; and as for proportions,\neven Raphael himself couldn't have botched them more formidably,\nafter all his practice on those nightmares they call his \"celebrated\nHampton Court cartoons.\"  Raphael was a bird.  We had several\nof his chromos; one was his \"Miraculous Draught of Fishes,\" where\nhe puts in a miracle of his own--puts three men into a canoe which\nwouldn't have held a dog without upsetting.  I always admired\nto study R.'s art, it was so fresh and unconventional.\n\nThere wasn't even a bell or a speaking-tube in the castle.  I had\na great many servants, and those that were on duty lolled in the\nanteroom; and when I wanted one of them I had to go and call for him.\nThere was no gas, there were no candles; a bronze dish half full\nof boarding-house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was\nthe thing that produced what was regarded as light.  A lot of\nthese hung along the walls and modified the dark, just toned it\ndown enough to make it dismal.  If you went out at night, your\nservants carried torches.  There were no books, pens, paper or\nink, and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows.\nIt is a little thing--glass is--until it is absent, then it becomes\na big thing.  But perhaps the worst of all was, that there wasn't\nany sugar, coffee, tea, or tobacco.  I saw that I was just another\nRobinson Crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island, with no society\nbut some more or less tame animals, and if I wanted to make life\nbearable I must do as he did--invent, contrive, create, reorganize\nthings; set brain and hand to work, and keep them busy.  Well,\nthat was in my line.\n\nOne thing troubled me along at first--the immense interest which\npeople took in me.  Apparently the whole nation wanted a look\nat me.  It soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the British\nworld almost to death; that while it lasted the whole country,\nfrom one end to the other, was in a pitiable state of panic, and\nthe churches, hermitages, and monkeries overflowed with praying\nand weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world was\ncome.  Then had followed the news that the producer of this awful\nevent was a stranger, a mighty magician at Arthur's court; that he\ncould have blown out the sun like a candle, and was just going\nto do it when his mercy was purchased, and he then dissolved\nhis enchantments, and was now recognized and honored as the man\nwho had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction and\nits peoples from extinction.  Now if you consider that everybody\nbelieved that, and not only believed it, but never even dreamed\nof doubting it, you will easily understand that there was not\na person in all Britain that would not have walked fifty miles\nto get a sight of me.  Of course I was all the talk--all other\nsubjects were dropped; even the king became suddenly a person of\nminor interest and notoriety.  Within twenty-four hours the\ndelegations began to arrive, and from that time onward for a fortnight\nthey kept coming.  The village was crowded, and all the countryside.\nI had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these\nreverent and awe-stricken multitudes.  It came to be a great burden,\nas to time and trouble, but of course it was at the same time\ncompensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center\nof homage.  It turned Brer Merlin green with envy and spite, which\nwas a great satisfaction to me.  But there was one thing I couldn't\nunderstand--nobody had asked for an autograph.  I spoke to Clarence\nabout it.  By George!  I had to explain to him what it was.  Then\nhe said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen\npriests.  Land! think of that.\n\nThere was another thing that troubled me a little.  Those multitudes\npresently began to agitate for another miracle.  That was natural.\nTo be able to carry back to their far homes the boast that they\nhad seen the man who could command the sun, riding in the heavens,\nand be obeyed, would make them great in the eyes of their neighbors,\nand envied by them all; but to be able to also say they had seen\nhim work a miracle themselves--why, people would come a distance\nto see _them_.  The pressure got to be pretty strong.  There was\ngoing to be an eclipse of the moon, and I knew the date and hour,\nbut it was too far away.  Two years.  I would have given a good\ndeal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was\na big market for it.  It seemed a great pity to have it wasted so,\nand come lagging along at a time when a body wouldn't have any\nuse for it, as like as not.  If it had been booked for only a month\naway, I could have sold it short; but, as matters stood, I couldn't\nseem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good, so I gave up\ntrying.  Next, Clarence found that old Merlin was making himself\nbusy on the sly among those people.  He was spreading a report that\nI was a humbug, and that the reason I didn't accommodate the people\nwith a miracle was because I couldn't.  I saw that I must do\nsomething.  I presently thought out a plan.\n\nBy my authority as executive I threw Merlin into prison--the same\ncell I had occupied myself.  Then I gave public notice by herald\nand trumpet that I should be busy with affairs of state for\na fortnight, but about the end of that time I would take a moment's\nleisure and blow up Merlin's stone tower by fires from heaven;\nin the meantime, whoso listened to evil reports about me, let him\nbeware.  Furthermore, I would perform but this one miracle at\nthis time, and no more; if it failed to satisfy and any murmured,\nI would turn the murmurers into horses, and make them useful.\nQuiet ensued.\n\nI took Clarence into my confidence, to a certain degree, and we\nwent to work privately.  I told him that this was a sort of miracle\nthat required a trifle of preparation, and that it would be sudden\ndeath to ever talk about these preparations to anybody.  That made\nhis mouth safe enough.  Clandestinely we made a few bushels of\nfirst-rate blasting powder, and I superintended my armorers while\nthey constructed a lightning-rod and some wires.  This old stone\ntower was very massive--and rather ruinous, too, for it was Roman,\nand four hundred years old.  Yes, and handsome, after a rude\nfashion, and clothed with ivy from base to summit, as with a shirt\nof scale mail.  It stood on a lonely eminence, in good view from\nthe castle, and about half a mile away.\n\nWorking by night, we stowed the powder in the tower--dug stones\nout, on the inside, and buried the powder in the walls themselves,\nwhich were fifteen feet thick at the base.  We put in a peck\nat a time, in a dozen places.  We could have blown up the Tower\nof London with these charges.  When the thirteenth night was come\nwe put up our lightning-rod, bedded it in one of the batches of\npowder, and ran wires from it to the other batches.  Everybody\nhad shunned that locality from the day of my proclamation, but\non the morning of the fourteenth I thought best to warn the people,\nthrough the heralds, to keep clear away--a quarter of a mile away.\nThen added, by command, that at some time during the twenty-four\nhours I would consummate the miracle, but would first give a brief\nnotice; by flags on the castle towers if in the daytime, by\ntorch-baskets in the same places if at night.\n\nThunder-showers had been tolerably frequent of late, and I was\nnot much afraid of a failure; still, I shouldn't have cared for\na delay of a day or two; I should have explained that I was busy\nwith affairs of state yet, and the people must wait.\n\nOf course, we had a blazing sunny day--almost the first one without\na cloud for three weeks; things always happen so.  I kept secluded,\nand watched the weather.  Clarence dropped in from time to time\nand said the public excitement was growing and growing all the\ntime, and the whole country filling up with human masses as far\nas one could see from the battlements.  At last the wind sprang up\nand a cloud appeared--in the right quarter, too, and just at\nnightfall.  For a little while I watched that distant cloud spread\nand blacken, then I judged it was time for me to appear.  I ordered\nthe torch-baskets to be lit, and Merlin liberated and sent to me.\nA quarter of an hour later I ascended the parapet and there found\nthe king and the court assembled and gazing off in the darkness\ntoward Merlin's Tower.  Already the darkness was so heavy that\none could not see far; these people and the old turrets, being\npartly in deep shadow and partly in the red glow from the great\ntorch-baskets overhead, made a good deal of a picture.\n\nMerlin arrived in a gloomy mood.  I said:\n\n\"You wanted to burn me alive when I had not done you any harm,\nand latterly you have been trying to injure my professional\nreputation.  Therefore I am going to call down fire and blow up\nyour tower, but it is only fair to give you a chance; now if you\nthink you can break my enchantments and ward off the fires, step\nto the bat, it's your innings.\"\n\n\"I can, fair sir, and I will. Doubt it not.\"\n\nHe drew an imaginary circle on the stones of the roof, and burnt\na pinch of powder in it, which sent up a small cloud of aromatic\nsmoke, whereat everybody fell back and began to cross themselves\nand get uncomfortable.  Then he began to mutter and make passes\nin the air with his hands.  He worked himself up slowly and\ngradually into a sort of frenzy, and got to thrashing around with\nhis arms like the sails of a windmill.  By this time the storm had\nabout reached us; the gusts of wind were flaring the torches and\nmaking the shadows swash about, the first heavy drops of rain\nwere falling, the world abroad was black as pitch, the lightning\nbegan to wink fitfully.  Of course, my rod would be loading itself\nnow.  In fact, things were imminent. So I said:\n\n\"You have had time enough.  I have given you every advantage,\nand not interfered.  It is plain your magic is weak. It is only\nfair that I begin now.\"\n\nI made about three passes in the air, and then there was an awful\ncrash and that old tower leaped into the sky in chunks, along\nwith a vast volcanic fountain of fire that turned night to noonday,\nand showed a thousand acres of human beings groveling on the ground\nin a general collapse of consternation.  Well, it rained mortar and\nmasonry the rest of the week.  This was the report; but probably\nthe facts would have modified it.\n\nIt was an effective miracle.  The great bothersome temporary\npopulation vanished.  There were a good many thousand tracks\nin the mud the next morning, but they were all outward bound.\nIf I had advertised another miracle I couldn't have raised an\naudience with a sheriff.\n\nMerlin's stock was flat.  The king wanted to stop his wages; he\neven wanted to banish him, but I interfered.  I said he would be\nuseful to work the weather, and attend to small matters like that,\nand I would give him a lift now and then when his poor little\nparlor-magic soured on him.  There wasn't a rag of his tower left,\nbut I had the government rebuild it for him, and advised him\nto take boarders; but he was too high-toned for that.  And as for\nbeing grateful, he never even said thank you.  He was a rather\nhard lot, take him how you might; but then you couldn't fairly\nexpect a man to be sweet that had been set back so.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE BOSS\n\nTo be vested with enormous authority is a fine thing; but to have\nthe on-looking world consent to it is a finer.  The tower episode\nsolidified my power, and made it impregnable.  If any were perchance\ndisposed to be jealous and critical before that, they experienced\na change of heart, now.  There was not any one in the kingdom\nwho would have considered it good judgment to meddle with my matters.\n\nI was fast getting adjusted to my situation and circumstances.\nFor a time, I used to wake up, mornings, and smile at my \"dream,\"\nand listen for the Colt's factory whistle; but that sort of thing\nplayed itself out, gradually, and at last I was fully able to realize\nthat I was actually living in the sixth century, and in Arthur's\ncourt, not a lunatic asylum.  After that, I was just as much\nat home in that century as I could have been in any other; and\nas for preference, I wouldn't have traded it for the twentieth.\nLook at the opportunities here for a man of knowledge, brains,\npluck, and enterprise to sail in and grow up with the country.\nThe grandest field that ever was; and all my own; not a competitor;\nnot a man who wasn't a baby to me in acquirements and capacities;\nwhereas, what would I amount to in the twentieth century?  I should\nbe foreman of a factory, that is about all; and could drag a seine\ndown street any day and catch a hundred better men than myself.\n\nWhat a jump I had made!  I couldn't keep from thinking about it,\nand contemplating it, just as one does who has struck oil.  There\nwas nothing back of me that could approach it, unless it might be\nJoseph's case; and Joseph's only approached it, it didn't equal\nit, quite.  For it stands to reason that as Joseph's splendid\nfinancial ingenuities advantaged nobody but the king, the general\npublic must have regarded him with a good deal of disfavor, whereas\nI had done my entire public a kindness in sparing the sun, and was\npopular by reason of it.\n\nI was no shadow of a king; I was the substance; the king himself\nwas the shadow.  My power was colossal; and it was not a mere\nname, as such things have generally been, it was the genuine\narticle.  I stood here, at the very spring and source of the second\ngreat period of the world's history; and could see the trickling\nstream of that history gather and deepen and broaden, and roll\nits mighty tides down the far centuries; and I could note the\nupspringing of adventurers like myself in the shelter of its long\narray of thrones: De Montforts, Gavestons, Mortimers, Villierses;\nthe war-making, campaign-directing wantons of France, and Charles\nthe Second's scepter-wielding drabs; but nowhere in the procession\nwas my full-sized fellow visible.  I was a Unique; and glad to know\nthat that fact could not be dislodged or challenged for thirteen\ncenturies and a half, for sure.  Yes, in power I was equal to\nthe king.  At the same time there was another power that was\na trifle stronger than both of us put together.  That was the Church.\nI do not wish to disguise that fact.  I couldn't, if I wanted to.\nBut never mind about that, now; it will show up, in its proper\nplace, later on.  It didn't cause me any trouble in the beginning\n--at least any of consequence.\n\nWell, it was a curious country, and full of interest.  And the\npeople!  They were the quaintest and simplest and trustingest race;\nwhy, they were nothing but rabbits.  It was pitiful for a person\nborn in a wholesome free atmosphere to listen to their humble\nand hearty outpourings of loyalty toward their king and Church\nand nobility; as if they had any more occasion to love and honor\nking and Church and noble than a slave has to love and honor\nthe lash, or a dog has to love and honor the stranger that kicks him!\nWhy, dear me, _any_ kind of royalty, howsoever modified, _any_ kind\nof aristocracy, howsoever pruned, is rightly an insult; but if you\nare born and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably\nnever find it out for yourself, and don't believe it when somebody\nelse tells you.  It is enough to make a body ashamed of his race\nto think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones\nwithout shadow of right or reason, and the seventh-rate people\nthat have always figured as its aristocracies--a company of monarchs\nand nobles who, as a rule, would have achieved only poverty and\nobscurity if left, like their betters, to their own exertions.\n\nThe most of King Arthur's British nation were slaves, pure and\nsimple, and bore that name, and wore the iron collar on their\nnecks; and the rest were slaves in fact, but without the name;\nthey imagined themselves men and freemen, and called themselves\nso.  The truth was, the nation as a body was in the world for one\nobject, and one only: to grovel before king and Church and noble;\nto slave for them, sweat blood for them, starve that they might\nbe fed, work that they might play, drink misery to the dregs that\nthey might be happy, go naked that they might wear silks and\njewels, pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them,\nbe familiar all their lives with the degrading language and postures\nof adulation that they might walk in pride and think themselves\nthe gods of this world.  And for all this, the thanks they got were\ncuffs and contempt; and so poor-spirited were they that they took\neven this sort of attention as an honor.\n\nInherited ideas are a curious thing, and interesting to observe\nand examine.  I had mine, the king and his people had theirs.\nIn both cases they flowed in ruts worn deep by time and habit,\nand the man who should have proposed to divert them by reason\nand argument would have had a long contract on his hands.  For\ninstance, those people had inherited the idea that all men without\ntitle and a long pedigree, whether they had great natural gifts\nand acquirements or hadn't, were creatures of no more consideration\nthan so many animals, bugs, insects; whereas I had inherited the idea\nthat human daws who can consent to masquerade in the peacock-shams\nof inherited dignities and unearned titles, are of no good but\nto be laughed at.  The way I was looked upon was odd, but it was\nnatural.  You know how the keeper and the public regard the elephant\nin the menagerie: well, that is the idea.  They are full of\nadmiration of his vast bulk and his prodigious strength; they\nspeak with pride of the fact that he can do a hundred marvels\nwhich are far and away beyond their own powers; and they speak\nwith the same pride of the fact that in his wrath he is able\nto drive a thousand men before him.  But does that make him one\nof _them_?  No; the raggedest tramp in the pit would smile at\nthe idea.  He couldn't comprehend it; couldn't take it in; couldn't\nin any remote way conceive of it.  Well, to the king, the nobles,\nand all the nation, down to the very slaves and tramps, I was\njust that kind of an elephant, and nothing more.  I was admired,\nalso feared; but it was as an animal is admired and feared.\nThe animal is not reverenced, neither was I; I was not even\nrespected.  I had no pedigree, no inherited title; so in the king's\nand nobles' eyes I was mere dirt; the people regarded me with\nwonder and awe, but there was no reverence mixed with it; through\nthe force of inherited ideas they were not able to conceive of\nanything being entitled to that except pedigree and lordship.\nThere you see the hand of that awful power, the Roman Catholic\nChurch.  In two or three little centuries it had converted a nation\nof men to a nation of worms.  Before the day of the Church's\nsupremacy in the world, men were men, and held their heads up,\nand had a man's pride and spirit and independence; and what\nof greatness and position a person got, he got mainly by achievement,\nnot by birth.  But then the Church came to the front, with an axe\nto grind; and she was wise, subtle, and knew more than one way\nto skin a cat--or a nation; she invented \"divine right of kings,\"\nand propped it all around, brick by brick, with the Beatitudes\n--wrenching them from their good purpose to make them fortify\nan evil one; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience\nto superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice; she preached (to the\ncommoner) meekness under insult; preached (still to the commoner,\nalways to the commoner) patience, meanness of spirit, non-resistance\nunder oppression; and she introduced heritable ranks and\naristocracies, and taught all the Christian populations of the earth\nto bow down to them and worship them.  Even down to my birth-century\nthat poison was still in the blood of Christendom, and the best\nof English commoners was still content to see his inferiors\nimpudently continuing to hold a number of positions, such as\nlordships and the throne, to which the grotesque laws of his country\ndid not allow him to aspire; in fact, he was not merely contented\nwith this strange condition of things, he was even able to persuade\nhimself that he was proud of it.  It seems to show that there isn't\nanything you can't stand, if you are only born and bred to it.\nOf course that taint, that reverence for rank and title, had been\nin our American blood, too--I know that; but when I left America\nit had disappeared--at least to all intents and purposes.  The\nremnant of it was restricted to the dudes and dudesses.  When\na disease has worked its way down to that level, it may fairly\nbe said to be out of the system.\n\nBut to return to my anomalous position in King Arthur's kingdom.\nHere I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master\nintelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement\nthe one and only actually great man in that whole British world;\nand yet there and then, just as in the remote England of my\nbirth-time, the sheep-witted earl who could claim long descent\nfrom a king's leman, acquired at second-hand from the slums of\nLondon, was a better man than I was.  Such a personage was fawned\nupon in Arthur's realm and reverently looked up to by everybody,\neven though his dispositions were as mean as his intelligence,\nand his morals as base as his lineage.  There were times when\n_he_ could sit down in the king's presence, but I couldn't.  I could\nhave got a title easily enough, and that would have raised me\na large step in everybody's eyes; even in the king's, the giver\nof it.  But I didn't ask for it; and I declined it when it was\noffered.  I couldn't have enjoyed such a thing with my notions;\nand it wouldn't have been fair, anyway, because as far back as\nI could go, our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister.\nI couldn't have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proud\nand set-up over any title except one that should come from the nation\nitself, the only legitimate source; and such an one I hoped to win;\nand in the course of years of honest and honorable endeavor, I did\nwin it and did wear it with a high and clean pride.  This title\nfell casually from the lips of a blacksmith, one day, in a village,\nwas caught up as a happy thought and tossed from mouth to mouth\nwith a laugh and an affirmative vote; in ten days it had swept\nthe kingdom, and was become as familiar as the king's name.  I was\nnever known by any other designation afterward, whether in the\nnation's talk or in grave debate upon matters of state at the\ncouncil-board of the sovereign.  This title, translated into modern\nspeech, would be THE BOSS.  Elected by the nation.  That suited me.\nAnd it was a pretty high title.  There were very few THE'S, and\nI was one of them.  If you spoke of the duke, or the earl, or\nthe bishop, how could anybody tell which one you meant?  But if\nyou spoke of The King or The Queen or The Boss, it was different.\n\nWell, I liked the king, and as king I respected him--respected\nthe office; at least respected it as much as I was capable of\nrespecting any unearned supremacy; but as MEN I looked down upon\nhim and his nobles--privately.  And he and they liked me, and\nrespected my office; but as an animal, without birth or sham title,\nthey looked down upon me--and were not particularly private about it,\neither.  I didn't charge for my opinion about them, and they didn't\ncharge for their opinion about me: the account was square, the\nbooks balanced, everybody was satisfied.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE TOURNAMENT\n\nThey were always having grand tournaments there at Camelot; and\nvery stirring and picturesque and ridiculous human bull-fights\nthey were, too, but just a little wearisome to the practical mind.\nHowever, I was generally on hand--for two reasons: a man must\nnot hold himself aloof from the things which his friends and his\ncommunity have at heart if he would be liked--especially as\na statesman; and both as business man and statesman I wanted\nto study the tournament and see if I couldn't invent an improvement\non it.  That reminds me to remark, in passing, that the very first\nofficial thing I did, in my administration--and it was on the very\nfirst day of it, too--was to start a patent office; for I knew\nthat a country without a patent office and good patent laws was\njust a crab, and couldn't travel any way but sideways or backways.\n\nThings ran along, a tournament nearly every week; and now and then\nthe boys used to want me to take a hand--I mean Sir Launcelot and\nthe rest--but I said I would by and by; no hurry yet, and too much\ngovernment machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a-going.\n\nWe had one tournament which was continued from day to day during\nmore than a week, and as many as five hundred knights took part\nin it, from first to last.  They were weeks gathering.  They came\non horseback from everywhere; from the very ends of the country,\nand even from beyond the sea; and many brought ladies, and all\nbrought squires and troops of servants.  It was a most gaudy and\ngorgeous crowd, as to costumery, and very characteristic of the\ncountry and the time, in the way of high animal spirits, innocent\nindecencies of language, and happy-hearted indifference to morals.\nIt was fight or look on, all day and every day; and sing, gamble,\ndance, carouse half the night every night.  They had a most noble\ngood time.  You never saw such people.  Those banks of beautiful\nladies, shining in their barbaric splendors, would see a knight\nsprawl from his horse in the lists with a lanceshaft the thickness\nof your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting, and instead\nof fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each other for a\nbetter view; only sometimes one would dive into her handkerchief,\nand look ostentatiously broken-hearted, and then you could lay\ntwo to one that there was a scandal there somewhere and she was\nafraid the public hadn't found it out.\n\nThe noise at night would have been annoying to me ordinarily, but\nI didn't mind it in the present circumstances, because it kept me\nfrom hearing the quacks detaching legs and arms from the day's\ncripples.  They ruined an uncommon good old cross-cut saw for me,\nand broke the saw-buck, too, but I let it pass.  And as for my\naxe--well, I made up my mind that the next time I lent an axe\nto a surgeon I would pick my century.\n\nI not only watched this tournament from day to day, but detailed\nan intelligent priest from my Department of Public Morals and\nAgriculture, and ordered him to report it; for it was my purpose\nby and by, when I should have gotten the people along far enough,\nto start a newspaper.  The first thing you want in a new country,\nis a patent office; then work up your school system; and after that,\nout with your paper.  A newspaper has its faults, and plenty of them,\nbut no matter, it's hark from the tomb for a dead nation, and don't\nyou forget it.  You can't resurrect a dead nation without it; there\nisn't any way.  So I wanted to sample things, and be finding out\nwhat sort of reporter-material I might be able to rake together out\nof the sixth century when I should come to need it.\n\nWell, the priest did very well, considering.  He got in all\nthe details, and that is a good thing in a local item: you see,\nhe had kept books for the undertaker-department of his church\nwhen he was younger, and there, you know, the money's in the details;\nthe more details, the more swag: bearers, mutes, candles, prayers\n--everything counts; and if the bereaved don't buy prayers enough\nyou mark up your candles with a forked pencil, and your bill\nshows up all right.  And he had a good knack at getting in the\ncomplimentary thing here and there about a knight that was likely\nto advertise--no, I mean a knight that had influence; and he also\nhad a neat gift of exaggeration, for in his time he had kept door\nfor a pious hermit who lived in a sty and worked miracles.\n\nOf course this novice's report lacked whoop and crash and lurid\ndescription, and therefore wanted the true ring; but its antique\nwording was quaint and sweet and simple, and full of the fragrances\nand flavors of the time, and these little merits made up in a measure\nfor its more important lacks.  Here is an extract from it:\n\n  Then Sir Brian de les Isles and Grummore Grummorsum,\n  knights of the castle, encountered with Sir Aglovale and\n  Sir Tor, and Sir Tor smote down Sir Grummore Grummorsum\n  to the earth.  Then came Sir Carados of the dolorous\n  tower, and Sir Turquine, knights of the castle, and\n  there encountered with them Sir Percivale de Galis\n  and Sir Lamorak de Galis, that were two brethren, and\n  there encountered Sir Percivale with Sir Carados, and\n  either brake their spears unto their hands, and then\n  Sir Turquine with Sir Lamorak, and either of them smote\n  down other, horse and all, to the earth, and either\n  parties rescued other and horsed them again.  And Sir\n  Arnold, and Sir Gauter, knights of the castle,\n  encountered with Sir Brandiles and Sir Kay, and these\n  four knights encountered mightily, and brake their\n  spears to their hands.  Then came Sir Pertolope from\n  the castle, and there encountered with him Sir Lionel,\n  and there Sir Pertolope the green knight smote down Sir\n  Lionel, brother to Sir Launcelot.  All this was marked\n  by noble heralds, who bare him best, and their names.\n  Then Sir Bleobaris brake his spear upon Sir Gareth,\n  but of that stroke Sir Bleobaris fell to the earth.\n  When Sir Galihodin saw that, he bad Sir Gareth keep him,\n  and Sir Gareth smote him to the earth.  Then Sir Galihud\n  gat a spear to avenge his brother, and in the same wise\n  Sir Gareth served him, and Sir Dinadan and his brother\n  La Cote Male Taile, and Sir Sagramore le Disirous, and\n  Sir Dodinas le Savage; all these he bare down with one\n  spear.  When King Aswisance of Ireland saw Sir Gareth\n  fare so he marvelled what he might be, that one time\n  seemed green, and another time, at his again coming,\n  he seemed blue.  And thus at every course that he rode\n  to and fro he changed his color, so that there might\n  neither king nor knight have ready cognizance of him.\n  Then Sir Agwisance the King of Ireland encountered\n  with Sir Gareth, and there Sir Gareth smote him from\n  his horse, saddle and all.  And then came King Carados\n  of Scotland, and Sir Gareth smote him down horse and\n  man.  And in the same wise he served King Uriens of the\n  land of Gore.  And then there came in Sir Bagdemagus,\n  and Sir Gareth smote him down horse and man to the\n  earth.  And Bagdemagus's son Meliganus brake a spear\n  upon Sir Gareth mightily and knightly.  And then Sir\n  Galahault the noble prince cried on high, Knight with\n  the many colors, well hast thou justed; now make thee\n  ready that I may just with thee.  Sir Gareth heard him,\n  and he gat a great spear, and so they encountered\n  together, and there the prince brake his spear; but Sir\n  Gareth smote him upon the left side of the helm, that\n  he reeled here and there, and he had fallen down had not\n  his men recovered him.  Truly, said King Arthur, that\n  knight with the many colors is a good knight.  Wherefore\n  the king called unto him Sir Launcelot, and prayed him\n  to encounter with that knight.  Sir, said Launcelot, I\n  may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at\n  this time, for he hath had travail enough this day, and\n  when a good knight doth so well upon some day, it is\n  no good knight's part to let him of his worship, and,\n  namely, when he seeth a knight hath done so great\n  labour; for peradventure, said Sir Launcelot, his\n  quarrel is here this day, and peradventure he is best\n  beloved with this lady of all that be here, for I see\n  well he paineth himself and enforceth him to do great\n  deeds, and therefore, said Sir Launcelot, as for me,\n  this day he shall have the honour; though it lay in my\n  power to put him from it, I would not.\n\nThere was an unpleasant little episode that day, which for reasons\nof state I struck out of my priest's report.  You will have noticed\nthat Garry was doing some great fighting in the engagement.  When\nI say Garry I mean Sir Gareth.  Garry was my private pet name\nfor him; it suggests that I had a deep affection for him, and that\nwas the case.  But it was a private pet name only, and never spoken\naloud to any one, much less to him; being a noble, he would not\nhave endured a familiarity like that from me.  Well, to proceed:\nI sat in the private box set apart for me as the king's minister.\nWhile Sir Dinadan was waiting for his turn to enter the lists,\nhe came in there and sat down and began to talk; for he was always\nmaking up to me, because I was a stranger and he liked to have\na fresh market for his jokes, the most of them having reached that\nstage of wear where the teller has to do the laughing himself while\nthe other person looks sick.  I had always responded to his efforts\nas well as I could, and felt a very deep and real kindness for him,\ntoo, for the reason that if by malice of fate he knew the one\nparticular anecdote which I had heard oftenest and had most hated\nand most loathed all my life, he had at least spared it me.  It was\none which I had heard attributed to every humorous person who\nhad ever stood on American soil, from Columbus down to Artemus Ward.\nIt was about a humorous lecturer who flooded an ignorant audience\nwith the killingest jokes for an hour and never got a laugh; and\nthen when he was leaving, some gray simpletons wrung him gratefully\nby the hand and said it had been the funniest thing they had ever\nheard, and \"it was all they could do to keep from laughin' right\nout in meetin'.\"  That anecdote never saw the day that it was\nworth the telling; and yet I had sat under the telling of it\nhundreds and thousands and millions and billions of times, and\ncried and cursed all the way through.  Then who can hope to know\nwhat my feelings were, to hear this armor-plated ass start in on\nit again, in the murky twilight of tradition, before the dawn of\nhistory, while even Lactantius might be referred to as \"the late\nLactantius,\" and the Crusades wouldn't be born for five hundred\nyears yet?  Just as he finished, the call-boy came; so, haw-hawing\nlike a demon, he went rattling and clanking out like a crate of\nloose castings, and I knew nothing more.  It was some minutes\nbefore I came to, and then I opened my eyes just in time to see\nSir Gareth fetch him an awful welt, and I unconsciously out with\nthe prayer, \"I hope to gracious he's killed!\"  But by ill-luck,\nbefore I had got half through with the words, Sir Gareth crashed\ninto Sir Sagramor le Desirous and sent him thundering over his\nhorse's crupper, and Sir Sagramor caught my remark and thought\nI meant it for _him_.\n\nWell, whenever one of those people got a thing into his head,\nthere was no getting it out again.  I knew that, so I saved my\nbreath, and offered no explanations.  As soon as Sir Sagramor\ngot well, he notified me that there was a little account to settle\nbetween us, and he named a day three or four years in the future;\nplace of settlement, the lists where the offense had been given.\nI said I would be ready when he got back.  You see, he was going\nfor the Holy Grail.  The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail\nnow and then.  It was a several years' cruise.  They always put in\nthe long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way,\nthough none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was,\nand I don't think any of them actually expected to find it, or\nwould have known what to do with it if he _had_ run across it.\nYou see, it was just the Northwest Passage of that day, as you may\nsay; that was all.  Every year expeditions went out holy grailing,\nand next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for _them_.  There\nwas worlds of reputation in it, but no money.  Why, they actually\nwanted _me_ to put in!  Well, I should smile.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nBEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION\n\nThe Round Table soon heard of the challenge, and of course it was\na good deal discussed, for such things interested the boys.\nThe king thought I ought now to set forth in quest of adventures,\nso that I might gain renown and be the more worthy to meet\nSir Sagramor when the several years should have rolled away.\nI excused myself for the present; I said it would take me three\nor four years yet to get things well fixed up and going smoothly;\nthen I should be ready; all the chances were that at the end of\nthat time Sir Sagramor would still be out grailing, so no valuable\ntime would be lost by the postponement; I should then have been\nin office six or seven years, and I believed my system and machinery\nwould be so well developed that I could take a holiday without\nits working any harm.\n\nI was pretty well satisfied with what I had already accomplished.\nIn various quiet nooks and corners I had the beginnings of all\nsorts of industries under way--nuclei of future vast factories,\nthe iron and steel missionaries of my future civilization.  In these\nwere gathered together the brightest young minds I could find,\nand I kept agents out raking the country for more, all the time.\nI was training a crowd of ignorant folk into experts--experts\nin every sort of handiwork and scientific calling.  These nurseries\nof mine went smoothly and privately along undisturbed in their\nobscure country retreats, for nobody was allowed to come into their\nprecincts without a special permit--for I was afraid of the Church.\n\nI had started a teacher-factory and a lot of Sunday-schools the\nfirst thing; as a result, I now had an admirable system of graded\nschools in full blast in those places, and also a complete variety\nof Protestant congregations all in a prosperous and growing\ncondition.  Everybody could be any kind of a Christian he wanted\nto; there was perfect freedom in that matter.  But I confined public\nreligious teaching to the churches and the Sunday-schools, permitting\nnothing of it in my other educational buildings.  I could have\ngiven my own sect the preference and made everybody a Presbyterian\nwithout any trouble, but that would have been to affront a law\nof human nature: spiritual wants and instincts are as various in\nthe human family as are physical appetites, complexions, and\nfeatures, and a man is only at his best, morally, when he is\nequipped with the religious garment whose color and shape and\nsize most nicely accommodate themselves to the spiritual complexion,\nangularities, and stature of the individual who wears it; and,\nbesides, I was afraid of a united Church; it makes a mighty power,\nthe mightiest conceivable, and then when it by and by gets into\nselfish hands, as it is always bound to do, it means death to\nhuman liberty and paralysis to human thought.\n\nAll mines were royal property, and there were a good many of them.\nThey had formerly been worked as savages always work mines--holes\ngrubbed in the earth and the mineral brought up in sacks of hide by\nhand, at the rate of a ton a day; but I had begun to put the mining\non a scientific basis as early as I could.\n\nYes, I had made pretty handsome progress when Sir Sagramor's\nchallenge struck me.\n\nFour years rolled by--and then!  Well, you would never imagine\nit in the world.  Unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in\nsafe hands.  The despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect\ngovernment.  An earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect\nearthly government, if the conditions were the same, namely, the\ndespot the perfectest individual of the human race, and his lease\nof life perpetual.  But as a perishable perfect man must die, and\nleave his despotism in the hands of an imperfect successor, an\nearthly despotism is not merely a bad form of government, it is\nthe worst form that is possible.\n\nMy works showed what a despot could do with the resources of\na kingdom at his command.  Unsuspected by this dark land, I had\nthe civilization of the nineteenth century booming under its very\nnose!  It was fenced away from the public view, but there it was,\na gigantic and unassailable fact--and to be heard from, yet, if\nI lived and had luck.  There it was, as sure a fact and as substantial\na fact as any serene volcano, standing innocent with its smokeless\nsummit in the blue sky and giving no sign of the rising hell in its\nbowels.  My schools and churches were children four years before;\nthey were grown-up now; my shops of that day were vast factories\nnow; where I had a dozen trained men then, I had a thousand now;\nwhere I had one brilliant expert then, I had fifty now.  I stood\nwith my hand on the cock, so to speak, ready to turn it on and\nflood the midnight world with light at any moment.  But I was not\ngoing to do the thing in that sudden way.  It was not my policy.\nThe people could not have stood it; and, moreover, I should have\nhad the Established Roman Catholic Church on my back in a minute.\n\nNo, I had been going cautiously all the while.  I had had confidential\nagents trickling through the country some time, whose office was\nto undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees, and to gnaw\na little at this and that and the other superstition, and so prepare\nthe way gradually for a better order of things.  I was turning on\nmy light one-candle-power at a time, and meant to continue to do so.\n\nI had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom,\nand they were doing very well.  I meant to work this racket more\nand more, as time wore on, if nothing occurred to frighten me.\nOne of my deepest secrets was my West Point--my military academy.\nI kept that most jealously out of sight; and I did the same with my\nnaval academy which I had established at a remote seaport.  Both\nwere prospering to my satisfaction.\n\nClarence was twenty-two now, and was my head executive, my right\nhand.  He was a darling; he was equal to anything; there wasn't\nanything he couldn't turn his hand to.  Of late I had been training\nhim for journalism, for the time seemed about right for a start\nin the newspaper line; nothing big, but just a small weekly for\nexperimental circulation in my civilization-nurseries.  He took\nto it like a duck; there was an editor concealed in him, sure.\nAlready he had doubled himself in one way; he talked sixth century\nand wrote nineteenth.  His journalistic style was climbing,\nsteadily; it was already up to the back settlement Alabama mark,\nand couldn't be told from the editorial output of that region\neither by matter or flavor.\n\nWe had another large departure on hand, too.  This was a telegraph\nand a telephone; our first venture in this line.  These wires were\nfor private service only, as yet, and must be kept private until\na riper day should come.  We had a gang of men on the road, working\nmainly by night.  They were stringing ground wires; we were afraid\nto put up poles, for they would attract too much inquiry.  Ground\nwires were good enough, in both instances, for my wires were\nprotected by an insulation of my own invention which was perfect.\nMy men had orders to strike across country, avoiding roads, and\nestablishing connection with any considerable towns whose lights\nbetrayed their presence, and leaving experts in charge. Nobody\ncould tell you how to find any place in the kingdom, for nobody\never went intentionally to any place, but only struck it by\naccident in his wanderings, and then generally left it without\nthinking to inquire what its name was.  At one time and another\nwe had sent out topographical expeditions to survey and map the\nkingdom, but the priests had always interfered and raised trouble.\nSo we had given the thing up, for the present; it would be poor\nwisdom to antagonize the Church.\n\nAs for the general condition of the country, it was as it had been\nwhen I arrived in it, to all intents and purposes.  I had made\nchanges, but they were necessarily slight, and they were not\nnoticeable.  Thus far, I had not even meddled with taxation,\noutside of the taxes which provided the royal revenues.  I had\nsystematized those, and put the service on an effective and\nrighteous basis.  As a result, these revenues were already quadrupled,\nand yet the burden was so much more equably distributed than\nbefore, that all the kingdom felt a sense of relief, and the praises\nof my administration were hearty and general.\n\nPersonally, I struck an interruption, now, but I did not mind it,\nit could not have happened at a better time.  Earlier it could\nhave annoyed me, but now everything was in good hands and swimming\nright along.  The king had reminded me several times, of late, that\nthe postponement I had asked for, four years before, had about\nrun out now.  It was a hint that I ought to be starting out to seek\nadventures and get up a reputation of a size to make me worthy\nof the honor of breaking a lance with Sir Sagramor, who was still\nout grailing, but was being hunted for by various relief expeditions,\nand might be found any year, now.  So you see I was expecting\nthis interruption; it did not take me by surprise.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE YANKEE IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURES\n\nThere never was such a country for wandering liars; and they were\nof both sexes.  Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps\narriving; and generally loaded with a tale about some princess or\nother wanting help to get her out of some far-away castle where\nshe was held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel, usually a giant.\nNow you would think that the first thing the king would do after\nlistening to such a novelette from an entire stranger, would be\nto ask for credentials--yes, and a pointer or two as to locality\nof castle, best route to it, and so on.  But nobody ever thought\nof so simple and common-sense a thing at that.  No, everybody\nswallowed these people's lies whole, and never asked a question\nof any sort or about anything.  Well, one day when I was not\naround, one of these people came along--it was a she one, this\ntime--and told a tale of the usual pattern.  Her mistress was\na captive in a vast and gloomy castle, along with forty-four other\nyoung and beautiful girls, pretty much all of them princesses;\nthey had been languishing in that cruel captivity for twenty-six\nyears; the masters of the castle were three stupendous brothers,\neach with four arms and one eye--the eye in the center of the\nforehead, and as big as a fruit.  Sort of fruit not mentioned;\ntheir usual slovenliness in statistics.\n\nWould you believe it?  The king and the whole Round Table were\nin raptures over this preposterous opportunity for adventure.\nEvery knight of the Table jumped for the chance, and begged for it;\nbut to their vexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me,\nwho had not asked for it at all.\n\nBy an effort, I contained my joy when Clarence brought me the news.\nBut he--he could not contain his.  His mouth gushed delight and\ngratitude in a steady discharge--delight in my good fortune,\ngratitude to the king for this splendid mark of his favor for me.\nHe could keep neither his legs nor his body still, but pirouetted\nabout the place in an airy ecstasy of happiness.\n\nOn my side, I could have cursed the kindness that conferred upon\nme this benefaction, but I kept my vexation under the surface\nfor policy's sake, and did what I could to let on to be glad.\nIndeed, I _said_ I was glad.  And in a way it was true; I was as\nglad as a person is when he is scalped.\n\nWell, one must make the best of things, and not waste time with\nuseless fretting, but get down to business and see what can be\ndone.  In all lies there is wheat among the chaff; I must get at\nthe wheat in this case: so I sent for the girl and she came.  She\nwas a comely enough creature, and soft and modest, but, if signs\nwent for anything, she didn't know as much as a lady's watch.  I said:\n\n\"My dear, have you been questioned as to particulars?\"\n\nShe said she hadn't.\n\n\"Well, I didn't expect you had, but I thought I would ask, to make\nsure; it's the way I've been raised.  Now you mustn't take it\nunkindly if I remind you that as we don't know you, we must go\na little slow.  You may be all right, of course, and we'll hope\nthat you are; but to take it for granted isn't business.  _You_\nunderstand that.  I'm obliged to ask you a few questions; just\nanswer up fair and square, and don't be afraid.  Where do you\nlive, when you are at home?\"\n\n\"In the land of Moder, fair sir.\"\n\n\"Land of Moder.  I don't remember hearing of it before.\nParents living?\"\n\n\"As to that, I know not if they be yet on live, sith it is many\nyears that I have lain shut up in the castle.\"\n\n\"Your name, please?\"\n\n\"I hight the Demoiselle Alisande la Carteloise, an it please you.\"\n\n\"Do you know anybody here who can identify you?\"\n\n\"That were not likely, fair lord, I being come hither now for\nthe first time.\"\n\n\"Have you brought any letters--any documents--any proofs that\nyou are trustworthy and truthful?\"\n\n\"Of a surety, no; and wherefore should I?  Have I not a tongue,\nand cannot I say all that myself?\"\n\n\"But _your_ saying it, you know, and somebody else's saying it,\nis different.\"\n\n\"Different?  How might that be?  I fear me I do not understand.\"\n\n\"Don't _understand_?  Land of--why, you see--you see--why, great Scott,\ncan't you understand a little thing like that?  Can't you understand\nthe difference between your--_why_ do you look so innocent and idiotic!\"\n\n\"I?  In truth I know not, but an it were the will of God.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I reckon that's about the size of it.  Don't mind my\nseeming excited; I'm not.  Let us change the subject.  Now as\nto this castle, with forty-five princesses in it, and three ogres\nat the head of it, tell me--where is this harem?\"\n\n\"Harem?\"\n\n\"The _castle_, you understand; where is the castle?\"\n\n\"Oh, as to that, it is great, and strong, and well beseen, and\nlieth in a far country.  Yes, it is many leagues.\"\n\n\"_How_ many?\"\n\n\"Ah, fair sir, it were woundily hard to tell, they are so many,\nand do so lap the one upon the other, and being made all in the\nsame image and tincted with the same color, one may not know\nthe one league from its fellow, nor how to count them except\nthey be taken apart, and ye wit well it were God's work to do\nthat, being not within man's capacity; for ye will note--\"\n\n\"Hold on, hold on, never mind about the distance; _whereabouts_\ndoes the castle lie?  What's the direction from here?\"\n\n\"Ah, please you sir, it hath no direction from here; by reason\nthat the road lieth not straight, but turneth evermore; wherefore\nthe direction of its place abideth not, but is some time under\nthe one sky and anon under another, whereso if ye be minded that\nit is in the east, and wend thitherward, ye shall observe that\nthe way of the road doth yet again turn upon itself by the space\nof half a circle, and this marvel happing again and yet again and\nstill again, it will grieve you that you had thought by vanities\nof the mind to thwart and bring to naught the will of Him that\ngiveth not a castle a direction from a place except it pleaseth\nHim, and if it please Him not, will the rather that even all castles\nand all directions thereunto vanish out of the earth, leaving the\nplaces wherein they tarried desolate and vacant, so warning His\ncreatures that where He will He will, and where He will not He--\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right, that's all right, give us a rest; never mind\nabout the direction, _hang_ the direction--I beg pardon, I beg\na thousand pardons, I am not well to-day; pay no attention when\nI soliloquize, it is an old habit, an old, bad habit, and hard\nto get rid of when one's digestion is all disordered with eating\nfood that was raised forever and ever before he was born; good\nland! a man can't keep his functions regular on spring chickens\nthirteen hundred years old.  But come--never mind about that;\nlet's--have you got such a thing as a map of that region about\nyou?  Now a good map--\"\n\n\"Is it peradventure that manner of thing which of late the unbelievers\nhave brought from over the great seas, which, being boiled in oil,\nand an onion and salt added thereto, doth--\"\n\n\"What, a map?  What are you talking about?  Don't you know what\na map is?  There, there, never mind, don't explain, I hate\nexplanations; they fog a thing up so that you can't tell anything\nabout it.  Run along, dear; good-day; show her the way, Clarence.\"\n\nOh, well, it was reasonably plain, now, why these donkeys didn't\nprospect these liars for details.  It may be that this girl had\na fact in her somewhere, but I don't believe you could have sluiced\nit out with a hydraulic; nor got it with the earlier forms of\nblasting, even; it was a case for dynamite.  Why, she was a perfect\nass; and yet the king and his knights had listened to her as if\nshe had been a leaf out of the gospel.  It kind of sizes up the\nwhole party.  And think of the simple ways of this court: this\nwandering wench hadn't any more trouble to get access to the king\nin his palace than she would have had to get into the poorhouse\nin my day and country.  In fact, he was glad to see her, glad\nto hear her tale; with that adventure of hers to offer, she was\nas welcome as a corpse is to a coroner.\n\nJust as I was ending-up these reflections, Clarence came back.\nI remarked upon the barren result of my efforts with the girl;\nhadn't got hold of a single point that could help me to find\nthe castle.  The youth looked a little surprised, or puzzled,\nor something, and intimated that he had been wondering to himself\nwhat I had wanted to ask the girl all those questions for.\n\n\"Why, great guns,\" I said, \"don't I want to find the castle?  And\nhow else would I go about it?\"\n\n\"La, sweet your worship, one may lightly answer that, I ween.\nShe will go with thee.  They always do.  She will ride with thee.\"\n\n\"Ride with me?  Nonsense!\"\n\n\"But of a truth she will.  She will ride with thee.  Thou shalt see.\"\n\n\"What?  She browse around the hills and scour the woods with me\n--alone--and I as good as engaged to be married?  Why, it's scandalous.\nThink how it would look.\"\n\nMy, the dear face that rose before me!  The boy was eager to know\nall about this tender matter.  I swore him to secrecy and then\nwhispered her name--\"Puss Flanagan.\"  He looked disappointed,\nand said he didn't remember the countess.  How natural it was for\nthe little courtier to give her a rank.  He asked me where she lived.\n\n\"In East Har--\" I came to myself and stopped, a little confused;\nthen I said, \"Never mind, now; I'll tell you some time.\"\n\nAnd might he see her?  Would I let him see her some day?\n\nIt was but a little thing to promise--thirteen hundred years\nor so--and he so eager; so I said Yes.  But I sighed; I couldn't\nhelp it.  And yet there was no sense in sighing, for she wasn't\nborn yet.  But that is the way we are made: we don't reason,\nwhere we feel; we just feel.\n\nMy expedition was all the talk that day and that night, and the\nboys were very good to me, and made much of me, and seemed to have\nforgotten their vexation and disappointment, and come to be as\nanxious for me to hive those ogres and set those ripe old virgins\nloose as if it were themselves that had the contract.  Well, they\n_were_ good children--but just children, that is all.  And they\ngave me no end of points about how to scout for giants, and how\nto scoop them in; and they told me all sorts of charms against\nenchantments, and gave me salves and other rubbish to put on my\nwounds.  But it never occurred to one of them to reflect that if\nI was such a wonderful necromancer as I was pretending to be,\nI ought not to need salves or instructions, or charms against\nenchantments, and, least of all, arms and armor, on a foray of any\nkind--even against fire-spouting dragons, and devils hot from\nperdition, let alone such poor adversaries as these I was after,\nthese commonplace ogres of the back settlements.\n\nI was to have an early breakfast, and start at dawn, for that was\nthe usual way; but I had the demon's own time with my armor,\nand this delayed me a little.  It is troublesome to get into, and\nthere is so much detail.  First you wrap a layer or two of blanket\naround your body, for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold\niron; then you put on your sleeves and shirt of chain mail--these\nare made of small steel links woven together, and they form a fabric\nso flexible that if you toss your shirt onto the floor, it slumps\ninto a pile like a peck of wet fish-net; it is very heavy and\nis nearly the uncomfortablest material in the world for a night\nshirt, yet plenty used it for that--tax collectors, and reformers,\nand one-horse kings with a defective title, and those sorts of\npeople; then you put on your shoes--flat-boats roofed over with\ninterleaving bands of steel--and screw your clumsy spurs into\nthe heels.  Next you buckle your greaves on your legs, and your\ncuisses on your thighs; then come your backplate and your breastplate,\nand you begin to feel crowded; then you hitch onto the breastplate\nthe half-petticoat of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs\ndown in front but is scolloped out behind so you can sit down,\nand isn't any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle, either\nfor looks or for wear, or to wipe your hands on; next you belt\non your sword; then you put your stove-pipe joints onto your arms,\nyour iron gauntlets onto your hands, your iron rat-trap onto your\nhead, with a rag of steel web hitched onto it to hang over the back\nof your neck--and there you are, snug as a candle in a candle-mould.\nThis is no time to dance.  Well, a man that is packed away like\nthat is a nut that isn't worth the cracking, there is so little of\nthe meat, when you get down to it, by comparison with the shell.\n\nThe boys helped me, or I never could have got in.  Just as we\nfinished, Sir Bedivere happened in, and I saw that as like as not\nI hadn't chosen the most convenient outfit for a long trip.  How\nstately he looked; and tall and broad and grand.  He had on his\nhead a conical steel casque that only came down to his ears, and\nfor visor had only a narrow steel bar that extended down to his\nupper lip and protected his nose; and all the rest of him, from\nneck to heel, was flexible chain mail, trousers and all.  But\npretty much all of him was hidden under his outside garment, which\nof course was of chain mail, as I said, and hung straight from his\nshoulders to his ankles; and from his middle to the bottom, both\nbefore and behind, was divided, so that he could ride and let the\nskirts hang down on each side.  He was going grailing, and it was\njust the outfit for it, too.  I would have given a good deal for\nthat ulster, but it was too late now to be fooling around.  The sun\nwas just up, the king and the court were all on hand to see me off\nand wish me luck; so it wouldn't be etiquette for me to tarry.\nYou don't get on your horse yourself; no, if you tried it you\nwould get disappointed.  They carry you out, just as they carry\na sun-struck man to the drug store, and put you on, and help get\nyou to rights, and fix your feet in the stirrups; and all the while\nyou do feel so strange and stuffy and like somebody else--like\nsomebody that has been married on a sudden, or struck by lightning,\nor something like that, and hasn't quite fetched around yet, and\nis sort of numb, and can't just get his bearings.  Then they\nstood up the mast they called a spear, in its socket by my left\nfoot, and I gripped it with my hand; lastly they hung my shield\naround my neck, and I was all complete and ready to up anchor\nand get to sea.  Everybody was as good to me as they could be,\nand a maid of honor gave me the stirrup-cup her own self.  There was\nnothing more to do now, but for that damsel to get up behind me on\na pillion, which she did, and put an arm or so around me to hold on.\n\nAnd so we started, and everybody gave us a goodbye and waved their\nhandkerchiefs or helmets.  And everybody we met, going down the hill\nand through the village was respectful to us, except some shabby\nlittle boys on the outskirts.  They said:\n\n\"Oh, what a guy!\"  And hove clods at us.\n\nIn my experience boys are the same in all ages.  They don't respect\nanything, they don't care for anything or anybody.  They say\n\"Go up, baldhead\" to the prophet going his unoffending way in\nthe gray of antiquity; they sass me in the holy gloom of the\nMiddle Ages; and I had seen them act the same way in Buchanan's\nadministration; I remember, because I was there and helped.  The\nprophet had his bears and settled with his boys; and I wanted\nto get down and settle with mine, but it wouldn't answer, because\nI couldn't have got up again.  I hate a country without a derrick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
