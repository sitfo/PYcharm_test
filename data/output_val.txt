A man who is not born with the novel-writing gift has a troublesome time
of it when he tries to build a novel. I know this from experience. He
has no clear idea of his story; in fact he has no story. He merely has
some people in his mind, and an incident or two, also a locality. He
knows these people, he knows the selected locality, and he trusts
that he can plunge those people into those incidents with interesting
results. So he goes to work. To write a novel? No--that is a thought
which comes later; in the beginning he is only proposing to tell a
little tale; a very little tale; a six-page tale. But as it is a tale
which he is not acquainted with, and can only find out what it is by
listening as it goes along telling itself, it is more than apt to go
on and on and on till it spreads itself into a book. I know about this,
because it has happened to me so many times.

And I have noticed another thing: that as the short tale grows into a
long tale, the original intention (or motif) is apt to get abolished and
find itself superseded by a quite different one. It was so in the
case of a magazine sketch which I once started to write--a funny and
fantastic sketch about a prince and a pauper; it presently assumed a
grave cast of its own accord, and in that new shape spread itself out
into a book. Much the same thing happened with Pudd'nhead Wilson. I
had a sufficiently hard time with that tale, because it changed itself
from a farce to a tragedy while I was going along with it--a most
embarrassing circumstance. But what was a great deal worse was, that it
was not one story, but two stories tangled together; and they obstructed
and interrupted each other at every turn and created no end of confusion
and annoyance. I could not offer the book for publication, for I was
afraid it would unseat the reader's reason. I did not know what was the
matter with it, for I had not noticed, as yet, that it was two stories
in one. It took me months to make that discovery. I carried the
manuscript back and forth across the Atlantic two or three times, and
read it and studied over it on shipboard; and at last I saw where the
difficulty lay. I had no further trouble. I pulled one of the stories
out by the roots, and left the other one--a kind of literary Caesarean
operation.

Would the reader care to know something about the story which I pulled
out? He has been told many a time how the born-and-trained novelist
works. Won't he let me round and complete his knowledge by telling him
how the jack-leg does it?

Originally the story was called Those Extraordinary Twins. I meant to
make it very short. I had seen a picture of a youthful Italian freak
 or freaks which was--or which were--on exhibition in our cities--a
combination consisting of two heads and four arms joined to a single
body and a single pair of legs--and I thought I would write an
extravagantly fantastic little story with this freak of nature for
hero--or heroes--a silly young miss for heroine, and two old ladies and
two boys for the minor parts. I lavishly elaborated these people
and their doings, of course. But the tale kept spreading along, and
spreading along, and other people got to intruding themselves and taking
up more and more room with their talk and their affairs. Among them
came a stranger named Pudd'nhead Wilson, and a woman named Roxana; and
presently the doings of these two pushed up into prominence a young
fellow named Tom Driscoll, whose proper place was away in the obscure
background. Before the book was half finished those three were taking
things almost entirely into their own hands and working the whole tale
as a private venture of their own--a tale which they had nothing at all
to do with, by rights.

When the book was finished and I came to look around to see what had
become of the team I had originally started out with--Aunt Patsy Cooper,
Aunt Betsy Hale, the two boys, and Rowena the light-weight heroine--they
were nowhere to be seen; they had disappeared from the story some time
or other. I hunted about and found them--found them stranded, idle,
forgotten, and permanently useless. It was very awkward. It was awkward
all around; but more particularly in the case of Rowena, because there
was a love-match on, between her and one of the twins that constituted
the freak, and I had worked it up to a blistering heat and thrown in
a quite dramatic love-quarrel, wherein Rowena scathingly denounced her
betrothed for getting drunk, and scoffed at his explanation of how it
had happened, and wouldn't listen to it, and had driven him from her in
the usual forever way; and now here she sat crying and broken-hearted;
for she had found that he had spoken only the truth; that it was not he,
but the other half of the freak, that had drunk the liquor that made him
drunk; that her half was a prohibitionist and had never drunk a drop
in his life, and, although tight as a brick three days in the week, was
wholly innocent of blame; and indeed, when sober, was constantly doing
all he could to reform his brother, the other half, who never got any
satisfaction out of drinking, anyway, because liquor never affected him.
Yes, here she was, stranded with that deep injustice of hers torturing
her poor torn heart.

I didn't know what to do with her. I was as sorry for her as anybody
could be, but the campaign was over, the book was finished, she was
sidetracked, and there was no possible way of crowding her in, anywhere.
I could not leave her there, of course; it would not do. After spreading
her out so, and making such a to-do over her affairs, it would be
absolutely necessary to account to the reader for her. I thought and
thought and studied and studied; but I arrived at nothing. I finally saw
plainly that there was really no way but one--I must simply give her the
grand bounce. It grieved me to do it, for after associating with her so
much I had come to kind of like her after a fashion, notwithstanding
she was such an ass and said such stupid irritating things and was so
nauseatingly sentimental. Still it had to be done. So, at the top of
Chapter XVII, I put in a Calendar remark concerning July the Fourth,
and began the chapter with this statistic:

Rowena went out in the back yard after supper to see the fireworks and
fell down the well and got drowned.

It seemed abrupt, but I thought maybe the reader wouldn't notice it,
because I changed the subject right away to something else. Anyway it
loosened up Rowena from where she was stuck and got her out of the way,
and that was the main thing. It seemed a prompt good way of weeding
out people that had got stalled, and a plenty good enough way for those
others; so I hunted up the two boys and said they went out back one
night to stone the cat and fell down the well and got drowned. Next
I searched around and found old Aunt Patsy Cooper and Aunt Betsy Hale
where they were aground, and said they went out back one night to visit
the sick and fell down the well and got drowned. I was going to drown
some of the others, but I gave up the idea, partly because I believed
that if I kept that up it would arouse attention, and perhaps sympathy
with those people, and partly because it was not a large well and would
not hold any more anyway.

Still the story was unsatisfactory. Here was a set of new characters who
were become inordinately prominent and who persisted in remaining so to
the end; and back yonder was an older set who made a large noise and a
great to-do for a little while and then suddenly played out utterly and
fell down the well. There was a radical defect somewhere, and I must
search it out and cure it.

The defect turned out to be the one already spoken of--two stories
in one, a farce and a tragedy. So I pulled out the farce and left the
tragedy. This left the original team in, but only as mere names, not as
characters. Their prominence was wholly gone; they were not even worth
drowning; so I removed that detail. Also I took those twins apart and
made two separate men of them. They had no occasion to have foreign
names now, but it was too much trouble to remove them all through, so I
left them christened as they were and made no explanation.




CHAPTER I. THE TWINS AS THEY REALLY WERE

The conglomerate twins were brought on the stage in Chapter I of the
original extravaganza. Aunt Patsy Cooper has received their letter
applying for board and lodging, and Rowena, her daughter, insane with
joy, is begging for a hearing of it:

Well, set down then, and be quiet a minute and don't fly around so; it
fairly makes me tired to see you. It starts off so: 'HONORED MADAM'--

I like that, ma, don't you? It shows they're high-bred.

Yes, I noticed that when I first read it. 'My brother and I have seen
your advertisement, by chance, in a copy of your local journal'

It's so beautiful and smooth, ma-don't you think so?

Yes, seems so to me--'and beg leave to take the room you offer. We are
twenty-four years of age, and twins--'

Twins! How sweet! I do hope they are handsome, and I just know they
are! Don't you hope they are, ma?

Land, I ain't particular. 'We are Italians by birth--'

It's so romantic! Just think there's never been one in this town, and
everybody will want to see them, and they're all ours! Think of that!

--'but have lived long in the various countries of Europe, and several
years in the United States.'

Oh, just think what wonders they've seen, ma! Won't it be good to hear
them talk?

I reckon so; yes, I reckon so. 'Our names are Luigi and Angelo
Capello--'

Beautiful, perfectly beautiful! Not like Jones and Robinson and those
horrible names.

'You desire but one guest, but dear madam, if you will allow us to pay
for two we will not discommode you. We will sleep together in the same
bed. We have always been used to this, and prefer it.' And then he goes
on to say they will be down Thursday.

And this is Tuesday--I don't know how I'm ever going to wait, ma! The
time does drag along so, and I'm so dying to see them! Which of them do
you reckon is the tallest, ma?

How do you s'pose I can tell, child? Mostly they are the same
size-twins are.

'Well then, which do you reckon is the best looking?

Goodness knows--I don't.

I think Angelo is; it's the prettiest name, anyway. Don't you think
it's a sweet name, ma?

Yes, it's well enough. I'd like both of them better if I knew the way
to pronounce them--the Eyetalian way, I mean. The Missouri way and the
Eyetalian way is different, I judge.

Maybe--yes. It's Luigi that writes the letter. What do you reckon is
the reason Angelo didn't write it?

Why, how can I tell? What's the difference who writes it, so long as
it's done?

Oh, I hope it wasn't because he is sick! You don't think he is sick, do
you, ma?

Sick your granny; what's to make him sick?

Oh, there's never any telling. These foreigners with that kind of names
are so delicate, and of course that kind of names are not suited to our
climate--you wouldn't expect it.

[And so-on and so-on, no end. The time drags along; Thursday comes: the
boat arrives in a pouring storm toward midnight.]

At last there was a knock at the door and the anxious family jumped to
open it. Two negro men entered, each carrying a trunk, and proceeded
upstairs toward the guest-room. Then followed a stupefying apparition--a
double-headed human creature with four arms, one body, and a single
pair of legs! It--or they, as you please--bowed with elaborate foreign
formality, but the Coopers could not respond immediately; they were
paralyzed. At this moment there came from the rear of the group a
fervent ejaculation--My lan'!--followed by a crash of crockery,
and the slave-wench Nancy stood petrified and staring, with a tray
of wrecked tea-things at her feet. The incident broke the spell,
and brought the family to consciousness. The beautiful heads of the
new-comer bowed again, and one of them said with easy grace and dignity:

I crave the honor, madam and miss, to introduce to you my brother,
Count Luigi Capello, (the other head bowed) and myself--Count Angelo;
and at the same time offer sincere apologies for the lateness of our
coming, which was unavoidable, and both heads bowed again.

The poor old lady was in a whirl of amazement and confusion, but she
managed to stammer out:

I'm sure I'm glad to make your acquaintance, sir--I mean, gentlemen.
As for the delay, it is nothing, don't mention it. This is my daughter
Rowena, sir--gentlemen. Please step into the parlor and sit down
and have a bite and sup; you are dreadful wet and must be
uncomfortable--both of you, I mean.

But to the old lady's relief they courteously excused themselves, saying
it would be wrong to keep the family out of their beds longer; then each
head bowed in turn and uttered a friendly good night, and the singular
figure moved away in the wake of Rowena's small brothers, who bore
candles, and disappeared up the stairs.

The widow tottered into the parlor and sank into a chair with a gasp,
and Rowena followed, tongue-tied and dazed. The two sat silent in the
throbbing summer heat unconscious of the million-voiced music of the
mosquitoes, unconscious of the roaring gale, the lashing and thrashing
of the rain along the windows and the roof, the white glare of the
lightning, the tumultuous booming and bellowing of the thunder;
conscious of nothing but that prodigy, that uncanny apparition that
had come and gone so suddenly--that weird strange thing that was so
soft-spoken and so gentle of manner and yet had shaken them up like an
earthquake with the shock of its gruesome aspect. At last a cold little
shudder quivered along down the widow's meager frame and she said in a
weak voice:

Ugh, it was awful just the mere look of that phillipene!

Rowena did not answer. Her faculties were still caked; she had not yet
found her voice. Presently the widow said, a little resentfully:

Always been used to sleeping together--in-fact, prefer it. And I was
thinking it was to accommodate me. I thought it was very good of them,
whereas a person situated as that young man is--

Ma, you oughtn't to begin by getting up a prejudice against him. I'm
sure he is good-hearted and means well. Both of his faces show it.

I'm not so certain about that. The one on the left--I mean the one on
it's left--hasn't near as good a face, in my opinion, as its brother.

That's Luigi.

Yes, Luigi; anyway it's the dark-skinned one; the one that was west of
his brother when they stood in the door. Up to all kinds of mischief
and disobedience when he was a boy, I'll be bound. I lay his mother had
trouble to lay her hand on him when she wanted him. But the one on the
right is as good as gold, I can see that.

That's Angelo.

Yes, Angelo, I reckon, though I can't tell t'other from which by their
names, yet awhile. But it's the right-hand one--the blond one. He has
such kind blue eyes, and curly copper hair and fresh complexion--

And such a noble face!--oh, it is a noble face, ma, just royal, you may
say! And beautiful deary me, how beautiful! But both are that; the dark
one's as beautiful as--a picture. There's no such wonderful faces
and handsome heads in this town none that even begin. And such hands,
especially Angelo's--so shapely and--

Stuff, how could you tell which they belonged to?--they had gloves on.

Why, didn't I see them take off their hats?

That don't signify. They might have taken off each other's hats. Nobody
could tell. There was just a wormy squirming of arms in the air--seemed
to be a couple of dozen of them, all writhing at once, and it just made
me dizzy to see them go.

Why, ma, I hadn't any difficulty. There's two arms on each shoulder--

There, now. One arm on each shoulder belongs to each of the creatures,
don't it? For a person to have two arms on one shoulder wouldn't do him
any good, would it? Of course not. Each has an arm on each shoulder. Now
then, you tell me which of them belongs to which, if you can. They don't
know, themselves--they just work whichever arm comes handy. Of course
they do; especially if they are in a hurry and can't stop to think which
belongs to which.

The mother seemed to have the rights of the argument, so the daughter
abandoned the struggle. Presently the widow rose with a yawn and said:

Poor thing, I hope it won't catch cold; it was powerful wet, just
drenched, you may say. I hope it has left its boots outside, so they can
be dried.

Then she gave a little start, and looked perplexed.

Now I remember I heard one of them ask Joe to call him at half after
seven--I think it was the one on the left--no, it was the one to the
east of the other one--but I didn't hear the other one say any thing.
I wonder if he wants to be called too. Do you reckon it's too late to
ask?

Why, ma, it's not necessary. Calling one is calling both. If one gets
up, the other's got to.

Sho, of course; I never thought of that. Well, come along, maybe we can
get some sleep, but I don't know, I'm so shook up with what we've been
through.

The stranger had made an impression on the boys, too. They had a word of
talk as they were getting to bed. Henry, the gentle, the humane, said:

I feel ever so sorry for it, don't you, Joe?

But Joe was a boy of this world, active, enterprising, and had a
theatrical side to him:

Sorry? Why, how you talk! It can't stir a step without attracting
attention. It's just grand!

Henry said, reproachfully:

Instead of pitying it, Joe, you talk as if--

Talk as if what? I know one thing mighty certain: if you can fix me so
I can eat for two and only have to stub toes for one, I ain't going to
fool away no such chance just for sentiment.

The twins were wet and tired, and they proceeded to undress without any
preliminary remarks. The abundance of sleeve made the partnership coat
hard to get off, for it was like skinning a tarantula; but it came at
last, after much tugging and perspiring. The mutual vest followed. Then
the brothers stood up before the glass, and each took off his own cravat
and collar. The collars were of the standing kind, and came high up
under the ears, like the sides of a wheelbarrow, as required by the
fashion of the day. The cravats were as broad as a bankbill, with
fringed ends which stood far out to right and left like the wings of a
dragon-fly, and this also was strictly in accordance with the fashion of
the time. Each cravat, as to color, was in perfect taste, so far as its
owner's complexion was concerned--a delicate pink, in the case of the
blond brother, a violent scarlet in the case of the brunette--but as
a combination they broke all the laws of taste known to civilization.
Nothing more fiendish and irreconcilable than those shrieking and
blaspheming colors could have been contrived. The wet boots gave no
end of trouble--to Luigi. When they were off at last, Angelo said, with
bitterness:

I wish you wouldn't wear such tight boots, they hurt my feet.

Luigi answered with indifference:

My friend, when I am in command of our body, I choose my apparel
according to my own convenience, as I have remarked more than several
times already. When you are in command, I beg you will do as you
please.

Angelo was hurt, and the tears came into his eyes. There was gentle
reproach in his voice, but, not anger, when he replied:

Luigi, I often consult your wishes, but you never consult mine. When
I am in command I treat you as a guest; I try to make you feel at home;
when you are in command you treat me as an intruder, you make me feel
unwelcome. It embarrasses me cruelly in company, for I can see that
people notice it and comment on it.

Oh, damn the people, responded the brother languidly, and with the air
of one who is tired of the subject.

A slight shudder shook the frame of Angelo, but he said nothing and the
conversation ceased. Each buttoned his own share of the nightshirt in
silence; then Luigi, with Paine's Age of Reason in his hand, sat down
in one chair and put his feet in another and lit his pipe, while Angelo
took his Whole Duty of Man, and both began to read. Angelo presently
began to cough; his coughing increased and became mixed with gaspings
for breath, and he was finally obliged to make an appeal to his
brother's humanity:

Luigi, if you would only smoke a little milder tobacco, I am sure I
could learn not to mind it in time, but this is so strong, and the pipe
is so rank that--

Angelo, I wouldn't be such a baby! I have learned to smoke in a week,
and the trouble is already over with me; if you would try, you could
learn too, and then you would stop spoiling my comfort with your
everlasting complaints.

Ah, brother, that is a strong word--everlasting--and isn't quite fair.
I only complain when I suffocate; you know I don't complain when we are
in the open air.

Well, anyway, you could learn to smoke yourself.

But my principles, Luigi, you forget my principles. You would not have
me do a thing which I regard as a sin?

Oh, bosh!

The conversation ceased again, for Angelo was sick and discouraged and
strangling; but after some time he closed his book and asked Luigi to
sing From Greenland's Icy Mountains with him, but he would not,
and when he tried to sing by himself Luigi did his best to drown
his plaintive tenor with a rude and rollicking song delivered in a
thundering bass.

After the singing there was silence, and neither brother was happy.
Before blowing the light out Luigi swallowed half a tumbler of whisky,
and Angelo, whose sensitive organization could not endure intoxicants of
any kind, took a pill to keep it from giving him the headache.




CHAPTER II. MA COOPER GETS ALL MIXED UP

The family sat in the breakfast-room waiting for the twins to come down.
The widow was quiet, the daughter was alive with happy excitement. She
said:

Ah, they're a boon, ma, just a boon! Don't you think so?

Laws, I hope so, I don't know.

Why, ma, yes you do. They're so fine and handsome, and high-bred and
polite, so every way superior to our gawks here in this village;
why, they'll make life different from what it was--so humdrum
and commonplace, you know--oh, you may be sure they're full of
accomplishments, and knowledge of the world, and all that, that will be
an immense advantage to society here. Don't you think so, ma?

Mercy on me, how should I know, and I've hardly set eyes on them yet.
 After a pause she added, They made considerable noise after they went
up.

Noise? Why, ma, they were singing! And it was beautiful, too.

Oh, it was well enough, but too mixed-up, seemed to me.

Now, ma, honor bright, did you ever hear 'Greenland's Icy Mountains'
sung sweeter--now did you?

If it had been sung by itself, it would have been uncommon sweet, I
don't deny it; but what they wanted to mix it up with 'Old Bob Ridley'
for, I can't make out. Why, they don't go together, at all. They are not
of the same nature. 'Bob Ridley' is a common rackety slam-bang secular
song, one of the rippingest and rantingest and noisiest there is. I am
no judge of music, and I don't claim it, but in my opinion nobody can
make those two songs go together right.

Why, ma, I thought--

It don't make any difference what you thought, it can't be done. They
tried it, and to my mind it was a failure. I never heard such a crazy
uproar; seemed to me, sometimes, the roof would come off; and as for the
cats--well, I've lived a many a year, and seen cats aggravated in more
ways than one, but I've never seen cats take on the way they took on
last night.

Well, I don't think that that goes for anything, ma, because it is the
nature of cats that any sound that is unusual--

Unusual! You may well call it so. Now if they are going to sing duets
every night, I do hope they will both sing the same tune at the same
time, for in my opinion a duet that is made up of two different tunes is
a mistake; especially when the tunes ain't any kin to one another, that
way.

But, ma, I think it must be a foreign custom; and it must be right too;
and the best way, because they have had every opportunity to know what
is right, and it don't stand to reason that with their education
they would do anything but what the highest musical authorities have
sanctioned. You can't help but admit that, ma.

The argument was formidably strong; the old lady could not find any way
around it; so, after thinking it over awhile she gave in with a sigh
of discontent, and admitted that the daughter's position was probably
correct. Being vanquished, she had no mind to continue the topic at
that disadvantage, and was about to seek a change when a change came of
itself. A footstep was heard on the stairs, and she said:

There-he's coming!

They, ma--you ought to say they--it's nearer right.

The new lodger, rather shoutingly dressed but looking superbly handsome,
stepped with courtly carnage into the trim little breakfast-room and put
out all his cordial arms at once, like one of those pocket-knives with
a multiplicity of blades, and shook hands with the whole family
simultaneously. He was so easy and pleasant and hearty that all
embarrassment presently thawed away and disappeared, and a cheery
feeling of friendliness and comradeship took its place. He--or
preferably they--were asked to occupy the seat of honor at the foot of
the table. They consented with thanks, and carved the beefsteak with one
set of their hands while they distributed it at the same time with the
other set.

Will you have coffee, gentlemen, or tea?

Coffee for Luigi, if you please, madam, tea for me.

Cream and sugar?

For me, yes, madam; Luigi takes his coffee, black. Our natures differ a
good deal from each other, and our tastes also.

The first time the negro girl Nancy appeared in the door and saw the two
heads turned in opposite directions and both talking at once, then saw
the commingling arms feed potatoes into one mouth and coffee into the
other at the same time, she had to pause and pull herself out of a
faintness that came over her; but after that she held her grip and was
able to wait on the table with fair courage.

Conversation fell naturally into the customary grooves. It was a little
jerky, at first, because none of the family could get smoothly through
a sentence without a wabble in it here and a break there, caused by some
new surprise in the way of attitude or gesture on the part of the twins.
The weather suffered the most. The weather was all finished up and
disposed of, as a subject, before the simple Missourians had gotten
sufficiently wonted to the spectacle of one body feeding two heads to
feel composed and reconciled in the presence of so bizarre a miracle.
And even after everybody's mind became tranquilized there was still one
slight distraction left: the hand that picked up a biscuit carried it to
the wrong head, as often as any other way, and the wrong mouth devoured
it. This was a puzzling thing, and marred the talk a little. It bothered
the widow to such a degree that she presently dropped out of the
conversation without knowing it, and fell to watching and guessing and
talking to herself:

Now that hand is going to take that coffee to--no, it's gone to the
other mouth; I can't understand it; and Now, here is the dark-complected
hand with a potato in its fork, I'll see what goes with it--there, the
light-complected head's got it, as sure as I live!

Finally Rowena said:

Ma, what is the matter with you? Are you dreaming about something?

The old lady came to herself and blushed; then she explained with the
first random thing that came into her mind: I saw Mr. Angelo take up
Mr. Luigi's coffee, and I thought maybe he--sha'n't I give you a cup,
Mr. Angelo?

Oh no, madam, I am very much obliged, but I never drink coffee, much as
I would like to. You did see me take up Luigi's cup, it is true, but if
you noticed, I didn't carry it to my mouth, but to his.

Y-es, I thought you did: Did you mean to?

How?

The widow was a little embarrassed again. She said:

I don't know but what I'm foolish, and you mustn't mind; but you see,
he got the coffee I was expecting to see you drink, and you got a potato
that I thought he was going to get. So I thought it might be a mistake
all around, and everybody getting what wasn't intended for him.

Both twins laughed and Luigi said:

Dear madam, there wasn't any mistake. We are always helping each other
that way. It is a great economy for us both; it saves time and labor.
We have a system of signs which nobody can notice or understand but
ourselves. If I am using both my hands and want some coffee, I make the
sign and Angelo furnishes it to me; and you saw that when he needed a
potato I delivered it.

How convenient!

Yes, and often of the extremest value. Take the Mississippi boats, for
instance. They are always overcrowded. There is table-room for only half
of the passengers, therefore they have to set a second table for the
second half. The stewards rush both parties, they give them no time to
eat a satisfying meal, both divisions leave the table hungry. It isn't
so with us. Angelo books himself for the one table, I book myself for
the other. Neither of us eats anything at the other's table, but just
simply works--works. Thus, you see there are four hands to feed Angelo,
and the same four to feed me. Each of us eats two meals.

The old lady was dazed with admiration, and kept saying, It is
perfectly wonderful, perfectly wonderful and the boy Joe licked his
chops enviously, but said nothing--at least aloud.

Yes, continued Luigi, our construction may have its disadvantages--in
fact, HAS--but it also has its compensations of one sort and another.
Take travel, for instance. Travel is enormously expensive, in all
countries; we have been obliged to do a vast deal of it--come, Angelo,
don't put any more sugar in your tea, I'm just over one indigestion and
don't want another right away--been obliged to do a deal of it, as I was
saying. Well, we always travel as one person, since we occupy but one
seat; so we save half the fare.

How romantic! interjected Rowena, with effusion.

Yes, my dear young lady, and how practical too, and economical.
In Europe, beds in the hotels are not charged with the board, but
separately--another saving, for we stood to our rights and paid for the
one bed only. The landlords often insisted that as both of us occupied
the bed we ought--

No, they didn't, said Angelo. They did it only twice, and in both
cases it was a double bed--a rare thing in Europe--and the double
bed gave them some excuse. Be fair to the landlords; twice doesn't
constitute 'often.'

Well, that depends--that depends. I knew a man who fell down a well
twice. He said he didn't mind the first time, but he thought the second
time was once too often. Have I misused that word, Mrs. Cooper?

To tell the truth, I was afraid you had, but it seems to look, now,
like you hadn't. She stopped, and was evidently struggling with the
difficult problem a moment, then she added in the tone of one who is
convinced without being converted, It seems so, but I can't somehow
tell why.

Rowena thought Luigi's retort was wonderfully quick and bright, and she
remarked to herself with satisfaction that there wasn't any young native
of Dawson's Landing that could have risen to the occasion like that.
Luigi detected the applause in her face, and expressed his pleasure and
his thanks with his eyes; and so eloquently withal, that the girl was
proud and pleased, and hung out the delicate sign of it on her cheeks.
Luigi went on, with animation:

Both of us get a bath for one ticket, theater seat for one ticket,
pew-rent is on the same basis, but at peep-shows we pay double.

We have much to be thankful for, said Angelo, impressively, with a
reverent light in his eye and a reminiscent tone in his voice, we have
been greatly blessed. As a rule, what one of us has lacked, the other,
by the bounty of Providence, has been able to supply. My brother is
hardy, I am not; he is very masculine, assertive, aggressive; I am
much less so. I am subject to illness, he is never ill. I cannot abide
medicines, and cannot take them, but he has no prejudice against them,
and--

Why, goodness gracious, interrupted the widow, when you are sick,
does he take the medicine for you?

Always, madam.

Why, I never heard such a thing in my life! I think it's beautiful of
you.

Oh, madam, it's nothing, don't mention it, it's really nothing at all.

But I say it's beautiful, and I stick to it! cried the widow, with a
speaking moisture in her eye.

A well brother to take the medicine for his poor sick brother--I wish
I had such a son, and she glanced reproachfully at her boys. I declare
I'll never rest till I've shook you by the hand, and she scrambled out
of her chair in a fever of generous enthusiasm, and made for the twins,
blind with her tears, and began to shake. The boy Joe corrected her:
You're shaking the wrong one, ma.

This flurried her, but she made a swift change and went on shaking.

Got the wrong one again, ma, said the boy.

Oh, shut up, can't you! said the widow, embarrassed and irritated.
Give me all your hands, I want to shake them all; for I know you are
both just as good as you can be.

It was a victorious thought, a master-stroke of diplomacy, though that
never occurred to her and she cared nothing for diplomacy. She shook the
four hands in turn cordially, and went back to her place in a state of
high and fine exultation that made her look young and handsome.

Indeed I owe everything to Luigi, said Angelo, affectionately.
But for him I could not have survived our boyhood days, when we were
friendless and poor--ah, so poor! We lived from hand to mouth-lived on
the coarse fare of unwilling charity, and for weeks and weeks together
not a morsel of food passed my lips, for its character revolted me and I
could not eat it. But for Luigi I should have died. He ate for us both.

How noble! sighed Rowena.

Do you hear that? said the widow, severely, to her boys. Let it be an
example to you--I mean you, Joe.

Joe gave his head a barely perceptible disparaging toss and said: Et
for both. It ain't anything I'd 'a' done it.

Hush, if you haven't got any better manners than that. You don't see
the point at all. It wasn't good food.

I don't care--it was food, and I'd 'a' et it if it was rotten.

Shame! Such language! Can't you understand? They were
starving--actually starving--and he ate for both, and--

Shucks! you gimme a chance and I'll--

There, now--close your head! and don't you open it again till you're
asked.

     [Angelo goes on and tells how his parents the Count and Countess had
     to fly from Florence for political reasons, and died poor in Berlin
     bereft of their great property by confiscation; and how he and Luigi
     had to travel with a freak-show during two years and suffer
     semi-starvation.]

That hateful black-bread; but I seldom ate anything during that time;
that was poor Luigi's affair--

I'll never Mister him again! cried the widow, with strong emotion,
he's Luigi to me, from this out!

Thank you a thousand times, madam, a thousand times! though in truth I
don't deserve it.

Ah, Luigi is always the fortunate one when honors are showering, said
Angelo, plaintively; now what have I done, Mrs. Cooper, that you leave
me out? Come, you must strain a point in my favor.

Call you Angelo? Why, certainly I will; what are you thinking of! In
the case of twins, why--

But, ma, you're breaking up the story--do let him go on.

You keep still, Rowena Cooper, and he can go on all the better, I
reckon. One interruption don't hurt, it's two that makes the trouble.

But you've added one, now, and that is three.

Rowena! I will not allow you to talk back at me when you have got
nothing rational to say.




CHAPTER III. ANGELO IS BLUE

[After breakfast the whole village crowded in, and there was a grand
reception in honor of the twins; and at the close of it the gifted
freak captured everybody's admiration by sitting down at the piano and
knocking out a classic four-handed piece in great style. Then the judge
took it--or them--driving in his buggy and showed off his village.]

All along the streets the people crowded the windows and stared at the
amazing twins. Troops of small boys flocked after the buggy, excited and
yelling. At first the dogs showed no interest. They thought they merely
saw three men in a buggy--a matter of no consequence; but when they
found out the facts of the case, they altered their opinion pretty
radically, and joined the boys, expressing their minds as they came.
Other dogs got interested; indeed, all the dogs. It was a spirited sight
to see them come leaping fences, tearing around corners, swarming out
of every bystreet and alley. The noise they made was something beyond
belief--or praise. They did not seem to be moved by malice but only by
prejudice, the common human prejudice against lack of conformity. If the
twins turned their heads, they broke and fled in every direction, but
stopped at a safe distance and faced about; and then formed and came
on again as soon as the strangers showed them their back. Negroes and
farmers' wives took to the woods when the buggy came upon them suddenly,
and altogether the drive was pleasant and animated, and a refreshment
all around.

     [It was a long and lively drive.  Angelo was a Methodist, Luigi was
     a Free-thinker.  The judge was very proud of his Freethinkers'
     Society, which was flourishing along in a most prosperous way and
     already had two members--himself and the obscure and neglected
     Pudd'nhead Wilson.  It was to meet that evening, and he invited
     Luigi to join; a thing which Luigi was glad to do, partly because it
     would please himself, and partly because it would gravel Angelo.]

They had now arrived at the widow's gate, and the excursion was ended.
The twins politely expressed their obligations for the pleasant outing
which had been afforded them; to which the judge bowed his thanks, and
then said he would now go and arrange for the Free-thinkers' meeting,
and would call for Count Luigi in the evening.

For you also, dear sir, he added hastily, turning to Angelo and
bowing. In addressing myself particularly to your brother, I was not
meaning to leave you out. It was an unintentional rudeness, I assure
you, and due wholly to accident--accident and preoccupation. I beg you
to forgive me.

His quick eye had seen the sensitive blood mount into Angelo's face,
betraying the wound that had been inflicted. The sting of the slight had
gone deep, but the apology was so prompt, and so evidently sincere, that
the hurt was almost immediately healed, and a forgiving smile testified
to the kindly judge that all was well again.

Concealed behind Angelo's modest and unassuming exterior, and
unsuspected by any but his intimates, was a lofty pride, a pride of
almost abnormal proportions, indeed, and this rendered him ever the prey
of slights; and although they were almost always imaginary ones, they
hurt none the less on that account. By ill fortune judge Driscoll
had happened to touch his sorest point, i.e., his conviction that his
brother's presence was welcomer everywhere than his own; that he was
often invited, out of mere courtesy, where only his brother was
wanted, and that in a majority of cases he would not be included in an
invitation if he could be left out without offense. A sensitive nature
like this is necessarily subject to moods; moods which traverse the
whole gamut of feeling; moods which know all the climes of emotion, from
the sunny heights of joy to the black abysses of despair. At times, in
his seasons of deepest depressions, Angelo almost wished that he and
his brother might become segregated from each other and be separate
individuals, like other men. But of course as soon as his mind cleared
and these diseased imaginings passed away, he shuddered at the repulsive
thought, and earnestly prayed that it might visit him no more. To
be separate, and as other men are! How awkward it would seem; how
unendurable. What would he do with his hands, his arms? How would his
legs feel? How odd, and strange, and grotesque every action, attitude,
movement, gesture would be. To sleep by himself, eat by himself, walk by
himself--how lonely, how unspeakably lonely! No, no, any fate but that.
In every way and from every point, the idea was revolting.

This was of course natural; to have felt otherwise would have been
unnatural. He had known no life but a combined one; he had been familiar
with it from his birth; he was not able to conceive of any other as
being agreeable, or even bearable. To him, in the privacy of his
secret thoughts, all other men were monsters, deformities: and during
three-fourths of his life their aspect had filled him with what promised
to be an unconquerable aversion. But at eighteen his eye began to take
note of female beauty; and little by little, undefined longings grew up
in his heart, under whose softening influences the old stubborn
aversion gradually diminished, and finally disappeared. Men were still
monstrosities to him, still deformities, and in his sober moments he had
no desire to be like them, but their strange and unsocial and uncanny
construction was no longer offensive to him.

This had been a hard day for him, physically and mentally. He had been
called in the morning before he had quite slept off the effects of the
liquor which Luigi had drunk; and so, for the first half-hour had had
the seedy feeling, and languor, the brooding depression, the cobwebby
mouth and druggy taste that come of dissipation and are so ill a
preparation for bodily or intellectual activities; the long violent
strain of the reception had followed; and this had been followed, in
turn, by the dreary sight-seeing, the judge's wearying explanations and
laudations of the sights, and the stupefying clamor of the dogs. As
a congruous conclusion, a fitting end, his feelings had been hurt, a
slight had been put upon him. He would have been glad to forego dinner
and betake himself to rest and sleep, but he held his peace and said no
word, for he knew his brother, Luigi, was fresh, unweary, full of life,
spirit, energy; he would have scoffed at the idea of wasting valuable
time on a bed or a sofa, and would have refused permission.




CHAPTER IV. SUPERNATURAL CHRONOMETRY

Rowena was dining out, Joe and Harry were belated at play, there
were but three chairs and four persons that noon at the home
dinner-table--the twins, the widow, and her chum, Aunt Betsy Hale. The
widow soon perceived that Angelo's spirits were as low as Luigi's were
high, and also that he had a jaded look. Her motherly solicitude was
aroused, and she tried to get him interested in the talk and win him
to a happier frame of mind, but the cloud of sadness remained on his
countenance. Luigi lent his help, too. He used a form and a phrase which
he was always accustomed to employ in these circumstances. He gave his
brother an affectionate slap on the shoulder and said, encouragingly:

Cheer up, the worst is yet to come!

But this did no good. It never did. If anything, it made the matter
worse, as a rule, because it irritated Angelo. This made it a favorite
with Luigi. By and by the widow said:

Angelo, you are tired, you've overdone yourself; you go right to bed
after dinner, and get a good nap and a rest, then you'll be all right.

Indeed, I would give anything if I could do that, madam.

And what's to hender, I'd like to know? Land, the room's yours to do
what you please with! The idea that you can't do what you like with your
own!

But, you see, there's one prime essential--an essential of the very
first importance--which isn't my own.

What is that?

My body.

The old ladies looked puzzled, and Aunt Betsy Hale said:

Why bless your heart, how is that?

It's my brother's.

Your brother's! I don't quite understand. I supposed it belonged to
both of you.

So it does. But not to both at the same time.

That is mighty curious; I don't see how it can be. I shouldn't think it
could be managed that way.

Oh, it's a good enough arrangement, and goes very well; in fact, it
wouldn't do to have it otherwise. I find that the teetotalers and the
anti-teetotalers hire the use of the same hall for their meetings. Both
parties don't use it at the same time, do they?

You bet they don't! said both old ladies in a breath.

And, moreover, said Aunt Betsy, the Freethinkers and the Baptist
Bible class use the same room over the Market house, but you can take my
word for it they don't mush up together and use it at the same time.'

Very well, said Angelo, you understand it now. And it stands to
reason that the arrangement couldn't be improved. I'll prove it to you.
If our legs tried to obey two wills, how could we ever get anywhere? I
would start one way, Luigi would start another, at the same moment--the
result would be a standstill, wouldn't it?

As sure as you are born! Now ain't that wonderful! A body would never
have thought of it.

We should always be arguing and fussing and disputing over the merest
trifles. We should lose worlds of time, for we couldn't go down-stairs
or up, couldn't go to bed, couldn't rise, couldn't wash, couldn't dress,
couldn't stand up, couldn't sit down, couldn't even cross our legs,
without calling a meeting first and explaining the case and passing
resolutions, and getting consent. It wouldn't ever do--now would it?

Do? Why, it would wear a person out in a week! Did you ever hear
anything like it, Patsy Cooper?

Oh, you'll find there's more than one thing about them that ain't
commonplace, said the widow, with the complacent air of a person with a
property right in a novelty that is under admiring scrutiny.

Well, now, how ever do you manage it? I don't mind saying I'm suffering
to know.

He who made us, said Angelo reverently, and with us this difficulty,
also provided a way out of it. By a mysterious law of our being, each of
us has utter and indisputable command of our body a week at a time, turn
and turn about.

Well, I never! Now ain't that beautiful!

Yes, it is beautiful and infinitely wise and just. The week ends every
Saturday at midnight to the minute, to the second, to the last shade of
a fraction of a second, infallibly, unerringly, and in that instant the
one brother's power over the body vanishes and the other brother takes
possession, asleep or awake.

How marvelous are His ways, and past finding out!

Luigi said: So exactly to the instant does the change come, that during
our stay in many of the great cities of the world, the public clocks
were regulated by it; and as hundreds of thousands of private clocks and
watches were set and corrected in accordance with the public clocks, we
really furnished the standard time for the entire city.

Don't tell me that He don't do miracles any more! Blowing down the
walls of Jericho with rams' horns wa'n't as difficult, in my opinion.

And that is not all, said Angelo. A thing that is even more
marvelous, perhaps, is the fact that the change takes note of longitude
and fits itself to the meridian we are on. Luigi is in command this
week. Now, if on Saturday night at a moment before midnight we could
fly in an instant to a point fifteen degrees west of here, he would hold
possession of the power another hour, for the change observes local time
and no other.

Betsy Hale was deeply impressed, and said with solemnity:

Patsy Cooper, for detail it lays over the Passage of the Red Sea.

Now, I shouldn't go as far as that, said Aunt Patsy, but if you've a
mind to say Sodom and Gomorrah, I am with you, Betsy Hale.

I am agreeable, then, though I do think I was right, and I believe
Parson Maltby would say the same. Well, now, there's another thing.
Suppose one of you wants to borrow the legs a minute from the one that's
got them, could he let him?

Yes, but we hardly ever do that. There were disagreeable results,
several times, and so we very seldom ask or grant the privilege,
nowadays, and we never even think of such a thing unless the case is
extremely urgent. Besides, a week's possession at a time seems so little
that we can't bear to spare a minute of it. People who have the use of
their legs all the time never think of what a blessing it is, of course.
It never occurs to them; it's just their natural ordinary condition,
and so it does not excite them at all. But when I wake up, on Sunday
morning, and it's my week and I feel the power all through me, oh, such
a wave of exultation and thanksgiving goes surging over me, and I want
to shout 'I can walk! I can walk!' Madam, do you ever, at your uprising,
want to shout 'I can walk! I can walk!'?

No, you poor unfortunate cretur', but I'll never get out of my bed
again without doing it! Laws, to think I've had this unspeakable
blessing all my long life and never had the grace to thank the good Lord
that gave it to me!

Tears stood in the eyes of both the old ladies and the widow said,
softly:

Betsy Hale, we have learned something, you and me.

The conversation now drifted wide, but by and by floated back once more
to that admired detail, the rigid and beautiful impartiality with which
the possession of power had been distributed, between the twins. Aunt
Betsy saw in it a far finer justice than human law exhibits in related
cases. She said:

In my opinion it ain't right noW, and never has been right, the way a
twin born a quarter of a minute sooner than the other one gets all the
land and grandeurs and nobilities in the old countries and his brother
has to go bare and be a nobody. Which of you was born first?

Angelo's head was resting against Luigi's; weariness had overcome him,
and for the past five minutes he had been peacefully sleeping. The old
ladies had dropped their voices to a lulling drone, to help him to steal
the rest his brother wouldn't take him up-stairs to get. Luigi listened
a moment to Angelo's regular breathing, then said in a voice barely
audible:

We were both born at the same time, but I am six months older than he
is.

For the land's sake!

'Sh! don't wake him up; he wouldn't like my telling this. It has always
been kept secret till now.

But how in the world can it be? If you were both born at the same time,
how can one of you be older than the other?

It is very simple, and I assure you it is true. I was born with a full
crop of hair, he was as bald as an egg for six months. I could walk six
months before he could make a step. I finished teething six months ahead
of him. I began to take solids six months before he left the breast.
I began to talk six months before he could say a word. Last, and
absolutely unassailable proof, the sutures in my skull closed six months
ahead of his. Always just that six months' difference to a day. Was that
accident? Nobody is going to claim that, I'm sure. It was ordained--it
was law--it had its meaning, and we know what that meaning was. Now what
does this overwhelming body of evidence establish? It establishes
just one thing, and that thing it establishes beyond any peradventure
whatever. Friends, we would not have it known for the world, and I must
beg you to keep it strictly to yourselves, but the truth is, we are no
more twins than you are.

The two old ladies were stunned, paralyzed--petrified, one may almost
say--and could only sit and gaze vacantly at each other for some
moments; then Aunt Betsy Hale said impressively:

There's no getting around proof like that. I do believe it's the most
amazing thing I ever heard of. She sat silent a moment or two and
breathing hard with excitement, then she looked up and surveyed the
strangers steadfastly a little while, and added: Well, it does beat me,
but I would have took you for twins anywhere.

So would I, so would I, said Aunt Patsy with the emphasis of a
certainty that is not impaired by any shade of doubt.

Anybody would-anybody in the world, I don't care who he is, said Aunt
Betsy with decision.

You won't tell, said Luigi, appealingly.

Oh, dear, no! answered both ladies promptly, you can trust us, don't
you be afraid.

That is good of you, and kind. Never let on; treat us always as if we
were twins.

You can depend on us, said Aunt Betsy, but it won't be easy, because
now that I know you ain't you don't seem so.

Luigi muttered to himself with satisfaction: That swindle has gone
through without change of cars.

It was not very kind of him to load the poor things up with a secret
like that, which would be always flying to their tongues' ends every
time they heard any one speak of the strangers as twins, and would
become harder and harder to hang on to with every recurrence of the
temptation to tell it, while the torture of retaining it would increase
with every new strain that was applied; but he never thought of that,
and probably would not have worried much about it if he had.

A visitor was announced--some one to see the twins. They withdrew to
the parlor, and the two old ladies began to discuss with interest the
strange things which they had been listening to. When they had finished
the matter to their satisfaction, and Aunt Betsy rose to go, she stopped
to ask a question:

How does things come on between Roweny and Tom Driscoll?

Well, about the same. He writes tolerable often, and she answers
tolerable seldom.

Where is he?

In St. Louis, I believe, though he's such a gadabout that a body can't
be very certain of him, I reckon.

Don't Roweny know?

Oh, yes, like enough. I haven't asked her lately.

Do you know how him and the judge are getting along now?

First rate, I believe. Mrs. Pratt says so; and being right in the
house, and sister to the one and aunt to t'other, of course she ought to
know. She says the judge is real fond of him when he's away; but frets
when he's around and is vexed with his ways, and not sorry to have him
go again. He has been gone three weeks this time--a pleasant thing for
both of them, I reckon.

Tom's rather harum-scarum, but there ain't anything bad in him, I
guess.

Oh, no, he's just young, that's all. Still, twenty-three is old, in
one way. A young man ought to be earning his living by that time. If Tom
were doing that, or was even trying to do it, the judge would be a heap
better satisfied with him. Tom's always going to begin, but somehow he
can't seem to find just the opening he likes.

Well, now, it's partly the judge's own fault. Promising the boy his
property wasn't the way to set him to earning a fortune of his own. But
what do you think--is Roweny beginning to lean any toward him, or ain't
she?

Aunt Patsy had a secret in her bosom; she wanted to keep it there, but
nature was too strong for her. She drew Aunt Betsy aside, and said in
her most confidential and mysterious manner:

Don't you breathe a syllable to a soul--I'm going to tell you
something. In my opinion Tom Driscoll's chances were considerable better
yesterday than they are to-day.

Patsy Cooper, what do you mean?

It's so, as sure as you're born. I wish you could 'a' been at breakfast
and seen for yourself.

You don't mean it!

Well, if I'm any judge, there's a leaning--there's a leaning, sure.

My land! Which one of 'em is it?

I can't say for certain, but I think it's the youngest one--Anjy.

Then there were hand-shakings, and congratulations, and hopes, and
so on, and the old ladies parted, perfectly happy--the one in knowing
something which the rest of the town didn't, and the other in having
been the sole person able to furnish that knowledge.

The visitor who had called to see the twins was the Rev. Mr. Hotchkiss,
pastor of the Baptist church. At the reception Angelo had told him he
had lately experienced a change in his religious views, and was
now desirous of becoming a Baptist, and would immediately join Mr.
Hotchkiss's church. There was no time to say more, and the brief talk
ended at that point. The minister was much gratified, and had dropped in
for a moment now, to invite the twins to attend his Bible class at eight
that evening. Angelo accepted, and was expecting Luigi to decline, but
he did not, because he knew that the Bible class and the Freethinkers
met in the same room, and he wanted to treat his brother to the
embarrassment of being caught in free-thinking company.




CHAPTER V. GUILT AND INNOCENCE FINELY BLENT

[A long and vigorous quarrel follows, between the twins. And there is
plenty to quarrel about, for Angelo was always seeking truth, and this
obliged him to change and improve his religion with frequency, which
wearied Luigi, and annoyed him too; for he had to be present at each new
enlistment--which placed him in the false position of seeming to indorse
and approve his brother's fickleness; moreover, he had to go to Angelo's
prohibition meetings, and he hated them. On the other hand, when it was
his week to command the legs he gave Angelo just cause of complaint, for
he took him to circuses and horse-races and fandangoes, exposing him to
all sorts of censure and criticism; and he drank, too; and whatever
he drank went to Angelo's head instead of his own and made him
act disgracefully. When the evening was come, the two attended the
Free-thinkers' meeting, where Angelo was sad and silent; then came the
Bible class and looked upon him coldly, finding him in such company.
Then they went to Wilson's house and Chapter XI of Pudd'nhead Wilson
follows, which tells of the girl seen in Tom Driscoll's room; and closes
with the kicking of Tom by Luigi at the anti-temperance mass-meeting
of the Sons of Liberty; with the addition of some account of Roxy's
adventures as a chamber-maid on a Mississippi boat. Her exchange of
the children had been flippantly and farcically described in an earlier
chapter.]

Next morning all the town was a-buzz with great news; Pudd'nhead Wilson
had a law case! The public astonishment was so great and the public
curiosity so intense, that when the justice of the peace opened his
court, the place was packed with people and even the windows were
full. Everybody was flushed and perspiring; the summer heat was almost
unendurable.

Tom Driscoll had brought a charge of assault and battery against the
twins. Robert Allen was retained by Driscoll, David Wilson by the
defense. Tom, his native cheerfulness unannihilated by his back-breaking
and bone-bruising passage across the massed heads of the Sons of Liberty
the previous night, laughed his little customary laugh, and said to
Wilson:

I've kept my promise, you see; I'm throwing my business your way.
Sooner than I was expecting, too.

It's very good of you--particularly if you mean to keep it up.

Well, I can't tell about that yet. But we'll see. If I find you deserve
it I'll take you under my protection and make your fame and fortune for
you.

I'll try to deserve it, Tom.

A jury was sworn in; then Mr. Allen said:

We will detain your honor but a moment with this case. It is not
one where any doubt of the fact of the assault can enter in. These
gentlemen--the accused--kicked my client at the Market Hall last night;
they kicked him with violence; with extraordinary violence; with even
unprecedented violence, I may say; insomuch that he was lifted entirely
off his feet and discharged into the midst of the audience. We can prove
this by four hundred witnesses--we shall call but three. Mr. Harkness
will take the stand.

Mr. Harkness, being sworn, testified that he was chairman upon the
occasion mentioned; that he was close at hand and saw the defendants in
this action kick the plaintiff into the air and saw him descend among
the audience.

Take the witness, said Allen.

Mr. Harkness, said Wilson, you say you saw these gentlemen, my
clients, kick the plaintiff. Are you sure--and please remember that you
are on oath--are you perfectly sure that you saw both of them kick him,
or only one? Now be careful.

A bewildered look began to spread itself over the witness's face. He
hesitated, stammered, but got out nothing. His eyes wandered to the
twins and fixed themselves there with a vacant gaze.

Please answer, Mr. Harkness, you are keeping the court waiting. It is a
very simple question.

Counsel for the prosecution broke in with impatience:

Your honor, the question is an irrelevant triviality. Necessarily, they
both kicked him, for they have but the one pair of legs, and both are
responsible for them.

Wilson said, sarcastically:

Will your honor permit this new witness to be sworn? He seems to
possess knowledge which can be of the utmost value just at this
moment--knowledge which would at once dispose of what every one must see
is a very difficult question in this case. Brother Allen, will you take
the stand?

Go on with your case! said Allen, petulantly. The audience laughed,
and got a warning from the court.

Now, Mr. Harkness, said Wilson, insinuatingly, we shall have to
insist upon an answer to that question.

I--er--well, of course, I do not absolutely know, but in my opinion--

Never mind your opinion, sir--answer the question.

I--why, I can't answer it.

That will do, Mr. Harkness. Stand down.

The audience tittered, and the discomfited witness retired in a state of
great embarrassment.

Mr. Wakeman took the stand and swore that he saw the twins kick the
plaintiff off the platform.

The defense took the witness.

Mr. Wakeman, you have sworn that you saw these gentlemen kick the
plaintiff. Do I understand you to swear that you saw them both do it?

Yes, sir,--with decision.

How do you know that both did it?

Because I saw them do it.

The audience laughed, and got another warning from the court.

But by what means do you know that both, and not one, did it?

Well, in the first place, the insult was given to both of them equally,
for they were called a pair of scissors. Of course they would both want
to resent it, and so--

Wait! You are theorizing now. Stick to facts--counsel will attend to
the arguments. Go on.

Well, they both went over there--that I saw.

Very good. Go on.

And they both kicked him--I swear to it.

Mr. Wakeman, was Count Luigi, here, willing to join the Sons of Liberty
last night?

Yes, sir, he was. He did join, too, and drank a glass or two of whisky,
like a man.

Was his brother willing to join?

No, sir, he wasn't. He is a teetotaler, and was elected through a
mistake.

Was he given a glass of whisky?

Yes, sir, but of course that was another mistake, and not intentional.
He wouldn't drink it. He set it down. A slight pause, then he added,
casually and quite simply: The plaintiff reached for it and hogged it.

There was a fine outburst of laughter, but as the justice was caught out
himself, his reprimand was not very vigorous.

Mr. Allen jumped up and exclaimed: I protest against these foolish
irrelevancies. What have they to do with the case?

Wilson said: Calm yourself, brother, it was only an experiment. Now,
Mr. Wakeman, if one of these gentlemen chooses to join an association
and the other doesn't; and if one of them enjoys whisky and the other
doesn't, but sets it aside and leaves it unprotected (titter from
the audience), it seems to show that they have independent minds, and
tastes, and preferences, and that one of them is able to approve of a
thing at the very moment that the other is heartily disapproving of it.
Doesn't it seem so to you?

Certainly it does. It's perfectly plain.

Now, then, it might be--I only say it might be--that one of these
brothers wanted to kick the plaintiff last night, and that the other
didn't want that humiliating punishment inflicted upon him in that
public way and before all those people. Isn't that possible?

Of course it is. It's more than possible. I don't believe the blond one
would kick anybody. It was the other one that--

Silence! shouted the plaintiff's counsel, and went on with an angry
sentence which was lost in the wave of laughter that swept the house.

That will do, Mr. Wakeman, said Wilson, you may stand down.

The third witness was called. He had seen the twins kick the plaintiff.
Mr. Wilson took the witness.

Mr. Rogers, you say you saw these accused gentlemen kick the
plaintiff?

Yes, sir.

Both of them?

Yes, sir.

Which of them kicked him first?

Why--they--they both kicked him at the same time.

Are you perfectly sure of that?

Yes, sir.

What makes you sure of it?

Why, I stood right behind them, and saw them do it.

How many kicks were delivered?

Only one.

If two men kick, the result should be two kicks, shouldn't it?

Why--why yes, as a rule.

Then what do you think went with the other kick?

I--well--the fact is, I wasn't thinking of two being necessary, this
time.

What do you think now?

Well, I--I'm sure I don't quite know what to think, but I reckon that
one of them did half of the kick and the other one did the other half.

Somebody in the crowd sung out: It's the first sane thing that any of
them has said.

The audience applauded. The judge said: Silence! or I will clear the
court.

Mr. Allen looked pleased, but Wilson did not seem disturbed. He said:

Mr. Rogers, you have favored us with what you think and what you
reckon, but as thinking and reckoning are not evidence, I will now give
you a chance to come out with something positive, one way or the other,
and shall require you to produce it. I will ask the accused to stand up
and repeat the phenomenal kick of last night. The twins stood up. Now,
Mr. Rogers, please stand behind them.

A Voice: No, stand in front! (Laughter. Silenced by the court.)
Another Voice: No, give Tommy another highst! (Laughter. Sharply
rebuked by the court.)

Now, then, Mr. Rogers, two kicks shall be delivered, one after the
other, and I give you my word that at least one of the two shall be
delivered by one of the twins alone, without the slightest assistance
from his brother. Watch sharply, for you have got to render a decision
without any if's and ands it. Rogers bent himself behind the twins with
his palms just above his knees, in the modern attitude of the catcher at
a baseball match, and riveted his eyes on the pair of legs in front of
him.

Are you ready, Mr. Rogers?

Ready sir.

The kick was launched.

Have you got that one classified, Mr. Rogers?

Let me study a minute, sir.

Take as much time as you please. Let me know when you are ready.

For as much as a minute Rogers pondered, with all eyes and a breathless
interest fastened upon him. Then he gave the word: Ready, sir.

Kick!

The kick that followed was an exact duplicate of the first one.

Now, then, Mr. Rogers, one of those kicks was an individual kick, not a
mutual one. You will now state positively which was the mutual one.

The witness said, with a crestfallen look:

I've got to give it up. There ain't any man in the world that could
tell t'other from which, sir.

Do you still assert that last night's kick was a mutual kick?

Indeed, I don't, sir.

That will do, Mr. Rogers. If my brother Allen desires to address the
court, your honor, very well; but as far as I am concerned I am ready
to let the case be at once delivered into the hands of this intelligent
jury without comment.

Mr. Justice Robinson had been in office only two months, and in that
short time had not had many cases to try, of course. He had no knowledge
of laws and courts except what he had picked up since he came into
office. He was a sore trouble to the lawyers, for his rulings were
pretty eccentric sometimes, and he stood by them with Roman simplicity
and fortitude; but the people were well satisfied with him, for they saw
that his intentions were always right, that he was entirely impartial,
and that he usually made up in good sense what he lacked in technique,
so to speak. He now perceived that there was likely to be a miscarriage
of justice here, and he rose to the occasion.

Wait a moment, gentlemen, he said, it is plain that an assault has
been committed it is plain to anybody; but the way things are going, the
guilty will certainly escape conviction. I can not allow this. Now---

But, your honor! said Wilson, interrupting him, earnestly but
respectfully, you are deciding the case yourself, whereas the jury--

Never mind the jury, Mr. Wilson; the jury will have a chance when there
is a reasonable doubt for them to take hold of--which there isn't, so
far. There is no doubt whatever that an assault has been committed. The
attempt to show that both of the accused committed it has failed. Are
they both to escape justice on that account? Not in this court, if I
can prevent it. It appears to have been a mistake to bring the charge
against them as a corporation; each should have been charged in his
capacity as an individual, and--

But, your honor! said Wilson, in fairness to my clients I must insist
that inasmuch as the prosecution did not separate the--

No wrong will be done your clients, sir--they will be protected;
also the public and the offended laws. Mr. Allen, you will amend your
pleadings, and put one of the accused on trial at a time.

Wilson broke in: But, your honor! this is wholly unprecedented! To
imperil an accused person by arbitrarily altering and widening the
charge against him in order to compass his conviction when the charge
as originally brought promises to fail to convict, is a thing unheard of
before.

Unheard of where?

In the courts of this or any other state.

The judge said with dignity: I am not acquainted with the customs
of other courts, and am not concerned to know what they are. I am
responsible for this court, and I cannot conscientiously allow my
judgment to be warped and my judicial liberty hampered by trying to
conform to the caprices of other courts, be they--

But, your honor, the oldest and highest courts in Europe--

This court is not run on the European plan, Mr. Wilson; it is not run
on any plan but its own. It has a plan of its own; and that plan is, to
find justice for both State and accused, no matter what happens to
be practice and custom in Europe or anywhere else. (Great applause.)
Silence! It has not been the custom of this court to imitate other
courts; it has not been the custom of this court to take shelter behind
the decisions of other courts, and we will not begin now. We will do
the best we can by the light that God has given us, and while this court
continues to have His approval, it will remain indifferent to what other
organizations may think of it. (Applause.) Gentlemen, I must have
order!--quiet yourselves! Mr. Allen, you will now proceed against the
prisoners one at a time. Go on with the case.

Allen was not at his ease. However, after whispering a moment with his
client and with one or two other people, he rose and said:

Your honor, I find it to be reported and believed that the accused are
able to act independently in many ways, but that this independence
does not extend to their legs, authority over their legs being vested
exclusively in the one brother during a specific term of days, and then
passing to the other brother for a like term, and so on, by regular
alternation. I could call witnesses who would prove that the accused had
revealed to them the existence of this extraordinary fact, and had also
made known which of them was in possession of the legs yesterday--and
this would, of course, indicate where the guilt of the assault
belongs--but as this would be mere hearsay evidence, these revelations
not having been made under oath--

Never mind about that, Mr. Allen. It may not all be hearsay. We
shall see. It may at least help to put us on the right track. Call the
witnesses.

Then I will call Mr. John Buckstone, who is now present, and I beg that
Mrs. Patsy Cooper may be sent for. Take the stand, Mr. Buckstone.

Buckstone took the oath, and then testified that on the previous evening
the Count Angelo Capello had protested against going to the hall, and
had called all present to witness that he was going by compulsion and
would not go if he could help himself. Also, that the Count Luigi had
replied sharply that he would go, just the same, and that he, Count
Luigi, would see to that himself. Also, that upon Count Angelo's
complaining about being kept on his legs so long, Count Luigi retorted
with apparent surprise, Your legs!--I like your impudence!

Now we are getting at the kernel of the thing, observed the judge,
with grave and earnest satisfaction. It looks as if the Count Luigi was
in possession of the battery at the time of the assault.

Nothing further was elicited from Mr. Buckstone on direct examination.
Mr. Wilson took the witness.

Mr. Buckstone, about what time was it that that conversation took
place?

Toward nine yesterday evening, sir.

Did you then proceed directly to the hall?

Yes, sir.

How long did it take you to go there?

Well, we walked; and as it was from the extreme edge of the town, and
there was no hurry, I judge it took us about twenty minutes, maybe a
trifle more.

About what hour was the kick delivered?

About thirteen minutes and a half to ten.

Admirable! You are a pattern witness, Mr. Buckstone. How did you happen
to look at your watch at that particular moment?

I always do it when I see an assault. It's likely I shall be called as
a witness, and it's a good point to have.

It would be well if others were as thoughtful. Was anything said,
between the conversation at my house and the assault, upon the detail
which we are now examining into?

No, sir.

If power over the mutual legs was in the possession of one brother at
nine, and passed into the possession of the other one during the next
thirty or forty minutes, do you think you could have detected the
change?

By no means!

That is all, Mr. Buckstone.

Mrs. Patsy Cooper was called. The crowd made way for her, and she came
smiling and bowing through the narrow human lane, with Betsy Hale,
as escort and support, smiling and bowing in her wake, the audience
breaking into welcoming cheers as the old favorites filed along. The
judge did not check this kindly demonstration of homage and affection,
but let it run its course unrebuked.

The old ladies stopped and shook hands with the twins with effusion,
then gave the judge a friendly nod, and bustled into the seats provided
for them. They immediately began to deliver a volley of eager questions
at the friends around them: What is this thing for? What is that
thing for? Who is that young man that's writing at the desk? Why, I
declare, it's Jack Bunce! I thought he was sick. Which is the jury?
Why, is that the jury? Billy Price and Job Turner, and Jack Lounsbury,
and--well, I never! Now who would ever 'a' thought--

But they were gently called to order at this point, and asked not to
talk in court. Their tongues fell silent, but the radiant interest in
their faces remained, and their gratitude for the blessing of a new
sensation and a novel experience still beamed undimmed from their eyes.
Aunt Patsy stood up and took the oath, and Mr. Allen explained the point
in issue, and asked her to go on now, in her own way, and throw as much
light upon it as she could. She toyed with her reticule a moment or two,
as if considering where to begin, then she said:

Well, the way of it is this. They are Luigi's legs a week at a time,
and then they are Angelo's, and he can do whatever he wants to with
them.

You are making a mistake, Aunt Patsy Cooper, said the judge. You
shouldn't state that as a fact, because you don't know it to be a fact.

What's the reason I don't? said Aunt Patsy, bridling a little.

What is the reason that you do know it?

The best in the world because they told me.

That isn't a reason.

Well, for the land's sake! Betsy Hale, do you hear that?

Hear it? I should think so, said Aunt Betsy, rising and facing the
court. Why, Judge, I was there and heard it myself. Luigi says to
Angelo--no, it was Angelo said it to--

Come, come, Mrs. Hale, pray sit down, and--

Certainly, it's all right, I'm going to sit down presently, but not
until I've--

But you must sit down!

Must! Well, upon my word if things ain't getting to a pretty pass
when--

The house broke into laughter, but was promptly brought to order, and
meantime Mr. Allen persuaded the old lady to take her seat. Aunt Patsy
continued:

Yes, they told me that, and I know it's true. They're Luigi's legs this
week, but--

Ah, they told you that, did they? said the Justice, with interest.

Well, no, I don't know that they told me, but that's neither here nor
there. I know, without that, that at dinner yesterday, Angelo was as
tired as a dog, and yet Luigi wouldn't lend him the legs to go up-stairs
and take a nap with.

Did he ask for them?

Let me see--it seems to me, somehow, that--that--Aunt Betsy, do you
remember whether he--

Never mind about what Aunt Betsy remembers--she is not a witness; we
only want to know what YOU remember yourself, said the judge.

Well, it does seem to me that you are most cantankerously particular
about a little thing, Sim Robinson. Why, when I can't remember a thing
myself, I always--

Ah, please go on!

Now how can she when you keep fussing at her all the time? said Aunt
Betsy. Why, with a person pecking at me that way, I should get that
fuzzled and fuddled that--

She was on her feet again, but Allen coaxed her into her seat once more,
while the court squelched the mirth of the house. Then the judge said:

Madam, do you know--do you absolutely know, independently of anything
these gentlemen have told you--that the power over their legs passes
from the one to the other regularly every week?

Regularly? Bless your heart, regularly ain't any name for the exactness
of it! All the big cities in Europe used to set the clocks by it.
 (Laughter, suppressed by the court.)

How do you know? That is the question. Please answer it plainly and
squarely.

Don't you talk to me like that, Sim Robinson--I won't have it. How do I
know, indeed! How do YOU know what you know? Because somebody told you.
You didn't invent it out of your own head, did you? Why, these twins are
the truthfulest people in the world; and I don't think it becomes you
to sit up there and throw slurs at them when they haven't been doing
anything to you. And they are orphans besides--both of them. All--

But Aunt Betsy was up again now, and both old ladies were talking at
once and with all their might; but as the house was weltering in a
storm of laughter, and the judge was hammering his desk with an iron
paper-weight, one could only see them talk, not hear them. At last, when
quiet was restored, the court said:

Let the ladies retire.

But, your honor, I have the right, in the interest of my clients,--to
cross-exam--

You'll not need to exercise it, Mr. Wilson--the evidence is thrown
out.

Thrown out! said Aunt Patsy, ruffled; and what's it thrown out for,
I'd like to know.

And so would I, Patsy Cooper. It seems to me that if we can save these
poor persecuted strangers, it is our bounden duty to stand up here and
talk for them till--

There, there, there, do sit down!

It cost some trouble and a good deal of coaxing, but they were got into
their seats at last. The trial was soon ended now. The twins themselves
became witnesses in their own defense. They established the fact, upon
oath, that the leg-power passed from one to the other every Saturday
night at twelve o'clock sharp. But on cross-examination their counsel
would not allow them to tell whose week of power the current week was.
The judge insisted upon their answering, and proposed to compel them,
but even the prosecution took fright and came to the rescue then, and
helped stay the sturdy jurist's revolutionary hand. So the case had to
go to the jury with that important point hanging in the air. They were
out an hour and brought in this verdict:

We the jury do find: 1, that an assault was committed, as charged; 2,
that it was committed by one of the persons accused, he having been seen
to do it by several credible witnesses; 3, but that his identity is so
merged in his brother's that we have not been able to tell which was
him. We cannot convict both, for only one is guilty. We cannot acquit
both, for only one is innocent. Our verdict is that justice has been
defeated by the dispensation of God, and ask to be discharged from
further duty.

This was read aloud in court and brought out a burst of hearty applause.
The old ladies made a spring at the twins, to shake and congratulate,
but were gently disengaged by Mr. Wilson and softly crowded back into
their places.

The judge rose in his little tribune, laid aside his silver-bowed
spectacles, roached his gray hair up with his fingers, and said, with
dignity and solemnity, and even with a certain pathos:

In all my experience on the bench, I have not seen justice bow her
head in shame in this court until this day. You little realize what
far-reaching harm has just been wrought here under the fickle forms of
law. Imitation is the bane of courts--I thank God that this one is free
from the contamination of that vice--and in no long time you will
see the fatal work of this hour seized upon by profligate so-called
guardians of justice in all the wide circumstance of this planet and
perpetuated in their pernicious decisions. I wash my hands of this
iniquity. I would have compelled these culprits to expose their
guilt, but support failed me where I had most right to expect aid and
encouragement. And I was confronted by a law made in the interest of
crime, which protects the criminal from testifying against himself.
Yet I had precedents of my own whereby I had set aside that law on two
different occasions and thus succeeded in convicting criminals to
whose crimes there were no witnesses but themselves. What have
you accomplished this day? Do you realize it? You have set adrift,
unadmonished, in this community, two men endowed with an awful and
mysterious gift, a hidden and grisly power for evil--a power by which
each in his turn may commit crime after crime of the most heinous
character, and no man be able to tell which is the guilty or which the
innocent party in any case of them all. Look to your homes--look to your
property--look to your lives--for you have need!

Prisoners at the bar, stand up. Through suppression of evidence, a
jury of your--our--countrymen have been obliged to deliver a verdict
concerning your case which stinks to heaven with the rankness of its
injustice. By its terms you, the guilty one, go free with the innocent.
Depart in peace, and come no more! The costs devolve upon the outraged
plaintiff--another iniquity. The court stands dissolved.

Almost everybody crowded forward to overwhelm the twins and their
counsel with congratulations; but presently the two old aunties dug
the duplicates out and bore them away in triumph through the hurrahing
crowd, while lots of new friends carried Pudd'nhead Wilson off
tavern-ward to feast him and wet down his great and victorious entry
into the legal arena. To Wilson, so long familiar with neglect and
depreciation, this strange new incense of popularity and admiration
was as a fragrance blown from the fields of paradise. A happy man was
Wilson.




CHAPTER VI. THE AMAZING DUEL

     A deputation came in the evening and conferred upon Wilson the
     welcome honor of a nomination for mayor; for the village has just
     been converted into a city by charter.  Tom skulks out of
     challenging the twins.  Judge Driscoll thereupon challenges Angelo
     (accused by Tom of doing the kicking); he declines, but Luigi
     accepts in his place against Angelo's timid protest.

It was late Saturday night nearing eleven.

The judge and his second found the rest of the war party at the further
end of the vacant ground, near the haunted house. Pudd'nhead Wilson
advanced to meet them, and said anxiously:

I must say a word in behalf of my principal's proxy, Count Luigi, to
whom you have kindly granted the privilege of fighting my principal's
battle for him. It is growing late, and Count Luigi is in great trouble
lest midnight shall strike before the finish.

It is another testimony, said Howard, approvingly. That young man is
fine all through. He wishes to save his brother the sorrow of fighting
on the Sabbath, and he is right; it is the right and manly feeling and
does him credit. We will make all possible haste.

Wilson said: There is also another reason--a consideration, in fact,
which deeply concerns Count Luigi himself. These twins have command
of their mutual legs turn about. Count Luigi is in command now; but at
midnight, possession will pass to my principal, Count Angelo, and--well,
you can foresee what will happen. He will march straight off the field,
and carry Luigi with him.

Why! sure enough! cried the judge, we have heard something about that
extraordinary law of their being, already--nothing very definite, it is
true, as regards dates and durations of power, but I see it is definite
enough as regards to-night. Of course we must give Luigi every chance.
Omit all the ceremonial possible, gentlemen, and place us in position.

The seconds at once tossed up a coin; Howard won the choice. He placed
the judge sixty feet from the haunted house and facing it; Wilson
placed the twins within fifteen feet of the house and facing the
judge--necessarily. The pistol-case was opened and the long slim tubes
taken out; when the moonlight glinted from them a shiver went through
Angelo. The doctor was a fool, but a thoroughly well-meaning one, with
a kind heart and a sincere disposition to oblige, but along with it an
absence of tact which often hurt its effectiveness. He brought his box
of lint and bandages, and asked Angelo to feel and see how soft and
comfortable they were. Angelo's head fell over against Luigi's in a
faint, and precious time was lost in bringing him to; which provoked
Luigi into expressing his mind to the doctor with a good deal of vigor
and frankness. After Angelo came to he was still so weak that Luigi was
obliged to drink a stiff horn of brandy to brace him up.

The seconds now stepped at once to their posts, halfway between the
combatants, one of them on each side of the line of fire. Wilson was to
count, very deliberately, One-two-three-fire!--stop! and the duelists
could bang away at any time they chose during that recitation, but not
after the last word. Angelo grew very nervous when he saw Wilson's hand
rising slowly into the air as a sign to make ready, and he leaned his
head against Luigi's and said:

Oh, please take me away from here, I can't stay, I know I can't!

What in the world are you doing? Straighten up! What's the matter with
you?--you're in no danger--nobody's going to shoot at you. Straighten
up, I tell you!

Angelo obeyed, just in time to hear:

One--!

Bang! Just one report, and a little tuft of white hair floated slowly
to the judge's feet in the moonlight. The judge did not swerve; he still
stood erect and motionless, like a statue, with his pistol-arm hanging
straight down at his side. He was reserving his fire.

Two--!

Three--!

Fire--!

Up came the pistol-arm instantly-Angelo dodged with the report. He said
Ouch! and fainted again.

The doctor examined and bandaged the wound.

It was of no consequence, he said--bullet through fleshy part of
arm--no bones broken--the gentleman was still able to fight let the duel
proceed.

Next time Angelo jumped just as Luigi fired, which disordered his aim
and caused him to cut a chip off of Howard's ear. The judge took his
time again, and when he fired Angelo jumped and got a knuckle skinned.
The doctor inspected and dressed the wounds. Angelo now spoke out
and said he was content with the satisfaction he had got, and if the
judge--but Luigi shut him roughly up, and asked him not to make an ass
of himself; adding:

And I want you to stop dodging. You take a great deal too prominent a
part in this thing for a person who has got nothing to do with it. You
should remember that you are here only by courtesy, and are without
official recognition; officially you are not here at all; officially you
do not even exist. To all intents and purposes you are absent from this
place, and you ought for your own modesty's sake to reflect that it
cannot become a person who is not present here to be taking this sort
of public and indecent prominence in a matter in which he is not in the
slightest degree concerned. Now, don't dodge again; the bullets are
not for you, they are for me; if I want them dodged I will attend to it
myself. I never saw a person act so.

Angelo saw the reasonableness of what his brother had said, and he did
try to reform, but it was of no use; both pistols went off at the same
instant, and he jumped once more; he got a sharp scrape along his cheek
from the judge's bullet, and so deflected Luigi's aim that his ball
went wide and chipped a flake of skin from Pudd'nhead Wilson's chin. The
doctor attended to the wounded.

By the terms, the duel was over. But Luigi was entirely out of patience,
and begged for one more exchange of shots, insisting that he had had no
fair chance, on account of his brother's indelicate behavior. Howard was
opposed to granting so unusual a privilege, but the judge took Luigi's
part, and added that indeed he himself might fairly be considered
entitled to another trial, because although the proxy on the other side
was in no way to blame for his (the judge's) humiliatingly resultless
work, the gentleman with whom he was fighting this duel was to blame for
it, since if he had played no advantages and had held his head still,
his proxy would have been disposed of early. He added:

Count Luigi's request for another exchange is another proof that he is
a brave and chivalrous gentleman, and I beg that the courtesy he asks
may be accorded him.

I thank you most sincerely for this generosity, Judge Driscoll, said
Luigi, with a polite bow, and moving to his place. Then he added--to
Angelo, Now hold your grip, hold your grip, I tell you, and I'll land
him sure!

The men stood erect, their pistol-arms at their sides, the two seconds
stood at their official posts, the doctor stood five paces in Wilson's
rear with his instruments and bandages in his hands. The deep stillness,
the peaceful moonlight, the motionless figures, made an impressive
picture and the impending fatal possibilities augmented
this impressiveness to solemnity. Wilson's hand began to
rise--slowly--slowly--higher--still higher--still higher--in another
moment:

Boom! the first stroke of midnight swung up out of the distance;
Angelo was off like a deer!

Oh, you unspeakable traitor! wailed his brother, as they went soaring
over the fence.

The others stood astonished and gazing; and so stood, watching that
strange spectacle until distance dissolved it and swept it from their
view. Then they rubbed their eyes like people waking out of a dream.

Well, I've never seen anything like that before! said the judge.
Wilson, I am going to confess now, that I wasn't quite able to
believe in that leg business, and had a suspicion that it was a put-up
convenience between those twins; and when Count Angelo fainted I thought
I saw the whole scheme--thought it was pretext No. 1, and would be
followed by others till twelve o'clock should arrive, and Luigi would
get off with all the credit of seeming to want to fight and yet not have
to fight, after all. But I was mistaken. His pluck proved it. He's a
brave fellow and did want to fight.

There isn't any doubt about that, said Howard, and added, in a grieved
tone, but what an unworthy sort of Christian that Angelo is--I hope and
believe there are not many like him. It is not right to engage in a duel
on the Sabbath--I could not approve of that myself; but to finish one
that has been begun--that is a duty, let the day be what it may.

They strolled along, still wondering, still talking.

It is a curious circumstance, remarked the surgeon, halting Wilson a
moment to paste some more court-plaster on his chin, which had gone
to leaking blood again, that in this duel neither of the parties who
handled the pistols lost blood while nearly all the persons present in
the mere capacity of guests got hit. I have not heard of such a thing
before. Don't you think it unusual?

Yes, said the Judge, it has struck me as peculiar. Peculiar and
unfortunate. I was annoyed at it, all the time. In the case of Angelo it
made no great difference, because he was in a measure concerned, though
not officially; but it troubled me to see the seconds compromised, and
yet I knew no way to mend the matter.

There was no way to mend it, said Howard, whose ear was being
readjusted now by the doctor; the code fixes our place, and it would
not have been lawful to change it. If we could have stood at your
side, or behind you, or in front of you, it--but it would not have been
legitimate and the other parties would have had a just right to complain
of our trying to protect ourselves from danger; infractions of the code
are certainly not permissible in any case whatever.

Wilson offered no remarks. It seemed to him that there was very little
place here for so much solemnity, but he judged that if a duel where
nobody was in danger or got crippled but the seconds and the outsiders
had nothing ridiculous about it for these gentlemen, his pointing out
that feature would probably not help them to see it.

He invited them in to take a nightcap, and Howard and the judge
accepted, but the doctor said he would have to go and see how Angelo's
principal wound was getting on.

     [It was now Sunday, and in the afternoon Angelo was to be received
     into the Baptist communion by immersion--a doubtful prospect, the
     doctor feared.]





CHAPTER VII. LUIGI DEFIES GALEN

When the doctor arrived at Aunt Patsy Cooper's house, he found the
lights going and everybody up and dressed and in a great state of
solicitude and excitement. The twins were stretched on a sofa in the
sitting-room, Aunt Patsy was fussing at Angelo's arm, Nancy was flying
around under her commands, the two young boys were trying to keep out
of the way and always getting in it, in order to see and wonder, Rowena
stood apart, helpless with apprehension and emotion, and Luigi was
growling in unappeasable fury over Angelo's shameful flight.

As has been reported before, the doctor was a fool--a kind-hearted and
well-meaning one, but with no tact; and as he was by long odds the most
learned physician in the town, and was quite well aware of it, and could
talk his learning with ease and precision, and liked to show off when he
had an audience, he was sometimes tempted into revealing more of a case
than was good for the patient.

He examined Angelo's wound, and was really minded to say nothing for
once; but Aunt Patsy was so anxious and so pressing that he allowed his
caution to be overcome, and proceeded to empty himself as follows, with
scientific relish:

Without going too much into detail, madam--for you would probably
not understand it, anyway--I concede that great care is going to be
necessary here; otherwise exudation of the esophagus is nearly sure to
ensue, and this will be followed by ossification and extradition of the
maxillaris superioris, which must decompose the granular surfaces of the
great infusorial ganglionic system, thus obstructing the action of the
posterior varioloid arteries, and precipitating compound strangulated
sorosis of the valvular tissues, and ending unavoidably in the
dispersion and combustion of the marsupial fluxes and the consequent
embrocation of the bicuspid populo redax referendum rotulorum.

A miserable silence followed. Aunt Patsy's heart sank, the pallor of
despair invaded her face, she was not able to speak; poor Rowena wrung
her hands in privacy and silence, and said to herself in the bitterness
of her young grief, There is no hope--it is plain there is no hope;
the good-hearted negro wench, Nancy, paled to chocolate, then to orange,
then to amber, and thought to herself with yearning sympathy and sorrow,
Po' thing, he ain' gwyne to las' throo de half o' dat; small Henry
choked up, and turned his head away to hide his rising tears, and his
brother Joe said to himself, with a sense of loss, The baptizing's
busted, that's sure. Luigi was the only person who had any heart to
speak. He said, a little bit sharply, to the doctor:

Well, well, there's nothing to be gained by wasting precious time; give
him a barrel of pills--I'll take them for him.

You? asked the doctor.

Yes. Did you suppose he was going to take them himself?

Why, of course.

Well, it's a mistake. He never took a dose of medicine in his life. He
can't.

Well, upon my word, it's the most extraordinary thing I ever heard of!

Oh, said Aunt Patsy, as pleased as a mother whose child is being
admired and wondered at; you'll find that there's more about them
that's wonderful than their just being made in the image of God like the
rest of His creatures, now you can depend on that, I tell you, and she
wagged her complacent head like one who could reveal marvelous things if
she chose.

The boy Joe began:

Why, ma, they ain't made in the im--

You shut up, and wait till you're asked, Joe. I'll let you know when I
want help. Are you looking for something, doctor?

The doctor asked for a few sheets of paper and a pen, and said he would
write a prescription; which he did. It was one of Galen's; in fact, it
was Galen's favorite, and had been slaying people for sixteen thousand
years. Galen used it for everything, applied it to everything, said it
would remove everything, from warts all the way through to lungs and it
generally did. Galen was still the only medical authority recognized
in Missouri; his practice was the only practice known to the Missouri
doctors, and his prescriptions were the only ammunition they carried
when they went out for game.

By and by Dr. Claypool laid down his pen and read the result of his
labors aloud, carefully and deliberately, for this battery must be
constructed on the premises by the family, and mistakes could occur; for
he wrote a doctor's hand--the hand which from the beginning of time
has been so disastrous to the apothecary and so profitable to the
undertaker:

Take of afarabocca, henbane, corpobalsamum, each two drams and a half;
of cloves, opium, myrrh, cyperus, each two drams; of opobalsamum, Indian
leaf, cinnamon, zedoary, ginger, coftus, coral, cassia, euphorbium,
gum tragacanth, frankincense, styrax calamita, Celtic, nard, spignel,
hartwort, mustard, saxifrage, dill, anise, each one dram; of xylaloes,
rheum ponticum, alipta, moschata, castor, spikenard, galangals,
opoponax, anacardium, mastich, brimstone, peony, eringo, pulp of dates,
red and white hermodactyls, roses, thyme, acorns, pennyroyal, gentian,
the bark of the root of mandrake, germander, valerian, bishop's-weed,
bayberries, long and white pepper, xylobalsamum, carnabadium,
macedonian, parsley seeds, lovage, the seeds of rue, and sinon, of each
a dram and a half; of pure gold, pure silver, pearls not perforated, the
blatta byzantina, the bone of the stag's heart, of each the quantity of
fourteen grains of wheat; of sapphire, emerald and jasper stones, each
one dram; of hazel-nuts, two drams; of pellitory of Spain, shavings
of ivory, calamus odoratus, each the quantity of twenty-nine grains of
wheat; of honey or sugar a sufficient quantity. Boil down and skim off.

There, he said, that will fix the patient; give his brother a
dipperful every three-quarters of an hour--

--while he survives, muttered Luigi--

--and see that the room is kept wholesomely hot, and the doors and
windows closed tight. Keep Count Angelo nicely covered up with six
or seven blankets, and when he is thirsty--which will be
frequently--moisten a rag in the vapor of the tea kettle and let his
brother suck it. When he is hungry--which will also be frequently--he
must not be humored oftener than every seven or eight hours; then toast
part of a cracker until it begins to brown, and give it to his brother.

That is all very well, as far as Angelo is concerned, said Luigi, but
what am I to eat?

I do not see that there is anything the matter with you, the doctor
answered, you may, of course, eat what you please.

And also drink what I please, I suppose?

Oh, certainly--at present. When the violent and continuous perspiring
has reduced your strength, I shall have to reduce your diet, of course,
and also bleed you, but there is no occasion for that yet awhile. He
turned to Aunt Patsy and said: He must be put to bed, and sat up with,
and tended with the greatest care, and not allowed to stir for several
days and nights.

For one, I'm sacredly thankful for that, said Luigi, it postpones the
funeral--I'm not to be drowned to-day, anyhow.

Angelo said quietly to the doctor:

I will cheerfully submit to all your requirements, sir, up to two
o'clock this afternoon, and will resume them after three, but cannot be
confined to the house during that intermediate hour.

Why, may I ask?

Because I have entered the Baptist communion, and by appointment am to
be baptised in the river at that hour.

Oh, insanity!--it cannot be allowed!

Angelo answered with placid firmness:

Nothing shall prevent it, if I am alive.

Why, consider, my dear sir, in your condition it might prove fatal.

A tender and ecstatic smile beamed from Angelo's eyes, and he broke
forth in a tone of joyous fervency:

Ah, how blessed it would be to die for such a cause--it would be
martyrdom!

But your brother--consider your brother; you would be risking his life,
too.

He risked mine an hour ago, responded Angelo, gloomily; did he
consider me? A thought swept through his mind that made him shudder.
If I had not run, I might have been killed in a duel on the Sabbath
day, and my soul would have been lost--lost.

Oh, don't fret, it wasn't in any danger, said Luigi, irritably; they
wouldn't waste it for a little thing like that; there's a glass case all
ready for it in the heavenly museum, and a pin to stick it up with.

Aunt Patsy was shocked, and said:

Looy, Looy!--don't talk so, dear!

Rowena's soft heart was pierced by Luigi's unfeeling words, and she
murmured to herself, Oh, if I but had the dear privilege of protecting
and defending him with my weak voice!--but alas! this sweet boon is
denied me by the cruel conventions of social intercourse.

Get their bed ready, said Aunt Patsy to Nancy, and shut up the
windows and doors, and light their candles, and see that you drive all
the mosquitoes out of their bar, and make up a good fire in their stove,
and carry up some bags of hot ashes to lay to his feet--

--and a shovel of fire for his head, and a mustard plaster for his
neck, and some gum shoes for his ears, Luigi interrupted, with temper;
and added, to himself, Damnation, I'm going to be roasted alive, I just
know it!

Why, Looy! Do be quiet; I never saw such a fractious thing. A body
would think you didn't care for your brother.

I don't--to that extent, Aunt Patsy. I was glad the drowning was
postponed a minute ago, but I'm not now. No, that is all gone by; I want
to be drowned.

You'll bring a judgment on yourself just as sure as you live, if you
go on like that. Why, I never heard the beat of it. Now, there--there!
you've said enough. Not another word out of you--I won't have it!

But, Aunt Patsy--

Luigi! Didn't you hear what I told you?

But, Aunt Patsy, I--why, I'm not going to set my heart and lungs afloat
in that pail of sewage which this criminal here has been prescri--

Yes, you are, too. You are going to be good, and do everything I tell
you, like a dear, and she tapped his cheek affectionately with her
finger. Rowena, take the prescription and go in the kitchen and hunt up
the things and lay them out for me. I'll sit up with my patient the rest
of the night, doctor; I can't trust Nancy, she couldn't make Luigi take
the medicine. Of course, you'll drop in again during the day. Have you
got any more directions?

No, I believe not, Aunt Patsy. If I don't get in earlier, I'll be along
by early candle-light, anyway. Meantime, don't allow him to get out of
his bed.

Angelo said, with calm determination:

I shall be baptized at two o'clock. Nothing but death shall prevent
me.

The doctor said nothing aloud, but to himself he said:

Why, this chap's got a manly side, after all! Physically he's a coward,
but morally he's a lion. I'll go and tell the others about this; it will
raise him a good deal in their estimation--and the public will follow
their lead, of course.

Privately, Aunt Patsy applauded too, and was proud of Angelo's courage
in the moral field as she was of Luigi's in the field of honor.

The boy Henry was troubled, but the boy Joe said, inaudibly, and
gratefully, We're all honky, after all; and no postponement on account
of the weather.




CHAPTER VIII. BAPTISM OF THE BETTER HALF

By nine o'clock the town was humming with the news of the midnight duel,
and there were but two opinions about it: one, that Luigi's pluck in
the field was most praiseworthy and Angelo's flight most scandalous; the
other, that Angelo's courage in flying the field for conscience' sake
was as fine and creditable as was Luigi's in holding the field in the
face of the bullets. The one opinion was held by half of the town, the
other one was maintained by the other half. The division was clean and
exact, and it made two parties, an Angelo party and a Luigi party. The
twins had suddenly become popular idols along with Pudd'nhead Wilson,
and haloed with a glory as intense as his. The children talked the duel
all the way to Sunday-school, their elders talked it all the way to
church, the choir discussed it behind their red curtain, it usurped the
place of pious thought in the nigger gallery.

By noon the doctor had added the news, and spread it, that Count Angelo,
in spite of his wound and all warnings and supplications, was resolute
in his determination to be baptized at the hour appointed. This swept
the town like wildfire, and mightily reinforced the enthusiasm of the
Angelo faction, who said, If any doubted that it was moral courage that
took him from the field, what have they to say now!

Still the excitement grew. All the morning it was traveling countryward,
toward all points of the compass; so, whereas before only the farmers
and their wives were intending to come and witness the remarkable
baptism, a general holiday was now proclaimed and the children and
negroes admitted to the privileges of the occasion. All the farms for
ten miles around were vacated, all the converging roads emptied long
processions of wagons, horses, and yeomanry into the town. The pack
and cram of people vastly exceeded any that had ever been seen in that
sleepy region before. The only thing that had ever even approached it,
was the time long gone by, but never forgotten, nor even referred to
without wonder and pride, when two circuses and a Fourth of July fell
together. But the glory of that occasion was extinguished now for good.
It was but a freshet to this deluge.

The great invasion massed itself on the river-bank and waited hungrily
for the immense event. Waited, and wondered if it would really happen,
or if the twin who was not a professor would stand out and prevent it.

But they were not to be disappointed. Angelo was as good as his word. He
came attended by an escort of honor composed of several hundred of
the best citizens, all of the Angelo party; and when the immersion was
finished they escorted him back home and would even have carried him on
their shoulders, but that people might think they were carrying Luigi.

Far into the night the citizens continued to discuss and wonder over the
strangely mated pair of incidents that had distinguished and exalted
the past twenty-four hours above any other twenty-four in the history
of their town for picturesqueness and splendid interest; and long before
the lights were out and burghers asleep it had been decided on all hands
that in capturing these twins Dawson's Landing had drawn a prize in the
great lottery of municipal fortune.

At midnight Angelo was sleeping peacefully. His immersion had not harmed
him, it had merely made him wholesomely drowsy, and he had been dead
asleep many hours now. It had made Luigi drowsy, too, but he had got
only brief naps, on account of his having to take the medicine every
three-quarters of an hour-and Aunt Betsy Hale was there to see that he
did it. When he complained and resisted, she was quietly firm with him,
and said in a low voice:

No-no, that won't do; you mustn't talk, and you mustn't retch and gag
that way, either--you'll wake up your poor brother.

Well, what of it, Aunt Betsy, he--

'Sh-h! Don't make a noise dear. You mustn't forget that your poor
brother is sick and--

Sick, is he? Well, I wish I--

'Sh-h-h! Will you be quiet, Luigi! Here, now, take the rest of
it--don't keep me holding the dipper all night. I declare if you haven't
left a good fourth of it in the bottom! Come--that's a good--

Aunt Betsy, don't make me! I feel like I've swallowed a cemetery; I do,
indeed. Do let me rest a little--just a little; I can't take any more of
the devilish stuff now.

Luigi! Using such language here, and him just baptized! Do you want the
roof to fall on you?

I wish to goodness it would!

Why, you dreadful thing! I've a good notion to--let that blanket alone;
do you want your brother to catch his death?

Aunt Betsy, I've got to have it off, I'm being roasted alive; nobody
could stand it--you couldn't yourself.

Now, then, you're sneezing again--I just expected it.

Because I've caught a cold in my head. I always do, when I go in the
water with my clothes on. And it takes me weeks to get over it, too. I
think it was a shame to serve me so.

Luigi, you are unreasonable; you know very well they couldn't baptize
him dry. I should think you would be willing to undergo a little
inconvenience for your brother's sake.

Inconvenience! Now how you talk, Aunt Betsy. I came as near as
anything to getting drowned you saw that yourself; and do you call this
inconvenience?--the room shut up as tight as a drum, and so hot the
mosquitoes are trying to get out; and a cold in the head, and dying for
sleep and no chance to get any--on account of this infamous medicine
that that assassin prescri--

There, you're sneezing again. I'm going down and mix some more of this
truck for you, dear.




CHAPTER IX. THE DRINKLESS DRUNK

During Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday the twins grew steadily worse; but
then the doctor was summoned South to attend his mother's funeral,
and they got well in forty-eight hours. They appeared on the street on
Friday, and were welcomed with enthusiasm by the new-born parties, the
Luigi and Angelo factions. The Luigi faction carried its strength into
the Democratic party, the Angelo faction entered into a combination with
the Whigs. The Democrats nominated Luigi for alderman under the new
city government, and the Whigs put up Angelo against him. The Democrats
nominated Pudd'nhead Wilson for mayor, and he was left alone in this
glory, for the Whigs had no man who was willing to enter the lists
against such a formidable opponent. No politician had scored such a
compliment as this before in the history of the Mississippi Valley.

The political campaign in Dawson's Landing opened in a pretty warm
fashion, and waxed hotter every week. Luigi's whole heart was in it, and
even Angelo developed a surprising amount of interest-which was
natural, because he was not merely representing Whigism, a matter of no
consequence to him; but he was representing something immensely finer
and greater--to wit, Reform. In him was centered the hopes of the whole
reform element of the town; he was the chosen and admired champion of
every clique that had a pet reform of any sort or kind at heart. He
was president of the great Teetotalers' Union, its chiefest prophet and
mouthpiece.

But as the canvass went on, troubles began to spring up all
around--troubles for the twins, and through them for all the parties and
segments and fractions of parties. Whenever Luigi had possession of the
legs, he carried Angelo to balls, rum shops, Sons of Liberty parades,
horse-races, campaign riots, and everywhere else that could damage him
with his party and the church; and when it was Angelo's week he carried
Luigi diligently to all manner of moral and religious gatherings, doing
his best to regain the ground he had lost before. As a result of
these double performances, there was a storm blowing all the time, an
ever-rising storm, too--a storm of frantic criticism of the twins, and
rage over their extravagant, incomprehensible conduct.

Luigi had the final chance. The legs were his for the closing week of
the canvass. He led his brother a fearful dance.

But he saved his best card for the very eve of the election. There was
to be a grand turnout of the Teetotalers' Union that day, and Angelo
was to march at the head of the procession and deliver a great oration
afterward. Luigi drank a couple of glasses of whisky--which steadied his
nerves and clarified his mind, but made Angelo drunk. Everybody who saw
the march, saw that the Champion of the Teetotalers was half seas over,
and noted also that his brother, who made no hypocritical pretensions
to extra temperance virtues, was dignified and sober. This eloquent fact
could not be unfruitful at the end of a hot political canvass. At the
mass-meeting Angelo tried to make his great temperance oration, but was
so discommoded--by hiccoughs and thickness of tongue that he had to give
it up; then drowsiness overtook him and his head drooped against Luigi's
and he went to sleep. Luigi apologized for him, and was going on to
improve his opportunity with an appeal for a moderation of what he
called the prevailing teetotal madness, but persons in the audience
began to howl and throw things at him, and then the meeting rose in
wrath and chased him home.

This episode was a crusher for Angelo in another way. It destroyed his
chances with Rowena. Those chances had been growing, right along, for
two months. Rowena had partly confessed that she loved him, but wanted
time to consider. Now the tender dream was ended, and she told him so
the moment he was sober enough to understand. She said she would never
marry a man who drank.

But I don't drink, he pleaded.

That is nothing to the point, she said, coldly, you get drunk, and
that is worse.

[There was a long and sufficiently idiotic discussion here, which ended
as reported in a previous note.]




CHAPTER X. SO THEY HANGED LUIGI

Dawson's Landing had a week of repose, after the election, and it needed
it, for the frantic and variegated nightmare which had tormented it all
through the preceding week had left it limp, haggard, and exhausted at
the end. It got the week of repose because Angelo had the legs, and
was in too subdued a condition to want to go out and mingle with an
irritated community that had come to distrust and detest him because
there was such a lack of harmony between his morals, which were
confessedly excellent, and his methods of illustrating them, which
were distinctly damnable. The new city officers were sworn in on the
following Monday--at least all but Luigi. There was a complication in
his case. His election was conceded, but he could not sit in the board
of aldermen without his brother, and his brother could not sit there
because he was not a member. There seemed to be no way out of the
difficulty but to carry the matter into the courts, so this was resolved
upon.

The case was set for the Monday fortnight. In due course the time
arrived. In the mean time the city government had been at a standstill,
because without Luigi there was a tie in the board of aldermen, whereas
with him the liquor interest--the richest in the political field--would
have one majority. But the court decided that Angelo could not sit in
the board with him, either in public or executive sessions, and at the
same time forbade the board to deny admission to Luigi, a fairly and
legally chosen alderman. The case was carried up and up from court to
court, yet still the same old original decision was confirmed every
time. As a result, the city government not only stood still, with its
hands tied, but everything it was created to protect and care for went a
steady gait toward rack and ruin. There was no way to levy a tax, so the
minor officials had to resign or starve; therefore they resigned. There
being no city money, the enormous legal expenses on both sides had to be
defrayed by private subscription. But at last the people came to their
senses, and said:

Pudd'nhead was right at the start--we ought to have hired the official
half of that human phillipene to resign; but it's too late now; some of
us haven't got anything left to hire him with.

Yes, we have, said another citizen, we've got this--and he produced
a halter.

Many shouted: That's the ticket. But others said: No--Count Angelo is
innocent; we mustn't hang him.

Who said anything about hanging him? We are only going to hang the
other one.

Then that is all right--there is no objection to that.

So they hanged Luigi. And so ends the history of Those Extraordinary
Twins.




FINAL REMARKS

As you see, it was an extravagant sort of a tale, and had no purpose but
to exhibit that monstrous freak in all sorts of grotesque lights. But
when Roxy wandered into the tale she had to be furnished with something
to do; so she changed the children in the cradle; this necessitated
the invention of a reason for it; this, in turn, resulted in making the
children prominent personages--nothing could prevent it of course. Their
career began to take a tragic aspect, and some one had to be brought
in to help work the machinery; so Pudd'nhead Wilson was introduced and
taken on trial. By this time the whole show was being run by the
new people and in their interest, and the original show was become
side-tracked and forgotten; the twin-monster, and the heroine, and the
lads, and the old ladies had dwindled to inconsequentialities and were
merely in the way. Their story was one story, the new people's story
was another story, and there was no connection between them, no
interdependence, no kinship. It is not practicable or rational to try to
tell two stories at the same time; so I dug out the farce and left the
tragedy.

The reader already knew how the expert works; he knows now how the other
kind do it. MARK TWAIN.

CHAPTER XIX.

Mr. Harry Brierly drew his pay as an engineer while he was living at the
City Hotel in Hawkeye.  Mr. Thompson had been kind enough to say that it
didn't make any difference whether he was with the corps or not; and
although Harry protested to the Colonel daily and to Washington Hawkins
that he must go back at once to the line and superintend the lay-out with
reference to his contract, yet he did not go, but wrote instead long
letters to Philip, instructing him to keep his eye out, and to let him
know when any difficulty occurred that required his presence.

Meantime Harry blossomed out in the society of Hawkeye, as he did in any
society where fortune cast him and he had the slightest opportunity to
expand.  Indeed the talents of a rich and accomplished young fellow like
Harry were not likely to go unappreciated in such a place.  A land
operator, engaged in vast speculations, a favorite in the select circles
of New York, in correspondence with brokers and bankers, intimate with
public men at Washington, one who could play the guitar and touch the
banjo lightly, and who had an eye for a pretty girl, and knew the
language of flattery, was welcome everywhere in Hawkeye.  Even Miss Laura
Hawkins thought it worth while to use her fascinations upon him, and to
endeavor to entangle the volatile fellow in the meshes of her
attractions.

"Gad," says Harry to the Colonel, "she's a superb creature, she'd make a
stir in New York, money or no money.  There are men I know would give her
a railroad or an opera house, or whatever she wanted--at least they'd
promise."

Harry had a way of looking at women as he looked at anything else in the
world he wanted, and he half resolved to appropriate Miss Laura, during
his stay in Hawkeye.  Perhaps the Colonel divined his thoughts, or was
offended at Harry's talk, for he replied,

"No nonsense, Mr. Brierly.  Nonsense won't do in Hawkeye, not with my
friends.  The Hawkins' blood is good blood, all the way from Tennessee.
The Hawkinses are under the weather now, but their Tennessee property is
millions when it comes into market."

"Of course, Colonel.  Not the least offense intended.  But you can see
she is a fascinating woman.  I was only thinking, as to this
appropriation, now, what such a woman could do in Washington.  All
correct, too, all correct.  Common thing, I assure you in Washington; the
wives of senators, representatives, cabinet officers, all sorts of wives,
and some who are not wives, use their influence.  You want an
appointment?  Do you go to Senator X?  Not much.  You get on the right
side of his wife.  Is it an appropriation?  You'd go 'straight to the
Committee, or to the Interior office, I suppose?  You'd learn better than
that.  It takes a woman to get any thing through the Land Office: I tell
you, Miss Laura would fascinate an appropriation right through the Senate
and the House of Representatives in one session, if she was in
Washington, as your friend, Colonel, of course as your friend."

"Would you have her sign our petition?" asked the Colonel, innocently.

Harry laughed.  "Women don't get anything by petitioning Congress; nobody
does, that's for form.  Petitions are referred somewhere, and that's the
last of them; you can't refer a handsome woman so easily, when she is
present.  They prefer 'em mostly."

The petition however was elaborately drawn up, with a glowing description
of Napoleon and the adjacent country, and a statement of the absolute
necessity to the prosperity of that region and of one of the stations on
the great through route to the Pacific, of the, immediate improvement of
Columbus River; to this was appended a map of the city and a survey of
the river.  It was signed by all the people at Stone's Landing who could
write their names, by Col. Beriah Sellers, and the Colonel agreed to have
the names headed by all the senators and representatives from the state
and by a sprinkling of ex-governors and ex-members of congress.  When
completed it was a formidable document.  Its preparation and that of more
minute plots of the new city consumed the valuable time of Sellers and
Harry for many weeks, and served to keep them both in the highest
spirits.

In the eyes of Washington Hawkins, Harry was a superior being, a man who
was able to bring things to pass in a way that excited his enthusiasm.
He never tired of listening to his stories of what he had done and of
what he was going to do.  As for Washington, Harry thought he was a man
of ability and comprehension, but "too visionary," he told the Colonel.
The Colonel said he might be right, but he had never noticed anything
visionary about him.

"He's got his plans, sir.  God bless my soul, at his age, I was full of
plans.  But experience sobers a man, I never touch any thing now that
hasn't been weighed in my judgment; and when Beriah Sellers puts his
judgment on a thing, there it is."

Whatever might have been Harry's intentions with regard to Laura, he saw
more and more of her every day, until he got to be restless and nervous
when he was not with her.

That consummate artist in passion allowed him to believe that the
fascination was mainly on his side, and so worked upon his vanity, while
inflaming his ardor, that he scarcely knew what he was about.  Her
coolness and coyness were even made to appear the simple precautions of a
modest timidity, and attracted him even more than the little tendernesses
into which she was occasionally surprised.  He could never be away from
her long, day or evening; and in a short time their intimacy was the town
talk.  She played with him so adroitly that Harry thought she was
absorbed in love for him, and yet he was amazed that he did not get on
faster in his conquest.

And when he thought of it, he was piqued as well.  A country girl, poor
enough, that was evident; living with her family in a cheap and most
unattractive frame house, such as carpenters build in America, scantily
furnished and unadorned; without the adventitious aids of dress or jewels
or the fine manners of society--Harry couldn't understand it.  But she
fascinated him, and held him just beyond the line of absolute familiarity
at the same time.  While he was with her she made him forget that the
Hawkins' house was nothing but a wooden tenement, with four small square
rooms on the ground floor and a half story; it might have been a palace
for aught he knew.

Perhaps Laura was older than Harry.  She was, at any rate, at that ripe
age when beauty in woman seems more solid than in the budding period of
girlhood, and she had come to understand her powers perfectly, and to
know exactly how much of the susceptibility and archness of the girl it
was profitable to retain.  She saw that many women, with the best
intentions, make a mistake of carrying too much girlishness into
womanhood.  Such a woman would have attracted Harry at any time, but only
a woman with a cool brain and exquisite art could have made him lose his
head in this way; for Harry thought himself a man of the world.  The
young fellow never dreamed that he was merely being experimented on; he
was to her a man of another society and another culture, different from
that she had any knowledge of except in books, and she was not unwilling
to try on him the fascinations of her mind and person.

For Laura had her dreams.  She detested the narrow limits in which her
lot was cast, she hated poverty.  Much of her reading had been of modern
works of fiction, written by her own sex, which had revealed to her
something of her own powers and given her indeed, an exaggerated notion
of the influence, the wealth, the position a woman may attain who has
beauty and talent and ambition and a little culture, and is not too
scrupulous in the use of them.  She wanted to be rich, she wanted luxury,
she wanted men at her feet, her slaves, and she had not--thanks to some
of the novels she had read--the nicest discrimination between notoriety
and reputation; perhaps she did not know how fatal notoriety usually is
to the bloom of womanhood.

With the other Hawkins children Laura had been brought up in the belief
that they had inherited a fortune in the Tennessee Lands.  She did not by
any means share all the delusion of the family; but her brain was not
seldom busy with schemes about it.  Washington seemed to her only to
dream of it and to be willing to wait for its riches to fall upon him in
a golden shower; but she was impatient, and wished she were a man to take
hold of the business.

"You men must enjoy your schemes and your activity and liberty to go
about the world," she said to Harry one day, when he had been talking of
New York and Washington and his incessant engagements.

"Oh, yes," replied that martyr to business, "it's all well enough, if you
don't have too much of it, but it only has one object."

"What is that?"

"If a woman doesn't know, it's useless to tell her.  What do you suppose
I am staying in Hawkeye for, week after week, when I ought to be with my
corps?"

"I suppose it's your business with Col. Sellers about Napoleon, you've
always told me so," answered Laura, with a look intended to contradict
her words.

"And now I tell you that is all arranged, I suppose you'll tell me I
ought to go?"

"Harry!" exclaimed Laura, touching his arm and letting her pretty hand
rest there a moment.  "Why should I want you to go away?  The only person
in Hawkeye who understands me."

"But you refuse to understand me," replied Harry, flattered but still
petulant.  "You are like an iceberg, when we are alone."

Laura looked up with wonder in her great eyes, and something like a blush
suffusing her face, followed by a look of langour that penetrated Harry's
heart as if it had been longing.

"Did I ever show any want of confidence in you, Harry?"  And she gave him
her hand, which Harry pressed with effusion--something in her manner told
him that he must be content with that favor.

It was always so.  She excited his hopes and denied him, inflamed his
passion and restrained it, and wound him in her toils day by day.  To
what purpose?  It was keen delight to Laura to prove that she had power
over men.

Laura liked to hear about life at the east, and especially about the
luxurious society in which Mr. Brierly moved when he was at home.  It
pleased her imagination to fancy herself a queen in it.

"You should be a winter in Washington," Harry said.

"But I have no acquaintances there."

"Don't know any of the families of the congressmen?  They like to have a
pretty woman staying with them."

"Not one."

"Suppose Col. Sellers should, have business there; say, about this
Columbus River appropriation?"

"Sellers!" and Laura laughed.

"You needn't laugh.  Queerer things have happened.  Sellers knows
everybody from Missouri, and from the West, too, for that matter.  He'd
introduce you to Washington life quick enough.  It doesn't need a crowbar
to break your way into society there as it does in Philadelphia.  It's
democratic, Washington is.  Money or beauty will open any door.  If I
were a handsome woman, I shouldn't want any better place than the capital
to pick up a prince or a fortune."

"Thank you," replied Laura.  "But I prefer the quiet of home, and the
love of those I know;" and her face wore a look of sweet contentment and
unworldliness that finished Mr. Harry Brierly for the day.

Nevertheless, the hint that Harry had dropped fell upon good ground, and
bore fruit an hundred fold; it worked in her mind until she had built up
a plan on it, and almost a career for herself.  Why not, she said, why
shouldn't I do as other women have done?  She took the first opportunity
to see Col. Sellers, and to sound him about the Washington visit.  How
was he getting on with his navigation scheme, would it be likely to take
him from home to Jefferson City; or to Washington, perhaps?

"Well, maybe.  If the people of Napoleon want me to go to Washington, and
look after that matter, I might tear myself from my home.  It's been
suggested to me, but--not a word of it to Mrs. Sellers and the children.
Maybe they wouldn't like to think of their father in Washington.  But
Dilworthy, Senator Dilworthy, says to me, 'Colonel, you are the man, you
could influence more votes than any one else on such a measure, an old
settler, a man of the people, you know the wants of Missouri; you've a
respect for religion too, says he, and know how the cause of the gospel
goes with improvements: Which is true enough, Miss Laura, and hasn't been
enough thought of in connection with Napoleon.  He's an able man,
Dilworthy, and a good man.  A man has got to be good to succeed as he
has.  He's only been in Congress a few years, and he must be worth a
million.  First thing in the morning when he stayed with me he asked
about family prayers, whether we had 'em before or after breakfast.
I hated to disappoint the Senator, but I had to out with it, tell him we
didn't have 'em, not steady.  He said he understood, business
interruptions and all that, some men were well enough without, but as for
him he never neglected the ordinances of religion.  He doubted if the
Columbus River appropriation would succeed if we did not invoke the
Divine Blessing on it."

Perhaps it is unnecessary to say to the reader that Senator Dilworthy had
not stayed with Col. Sellers while he was in Hawkeye; this visit to his
house being only one of the Colonel's hallucinations--one of those
instant creations of his fertile fancy, which were always flashing into
his brain and out of his mouth in the course of any conversation and
without interrupting the flow of it.

During the summer Philip rode across the country and made a short visit
in Hawkeye, giving Harry an opportunity to show him the progress that he
and the Colonel had made in their operation at Stone's Landing, to
introduce him also to Laura, and to borrow a little money when he
departed.  Harry bragged about his conquest, as was his habit, and took
Philip round to see his western prize.

Laura received Mr. Philip with a courtesy and a slight hauteur that
rather surprised and not a little interested him.  He saw at once that
she was older than Harry, and soon made up his mind that she was leading
his friend a country dance to which he was unaccustomed.  At least he
thought he saw that, and half hinted as much to Harry, who flared up at
once; but on a second visit Philip was not so sure, the young lady was
certainly kind and friendly and almost confiding with Harry, and treated
Philip with the greatest consideration.  She deferred to his opinions,
and listened attentively when he talked, and in time met his frank manner
with an equal frankness, so that he was quite convinced that whatever she
might feel towards Harry, she was sincere with him.  Perhaps his manly
way did win her liking.  Perhaps in her mind, she compared him with
Harry, and recognized in him a man to whom a woman might give her whole
soul, recklessly and with little care if she lost it.  Philip was not
invincible to her beauty nor to the intellectual charm of her presence.

The week seemed very short that he passed in Hawkeye, and when he bade
Laura good by, he seemed to have known her a year.

"We shall see you again, Mr. Sterling," she said as she gave him her
hand, with just a shade of sadness in her handsome eyes.

And when he turned away she followed him with a look that might have
disturbed his serenity, if he had not at the moment had a little square
letter in his breast pocket, dated at Philadelphia, and signed "Ruth."




CHAPTER XX.

The visit of Senator Abner Dilworthy was an event in Hawkeye.  When a
Senator, whose place is in Washington moving among the Great and guiding
the destinies of the nation, condescends to mingle among the people and
accept the hospitalities of such a place as Hawkeye, the honor is not
considered a light one.  All, parties are flattered by it and politics
are forgotten in the presence of one so distinguished among his fellows.

Senator Dilworthy, who was from a neighboring state, had been a Unionist
in the darkest days of his country, and had thriven by it, but was that
any reason why Col. Sellers, who had been a confederate and had not
thriven by it, should give him the cold shoulder?

The Senator was the guest of his old friend Gen. Boswell, but it almost
appeared that he was indebted to Col. Sellers for the unreserved
hospitalities of the town.  It was the large hearted Colonel who, in a
manner, gave him the freedom of the city.

"You are known here, sir," said the Colonel, "and Hawkeye is proud of
you.  You will find every door open, and a welcome at every hearthstone.
I should insist upon your going to my house, if you were not claimed by
your older friend Gen. Boswell.  But you will mingle with our people, and
you will see here developments that will surprise you."

The Colonel was so profuse in his hospitality that he must have made the
impression upon himself that he had entertained the Senator at his own
mansion during his stay; at any rate, he afterwards always spoke of him
as his guest, and not seldom referred to the Senator's relish of certain
viands on his table.  He did, in fact, press him to dine upon the morning
of the day the Senator was going away.

Senator Dilworthy was large and portly, though not tall--a pleasant
spoken man, a popular man with the people.

He took a lively interest in the town and all the surrounding country,
and made many inquiries as to the progress of agriculture, of education,
and of religion, and especially as to the condition of the emancipated
race.

"Providence," he said, "has placed them in our hands, and although you
and I, General, might have chosen a different destiny for them, under the
Constitution, yet Providence knows best."

"You can't do much with 'em," interrupted Col. Sellers.  "They are a
speculating race, sir, disinclined to work for white folks without
security, planning how to live by only working for themselves.  Idle,
sir, there's my garden just a ruin of weeds.  Nothing practical in 'em."

"There is some truth in your observation, Colonel, but you must educate
them."

"You educate the niggro and you make him more speculating than he was
before.  If he won't stick to any industry except for himself now, what
will he do then?"

"But, Colonel, the negro when educated will be more able to make his
speculations fruitful."

"Never, sir, never.  He would only have a wider scope to injure himself.
A niggro has no grasp, sir.  Now, a white man can conceive great
operations, and carry them out; a niggro can't."

"Still," replied the Senator, "granting that he might injure himself in a
worldly point of view, his elevation through education would multiply his
chances for the hereafter--which is the important thing after all,
Colonel.  And no matter what the result is, we must fulfill our duty by
this being."

"I'd elevate his soul," promptly responded the Colonel; "that's just it;
you can't make his soul too immortal, but I wouldn't touch him, himself.
Yes, sir!  make his soul immortal, but don't disturb the niggro as he
is."

Of course one of the entertainments offered the Senator was a public
reception, held in the court house, at which he made a speech to his
fellow citizens.  Col. Sellers was master of ceremonies.  He escorted the
band from the city hotel to Gen. Boswell's; he marshalled the procession
of Masons, of Odd Fellows, and of Firemen, the Good Templars, the Sons of
Temperance, the Cadets of Temperance, the Daughters of Rebecca, the
Sunday School children, and citizens generally, which followed the
Senator to the court house; he bustled about the room long after every
one else was seated, and loudly cried "Order!" in the dead silence which
preceded the introduction of the Senator by Gen. Boswell.  The occasion
was one to call out his finest powers of personal appearance, and one he
long dwelt on with pleasure.

This not being an edition of the Congressional Globe it is impossible to
give Senator Dilworthy's speech in full.  He began somewhat as follows:

"Fellow citizens: It gives me great pleasure to thus meet and mingle with
you, to lay aside for a moment the heavy duties of an official and
burdensome station, and confer in familiar converse with my friends in
your great state.  The good opinion of my fellow citizens of all sections
is the sweetest solace in all my anxieties.  I look forward with longing
to the time when I can lay aside the cares of office--" ["dam sight,"
shouted a tipsy fellow near the door.  Cries of "put him out."]

"My friends, do not remove him.  Let the misguided man stay.  I see that
he is a victim of that evil which is swallowing up public virtue and
sapping the foundation of society.  As I was saying, when I can lay down
the cares of office and retire to the sweets of private life in some such
sweet, peaceful, intelligent, wide-awake and patriotic place as Hawkeye
(applause).  I have traveled much, I have seen all parts of our glorious
union, but I have never seen a lovelier village than yours, or one that
has more signs of commercial and industrial and religious prosperity
--(more applause)."

The Senator then launched into a sketch of our great country, and dwelt
for an hour or more upon its prosperity and the dangers which threatened
it.

He then touched reverently upon the institutions of religion, and upon
the necessity of private purity, if we were to have any public morality.
"I trust," he said, "that there are children within the sound of my
voice," and after some remarks to them, the Senator closed with an
apostrophe to "the genius of American Liberty, walking with the Sunday
School in one hand and Temperance in the other up the glorified steps of
the National Capitol."

Col. Sellers did not of course lose the opportunity to impress upon so
influential a person as the Senator the desirability of improving the
navigation of Columbus river.  He and Mr. Brierly took the Senator over
to Napoleon and opened to him their plan.  It was a plan that the Senator
could understand without a great deal of explanation, for he seemed to be
familiar with the like improvements elsewhere.  When, however, they
reached Stone's Landing the Senator looked about him and inquired,

"Is this Napoleon?"

"This is the nucleus, the nucleus," said the Colonel, unrolling his map.
"Here is the deepo, the church, the City Hall and so on."

"Ah, I see.  How far from here is Columbus River?  Does that stream
empty----"

"That, why, that's Goose Run.  Thar ain't no Columbus, thout'n it's over
to Hawkeye," interrupted one of the citizens, who had come out to stare
at the strangers.  "A railroad come here last summer, but it haint been
here no mo'."

"Yes, sir," the Colonel hastened to explain, "in the old records
Columbus River is called Goose Run.  You see how it sweeps round the
town--forty-nine miles to the Missouri; sloop navigation all the way
pretty much, drains this whole country; when it's improved steamboats
will run right up here.  It's got to be enlarged, deepened.  You see by
the map. Columbus River.  This country must have water communication!"

"You'll want a considerable appropriation, Col. Sellers.

"I should say a million; is that your figure Mr. Brierly."

"According to our surveys," said Harry, "a million would do it; a million
spent on the river would make Napoleon worth two millions at least."

"I see," nodded the Senator.  "But you'd better begin by asking only for
two or three hundred thousand, the usual way.  You can begin to sell town
lots on that appropriation you know."

The Senator, himself, to do him justice, was not very much interested in
the country or the stream, but he favored the appropriation, and he gave
the Colonel and Mr. Brierly to and understand that he would endeavor to
get it through.  Harry, who thought he was shrewd and understood
Washington, suggested an interest.

But he saw that the Senator was wounded by the suggestion.

"You will offend me by repeating such an observation," he said.
"Whatever I do will be for the public interest.  It will require a
portion of the appropriation for necessary expenses, and I am sorry to
say that there are members who will have to be seen.  But you can reckon
upon my humble services."

This aspect of the subject was not again alluded to.  The Senator
possessed himself of the facts, not from his observation of the ground,
but from the lips of Col. Sellers, and laid the appropriation scheme away
among his other plans for benefiting the public.

It was on this visit also that the Senator made the acquaintance of Mr.
Washington Hawkins, and was greatly taken with his innocence, his
guileless manner and perhaps with his ready adaptability to enter upon
any plan proposed.

Col. Sellers was pleased to see this interest that Washington had
awakened, especially since it was likely to further his expectations with
regard to the Tennessee lands; the Senator having remarked to the
Colonel, that he delighted to help any deserving young man, when the
promotion of a private advantage could at the same time be made to
contribute to the general good.  And he did not doubt that this was an
opportunity of that kind.

The result of several conferences with Washington was that the Senator
proposed that he should go to Washington with him and become his private
secretary and the secretary of his committee; a proposal which was
eagerly accepted.

The Senator spent Sunday in Hawkeye and attended church.  He cheered the
heart of the worthy and zealous minister by an expression of his sympathy
in his labors, and by many inquiries in regard to the religious state of
the region.  It was not a very promising state, and the good man felt how
much lighter his task would be, if he had the aid of such a man as
Senator Dilworthy.

"I am glad to see, my dear sir," said the Senator, "that you give them
the doctrines.  It is owing to a neglect of the doctrines, that there is
such a fearful falling away in the country.  I wish that we might have
you in Washington--as chaplain, now, in the senate."

The good man could not but be a little flattered, and if sometimes,
thereafter, in his discouraging work, he allowed the thought that he
might perhaps be called to Washington as chaplain of the Senate, to cheer
him, who can wonder.  The Senator's commendation at least did one service
for him, it elevated him in the opinion of Hawkeye.

Laura was at church alone that day, and Mr. Brierly walked home with her.
A part of their way lay with that of General Boswell and Senator
Dilworthy, and introductions were made.  Laura had her own reasons for
wishing to know the Senator, and the Senator was not a man who could be
called indifferent to charms such as hers.  That meek young lady so
commended herself to him in the short walk, that he announced his
intentions of paying his respects to her the next day, an intention which
Harry received glumly; and when the Senator was out of hearing he called
him "an old fool."

"Fie," said Laura, "I do believe you are jealous, Harry.  He is a very
pleasant man.  He said you were a young man of great promise."

The Senator did call next day, and the result of his visit was that he
was confirmed in his impression that there was something about him very
attractive to ladies.  He saw Laura again and again daring his stay, and
felt more and more the subtle influence of her feminine beauty, which
every man felt who came near her.

Harry was beside himself with rage while the Senator remained in town;
he declared that women were always ready to drop any man for higher game;
and he attributed his own ill-luck to the Senator's appearance.  The
fellow was in fact crazy about her beauty and ready to beat his brains
out in chagrin.  Perhaps Laura enjoyed his torment, but she soothed him
with blandishments that increased his ardor, and she smiled to herself to
think that he had, with all his protestations of love, never spoken of
marriage.  Probably the vivacious fellow never had thought of it.  At any
rate when he at length went away from Hawkeye he was no nearer it.  But
there was no telling to what desperate lengths his passion might not
carry him.

Laura bade him good bye with tender regret, which, however, did not
disturb her peace or interfere with her plans.  The visit of Senator
Dilworthy had become of more importance to her, and it by and by bore the
fruit she longed for, in an invitation to visit his family in the
National Capital during the winter session of Congress.




CHAPTER XXI.

                              O lift your natures up:
               Embrace our aims: work out your freedom.  Girls,
               Knowledge is now no more a fountain sealed;
               Drink deep until the habits of the slave,
               The sins of emptiness, gossip and spite
               And slander, die.
                                   The Princess.

Whether medicine is a science, or only an empirical method of getting a
living out of the ignorance of the human race, Ruth found before her
first term was over at the medical school that there were other things
she needed to know quite as much as that which is taught in medical
books, and that she could never satisfy her aspirations without more
general culture.

"Does your doctor know any thing--I don't mean about medicine, but about
things in general, is he a man of information and good sense?" once asked
an old practitioner.  "If he doesn't know any thing but medicine the
chance is he doesn't know that:"

The close application to her special study was beginning to tell upon
Ruth's delicate health also, and the summer brought with it only
weariness and indisposition for any mental effort.

In this condition of mind and body the quiet of her home and the
unexciting companionship of those about her were more than ever tiresome.

She followed with more interest Philip's sparkling account of his life
in the west, and longed for his experiences, and to know some of those
people of a world so different from here, who alternately amused and
displeased him.  He at least was learning the world, the good and the bad
of it, as must happen to every one who accomplishes anything in it.

But what, Ruth wrote, could a woman do, tied up by custom, and cast into
particular circumstances out of which it was almost impossible to
extricate herself?  Philip thought that he would go some day and
extricate Ruth, but he did not write that, for he had the instinct to
know that this was not the extrication she dreamed of, and that she must
find out by her own experience what her heart really wanted.

Philip was not a philosopher, to be sure, but he had the old fashioned
notion, that whatever a woman's theories of life might be, she would come
round to matrimony, only give her time.  He could indeed recall to mind
one woman--and he never knew a nobler--whose whole soul was devoted and
who believed that her life was consecrated to a certain benevolent
project in singleness of life, who yielded to the touch of matrimony, as
an icicle yields to a sunbeam.

Neither at home nor elsewhere did Ruth utter any complaint, or admit any
weariness or doubt of her ability to pursue the path she had marked out
for herself.  But her mother saw clearly enough her struggle with
infirmity, and was not deceived by either her gaiety or by the cheerful
composure which she carried into all the ordinary duties that fell to
her.  She saw plainly enough that Ruth needed an entire change of scene
and of occupation, and perhaps she believed that such a change, with the
knowledge of the world it would bring, would divert Ruth from a course
for which she felt she was physically entirely unfitted.

It therefore suited the wishes of all concerned, when autumn came, that
Ruth should go away to school.  She selected a large New England
Seminary, of which she had often heard Philip speak, which was attended
by both sexes and offered almost collegiate advantages of education.
Thither she went in September, and began for the second time in the year
a life new to her.

The Seminary was the chief feature of Fallkill, a village of two to three
thousand inhabitants.  It was a prosperous school, with three hundred
students, a large corps of teachers, men and women, and with a venerable
rusty row of academic buildings on the shaded square of the town.  The
students lodged and boarded in private families in the place, and so it
came about that while the school did a great deal to support the town,
the town gave the students society and the sweet influences of home life.
It is at least respectful to say that the influences of home life are
sweet.

Ruth's home, by the intervention of Philip, was in a family--one of the
rare exceptions in life or in fiction--that had never known better days.
The Montagues, it is perhaps well to say, had intended to come over in
the Mayflower, but were detained at Delft Haven by the illness of a
child.  They came over to Massachusetts Bay in another vessel, and thus
escaped the onus of that brevet nobility under which the successors of
the Mayflower Pilgrims have descended.  Having no factitious weight of
dignity to carry, the Montagues steadily improved their condition from
the day they landed, and they were never more vigorous or prosperous than
at the date of this narrative.  With character compacted by the rigid
Puritan discipline of more than two centuries, they had retained its
strength and purity and thrown off its narrowness, and were now
blossoming under the generous modern influences.  Squire Oliver Montague,
a lawyer who had retired from the practice of his profession except in
rare cases, dwelt in a square old fashioned New England mile away from
the green.  It was called a mansion because it stood alone with ample
fields about it, and had an avenue of trees leading to it from the road,
and on the west commanded a view of a pretty little lake with gentle
slopes and nodding were now blossoming under the generous modern
influences.  Squire Oliver Montague, a lawyer who had retired from the
practice of his profession except in rare cases, dwelt in a square old
fashioned New England groves.  But it was just a plain, roomy house,
capable of extending to many guests an unpretending hospitality.

The family consisted of the Squire and his wife, a son and a daughter
married and not at home, a son in college at Cambridge, another son at
the Seminary, and a daughter Alice, who was a year or more older than
Ruth.  Having only riches enough to be able to gratify reasonable
desires, and yet make their gratifications always a novelty and a
pleasure, the family occupied that just mean in life which is so rarely
attained, and still more rarely enjoyed without discontent.

If Ruth did not find so much luxury in the house as in her own home,
there were evidences of culture, of intellectual activity and of a zest
in the affairs of all the world, which greatly impressed her.  Every room
had its book-cases or book-shelves, and was more or less a library; upon
every table was liable to be a litter of new books, fresh periodicals and
daily newspapers.  There were plants in the sunny windows and some choice
engravings on the walls, with bits of color in oil or water-colors;
the piano was sure to be open and strewn with music; and there were
photographs and little souvenirs here and there of foreign travel.
An absence of any "what-pots" in the corners with rows of cheerful
shells, and Hindoo gods, and Chinese idols, and nests of use less boxes
of lacquered wood, might be taken as denoting a languidness in the family
concerning foreign missions, but perhaps unjustly.

At any rate the life of the world flowed freely into this hospitable
house, and there was always so much talk there of the news of the day,
of the new books and of authors, of Boston radicalism and New York
civilization, and the virtue of Congress, that small gossip stood a very
poor chance.

All this was in many ways so new to Ruth that she seemed to have passed
into another world, in which she experienced a freedom and a mental
exhilaration unknown to her before.  Under this influence she entered
upon her studies with keen enjoyment, finding for a time all the
relaxation she needed, in the charming social life at the Montague house.

It is strange, she wrote to Philip, in one of her occasional letters,
that you never told me more about this delightful family, and scarcely
mentioned Alice who is the life of it, just the noblest girl, unselfish,
knows how to do so many things, with lots of talent, with a dry humor,
and an odd way of looking at things, and yet quiet and even serious
often--one of your "capable" New England girls.  We shall be great
friends.  It had never occurred to Philip that there was any thing
extraordinary about the family that needed mention.  He knew dozens of
girls like Alice, he thought to himself, but only one like Ruth.

Good friends the two girls were from the beginning.  Ruth was a study to
Alice; the product of a culture entirely foreign to her experience, so
much a child in some things, so much a woman in others; and Ruth in turn,
it must be confessed, probing Alice sometimes with her serious grey eyes,
wondered what her object in life was, and whether she had any purpose
beyond living as she now saw her.  For she could scarcely conceive of a
life that should not be devoted to the accomplishment of some definite
work, and she had-no doubt that in her own case everything else would
yield to the professional career she had marked out.

"So you know Philip Sterling," said Ruth one day as the girls sat at
their sewing.  Ruth never embroidered, and never sewed when she could
avoid it.  Bless her.

"Oh yes, we are old friends.  Philip used to come to Fallkill often while
he was in college.  He was once rusticated here for a term."

"Rusticated?"

"Suspended for some College scrape.  He was a great favorite here.
Father and he were famous friends.  Father said that Philip had no end of
nonsense in him and was always blundering into something, but he was a
royal good fellow and would come out all right."

"Did you think he was fickle?"

"Why, I never thought whether he was or not," replied Alice looking up.
"I suppose he was always in love with some girl or another, as college
boys are.  He used to make me his confidant now and then, and be terribly
in the dumps."

"Why did he come to you?" pursued Ruth you were younger than he."

"I'm sure I don't know.  He was at our house a good deal.  Once at a
picnic by the lake, at the risk of his own life, he saved sister Millie
from drowning, and we all liked to have him here.  Perhaps he thought as
he had saved one sister, the other ought to help him when he was in
trouble.  I don't know."

The fact was that Alice was a person who invited confidences, because she
never betrayed them, and gave abundant sympathy in return.  There are
persons, whom we all know, to whom human confidences, troubles and
heart-aches flow as naturally its streams to a placid lake.

This is not a history of Fallkill, nor of the Montague family, worthy as
both are of that honor, and this narrative cannot be diverted into long
loitering with them.  If the reader visits the village to-day, he will
doubtless be pointed out the Montague dwelling, where Ruth lived, the
cross-lots path she traversed to the Seminary, and the venerable chapel
with its cracked bell.

In the little society of the place, the Quaker girl was a favorite, and
no considerable social gathering or pleasure party was thought complete
without her.  There was something in this seemingly transparent and yet
deep character, in her childlike gaiety and enjoyment of the society
about her, and in her not seldom absorption in herself, that would have
made her long remembered there if no events had subsequently occurred to
recall her to mind.

To the surprise of Alice, Ruth took to the small gaieties of the village
with a zest of enjoyment that seemed foreign to one who had devoted her
life to a serious profession from the highest motives.  Alice liked
society well enough, she thought, but there was nothing exciting in that
of Fallkill, nor anything novel in the attentions of the well-bred young
gentlemen one met in it.  It must have worn a different aspect to Ruth,
for she entered into its pleasures at first with curiosity, and then with
interest and finally with a kind of staid abandon that no one would have
deemed possible for her.  Parties, picnics, rowing-matches, moonlight
strolls, nutting expeditions in the October woods,--Alice declared that
it was a whirl of dissipation.  The fondness of Ruth, which was scarcely
disguised, for the company of agreeable young fellows, who talked
nothings, gave Alice opportunity for no end of banter.

"Do you look upon them as I subjects, dear?" she would ask.

And Ruth laughed her merriest laugh, and then looked sober again.
Perhaps she was thinking, after all, whether she knew herself.

If you should rear a duck in the heart of the Sahara, no doubt it would
swim if you brought it to the Nile.

Surely no one would have predicted when Ruth left Philadelphia that she
would become absorbed to this extent, and so happy, in a life so unlike
that she thought she desired.  But no one can tell how a woman will act
under any circumstances.  The reason novelists nearly always fail in
depicting women when they make them act, is that they let them do what
they have observed some woman has done at sometime or another.  And that
is where they make a mistake; for a woman will never do again what has
been done before.  It is this uncertainty that causes women, considered
as materials for fiction, to be so interesting to themselves and to
others.

As the fall went on and the winter, Ruth did not distinguish herself
greatly at the Fallkill Seminary as a student, a fact that apparently
gave her no anxiety, and did not diminish her enjoyment of a new sort of
power which had awakened within her.




CHAPTER XXII.
In mid-winter, an event occurred of unusual interest to the inhabitants
of the Montague house, and to the friends of the young ladies who sought
their society.

This was the arrival at the Sassacua Hotel of two young gentlemen from
the west.

It is the fashion in New England to give Indian names to the public
houses, not that the late lamented savage knew how to keep a hotel, but
that his warlike name may impress the traveler who humbly craves shelter
there, and make him grateful to the noble and gentlemanly clerk if he is
allowed to depart with his scalp safe.

The two young gentlemen were neither students for the Fallkill Seminary,
nor lecturers on physiology, nor yet life assurance solicitors, three
suppositions that almost exhausted the guessing power of the people at
the hotel in respect to the names of "Philip Sterling and Henry Brierly,
Missouri," on the register.  They were handsome enough fellows, that was
evident, browned by out-door exposure, and with a free and lordly way
about them that almost awed the hotel clerk himself.  Indeed, he very
soon set down Mr. Brierly as a gentleman of large fortune, with enormous
interests on his shoulders.  Harry had a way of casually mentioning
western investments, through lines, the freighting business, and the
route through the Indian territory to Lower California, which was
calculated to give an importance to his lightest word.

"You've a pleasant town here, sir, and the most comfortable looking hotel
I've seen out of New York," said Harry to the clerk; "we shall stay here
a few days if you can give us a roomy suite of apartments."

Harry usually had the best of everything, wherever he went, as such
fellows always do have in this accommodating world.  Philip would have
been quite content with less expensive quarters, but there was no
resisting Harry's generosity in such matters.

Railroad surveying and real-estate operations were at a standstill during
the winter in Missouri, and the young men had taken advantage of the lull
to come east, Philip to see if there was any disposition in his friends,
the railway contractors, to give him a share in the Salt Lick Union
Pacific Extension, and Harry to open out to his uncle the prospects of
the new city at Stone's Landing, and to procure congressional
appropriations for the harbor and for making Goose Run navigable.  Harry
had with him a map of that noble stream and of the harbor, with a perfect
net-work of railroads centering in it, pictures of wharves, crowded with
steamboats, and of huge grain-elevators on the bank, all of which grew
out of the combined imaginations of Col. Sellers and Mr. Brierly.  The
Colonel had entire confidence in Harry's influence with Wall street, and
with congressmen, to bring about the consummation of their scheme, and he
waited his return in the empty house at Hawkeye, feeding his pinched
family upon the most gorgeous expectations with a reckless prodigality.

"Don't let 'em into the thing more than is necessary," says the Colonel
to Harry; "give 'em a small interest; a lot apiece in the suburbs of the
Landing ought to do a congressman, but I reckon you'll have to mortgage a
part of the city itself to the brokers."

Harry did not find that eagerness to lend money on Stone's Landing in
Wall street which Col. Sellers had expected, (it had seen too many such
maps as he exhibited), although his uncle and some of the brokers looked
with more favor on the appropriation for improving the navigation of
Columbus River, and were not disinclined to form a company for that
purpose.  An appropriation was a tangible thing, if you could get hold of
it, and it made little difference what it was appropriated for, so long
as you got hold of it.

Pending these weighty negotiations, Philip has persuaded Harry to take a
little run up to Fallkill, a not difficult task, for that young man would
at any time have turned his back upon all the land in the West at sight
of a new and pretty face, and he had, it must be confessed, a facility in
love making which made it not at all an interference with the more
serious business of life.  He could not, to be sure, conceive how Philip
could be interested in a young lady who was studying medicine, but he had
no objection to going, for he did not doubt that there were other girls
in Fallkill who were worth a week's attention.

The young men were received at the house of the Montagues with the
hospitality which never failed there.

"We are glad to see you again," exclaimed the Squire heartily, "you are
welcome Mr. Brierly, any friend of Phil's is welcome at our house"

"It's more like home to me, than any place except my own home," cried
Philip, as he looked about the cheerful house and went through a general
hand-shaking.

"It's a long time, though, since you have been here to say so," Alice
said, with her father's frankness of manner; "and I suspect we owe the
visit now to your sudden interest in the Fallkill Seminary."

Philip's color came, as it had an awkward way of doing in his tell-tale
face, but before he could stammer a reply, Harry came in with,

"That accounts for Phil's wish to build a Seminary at Stone's Landing,
our place in Missouri, when Col. Sellers insisted it should be a
University.  Phil appears to have a weakness for Seminaries."

"It would have been better for your friend Sellers," retorted Philip,
"if he had had a weakness for district schools.  Col. Sellers, Miss
Alice, is a great friend of Harry's, who is always trying to build a
house by beginning at the top."

"I suppose it's as easy to build a University on paper as a Seminary, and
it looks better," was Harry's reflection; at which the Squire laughed,
and said he quite agreed with him.  The old gentleman understood Stone's
Landing a good deal better than he would have done after an hour's talk
with either of it's expectant proprietors.

At this moment, and while Philip was trying to frame a question that he
found it exceedingly difficult to put into words, the door opened
quietly, and Ruth entered.  Taking in the, group with a quick glance, her
eye lighted up, and with a merry smile she advanced and shook hands with
Philip.  She was so unconstrained and sincerely cordial, that it made
that hero of the west feel somehow young, and very ill at ease.

For months and months he had thought of this meeting and pictured it to
himself a hundred times, but he had never imagined it would be like this.
He should meet Ruth unexpectedly, as she was walking alone from the
school, perhaps, or entering the room where he was waiting for her, and
she would cry "Oh!  Phil," and then check herself, and perhaps blush, and
Philip calm but eager and enthusiastic, would reassure her by his warm
manner, and he would take her hand impressively, and she would look up
timidly, and, after his' long absence, perhaps he would be permitted to
Good heavens, how many times he had come to this point, and wondered if
it could happen so.  Well, well; he had never supposed that he should be
the one embarrassed, and above all by a sincere and cordial welcome.

"We heard you were at the Sassacus House," were Ruth's first words; "and
this I suppose is your friend?"

"I beg your pardon," Philip at length blundered out, "this is Mr. Brierly
of whom I have written you."

And Ruth welcomed Harry with a friendliness that Philip thought was due
to his friend, to be sure, but which seemed to him too level with her
reception of himself, but which Harry received as his due from the other
sex.

Questions were asked about the journey and about the West, and the
conversation became a general one, until Philip at length found himself
talking with the Squire in relation to land and railroads and things he
couldn't keep his mind on especially as he heard Ruth and Harry in an
animated discourse, and caught the words "New York," and "opera," and
"reception," and knew that Harry was giving his imagination full range in
the world of fashion.

Harry knew all about the opera, green room and all (at least he said so)
and knew a good many of the operas and could make very entertaining
stories of their plots, telling how the soprano came in here, and the
basso here, humming the beginning of their airs--tum-ti-tum-ti-ti
--suggesting the profound dissatisfaction of the basso recitative--down
--among--the--dead--men--and touching off the whole with an airy grace
quite captivating; though he couldn't have sung a single air through to
save himself, and he hadn't an ear to know whether it was sung correctly.
All the same he doted on the opera, and kept a box there, into which he
lounged occasionally to hear a favorite scene and meet his society
friends.

If Ruth was ever in the city he should be happy to place his box at the
disposal of Ruth and her friends.  Needless to say that she was delighted
with the offer.

When she told Philip of it, that discreet young fellow only smiled, and
said that he hoped she would be fortunate enough to be in New York some
evening when Harry had not already given the use of his private box to
some other friend.

The Squire pressed the visitors to let him send for their trunks and
urged them to stay at his house, and Alice joined in the invitation, but
Philip had reasons for declining.  They staid to supper, however, and in;
the evening Philip had a long talk apart with Ruth, a delightful hour to
him, in which she spoke freely of herself as of old, of her studies at
Philadelphia and of her plans, and she entered into his adventures and
prospects in the West with a genuine and almost sisterly interest; an
interest, however, which did not exactly satisfy Philip--it was too
general and not personal enough to suit him.  And with all her freedom in
speaking of her own hopes, Philip could not, detect any reference to
himself in them; whereas he never undertook anything that he did not
think of Ruth in connection with it, he never made a plan that had not
reference to her, and he never thought of anything as complete if she
could not share it.  Fortune, reputation these had no value to him except
in Ruth's eyes, and there were times when it seemed to him that if Ruth
was not on this earth, he should plunge off into some remote wilderness
and live in a purposeless seclusion.

"I hoped," said Philip; "to get a little start in connection with this
new railroad, and make a little money, so that I could came east and
engage in something more suited to my tastes.  I shouldn't like to live
in the West.  Would you?

"It never occurred to me whether I would or not," was the unembarrassed
reply.  "One of our graduates went to Chicago, and has a nice practice
there.  I don't know where I shall go.  It would mortify mother
dreadfully to have me driving about Philadelphia in a doctor's gig."

Philip laughed at the idea of it.  "And does it seem as necessary to you
to do it as it did before you came to Fallkill?"

It was a home question, and went deeper than Philip knew, for Ruth at
once thought of practicing her profession among the young gentlemen and
ladies of her acquaintance in the village; but she was reluctant to admit
to herself that her notions of a career had undergone any change.

"Oh, I don't think I should come to Fallkill to practice, but I must do
something when I am through school; and why not medicine?"

Philip would like to have explained why not, but the explanation would be
of no use if it were not already obvious to Ruth.

Harry was equally in his element whether instructing Squire Montague
about the investment of capital in Missouri, the improvement of Columbus
River, the project he and some gentlemen in New York had for making a
shorter Pacific connection with the Mississippi than the present one; or
diverting Mrs. Montague with his experience in cooking in camp; or
drawing for Miss Alice an amusing picture of the social contrasts of New
England and the border where he had been. Harry was a very entertaining
fellow, having his imagination to help his memory, and telling his
stories as if he believed them--as perhaps he did. Alice was greatly
amused with Harry and listened so seriously to his romancing that he
exceeded his usual limits.  Chance allusions to his bachelor
establishment in town and the place of his family on the Hudson, could
not have been made by a millionaire, more naturally.

"I should think," queried Alice, "you would rather stay in New York than
to try the rough life at the West you have been speaking of."

"Oh, adventure," says Harry, "I get tired of New York.  And besides I
got involved in some operations that I had to see through.  Parties in
New York only last week wanted me to go down into Arizona in a big
diamond interest.  I told them, no, no speculation for me.  I've got my
interests in Missouri; and I wouldn't leave Philip, as long as he stays
there."

When the young gentlemen were on their way back to the hotel, Mr. Philip,
who was not in very good humor, broke out,

"What the deuce, Harry, did you go on in that style to the Montagues
for?"

"Go on?" cried Harry.  "Why shouldn't I try to make a pleasant evening?
And besides, ain't I going to do those things?  What difference does it
make about the mood and tense of a mere verb?  Didn't uncle tell me only
last Saturday, that I might as well go down to Arizona and hunt for
diamonds?  A fellow might as well make a good impression as a poor one."

"Nonsense.  You'll get to believing your own romancing by and by."

"Well, you'll see.  When Sellers and I get that appropriation, I'll show
you an establishment in town and another on the Hudson and a box at the
opera."

"Yes, it will be like Col. Sellers' plantation at Hawkeye.  Did you ever
see that?"

"Now, don't be cross, Phil.  She's just superb, that little woman.  You
never told me."

"Who's just superb?" growled Philip, fancying this turn of the
conversation less than the other.

"Well, Mrs. Montague, if you must know."  And Harry stopped to light a
cigar, and then puffed on in silence.  The little quarrel didn't last
over night, for Harry never appeared to cherish any ill-will half a
second, and Philip was too sensible to continue a row about nothing; and
he had invited Harry to come with him.

The young gentlemen stayed in Fallkill a week, and were every day at the
Montagues, and took part in the winter gaieties of the village.  There
were parties here and there to which the friends of Ruth and the
Montagues were of course invited, and Harry in the generosity of his
nature, gave in return a little supper at the hotel, very simple indeed,
with dancing in the hall, and some refreshments passed round.  And Philip
found the whole thing in the bill when he came to pay it.

Before the week was over Philip thought he had a new light on the
character of Ruth.  Her absorption in the small gaieties of the society
there surprised him.  He had few opportunities for serious conversation
with her.  There was always some butterfly or another flitting about,
and when Philip showed by his manner that he was not pleased, Ruth
laughed merrily enough and rallied him on his soberness--she declared he
was getting to be grim and unsocial.  He talked indeed more with Alice
than with Ruth, and scarcely concealed from her the trouble that was in
his mind.  It needed, in fact, no word from him, for she saw clearly
enough what was going forward, and knew her sex well enough to know there
was no remedy for it but time.

"Ruth is a dear girl, Philip, and has as much firmness of purpose as
ever, but don't you see she has just discovered that she is fond of
society?  Don't you let her see you are selfish about it, is my advice."

The last evening they were to spend in Fallkill, they were at the
Montagues, and Philip hoped that he would find Ruth in a different mood.
But she was never more gay, and there was a spice of mischief in her eye
and in her laugh.  "Confound it," said Philip to himself, "she's in a
perfect twitter."

He would have liked to quarrel with her, and fling himself out of the
house in tragedy style, going perhaps so far as to blindly wander off
miles into the country and bathe his throbbing brow in the chilling rain
of the stars, as people do in novels; but he had no opportunity.  For
Ruth was as serenely unconscious of mischief as women can be at times,
and fascinated him more than ever with her little demurenesses and
half-confidences.  She even said "Thee" to him once in reproach for a
cutting speech he began.  And the sweet little word made his heart beat
like a trip-hammer, for never in all her life had she said "thee" to him
before.

Was she fascinated with Harry's careless 'bon homie' and gay assurance?
Both chatted away in high spirits, and made the evening whirl along in
the most mirthful manner.  Ruth sang for Harry, and that young gentleman
turned the leaves for her at the piano, and put in a bass note now and
then where he thought it would tell.

Yes, it was a merry evening, and Philip was heartily glad when it was
over, and the long leave-taking with the family was through with.

"Farewell Philip.  Good night Mr. Brierly," Ruth's clear voice sounded
after them as they went down the walk.

And she spoke Harry's name last, thought Philip.




CHAPTER XXIII.

               "O see ye not yon narrow road
               So thick beset wi' thorns and briers?
               That is the Path of Righteousness,
               Though after it but few inquires.

               "And see ye not yon braid, braid road,
               That lies across the lily leven?
               That is the Path of Wickedness,
               Though some call it the road to Heaven."

                                             Thomas the Rhymer.

Phillip and Harry reached New York in very different states of mind.
Harry was buoyant.  He found a letter from Col. Sellers urging him to go
to Washington and confer with Senator Dilworthy.  The petition was in his
hands.

It had been signed by everybody of any importance in Missouri, and would
be presented immediately.

"I should go on myself," wrote the Colonel, "but I am engaged in the
invention of a process for lighting such a city as St. Louis by means of
water; just attach my machine to the water-pipes anywhere and the
decomposition of the fluid begins, and you will have floods of light for
the mere cost of the machine.  I've nearly got the lighting part, but I
want to attach to it a heating, cooking, washing and ironing apparatus.
It's going to be the great thing, but we'd better keep this appropriation
going while I am perfecting it."

Harry took letters to several congressmen from his uncle and from Mr.
Duff Brown, each of whom had an extensive acquaintance in both houses
where they were well known as men engaged in large private operations for
the public good and men, besides, who, in the slang of the day,
understood the virtues of "addition, division and silence."

Senator Dilworthy introduced the petition into the Senate with the remark
that he knew, personally, the signers of it, that they were men
interested; it was true, in the improvement of the country, but he
believed without any selfish motive, and that so far as he knew the
signers were loyal.  It pleased him to see upon the roll the names of
many colored citizens, and it must rejoice every friend of humanity to
know that this lately emancipated race were intelligently taking part in
the development of the resources of their native land.  He moved the
reference of the petition to the proper committee.

Senator Dilworthy introduced his young friend to influential members,
as a person who was very well informed about the Salt Lick Extension of
the Pacific, and was one of the Engineers who had made a careful survey
of Columbus River; and left him to exhibit his maps and plans and to show
the connection between the public treasury, the city of Napoleon and
legislation for the benefit off the whole country.

Harry was the guest of Senator Dilworthy.  There was scarcely any good
movement in which the Senator was not interested.  His house was open to
all the laborers in the field of total abstinence, and much of his time
was taken up in attending the meetings of this cause.  He had a Bible
class in the Sunday school of the church which he attended, and he
suggested to Harry that he might take a class during the time he remained
in Washington, Mr. Washington Hawkins had a class.  Harry asked the
Senator if there was a class of young ladies for him to teach, and after
that the Senator did not press the subject.

Philip, if the truth must be told, was not well satisfied with his
western prospects, nor altogether with the people he had fallen in with.
The railroad contractors held out large but rather indefinite promises.
Opportunities for a fortune he did not doubt existed in Missouri, but for
himself he saw no better means for livelihood than the mastery of the
profession he had rather thoughtlessly entered upon.  During the summer
he had made considerable practical advance in the science of engineering;
he had been diligent, and made himself to a certain extent necessary to
the work he was engaged on.  The contractors called him into their
consultations frequently, as to the character of the country he had been
over, and the cost of constructing the road, the nature of the work, etc.

Still Philip felt that if he was going to make either reputation or money
as an engineer, he had a great deal of hard study before him, and it is
to his credit that he did not shrink from it.  While Harry was in
Washington dancing attendance upon the national legislature and making
the acquaintance of the vast lobby that encircled it, Philip devoted
himself day and night, with an energy and a concentration he was capable
of, to the learning and theory of his profession, and to the science of
railroad building.  He wrote some papers at this time for the "Plow, the
Loom and the Anvil," upon the strength of materials, and especially upon
bridge-building, which attracted considerable attention, and were copied
into the English "Practical Magazine."  They served at any rate to raise
Philip in the opinion of his friends the contractors, for practical men
have a certain superstitious estimation of ability with the pen, and
though they may a little despise the talent, they are quite ready to make
use of it.

Philip sent copies of his performances to Ruth's father and to other
gentlemen whose good opinion he coveted, but he did not rest upon his
laurels.  Indeed, so diligently had he applied himself, that when it came
time for him to return to the West, he felt himself, at least in theory,
competent to take charge of a division in the field.




CHAPTER XXIV.

The capital of the Great Republic was a new world to country-bred
Washington Hawkins.  St. Louis was a greater city, but its floating.
population did not hail from great distances, and so it had the general
family aspect of the permanent population; but Washington gathered its
people from the four winds of heaven, and so the manners, the faces and
the fashions there, presented a variety that was infinite.  Washington
had never been in "society" in St. Louis, and he knew nothing of the ways
of its wealthier citizens and had never inspected one of their dwellings.
Consequently, everything in the nature of modern fashion and grandeur was
a new and wonderful revelation to him.

Washington is an interesting city to any of us.  It seems to become more
and more interesting the oftener we visit it.  Perhaps the reader has
never been there?  Very well.  You arrive either at night, rather too
late to do anything or see anything until morning, or you arrive so early
in the morning that you consider it best to go to your hotel and sleep an
hour or two while the sun bothers along over the Atlantic.  You cannot
well arrive at a pleasant intermediate hour, because the railway
corporation that keeps the keys of the only door that leads into the town
or out of it take care of that.  You arrive in tolerably good spirits,
because it is only thirty-eight miles from Baltimore to the capital, and
so you have only been insulted three times (provided you are not in a
sleeping car--the average is higher there): once when you renewed your
ticket after stopping over in Baltimore, once when you were about to
enter the "ladies' car" without knowing it was a lady's car, and once
When you asked the conductor at what hour you would reach Washington.

You are assailed by a long rank of hackmen who shake their whips in your
face as you step out upon the sidewalk; you enter what they regard as a
"carriage," in the capital, and you wonder why they do not take it out of
service and put it in the museum: we have few enough antiquities, and
it is little to our credit that we make scarcely any effort to preserve
the few we have.  You reach your hotel, presently--and here let us draw
the curtain of charity--because of course you have gone to the wrong one.
You being a stranger, how could you do otherwise?  There are a hundred
and eighteen bad hotels, and only one good one.  The most renowned and
popular hotel of them all is perhaps the worst one known to history.

It is winter, and night.  When you arrived, it was snowing.  When you
reached the hotel, it was sleeting.  When you went to bed, it was
raining.  During the night it froze hard, and the wind blew some chimneys
down.  When you got up in the morning, it was foggy.  When you finished
your breakfast at ten o'clock and went out, the sunshine was brilliant,
the weather balmy and delicious, and the mud and slush deep and
all-pervading.  You will like the climate when you get used to it.

You naturally wish to view the city; so you take an umbrella, an
overcoat, and a fan, and go forth.  The prominent features you soon
locate and get familiar with; first you glimpse the ornamental upper
works of a long, snowy palace projecting above a grove of trees, and a
tall, graceful white dome with a statue on it surmounting the palace and
pleasantly contrasting with the background of blue sky.  That building is
the capitol; gossips will tell you that by the original estimates it was
to cost $12,000,000, and that the government did come within $21,200,000
of building it for that sum.

You stand at the back of the capitol to treat yourself to a view, and it
is a very noble one.  You understand, the capitol stands upon the verge
of a high piece of table land, a fine commanding position, and its front
looks out over this noble situation for a city--but it don't see it, for
the reason that when the capitol extension was decided upon, the property
owners at once advanced their prices to such inhuman figures that the
people went down and built the city in the muddy low marsh behind the
temple of liberty; so now the lordly front of the building, with, its
imposing colonades, its, projecting, graceful wings, its, picturesque
groups of statuary, and its long terraced ranges of steps, flowing down
in white marble waves to the ground, merely looks out upon a sorrowful
little desert of cheap boarding houses.

So you observe, that you take your view from the back of the capitol.
And yet not from the airy outlooks of the dome, by the way, because to
get there you must pass through the great rotunda: and to do that, you
would have to see the marvelous Historical Paintings that hang there,
and the bas-reliefs--and what have you done that you should suffer thus?
And besides, you might have to pass through the old part of the building,
and you could not help seeing Mr. Lincoln, as petrified by a young lady
artist for $10,000--and you might take his marble emancipation
proclamation, which he holds out in his hand and contemplates, for a
folded napkin; and you might conceive from his expression and his
attitude, that he is finding fault with the washing.  Which is not the
case.  Nobody knows what is the matter with him; but everybody feels for
him.  Well, you ought not to go into the dome anyhow, because it would be
utterly impossible to go up there without seeing the frescoes in it--and
why should you be interested in the delirium tremens of art?

The capitol is a very noble and a very beautiful building, both within
and without, but you need not examine it now.  Still, if you greatly
prefer going into the dome, go.  Now your general glance gives you
picturesque stretches of gleaming water, on your left, with a sail here
and there and a lunatic asylum on shore; over beyond the water, on a
distant elevation, you see a squat yellow temple which your eye dwells
upon lovingly through a blur of unmanly moisture, for it recalls your
lost boyhood and the Parthenons done in molasses candy which made it
blest and beautiful.  Still in the distance, but on this side of the
water and close to its edge, the Monument to the Father of his Country
towers out of the mud--sacred soil is the, customary term.  It has the
aspect of a factory chimney with the top broken off.  The skeleton of a
decaying scaffolding lingers about its summit, and tradition says that
the spirit of Washington often comes down and sits on those rafters to
enjoy this tribute of respect which the nation has reared as the symbol
of its unappeasable gratitude.  The Monument is to be finished, some day,
and at that time our Washington will have risen still higher in the
nation's veneration, and will be known as the Great-Great-Grandfather of
his Country.  The memorial Chimney stands in a quiet pastoral locality
that is full of reposeful expression.  With a glass you can see the
cow-sheds about its base, and the contented sheep nimbling pebbles in the
desert solitudes that surround it, and the tired pigs dozing in the holy
calm of its protecting shadow.

Now you wrench your gaze loose, and you look down in front of you and see
the broad Pennsylvania Avenue stretching straight ahead for a mile or
more till it brings up against the iron fence in front of a pillared
granite pile, the Treasury building-an edifice that would command respect
in any capital.  The stores and hotels that wall in this broad avenue are
mean, and cheap, and dingy, and are better left without comment.  Beyond
the Treasury is a fine large white barn, with wide unhandsome grounds
about it.  The President lives there.  It is ugly enough outside, but
that is nothing to what it is inside.  Dreariness, flimsiness, bad taste
reduced to mathematical completeness is what the inside offers to the
eye, if it remains yet what it always has been.

The front and right hand views give you the city at large.  It is a wide
stretch of cheap little brick houses, with here and there a noble
architectural pile lifting itself out of the midst-government buildings,
these.  If the thaw is still going on when you come down and go about
town, you will wonder at the short-sightedness of the city fathers, when
you come to inspect the streets, in that they do not dilute the mud a
little more and use them for canals.

If you inquire around a little, you will find that there are more
boardinghouses to the square acre in Washington than there are in any
other city in the land, perhaps.  If you apply for a home in one of them,
it will seem odd to you to have the landlady inspect you with a severe
eye and then ask you if you are a member of Congress.  Perhaps, just as a
pleasantry, you will say yes.  And then she will tell you that she is
"full."  Then you show her her advertisement in the morning paper, and
there she stands, convicted and ashamed.  She will try to blush, and it
will be only polite in you to take the effort for the deed.  She shows
you her rooms, now, and lets you take one--but she makes you pay in
advance for it.  That is what you will get for pretending to be a member
of Congress.  If you had been content to be merely a private citizen,
your trunk would have been sufficient security for your board.  If you
are curious and inquire into this thing, the chances are that your
landlady will be ill-natured enough to say that the person and property
of a Congressman are exempt from arrest or detention, and that with the
tears in her eyes she has seen several of the people's representatives
walk off to their several States and Territories carrying her unreceipted
board bills in their pockets for keepsakes.  And before you have been in
Washington many weeks you will be mean enough to believe her, too.

Of course you contrive to see everything and find out everything.  And
one of the first and most startling things you find out is, that every
individual you encounter in the City of Washington almost--and certainly
every separate and distinct individual in the public employment, from the
highest bureau chief, clear down to the maid who scrubs Department halls,
the night watchmen of the public buildings and the darkey boy who
purifies the Department spittoons--represents Political Influence.
Unless you can get the ear of a Senator, or a Congressman, or a Chief of
a Bureau or Department, and persuade him to use his "influence" in your
behalf, you cannot get an employment of the most trivial nature in
Washington.  Mere merit, fitness and capability, are useless baggage to
you without "influence."  The population of Washington consists pretty
much entirely of government employee and the people who board them.
There are thousands of these employees, and they have gathered there from
every corner of the Union and got their berths through the intercession
(command is nearer the word) of the Senators and Representatives of their
respective States.  It would be an odd circumstance to see a girl get
employment at three or four dollars a week in one of the great public
cribs without any political grandee to back her, but merely because she
was worthy, and competent, and a good citizen of a free country that
"treats all persons alike."  Washington would be mildly thunderstruck at
such a thing as that.  If you are a member of Congress, (no offence,) and
one of your constituents who doesn't know anything, and does not want to
go into the bother of learning something, and has no money, and no
employment, and can't earn a living, comes besieging you for help, do you
say, "Come, my friend, if your services were valuable you could get
employment elsewhere--don't want you here?"  Oh, no: You take him to a
Department and say, "Here, give this person something to pass away the
time at--and a salary"--and the thing is done.  You throw him on his
country.  He is his country's child, let his country support him.  There
is something good and motherly about Washington, the grand old benevolent
National Asylum for the Helpless.

The wages received by this great hive of employees are placed at the
liberal figure meet and just for skilled and competent labor.  Such of
them as are immediately employed about the two Houses of Congress, are
not only liberally paid also, but are remembered in the customary Extra
Compensation bill which slides neatly through, annually, with the general
grab that signalizes the last night of a session, and thus twenty per
cent. is added to their wages, for--for fun, no doubt.

Washington Hawkins' new life was an unceasing delight to him.  Senator
Dilworthy lived sumptuously, and Washington's quarters were charming
--gas; running water, hot and cold; bath-room, coal-fires, rich carpets,
beautiful pictures on the walls; books on religion, temperance, public
charities and financial schemes; trim colored servants, dainty food
--everything a body could wish for.  And as for stationery, there was no
end to it; the government furnished it; postage stamps were not needed
--the Senator's frank could convey a horse through the mails, if necessary.

And then he saw such dazzling company.  Renowned generals and admirals
who had seemed but colossal myths when he was in the far west, went in
and out before him or sat at the Senator's table, solidified into
palpable flesh and blood; famous statesmen crossed his path daily; that
once rare and awe-inspiring being, a Congressman, was become a common
spectacle--a spectacle so common, indeed, that he could contemplate it
without excitement, even without embarrassment; foreign ministers were
visible to the naked eye at happy intervals; he had looked upon the
President himself, and lived.  And more; this world of enchantment teemed
with speculation--the whole atmosphere was thick with hand that indeed
was Washington Hawkins' native air; none other refreshed his lungs so
gratefully.  He had found paradise at last.

The more he saw of his chief the Senator, the more he honored him, and
the more conspicuously the moral grandeur of his character appeared to
stand out.  To possess the friendship and the kindly interest of such a
man, Washington said in a letter to Louise, was a happy fortune for a
young man whose career had been so impeded and so clouded as his.

The weeks drifted by;--Harry Brierly flirted, danced, added lustre
to the brilliant Senatorial receptions, and diligently "buzzed" and
"button-holed" Congressmen in the interest of the Columbus River scheme;
meantime Senator Dilworthy labored hard in the same interest--and in
others of equal national importance.  Harry wrote frequently to Sellers,
and always encouragingly; and from these letters it was easy to see that
Harry was a pet with all Washington, and was likely to carry the thing
through; that the assistance rendered him by "old Dilworthy" was pretty
fair--pretty fair; "and every little helps, you know," said Harry.

Washington wrote Sellers officially, now and then.  In one of his letters
it appeared that whereas no member of the House committee favored the
scheme at first, there was now needed but one more vote to compass a
majority report.  Closing sentence:

     "Providence seems to further our efforts."
          (Signed,) "ABNER DILWORTHY, U. S. S.,
                         per WASHINGTON HAWKINS, P. S."

At the end of a week, Washington was able to send the happy news,
officially, as usual,--that the needed vote had been added and the bill
favorably reported from the Committee.  Other letters recorded its perils
in Committee of the whole, and by and by its victory, by just the skin of
its teeth, on third reading and final passage.  Then came letters telling
of Mr. Dilworthy's struggles with a stubborn majority in his own
Committee in the Senate; of how these gentlemen succumbed, one by one,
till a majority was secured.

Then there was a hiatus.  Washington watched every move on the board, and
he was in a good position to do this, for he was clerk of this committee,
and also one other.  He received no salary as private secretary, but
these two clerkships, procured by his benefactor, paid him an aggregate
of twelve dollars a day, without counting the twenty percent extra
compensation which would of course be voted to him on the last night of
the session.

He saw the bill go into Committee of the whole and struggle for its life
again, and finally worry through.  In the fullness of time he noted its
second reading, and by and by the day arrived when the grand ordeal came,
and it was put upon its final passage.  Washington listened with bated
breath to the "Aye!" "No!" "No!" "Aye!" of the voters, for a few dread
minutes, and then could bear the suspense no longer.  He ran down from
the gallery and hurried home to wait.

At the end of two or three hours the Senator arrived in the bosom of his
family, and dinner was waiting.  Washington sprang forward, with the
eager question on his lips, and the Senator said:

"We may rejoice freely, now, my son--Providence has crowned our efforts
with success."




CHAPTER XXV.

Washington sent grand good news to Col. Sellers that night.  To Louise he
wrote:

"It is beautiful to hear him talk when his heart is full of thankfulness
for some manifestation of the Divine favor.  You shall know him, some day
my Louise, and knowing him you will honor him, as I do."

Harry wrote:

"I pulled it through, Colonel, but it was a tough job, there is no
question about that.  There was not a friend to the measure in the House
committee when I began, and not a friend in the Senate committee except
old Dil himself, but they were all fixed for a majority report when I
hauled off my forces.  Everybody here says you can't get a thing like
this through Congress without buying committees for straight-out cash on
delivery, but I think I've taught them a thing or two--if I could only
make them believe it.  When I tell the old residenters that this thing
went through without buying a vote or making a promise, they say, 'That's
rather too thin.'  And when I say thin or not thin it's a fact, anyway,
they say, 'Come, now, but do you really believe that?' and when I say I
don't believe anything about it, I know it, they smile and say, 'Well,
you are pretty innocent, or pretty blind, one or the other--there's no
getting around that.'  Why they really do believe that votes have been
bought--they do indeed.  But let them keep on thinking so.  I have found
out that if a man knows how to talk to women, and has a little gift in
the way of argument with men, he can afford to play for an appropriation
against a money bag and give the money bag odds in the game.  We've raked
in $200,000 of Uncle Sam's money, say what they will--and there is more
where this came from, when we want it, and I rather fancy I am the person
that can go in and occupy it, too, if I do say it myself, that shouldn't,
perhaps.  I'll be with you within a week.  Scare up all the men you can,
and put them to work at once.  When I get there I propose to make things
hum."  The great news lifted Sellers into the clouds.  He went to work on
the instant.  He flew hither and thither making contracts, engaging men,
and steeping his soul in the ecstasies of business.  He was the happiest
man in Missouri.  And Louise was the happiest woman; for presently came a
letter from Washington which said:

"Rejoice with me, for the long agony is over!  We have waited patiently
and faithfully, all these years, and now at last the reward is at hand.
A man is to pay our family $40,000 for the Tennessee Land!  It is but a
little sum compared to what we could get by waiting, but I do so long to
see the day when I can call you my own, that I have said to myself,
better take this and enjoy life in a humble way than wear out our best
days in this miserable separation.  Besides, I can put this money into
operations here that will increase it a hundred fold, yes, a thousand
fold, in a few months.  The air is full of such chances, and I know our
family would consent in a moment that I should put in their shares with
mine.  Without a doubt we shall be worth half a million dollars in a year
from this time--I put it at the very lowest figure, because it is always
best to be on the safe side--half a million at the very lowest
calculation, and then your father will give his consent and we can marry
at last.  Oh, that will be a glorious day.  Tell our friends the good
news--I want all to share it."

And she did tell her father and mother, but they said, let it be kept
still for the present.  The careful father also told her to write
Washington and warn him not to speculate with the money, but to wait a
little and advise with one or two wise old heads.  She did this.  And she
managed to keep the good news to herself, though it would seem that the
most careless observer might have seen by her springing step and her
radiant countenance that some fine piece of good fortune had descended
upon her.

Harry joined the Colonel at Stone's Landing, and that dead place sprang
into sudden life.  A swarm of men were hard at work, and the dull air was
filled with the cheery music of labor.  Harry had been constituted
engineer-in-general, and he threw the full strength of his powers into
his work.  He moved among his hirelings like a king.  Authority seemed to
invest him with a new splendor.  Col. Sellers, as general superintendent
of a great public enterprise, was all that a mere human being could be
--and more.  These two grandees went at their imposing "improvement" with
the air of men who had been charged with the work of altering the
foundations of the globe.

They turned their first attention to straightening the river just above
the Landing, where it made a deep bend, and where the maps and plans
showed that the process of straightening would not only shorten distance
but increase the "fall."  They started a cut-off canal across the
peninsula formed by the bend, and such another tearing up of the earth
and slopping around in the mud as followed the order to the men, had
never been seen in that region before.  There was such a panic among the
turtles that at the end of six hours there was not one to be found within
three miles of Stone's Landing.  They took the young and the aged, the
decrepit and the sick upon their backs and left for tide-water in
disorderly procession, the tadpoles following and the bull-frogs bringing
up the rear.

Saturday night came, but the men were obliged to wait, because the
appropriation had not come.  Harry said he had written to hurry up the
money and it would be along presently.  So the work continued, on Monday.
Stone's Landing was making quite a stir in the vicinity, by this time.
Sellers threw a lot or two on the market, "as a feeler," and they sold
well.  He re-clothed his family, laid in a good stock of provisions, and
still had money left.  He started a bank account, in a small way--and
mentioned the deposit casually to friends; and to strangers, too; to
everybody, in fact; but not as a new thing--on the contrary, as a matter
of life-long standing.  He could not keep from buying trifles every day
that were not wholly necessary, it was such a gaudy thing to get out his
bank-book and draw a check, instead of using his old customary formula,
"Charge it" Harry sold a lot or two, also--and had a dinner party or two
at Hawkeye and a general good time with the money.  Both men held on
pretty strenuously for the coming big prices, however.

At the end of a month things were looking bad.  Harry had besieged the
New York headquarters of the Columbus River Slack-water Navigation
Company with demands, then commands, and finally appeals, but to no
purpose; the appropriation did not come; the letters were not even
answered.  The workmen were clamorous, now.  The Colonel and Harry
retired to consult.

"What's to be done?" said the Colonel.

"Hang'd if I know."

"Company say anything?"

"Not a word."

"You telegraphed yesterday?"

Yes, and the day before, too."

"No answer?"

"None-confound them!"

Then there was a long pause.  Finally both spoke at once:

"I've got it!"

"I've got it!"

"What's yours?" said Harry.

"Give the boys thirty-day orders on the Company for the back pay."

"That's it-that's my own idea to a dot.  But then--but then----"

"Yes, I know," said the Colonel; "I know they can't wait for the orders
to go to New York and be cashed, but what's the reason they can't get
them discounted in Hawkeye?"

"Of course they can.  That solves the difficulty.  Everybody knows the
appropriation's been made and the Company's perfectly good."

So the orders were given and the men appeased, though they grumbled a
little at first.  The orders went well enough for groceries and such
things at a fair discount, and the work danced along gaily for a time.
Two or three purchasers put up frame houses at the Landing and moved in,
and of course a far-sighted but easy-going journeyman printer wandered
along and started the "Napoleon Weekly Telegraph and Literary
Repository"--a paper with a Latin motto from the Unabridged dictionary,
and plenty of "fat" conversational tales and double-leaded poetry--all
for two dollars a year, strictly in advance.  Of course the merchants
forwarded the orders at once to New York--and never heard of them again.

At the end of some weeks Harry's orders were a drug in the market--nobody
would take them at any discount whatever.  The second month closed with a
riot.--Sellers was absent at the time, and Harry began an active absence
himself with the mob at his heels.  But being on horseback, he had the
advantage.  He did not tarry in Hawkeye, but went on, thus missing
several appointments with creditors.  He was far on his flight eastward,
and well out of danger when the next morning dawned.  He telegraphed the
Colonel to go down and quiet the laborers--he was bound east for money
--everything would be right in a week--tell the men so--tell them to rely
on him and not be afraid.

Sellers found the mob quiet enough when he reached the Landing.
They had gutted the Navigation office, then piled the beautiful engraved
stock-books and things in the middle of the floor and enjoyed the bonfire
while it lasted.  They had a liking for the Colonel, but still they had
some idea of hanging him, as a sort of make-shift that might answer,
after a fashion, in place of more satisfactory game.

But they made the mistake of waiting to hear what he had to say first.
Within fifteen minutes his tongue had done its work and they were all
rich men.--He gave every one of them a lot in the suburbs of the city of
Stone's Landing, within a mile and a half of the future post office and
railway station, and they promised to resume work as soon as Harry got
east and started the money along.  Now things were blooming and pleasant
again, but the men had no money, and nothing to live on.  The Colonel
divided with them the money he still had in bank--an act which had
nothing surprising about it because he was generally ready to divide
whatever he had with anybody that wanted it, and it was owing to this
very trait that his family spent their days in poverty and at times were
pinched with famine.

When the men's minds had cooled and Sellers was gone, they hated
themselves for letting him beguile them with fine speeches, but it was
too late, now--they agreed to hang him another time--such time as
Providence should appoint.




CHAPTER XXVI.

Rumors of Ruth's frivolity and worldliness at Fallkill traveled to
Philadelphia in due time, and occasioned no little undertalk among the
Bolton relatives.

Hannah Shoecraft told another, cousin that, for her part, she never
believed that Ruth had so much more "mind" than other people; and Cousin
Hulda added that she always thought Ruth was fond of admiration, and that
was the reason she was unwilling to wear plain clothes and attend
Meeting.  The story that Ruth was "engaged" to a young gentleman of
fortune in Fallkill came with the other news, and helped to give point to
the little satirical remarks that went round about Ruth's desire to be a
doctor!

Margaret Bolton was too wise to be either surprised or alarmed by these
rumors.  They might be true; she knew a woman's nature too well to think
them improbable, but she also knew how steadfast Ruth was in her
purposes, and that, as a brook breaks into ripples and eddies and dances
and sports by the way, and yet keeps on to the sea, it was in Ruth's
nature to give back cheerful answer to the solicitations of friendliness
and pleasure, to appear idly delaying even, and sporting in the sunshine,
while the current of her resolution flowed steadily on.

That Ruth had this delight in the mere surface play of life that she
could, for instance, be interested in that somewhat serious by-play
called "flirtation," or take any delight in the exercise of those little
arts of pleasing and winning which are none the less genuine and charming
because they are not intellectual, Ruth, herself, had never suspected
until she went to Fallkill.  She had believed it her duty to subdue her
gaiety of temperament, and let nothing divert her from what are called
serious pursuits: In her limited experience she brought everything to the
judgment of her own conscience, and settled the affairs of all the world
in her own serene judgment hall.  Perhaps her mother saw this, and saw
also that there was nothing in the Friends' society to prevent her from
growing more and more opinionated.

When Ruth returned to Philadelphia, it must be confessed--though it would
not have been by her--that a medical career did seem a little less
necessary for her than formerly; and coming back in a glow of triumph, as
it were, and in the consciousness of the freedom and life in a lively
society and in new and sympathetic friendship, she anticipated pleasure
in an attempt to break up the stiffness and levelness of the society at
home, and infusing into it something of the motion and sparkle which were
so agreeable at Fallkill.  She expected visits from her new friends, she
would have company, the new books and the periodicals about which all the
world was talking, and, in short, she would have life.

For a little while she lived in this atmosphere which she had brought
with her.  Her mother was delighted with this change in her, with the
improvement in her health and the interest she exhibited in home affairs.
Her father enjoyed the society of his favorite daughter as he did few
things besides; he liked her mirthful and teasing ways, and not less a
keen battle over something she had read.  He had been a great reader all
his life, and a remarkable memory had stored his mind with encyclopaedic
information.  It was one of Ruth's delights to cram herself with some out
of the way subject and endeavor to catch her father; but she almost
always failed.  Mr. Bolton liked company, a house full of it, and the
mirth of young people, and he would have willingly entered into any
revolutionary plans Ruth might have suggested in relation to Friends'
society.

But custom and the fixed order are stronger than the most enthusiastic
and rebellious young lady, as Ruth very soon found.  In spite of all her
brave efforts, her frequent correspondence, and her determined animation,
her books and her music, she found herself settling into the clutches of
the old monotony, and as she realized the hopelessness of her endeavors,
the medical scheme took new hold of her, and seemed to her the only
method of escape.

"Mother, thee does not know how different it is in Fallkill, how much
more interesting the people are one meets, how much more life there is."

"But thee will find the world, child, pretty much all the same, when thee
knows it better.  I thought once as thee does now, and had as little
thought of being a Friend as thee has.  Perhaps when thee has seen more,
thee will better appreciate a quiet life."

"Thee married young.  I shall not marry young, and perhaps not at all,"
said Ruth, with a look of vast experience.

"Perhaps thee doesn't know thee own mind; I have known persons of thy
age who did not.  Did thee see anybody whom thee would like to live with
always in Fallkill?"

"Not always," replied Ruth with a little laugh.  "Mother, I think I
wouldn't say 'always' to any one until I have a profession and am as
independent as he is.  Then my love would be a free act, and not in any
way a necessity."

Margaret Bolton smiled at this new-fangled philosophy.  "Thee will find
that love, Ruth, is a thing thee won't reason about, when it comes, nor
make any bargains about.  Thee wrote that Philip Sterling was at
Fallkill."

"Yes, and Henry Brierly, a friend of his; a very amusing young fellow and
not so serious-minded as Philip, but a bit of a fop maybe."

"And thee preferred the fop to the serious-minded?"

"I didn't prefer anybody; but Henry Brierly was good company, which
Philip wasn't always."

"Did thee know thee father had been in correspondence with Philip?"

Ruth looked up surprised and with a plain question in her eyes.

"Oh, it's not about thee."

"What then?" and if there was any shade of disappointment in her tone,
probably Ruth herself did not know it.

"It's about some land up in the country.  That man Bigler has got father
into another speculation."

"That odious man!  Why will father have anything to do with him?  Is it
that railroad?"

"Yes.  Father advanced money and took land as security, and whatever has
gone with the money and the bonds, he has on his hands a large tract of
wild land."

"And what has Philip to do with that?"

"It has good timber, if it could ever be got out, and father says that
there must be coal in it; it's in a coal region.  He wants Philip to
survey it, and examine it for indications of coal."

"It's another of father's fortunes, I suppose," said Ruth.  "He has put
away so many fortunes for us that I'm afraid we never shall find them."

Ruth was interested in it nevertheless, and perhaps mainly because Philip
was to be connected with the enterprise.  Mr. Bigler came to dinner with
her father next day, and talked a great deal about Mr. Bolton's
magnificent tract of land, extolled the sagacity that led him to secure
such a property, and led the talk along to another railroad which would
open a northern communication to this very land.

"Pennybacker says it's full of coal, he's no doubt of it, and a railroad
to strike the Erie would make it a fortune."

"Suppose you take the land and work the thing up, Mr. Bigler; you may
have the tract for three dollars an acre."

"You'd throw it away, then," replied Mr. Bigler, "and I'm not the man to
take advantage of a friend.  But if you'll put a mortgage on it for the
northern road, I wouldn't mind taking an interest, if Pennybacker is
willing; but Pennybacker, you know, don't go much on land, he sticks to
the legislature."  And Mr. Bigler laughed.

When Mr. Bigler had gone, Ruth asked her father about Philip's connection
with the land scheme.

"There's nothing definite," said Mr. Bolton.  "Philip is showing aptitude
for his profession.  I hear the best reports of him in New York, though
those sharpers don't 'intend to do anything but use him.  I've written
and offered him employment in surveying and examining the land.  We want
to know what it is.  And if there is anything in it that his enterprise
can dig out, he shall have an interest.  I should be glad to give the
young fellow a lift."

All his life Eli Bolton had been giving young fellows a lift, and
shouldering the loses when things turned out unfortunately.  His ledger,
take-it-altogether, would not show a balance on the right side; but
perhaps the losses on his books will turn out to be credits in a world
where accounts are kept on a different basis.  The left hand of the
ledger will appear the right, looked at from the other side.

Philip, wrote to Ruth rather a comical account of the bursting up of the
city of Napoleon and the navigation improvement scheme, of Harry's flight
and the Colonel's discomfiture.  Harry left in such a hurry that he
hadn't even time to bid Miss Laura Hawkins good-bye, but he had no doubt
that Harry would console himself with the next pretty face he saw
--a remark which was thrown in for Ruth's benefit.  Col. Sellers had in all
probability, by this time, some other equally brilliant speculation in
his brain.

As to the railroad, Philip had made up his mind that it was merely kept
on foot for speculative purposes in Wall street, and he was about to quit
it.  Would Ruth be glad to hear, he wondered, that he was coming East?
For he was coming, in spite of a letter from Harry in New York, advising
him to hold on until he had made some arrangements in regard to
contracts, he to be a little careful about Sellers, who was somewhat
visionary, Harry said.

The summer went on without much excitement for Ruth.  She kept up a
correspondence with Alice, who promised a visit in the fall, she read,
she earnestly tried to interest herself in home affairs and such people
as came to the house; but she found herself falling more and more into
reveries, and growing weary of things as they were.  She felt that
everybody might become in time like two relatives from a Shaker
establishment in Ohio, who visited the Boltons about this time, a father
and son, clad exactly alike, and alike in manners.  The son; however,
who was not of age, was more unworldly and sanctimonious than his father;
he always addressed his parent as "Brother Plum," and bore himself,
altogether in such a superior manner that Ruth longed to put bent pins in
his chair.  Both father and son wore the long, single breasted collarless
coats of their society, without buttons, before or behind, but with a row
of hooks and eyes on either side in front.  It was Ruth's suggestion that
the coats would be improved by a single hook and eye sewed on in the
small of the back where the buttons usually are.

Amusing as this Shaker caricature of the Friends was, it oppressed Ruth
beyond measure; and increased her feeling of being stifled.

It was a most unreasonable feeling.  No home could be pleasanter than
Ruth's.  The house, a little out of the city; was one of those elegant
country residences which so much charm visitors to the suburbs of
Philadelphia.  A modern dwelling and luxurious in everything that wealth
could suggest for comfort, it stood in the midst of exquisitely kept
lawns, with groups of trees, parterres of flowers massed in colors, with
greenhouse, grapery and garden; and on one side, the garden sloped away
in undulations to a shallow brook that ran over a pebbly bottom and sang
under forest trees.  The country about teas the perfection of cultivated
landscape, dotted with cottages, and stately mansions of Revolutionary
date, and sweet as an English country-side, whether seen in the soft
bloom of May or in the mellow ripeness of late October.

It needed only the peace of the mind within, to make it a paradise.
One riding by on the Old Germantown road, and seeing a young girl
swinging in the hammock on the piazza and, intent upon some volume of old
poetry or the latest novel, would no doubt have envied a life so idyllic.
He could not have imagined that the young girl was reading a volume of
reports of clinics and longing to be elsewhere.

Ruth could not have been more discontented if all the wealth about her
had been as unsubstantial as a dream.  Perhaps she so thought it.

"I feel," she once said to her father, "as if I were living in a house of
cards."

"And thee would like to turn it into a hospital?"

"No.  But tell me father," continued Ruth, not to be put off, "is thee
still going on with that Bigler and those other men who come here and
entice thee?"

Mr. Bolton smiled, as men do when they talk with women about "business"
"Such men have their uses, Ruth.  They keep the world active, and I owe a
great many of my best operations to such men.  Who knows, Ruth, but this
new land purchase, which I confess I yielded a little too much to Bigler
in, may not turn out a fortune for thee and the rest of the children?"

"Ah, father, thee sees every thing in a rose-colored light.  I do believe
thee wouldn't have so readily allowed me to begin the study of medicine,
if it hadn't had the novelty of an experiment to thee."

"And is thee satisfied with it?"

"If thee means, if I have had enough of it, no.  I just begin to see what
I can do in it, and what a noble profession it is for a woman.  Would
thee have me sit here like a bird on a bough and wait for somebody to
come and put me in a cage?"

Mr. Bolton was not sorry to divert the talk from his own affairs, and he
did not think it worth while to tell his family of a performance that
very day which was entirely characteristic of him.

Ruth might well say that she felt as if she were living in a house of
cards, although the Bolton household had no idea of the number of perils
that hovered over them, any more than thousands of families in America
have of the business risks and contingences upon which their prosperity
and luxury hang.

A sudden call upon Mr. Bolton for a large sum of money, which must be
forthcoming at once, had found him in the midst of a dozen ventures, from
no one of which a dollar could be realized.  It was in vain that he
applied to his business acquaintances and friends; it was a period of
sudden panic and no money.  "A hundred thousand!  Mr. Bolton," said
Plumly.  "Good God, if you should ask me for ten, I shouldn't know where
to get it."

And yet that day Mr. Small (Pennybacker, Bigler and Small) came to Mr.
Bolton with a piteous story of ruin in a coal operation, if he could not
raise ten thousand dollars.  Only ten, and he was sure of a fortune.
Without it he was a beggar.  Mr. Bolton had already Small's notes for a
large amount in his safe, labeled "doubtful;" he had helped him again and
again, and always with the same result.  But Mr. Small spoke with a
faltering voice of his family, his daughter in school, his wife ignorant
of his calamity, and drew such a picture of their agony, that Mr. Bolton
put by his own more pressing necessity, and devoted the day to scraping
together, here and there, ten thousand dollars for this brazen beggar,
who had never kept a promise to him nor paid a debt.

Beautiful credit!  The foundation of modern society.  Who shall say that
this is not the golden age of mutual trust, of unlimited reliance upon
human promises?  That is a peculiar condition of society which enables a
whole nation to instantly recognize point and meaning in the familiar
newspaper anecdote, which puts into the mouth of a distinguished
speculator in lands and mines this remark:--"I wasn't worth a cent two
years ago, and now I owe two millions of dollars."




CHAPTER XXVII.

It was a hard blow to poor Sellers to see the work on his darling
enterprise stop, and the noise and bustle and confusion that had been
such refreshment to his soul, sicken and die out.  It was hard to come
down to humdrum ordinary life again after being a General Superintendent
and the most conspicuous man in the community.  It was sad to see his
name disappear from the newspapers; sadder still to see it resurrected at
intervals, shorn of its aforetime gaudy gear of compliments and clothed
on with rhetorical tar and feathers.

But his friends suffered more on his account than he did.  He was a cork
that could not be kept under the water many moments at a time.

He had to bolster up his wife's spirits every now and then.  On one of
these occasions he said:

"It's all right, my dear, all right; it will all come right in a little
while.  There's $200,000 coming, and that will set things booming again:
Harry seems to be having some difficulty, but that's to be expected--you
can't move these big operations to the tune of Fisher's Hornpipe, you
know.  But Harry will get it started along presently, and then you'll
see!  I expect the news every day now."

"But Beriah, you've been expecting it every day, all along, haven't you?"

"Well, yes; yes--I don't know but I have.  But anyway, the longer it's
delayed, the nearer it grows to the time when it will start--same as
every day you live brings you nearer to--nearer--"

"The grave?"

"Well, no--not that exactly; but you can't understand these things, Polly
dear--women haven't much head for business, you know.  You make yourself
perfectly comfortable, old lady, and you'll see how we'll trot this right
along.  Why bless you, let the appropriation lag, if it wants to--that's
no great matter--there's a bigger thing than that."

"Bigger than $200,000, Beriah?"

"Bigger, child?--why, what's $200,000?  Pocket money!  Mere pocket money!
Look at the railroad!  Did you forget the railroad?  It ain't many months
till spring; it will be coming right along, and the railroad swimming
right along behind it.  Where'll it be by the middle of summer?  Just
stop and fancy a moment--just think a little--don't anything suggest
itself?  Bless your heart, you dear women live right in the present all
the time--but a man, why a man lives----

"In the future, Beriah?  But don't we live in the future most too much,
Beriah?  We do somehow seem to manage to live on next year's crop of corn
and potatoes as a general thing while this year is still dragging along,
but sometimes it's not a robust diet,--Beriah.  But don't look that way,
dear--don't mind what I say.  I don't mean to fret, I don't mean to
worry; and I don't, once a month, do I, dear?  But when I get a little
low and feel bad, I get a bit troubled and worrisome, but it don't mean
anything in the world.  It passes right away.  I know you're doing all
you can, and I don't want to seem repining and ungrateful--for I'm not,
Beriah--you know I'm not, don't you?"

"Lord bless you, child, I know you are the very best little woman that
ever lived--that ever lived on the whole face of the Earth!  And I know
that I would be a dog not to work for you and think for you and scheme
for you with all my might.  And I'll bring things all right yet, honey
--cheer up and don't you fear.  The railroad----"

"Oh, I had forgotten the railroad, dear, but when a body gets blue, a
body forgets everything.  Yes, the railroad--tell me about the railroad."

"Aha, my girl, don't you see?  Things ain't so dark, are they?  Now I
didn't forget the railroad.  Now just think for a moment--just figure up
a little on the future dead moral certainties.  For instance, call this
waiter St. Louis.

"And we'll lay this fork (representing the railroad) from St. Louis to
this potato, which is Slouchburg:

"Then with this carving knife we'll continue the railroad from Slouchburg
to Doodleville, shown by the black pepper:

"Then we run along the--yes--the comb--to the tumbler that's Brimstone:

"Thence by the pipe to Belshazzar, which is the salt-cellar:

"Thence to, to--that quill--Catfish--hand me the pincushion, Marie
Antoinette:

"Thence right along these shears to this horse, Babylon:

"Then by the spoon to Bloody Run--thank you, the ink:

"Thence to Hail Columbia--snuffers, Polly, please move that cup and
saucer close up, that's Hail Columbia:

"Then--let me open my knife--to Hark-from-the-Tomb, where we'll put
the candle-stick--only a little distance from Hail Columbia to
Hark-from-the-Tomb--down-grade all the way.

"And there we strike Columbus River--pass me two or throe skeins of
thread to stand for the river; the sugar bowl will do for Hawkeye, and
the rat trap for Stone's Landing-Napoleon, I mean--and you can see how
much better Napoleon is located than Hawkeye.  Now here you are with your
railroad complete, and showing its continuation to Hallelujah and thence
to Corruptionville.

"Now then-them you are!  It's a beautiful road, beautiful.  Jeff Thompson
can out-engineer any civil engineer that ever sighted through an aneroid,
or a theodolite, or whatever they call it--he calls it sometimes one and
sometimes the other just whichever levels off his sentence neatest, I
reckon.  But ain't it a ripping toad, though?  I tell you, it'll make a
stir when it gets along.  Just see what a country it goes through.
There's your onions at Slouchburg--noblest onion country that graces
God's footstool; and there's your turnip country all around Doodleville
--bless my life, what fortunes are going to be made there when they get
that contrivance perfected for extracting olive oil out of turnips--if
there's any in them; and I reckon there is, because Congress has made an
appropriation of money to test the thing, and they wouldn't have done
that just on conjecture, of course.  And now we come to the Brimstone
region--cattle raised there till you can't rest--and corn, and all that
sort of thing.  Then you've got a little stretch along through Belshazzar
that don't produce anything now--at least nothing but rocks--but
irrigation will fetch it.  Then from Catfish to Babylon it's a little
swampy, but there's dead loads of peat down under there somewhere.  Next
is the Bloody Run and Hail Columbia country--tobacco enough can be raised
there to support two such railroads.  Next is the sassparilla region.
I reckon there's enough of that truck along in there on the line of the
pocket-knife, from Hail Columbia to Hark-from-the Tomb to fat up all the
consumptives in all the hospitals from Halifax to the Holy Land.  It just
grows like weeds!  I've got a little belt of sassparilla land in there
just tucked away unobstrusively waiting for my little Universal
Expectorant to get into shape in my head.  And I'll fix that, you know.
One of these days I'll have all the nations of the earth expecto--"

"But Beriah, dear--"

"Don't interrupt me; Polly--I don't want you to lose the run of the map
--well, take your toy-horse, James Fitz-James, if you must have it--and run
along with you.  Here, now--the soap will do for Babylon.  Let me see
--where was I?  Oh yes--now we run down to Stone's Lan--Napoleon--now we
run down to Napoleon.  Beautiful road.  Look at that, now.  Perfectly
straight line-straight as the way to the grave.  And see where it leaves
Hawkeye-clear out in the cold, my dear, clear out in the cold.  That
town's as bound to die as--well if I owned it I'd get its obituary ready,
now, and notify the mourners.  Polly, mark my words--in three years from
this, Hawkeye'll be a howling wilderness.  You'll see.  And just look at
that river--noblest stream that meanders over the thirsty earth!
--calmest, gentlest artery that refreshes her weary bosom!  Railroad
goes all over it and all through it--wades right along on stilts.
Seventeen bridges in three miles and a half--forty-nine bridges from
Hark-from-the-Tomb to Stone's Landing altogether--forty nine bridges, and
culverts enough to culvert creation itself!  Hadn't skeins of thread
enough to represent them all--but you get an idea--perfect trestle-work
of bridges for seventy two miles: Jeff Thompson and I fixed all that, you
know; he's to get the contracts and I'm to put them through on the
divide.  Just oceans of money in those bridges.  It's the only part of
the railroad I'm interested in,--down along the line--and it's all I
want, too.  It's enough, I should judge. Now here we are at Napoleon.
Good enough country plenty good enough--all it wants is population.
That's all right--that will come.  And it's no bad country now for
calmness and solitude, I can tell you--though there's no money in that,
of course.  No money, but a man wants rest, a man wants peace--a man
don't want to rip and tear around all the time.  And here we go, now,
just as straight as a string for Hallelujah--it's a beautiful angle
--handsome up grade all the way --and then away you go to Corruptionville,
the gaudiest country for early carrots and cauliflowers that ever--good
missionary field, too.  There ain't such another missionary field outside
the jungles of Central Africa.  And patriotic?--why they named it after
Congress itself.  Oh, I warn you, my dear, there's a good time coming,
and it'll be right along before you know what you're about, too.  That
railroad's fetching it. You see what it is as far as I've got, and if I
had enough bottles and soap and boot-jacks and such things to carry it
along to where it joins onto the Union Pacific, fourteen hundred miles
from here, I should exhibit to you in that little internal improvement a
spectacle of inconceivable sublimity.  So, don't you see?  We've got the
rail road to fall back on; and in the meantime, what are we worrying
about that $200,000 appropriation for?  That's all right.  I'd be willing
to bet anything that the very next letter that comes from Harry will--"

The eldest boy entered just in the nick of time and brought a letter,
warm from the post-office.

"Things do look bright, after all, Beriah.  I'm sorry I was blue, but it
did seem as if everything had been going against us for whole ages.  Open
the letter--open it quick, and let's know all about it before we stir out
of our places.  I am all in a fidget to know what it says."

The letter was opened, without any unnecessary delay.

FENIMORE COOPER'S LITERARY OFFENCES

by Mark Twain



          The Pathfinder and The Deerslayer stand at the head of Cooper's
          novels as artistic creations.  There are others of his works
          which contain parts as perfect as are to be found in these, and
          scenes even more thrilling.  Not one can be compared with
          either of them as a finished whole.

          The defects in both of these tales are comparatively slight.
          They were pure works of art.--Prof. Lounsbury.


          The five tales reveal an extraordinary fulness of invention.
          ...  One of the very greatest characters in fiction, Natty
          Bumppo....

          The craft of the woodsman, the tricks of the trapper, all the
          delicate art of the forest, were familiar to Cooper from his
          youth up.--Prof. Brander Matthews.

          Cooper is the greatest artist in the domain of romantic fiction
          yet produced by America.--Wilkie Collins.


It seems to me that it was far from right for the Professor of English
Literature in Yale, the Professor of English Literature in Columbia, and
Wilkie Collins to deliver opinions on Cooper's literature without having
read some of it. It would have been much more decorous to keep silent
and let persons talk who have read Cooper.

Cooper's art has some defects. In one place in 'Deerslayer,' and in the
restricted space of two-thirds of a page, Cooper has scored 114 offences
against literary art out of a possible 115. It breaks the record.

There are nineteen rules governing literary art in the domain of
romantic fiction--some say twenty-two. In Deerslayer Cooper violated
eighteen of them. These eighteen require:

1. That a tale shall accomplish something and arrive somewhere. But the
Deerslayer tale accomplishes nothing and arrives in the air.

2. They require that the episodes of a tale shall be necessary parts of
the tale, and shall help to develop it. But as the Deerslayer tale is
not a tale, and accomplishes nothing and arrives nowhere, the episodes
have no rightful place in the work, since there was nothing for them to
develop.

3. They require that the personages in a tale shall be alive, except in
the case of corpses, and that always the reader shall be able to tell
the corpses from the others. But this detail has often been overlooked
in the Deerslayer tale.

4. They require that the personages in a tale, both dead and alive,
shall exhibit a sufficient excuse for being there. But this detail also
has been overlooked in the Deerslayer tale.

5. They require that when the personages of a tale deal in conversation,
the talk shall sound like human talk, and be talk such as human
beings would be likely to talk in the given circumstances, and have
a discoverable meaning, also a discoverable purpose, and a show of
relevancy, and remain in the neighborhood of the subject in hand, and
be interesting to the reader, and help out the tale, and stop when the
people cannot think of anything more to say. But this requirement has
been ignored from the beginning of the Deerslayer tale to the end of it.

6. They require that when the author describes the character of a
personage in his tale, the conduct and conversation of that personage
shall justify said description. But this law gets little or no attention
in the Deerslayer tale, as Natty Bumppo's case will amply prove.

7. They require that when a personage talks like an illustrated,
gilt-edged, tree-calf, hand-tooled, seven-dollar Friendship's Offering
in the beginning of a paragraph, he shall not talk like a negro minstrel
in the end of it. But this rule is flung down and danced upon in the
Deerslayer tale.

8. They require that crass stupidities shall not be played upon the
reader as “the craft of the woodsman, the delicate art of the forest,”
 by either the author or the people in the tale. But this rule is
persistently violated in the Deerslayer tale.

9. They require that the personages of a tale shall confine themselves
to possibilities and let miracles alone; or, if they venture a miracle,
the author must so plausibly set it forth as to make it look possible
and reasonable. But these rules are not respected in the Deerslayer
tale.

10. They require that the author shall make the reader feel a deep
interest in the personages of his tale and in their fate; and that he
shall make the reader love the good people in the tale and hate the bad
ones. But the reader of the Deerslayer tale dislikes the good people in
it, is indifferent to the others, and wishes they would all get drowned
together.

11. They require that the characters in a tale shall be so clearly
defined that the reader can tell beforehand what each will do in a given
emergency. But in the Deerslayer tale this rule is vacated.

In addition to these large rules there are some little ones. These
require that the author shall:

12. Say what he is proposing to say, not merely come near it.

13. Use the right word, not its second cousin.

14. Eschew surplusage.

15. Not omit necessary details.

16. Avoid slovenliness of form.

17. Use good grammar.

18. Employ a simple and straightforward style.

Even these seven are coldly and persistently violated in the Deerslayer
tale.

Cooper's gift in the way of invention was not a rich endowment; but
such as it was he liked to work it, he was pleased with the effects,
and indeed he did some quite sweet things with it. In his little box of
stage properties he kept six or eight cunning devices, tricks, artifices
for his savages and woodsmen to deceive and circumvent each other with,
and he was never so happy as when he was working these innocent things
and seeing them go. A favorite one was to make a moccasined person tread
in the tracks of the moccasined enemy, and thus hide his own trail.
Cooper wore out barrels and barrels of moccasins in working that trick.
Another stage-property that he pulled out of his box pretty frequently
was his broken twig. He prized his broken twig above all the rest of his
effects, and worked it the hardest. It is a restful chapter in any book
of his when somebody doesn't step on a dry twig and alarm all the reds
and whites for two hundred yards around. Every time a Cooper person is
in peril, and absolute silence is worth four dollars a minute, he is
sure to step on a dry twig. There may be a hundred handier things to
step on, but that wouldn't satisfy Cooper. Cooper requires him to turn
out and find a dry twig; and if he can't do it, go and borrow one. In
fact, the Leather Stocking Series ought to have been called the Broken
Twig Series.

I am sorry there is not room to put in a few dozen instances of the
delicate art of the forest, as practised by Natty Bumppo and some of the
other Cooperian experts. Perhaps we may venture two or three samples.
Cooper was a sailor--a naval officer; yet he gravely tells us how
a vessel, driving towards a lee shore in a gale, is steered for a
particular spot by her skipper because he knows of an undertow there
which will hold her back against the gale and save her. For just pure
woodcraft, or sailorcraft, or whatever it is, isn't that neat? For
several years Cooper was daily in the society of artillery, and he ought
to have noticed that when a cannon-ball strikes the ground it either
buries itself or skips a hundred feet or so; skips again a hundred feet
or so--and so on, till finally it gets tired and rolls. Now in one place
he loses some “females”--as he always calls women--in the edge of a wood
near a plain at night in a fog, on purpose to give Bumppo a chance to
show off the delicate art of the forest before the reader. These
mislaid people are hunting for a fort. They hear a cannonblast, and a
cannon-ball presently comes rolling into the wood and stops at their
feet. To the females this suggests nothing. The case is very different
with the admirable Bumppo. I wish I may never know peace again if he
doesn't strike out promptly and follow the track of that cannon-ball
across the plain through the dense fog and find the fort. Isn't it
a daisy? If Cooper had any real knowledge of Nature's ways of doing
things, he had a most delicate art in concealing the fact. For instance:
one of his acute Indian experts, Chingachgook (pronounced Chicago,
I think), has lost the trail of a person he is tracking through the
forest. Apparently that trail is hopelessly lost. Neither you nor I
could ever have guessed out the way to find it. It was very different
with Chicago. Chicago was not stumped for long. He turned a running
stream out of its course, and there, in the slush in its old bed, were
that person's moccasin-tracks. The current did not wash them away, as
it would have done in all other like cases--no, even the eternal laws
of Nature have to vacate when Cooper wants to put up a delicate job of
woodcraft on the reader.

We must be a little wary when Brander Matthews tells us that Cooper's
books “reveal an extraordinary fulness of invention.” As a rule, I
am quite willing to accept Brander Matthews's literary judgments and
applaud his lucid and graceful phrasing of them; but that particular
statement needs to be taken with a few tons of salt. Bless your heart,
Cooper hadn't any more invention than a horse; and I don't mean a
high-class horse, either; I mean a clothes-horse. It would be very
difficult to find a really clever “situation” in Cooper's books, and
still more difficult to find one of any kind which he has failed to
render absurd by his handling of it. Look at the episodes of “the
caves”; and at the celebrated scuffle between Maqua and those others
on the table-land a few days later; and at Hurry Harry's queer
water-transit from the castle to the ark; and at Deerslayer's half-hour
with his first corpse; and at the quarrel between Hurry Harry and
Deerslayer later; and at--but choose for yourself; you can't go amiss.

If Cooper had been an observer his inventive faculty would have worked
better; not more interestingly, but more rationally, more plausibly.
Cooper's proudest creations in the way of “situations” suffer noticeably
from the absence of the observer's protecting gift. Cooper's eye was
splendidly inaccurate. Cooper seldom saw anything correctly. He saw
nearly all things as through a glass eye, darkly. Of course a man who
cannot see the commonest little every-day matters accurately is
working at a disadvantage when he is constructing a “situation.” In the
Deerslayer tale Cooper has a stream which is fifty feet wide where it
flows out of a lake; it presently narrows to twenty as it meanders along
for no given reason; and yet when a stream acts like that it ought to
be required to explain itself. Fourteen pages later the width of the
brook's outlet from the lake has suddenly shrunk thirty feet, and become
“the narrowest part of the stream.” This shrinkage is not accounted for.
The stream has bends in it, a sure indication that it has alluvial banks
and cuts them; yet these bends are only thirty and fifty feet long. If
Cooper had been a nice and punctilious observer he would have noticed
that the bends were oftener nine hundred feet long than short of it.

Cooper made the exit of that stream fifty feet wide, in the first place,
for no particular reason; in the second place, he narrowed it to less
than twenty to accommodate some Indians. He bends a “sapling” to the
form of an arch over this narrow passage, and conceals six Indians in
its foliage. They are “laying” for a settler's scow or ark which is
coming up the stream on its way to the lake; it is being hauled against
the stiff current by a rope whose stationary end is anchored in the
lake; its rate of progress cannot be more than a mile an hour. Cooper
describes the ark, but pretty obscurely. In the matter of dimensions “it
was little more than a modern canal-boat.” Let us guess, then, that it
was about one hundred and forty feet long. It was of “greater breadth
than common.” Let us guess, then, that it was about sixteen feet wide.
This leviathan had been prowling down bends which were but a third as
long as itself, and scraping between banks where it had only two feet of
space to spare on each side. We cannot too much admire this miracle.
A low-roofed log dwelling occupies “two-thirds of the ark's length”--a
dwelling ninety feet long and sixteen feet wide, let us say a kind of
vestibule train. The dwelling has two rooms--each forty-five feet long
and sixteen feet wide, let us guess. One of them is the bedroom of the
Hutter girls, Judith and Hetty; the other is the parlor in the daytime,
at night it is papa's bedchamber. The ark is arriving at the stream's
exit now, whose width has been reduced to less than twenty feet to
accommodate the Indians--say to eighteen. There is a foot to spare on
each side of the boat. Did the Indians notice that there was going to
be a tight squeeze there? Did they notice that they could make money by
climbing down out of that arched sapling and just stepping aboard when
the ark scraped by? No, other Indians would have noticed these things,
but Cooper's Indians never notice anything. Cooper thinks they are
marvelous creatures for noticing, but he was almost always in error
about his Indians. There was seldom a sane one among them.

The ark is one hundred and forty feet long; the dwelling is ninety feet
long. The idea of the Indians is to drop softly and secretly from the
arched sapling to the dwelling as the ark creeps along under it at the
rate of a mile an hour, and butcher the family. It will take the ark a
minute and a half to pass under. It will take the ninety foot dwelling
a minute to pass under. Now, then, what did the six Indians do? It would
take you thirty years to guess, and even then you would have to give it
up, I believe. Therefore, I will tell you what the Indians did. Their
chief, a person of quite extraordinary intellect for a Cooper Indian,
warily watched the canal-boat as it squeezed along under him, and when
he had got his calculations fined down to exactly the right shade, as
he judged, he let go and dropped. And missed the house! That is actually
what he did. He missed the house, and landed in the stern of the scow.
It was not much of a fall, yet it knocked him silly. He lay there
unconscious. If the house had been ninety-seven feet long he would have
made the trip. The fault was Cooper's, not his. The error lay in the
construction of the house. Cooper was no architect.

There still remained in the roost five Indians.

The boat has passed under and is now out of their reach. Let me explain
what the five did--you would not be able to reason it out for yourself.
No. 1 jumped for the boat, but fell in the water astern of it. Then No.
2 jumped for the boat, but fell in the water still farther astern of it.
Then No. 3 jumped for the boat, and fell a good way astern of it. Then
No. 4 jumped for the boat, and fell in the water away astern. Then
even No. 5 made a jump for the boat--for he was a Cooper Indian. In
the matter of intellect, the difference between a Cooper Indian and the
Indian that stands in front of the cigarshop is not spacious. The scow
episode is really a sublime burst of invention; but it does not
thrill, because the inaccuracy of the details throws a sort of air of
fictitiousness and general improbability over it. This comes of Cooper's
inadequacy as an observer.

The reader will find some examples of Cooper's high talent for
inaccurate observation in the account of the shooting-match in The
Pathfinder.

          “A common wrought nail was driven lightly into the target, its
          head having been first touched with paint.”

The color of the paint is not stated--an important omission, but Cooper
deals freely in important omissions. No, after all, it was not an
important omission; for this nail-head is a hundred yards from the
marksmen, and could not be seen by them at that distance, no matter what
its color might be.

How far can the best eyes see a common house-fly? A hundred yards? It is
quite impossible. Very well; eyes that cannot see a house-fly that is a
hundred yards away cannot see an ordinary nailhead at that distance, for
the size of the two objects is the same. It takes a keen eye to see a
fly or a nailhead at fifty yards--one hundred and fifty feet. Can the
reader do it?

The nail was lightly driven, its head painted, and game called. Then the
Cooper miracles began. The bullet of the first marksman chipped an edge
off the nail-head; the next man's bullet drove the nail a little way
into the target--and removed all the paint. Haven't the miracles
gone far enough now? Not to suit Cooper; for the purpose of
this whole scheme is to show off his prodigy, Deerslayer--
Hawkeye--Long-Rifle--Leather-Stocking--Pathfinder--Bumppo before
the ladies.

          “'Be all ready to clench it, boys!' cried out Pathfinder,
          stepping into his friend's tracks the instant they were vacant.
          'Never mind a new nail; I can see that, though the paint is
          gone, and what I can see I can hit at a hundred yards, though
          it were only a mosquito's eye.  Be ready to clench!'

“The rifle cracked, the bullet sped its way, and the head of the nail
was buried in the wood, covered by the piece of flattened lead.”

There, you see, is a man who could hunt flies with a rifle, and command
a ducal salary in a Wild West show to-day if we had him back with us.

The recorded feat is certainly surprising just as it stands; but it
is not surprising enough for Cooper. Cooper adds a touch. He has made
Pathfinder do this miracle with another man's rifle; and not only that,
but Pathfinder did not have even the advantage of loading it himself.
He had everything against him, and yet he made that impossible shot; and
not only made it, but did it with absolute confidence, saying, “Be ready
to clench.” Now a person like that would have undertaken that same feat
with a brickbat, and with Cooper to help he would have achieved it, too.

Pathfinder showed off handsomely that day before the ladies. His
very first feat was a thing which no Wild West show can touch. He was
standing with the group of marksmen, observing--a hundred yards from the
target, mind; one Jasper raised his rifle and drove the centre of the
bull's-eye. Then the Quartermaster fired. The target exhibited no result
this time. There was a laugh. “It's a dead miss,” said Major Lundie.
Pathfinder waited an impressive moment or two; then said, in that calm,
indifferent, know-it-all way of his, “No, Major, he has covered Jasper's
bullet, as will be seen if any one will take the trouble to examine the
target.”

Wasn't it remarkable! How could he see that little pellet fly through
the air and enter that distant bullet-hole? Yet that is what he did; for
nothing is impossible to a Cooper person. Did any of those people
have any deep-seated doubts about this thing? No; for that would imply
sanity, and these were all Cooper people.

          “The respect for Pathfinder's skill and for his 'quickness and
          accuracy of sight'” (the italics [' '] are mine) “was so
          profound and general, that the instant he made this declaration
          the spectators began to distrust their own opinions, and a
          dozen rushed to the target in order to ascertain the fact.
          There, sure enough, it was found that the Quartermaster's
          bullet had gone through the hole made by Jasper's, and that,
          too, so accurately as to require a minute examination to be
          certain of the circumstance, which, however, was soon clearly
          established by discovering one bullet over the other in the
          stump against which the target was placed.”

They made a “minute” examination; but never mind, how could they know
that there were two bullets in that hole without digging the latest one
out? for neither probe nor eyesight could prove the presence of any
more than one bullet. Did they dig? No; as we shall see. It is the
Pathfinder's turn now; he steps out before the ladies, takes aim, and
fires.

But, alas! here is a disappointment; an incredible, an unimaginable
disappointment--for the target's aspect is unchanged; there is nothing
there but that same old bullet-hole!

          “'If one dared to hint at such a thing,' cried Major Duncan, 'I
          should say that the Pathfinder has also missed the target!'”

As nobody had missed it yet, the “also” was not necessary; but never
mind about that, for the Pathfinder is going to speak.

          “'No, no, Major,' said he, confidently, 'that would be a risky
          declaration.  I didn't load the piece, and can't say what was
          in it; but if it was lead, you will find the bullet driving
          down those of the Quartermaster and Jasper, else is not my name
          Pathfinder.'

          “A shout from the target announced the truth of this
          assertion.”

Is the miracle sufficient as it stands? Not for Cooper. The Pathfinder
speaks again, as he “now slowly advances towards the stage occupied by
the females”:

          “'That's not all, boys, that's not all; if you find the target
          touched at all, I'll own to a miss.  The Quartermaster cut the
          wood, but you'll find no wood cut by that last messenger.”

The miracle is at last complete. He knew--doubtless saw--at the distance
of a hundred yards--that his bullet had passed into the hole without
fraying the edges. There were now three bullets in that one hole--three
bullets embedded processionally in the body of the stump back of the
target. Everybody knew this--somehow or other--and yet nobody had dug
any of them out to make sure. Cooper is not a close observer, but he is
interesting. He is certainly always that, no matter what happens. And he
is more interesting when he is not noticing what he is about than when
he is. This is a considerable merit.

The conversations in the Cooper books have a curious sound in our modern
ears. To believe that such talk really ever came out of people's mouths
would be to believe that there was a time when time was of no value to
a person who thought he had something to say; when it was the custom
to spread a two-minute remark out to ten; when a man's mouth was a
rolling-mill, and busied itself all day long in turning four-foot pigs
of thought into thirty-foot bars of conversational railroad iron by
attenuation; when subjects were seldom faithfully stuck to, but the talk
wandered all around and arrived nowhere; when conversations consisted
mainly of irrelevancies, with here and there a relevancy, a relevancy
with an embarrassed look, as not being able to explain how it got there.

Cooper was certainly not a master in the construction of dialogue.
Inaccurate observation defeated him here as it defeated him in so many
other enterprises of his. He even failed to notice that the man who
talks corrupt English six days in the week must and will talk it on
the seventh, and can't help himself. In the Deerslayer story he lets
Deerslayer talk the showiest kind of book-talk sometimes, and at other
times the basest of base dialects. For instance, when some one asks
him if he has a sweetheart, and if so, where she abides, this is his
majestic answer:

          “'She's in the forest-hanging from the boughs of the trees, in
          a soft rain--in the dew on the open grass--the clouds that
          float about in the blue heavens--the birds that sing in the
          woods--the sweet springs where I slake my thirst--and in all
          the other glorious gifts that come from God's Providence!'”

And he preceded that, a little before, with this:

          “'It consarns me as all things that touches a fri'nd consarns a
          fri'nd.'”

And this is another of his remarks:

          “'If I was Injin born, now, I might tell of this, or carry in
          the scalp and boast of the expl'ite afore the whole tribe; or
          if my inimy had only been a bear'”--and so on.

We cannot imagine such a thing as a veteran Scotch Commander-in-Chief
comporting himself in the field like a windy melodramatic actor, but
Cooper could. On one occasion Alice and Cora were being chased by the
French through a fog in the neighborhood of their father's fort:

          “'Point de quartier aux coquins!' cried an eager pursuer, who
          seemed to direct the operations of the enemy.

          “'Stand firm and be ready, my gallant 60ths!' suddenly
          exclaimed a voice above them; wait to see the enemy; fire low,
          and sweep the glacis.'

          “'Father? father!' exclaimed a piercing cry from out the mist;
          'it is I!  Alice! thy own Elsie! spare, O! save your daughters!'

          “'Hold!' shouted the former speaker, in the awful tones of
          parental agony, the sound reaching even to the woods, and
          rolling back in solemn echo.  ''Tis she! God has restored me my
          children! Throw open the sally-port; to the field, 60ths, to
          the field! pull not a trigger, lest ye kill my lambs!  Drive
          off these dogs of France with your steel!'”

Cooper's word-sense was singularly dull. When a person has a poor ear
for music he will flat and sharp right along without knowing it. He
keeps near the tune, but it is not the tune. When a person has a poor
ear for words, the result is a literary flatting and sharping; you
perceive what he is intending to say, but you also perceive that he
doesn't say it. This is Cooper. He was not a word-musician. His ear was
satisfied with the approximate word. I will furnish some circumstantial
evidence in support of this charge. My instances are gathered from
half a dozen pages of the tale called Deerslayer. He uses “verbal,”
 for “oral”; “precision,” for “facility”; “phenomena,” for “marvels”;
“necessary,” for “predetermined”; “unsophisticated,” for “primitive”;
“preparation,” for “expectancy”; “rebuked,” for “subdued”; “dependent
on,” for “resulting from”; “fact,” for “condition”; “fact,” for
“conjecture”; “precaution,” for “caution”; “explain,” for “determine”;
“mortified,” for “disappointed”; “meretricious,” for “factitious”;
“materially,” for “considerably”; “decreasing,” for “deepening”;
“increasing,” for “disappearing”; “embedded,” for “enclosed”;
“treacherous;” for “hostile”; “stood,” for “stooped”; “softened,” for
“replaced”; “rejoined,” for “remarked”; “situation,” for “condition”;
“different,” for “differing”; “insensible,” for “unsentient”; “brevity,”
 for “celerity”; “distrusted,” for “suspicious”; “mental imbecility,”
 for “imbecility”; “eyes,” for “sight”; “counteracting,” for “opposing”;
“funeral obsequies,” for “obsequies.”

There have been daring people in the world who claimed that Cooper could
write English, but they are all dead now--all dead but Lounsbury. I
don't remember that Lounsbury makes the claim in so many words, still he
makes it, for he says that Deerslayer is a “pure work of art.” Pure, in
that connection, means faultless--faultless in all details--and language
is a detail. If Mr. Lounsbury had only compared Cooper's English with
the English which he writes himself--but it is plain that he didn't;
and so it is likely that he imagines until this day that Cooper's is as
clean and compact as his own. Now I feel sure, deep down in my heart,
that Cooper wrote about the poorest English that exists in our language,
and that the English of Deerslayer is the very worst that even Cooper
ever wrote.

I may be mistaken, but it does seem to me that Deerslayer is not a work
of art in any sense; it does seem to me that it is destitute of every
detail that goes to the making of a work of art; in truth, it seems to
me that Deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens.

A work of art? It has no invention; it has no order, system, sequence,
or result; it has no lifelikeness, no thrill, no stir, no seeming of
reality; its characters are confusedly drawn, and by their acts and
words they prove that they are not the sort of people the author
claims that they are; its humor is pathetic; its pathos is funny;
its conversations are--oh! indescribable; its love-scenes odious; its
English a crime against the language.

Counting these out, what is left is Art. I think we must all admit that.

PREFACE

I have scattered through this volume a mass of matter which has never
been in print before (such as "Learned Fables for Good Old Boys and
Girls," the "Jumping Frog restored to the English tongue after martyrdom
in the French," the "Membranous Croup" sketch, and many others which I
need not specify): not doing this in order to make an advertisement of
it, but because these things seemed instructive.

MY WATCH--[Written about 1870.]

AN INSTRUCTIVE LITTLE TALE

My beautiful new watch had run eighteen months without losing or gaining,
and without breaking any part of its machinery or stopping.  I had come
to believe it infallible in its judgments about the time of day, and to
consider its constitution and its anatomy imperishable.  But at last, one
night, I let it run down.  I grieved about it as if it were a recognized
messenger and forerunner of calamity.  But by and by I cheered up, set
the watch by guess, and commanded my bodings and superstitions to depart.
Next day I stepped into the chief jeweler's to set it by the exact time,
and the head of the establishment took it out of my hand and proceeded to
set it for me.  Then he said, "She is four minutes slow-regulator wants
pushing up."  I tried to stop him--tried to make him understand that the
watch kept perfect time.  But no; all this human cabbage could see was
that the watch was four minutes slow, and the regulator must be pushed up
a little; and so, while I danced around him in anguish, and implored him
to let the watch alone, he calmly and cruelly did the shameful deed.  My
watch began to gain.  It gained faster and faster day by day.  Within the
week it sickened to a raging fever, and its pulse went up to a hundred
and fifty in the shade.  At the end of two months it had left all the
timepieces of the town far in the rear, and was a fraction over thirteen
days ahead of the almanac.  It was away into November enjoying the snow,
while the October leaves were still turning.  It hurried up house rent,
bills payable, and such things, in such a ruinous way that I could not
abide it.  I took it to the watchmaker to be regulated.  He asked me if I
had ever had it repaired.  I said no, it had never needed any repairing.
He looked a look of vicious happiness and eagerly pried the watch open,
and then put a small dice-box into his eye and peered into its machinery.
He said it wanted cleaning and oiling, besides regulating--come in a
week.  After being cleaned and oiled, and regulated, my watch slowed down
to that degree that it ticked like a tolling bell.  I began to be left by
trains, I failed all appointments, I got to missing my dinner; my watch
strung out three days' grace to four and let me go to protest;
I gradually drifted back into yesterday, then day before, then into last
week, and by and by the comprehension came upon me that all solitary and
alone I was lingering along in week before last, and the world was out of
sight.  I seemed to detect in myself a sort of sneaking fellow-feeling
for the mummy in the museum, and a desire to swap news with him.  I went
to a watchmaker again.  He took the watch all to pieces while I waited,
and then said the barrel was "swelled."  He said he could reduce it in
three days.  After this the watch averaged well, but nothing more.  For
half a day it would go like the very mischief, and keep up such a barking
and wheezing and whooping and sneezing and snorting, that I could not
hear myself think for the disturbance; and as long as it held out there
was not a watch in the land that stood any chance against it.  But the
rest of the day it would keep on slowing down and fooling along until all
the clocks it had left behind caught up again.  So at last, at the end of
twenty-four hours, it would trot up to the judges' stand all right and
just in time.  It would show a fair and square average, and no man could
say it had done more or less than its duty.  But a correct average is
only a mild virtue in a watch, and I took this instrument to another
watchmaker.  He said the king-bolt was broken.  I said I was glad it was
nothing more serious.  To tell the plain truth, I had no idea what the
king-bolt was, but I did not choose to appear ignorant to a stranger.
He repaired the king-bolt, but what the watch gained in one way it lost
in another.  It would run awhile and then stop awhile, and then run
awhile again, and so on, using its own discretion about the intervals.
And every time it went off it kicked back like a musket.  I padded my
breast for a few days, but finally took the watch to another watchmaker.
He picked it all to pieces, and turned the ruin over and over under his
glass; and then he said there appeared to be something the matter with
the hair-trigger.  He fixed it, and gave it a fresh start.  It did well
now, except that always at ten minutes to ten the hands would shut
together like a pair of scissors, and from that time forth they would
travel together.  The oldest man in the world could not make head or tail
of the time of day by such a watch, and so I went again to have the thing
repaired.  This person said that the crystal had got bent, and that the
mainspring was not straight.  He also remarked that part of the works
needed half-soling.  He made these things all right, and then my
timepiece performed unexceptionably, save that now and then, after
working along quietly for nearly eight hours, everything inside would let
go all of a sudden and begin to buzz like a bee, and the hands would
straightway begin to spin round and round so fast that their
individuality was lost completely, and they simply seemed a delicate
spider's web over the face of the watch.  She would reel off the next
twenty-four hours in six or seven minutes, and then stop with a bang.
I went with a heavy heart to one more watchmaker, and looked on while he
took her to pieces.  Then I prepared to cross-question him rigidly, for
this thing was getting serious.  The watch had cost two hundred dollars
originally, and I seemed to have paid out two or three thousand for
repairs.  While I waited and looked on I presently recognized in this
watchmaker an old acquaintance--a steamboat engineer of other days, and
not a good engineer, either.  He examined all the parts carefully, just
as the other watchmakers had done, and then delivered his verdict with
the same confidence of manner.

He said:

"She makes too much steam-you want to hang the monkey-wrench on the
safety-valve!"

I brained him on the spot, and had him buried at my own expense.

My uncle William (now deceased, alas!) used to say that a good horse was,
a good horse until it had run away once, and that a good watch was a good
watch until the repairers got a chance at it.  And he used to wonder what
became of all the unsuccessful tinkers, and gunsmiths, and shoemakers,
and engineers, and blacksmiths; but nobody could ever tell him.






POLITICAL ECONOMY

     Political Economy is the basis of all good government.  The wisest
     men of all ages have brought to bear upon this subject the--

[Here I was interrupted and informed that a stranger wished to see me
down at the door.  I went and confronted him, and asked to know his
business, struggling all the time to keep a tight rein on my seething
political-economy ideas, and not let them break away from me or get
tangled in their harness.  And privately I wished the stranger was in the
bottom of the canal with a cargo of wheat on top of him.  I was all in a
fever, but he was cool.  He said he was sorry to disturb me, but as he
was passing he noticed that I needed some lightning-rods.  I said, "Yes,
yes--go on--what about it?"  He said there was nothing about it, in
particular--nothing except that he would like to put them up for me.
I am new to housekeeping; have been used to hotels and boarding-houses
all my life.  Like anybody else of similar experience, I try to appear
(to strangers) to be an old housekeeper; consequently I said in an
offhand way that I had been intending for some time to have six or eight
lightning-rods put up, but--The stranger started, and looked inquiringly
at me, but I was serene.  I thought that if I chanced to make any
mistakes, he would not catch me by my countenance.  He said he would
rather have my custom than any man's in town.  I said, "All right," and
started off to wrestle with my great subject again, when he called me
back and said it would be necessary to know exactly how many "points" I
wanted put up, what parts of the house I wanted them on, and what quality
of rod I preferred.  It was close quarters for a man not used to the
exigencies of housekeeping; but I went through creditably, and he
probably never suspected that I was a novice.  I told him to put up eight
"points," and put them all on the roof, and use the best quality of rod.
He said he could furnish the "plain" article at 20 cents a foot;
"coppered," 25 cents; "zinc-plated spiral-twist," at 30 cents, that would
stop a streak of lightning any time, no matter where it was bound, and
"render its errand harmless and its further progress apocryphal."  I said
apocryphal was no slouch of a word, emanating from the source it did,
but, philology aside, I liked the spiral-twist and would take that brand.
Then he said he could make two hundred and fifty feet answer; but to do
it right, and make the best job in town of it, and attract the admiration
of the just and the unjust alike, and compel all parties to say they
never saw a more symmetrical and hypothetical display of lightning-rods
since they were born, he supposed he really couldn't get along without
four hundred, though he was not vindictive, and trusted he was willing to
try.  I said, go ahead and use four hundred, and make any kind of a job
he pleased out of it, but let me get back to my work.  So I got rid of
him at last; and now, after half an hour spent in getting my train of
political-economy thoughts coupled together again, I am ready to go on
once more.]

     richest treasures of their genius, their experience of life, and
     their learning.  The great lights of commercial jurisprudence,
     international confraternity, and biological deviation, of all ages,
     all civilizations, and all nationalities, from Zoroaster down to
     Horace Greeley, have--

[Here I was interrupted again, and required to go down and confer further
with that lightning-rod man.  I hurried off, boiling and surging with
prodigious thoughts wombed in words of such majesty that each one of them
was in itself a straggling procession of syllables that might be fifteen
minutes passing a given point, and once more I confronted him--he so calm
and sweet, I so hot and frenzied.  He was standing in the contemplative
attitude of the Colossus of Rhodes, with one foot on my infant tuberose,
and the other among my pansies, his hands on his hips, his hat-brim
tilted forward, one eye shut and the other gazing critically and
admiringly in the direction of my principal chimney.  He said now there
was a state of things to make a man glad to be alive; and added, "I leave
it to you if you ever saw anything more deliriously picturesque than
eight lightning-rods on one chimney?"  I said I had no present
recollection of anything that transcended it.  He said that in his
opinion nothing on earth but Niagara Falls was superior to it in the way
of natural scenery.  All that was needed now, he verily believed, to make
my house a perfect balm to the eye, was to kind of touch up the other
chimneys a little, and thus "add to the generous 'coup d'oeil' a soothing
uniformity of achievement which would allay the excitement naturally
consequent upon the 'coup d'etat.'"  I asked him if he learned to talk
out of a book, and if I could borrow it anywhere?  He smiled pleasantly,
and said that his manner of speaking was not taught in books, and that
nothing but familiarity with lightning could enable a man to handle his
conversational style with impunity.  He then figured up an estimate, and
said that about eight more rods scattered about my roof would about fix
me right, and he guessed five hundred feet of stuff would do it; and
added that the first eight had got a little the start of him, so to
speak, and used up a mere trifle of material more than he had calculated
on--a hundred feet or along there.  I said I was in a dreadful hurry,
and I wished we could get this business permanently mapped out, so that I
could go on with my work.  He said, "I could have put up those eight
rods, and marched off about my business--some men would have done it.
But no; I said to myself, this man is a stranger to me, and I will die
before I'll wrong him; there ain't lightning-rods enough on that house,
and for one I'll never stir out of my tracks till I've done as I would be
done by, and told him so.  Stranger, my duty is accomplished; if the
recalcitrant and dephlogistic messenger of heaven strikes your--"
"There, now, there," I said, "put on the other eight--add five hundred
feet of spiral-twist--do anything and everything you want to do; but calm
your sufferings, and try to keep your feelings where you can reach them
with the dictionary.  Meanwhile, if we understand each other now, I will
go to work again."

I think I have been sitting here a full hour this time, trying to get
back to where I was when my train of thought was broken up by the last
interruption; but I believe I have accomplished it at last, and may
venture to proceed again.]

     wrestled with this great subject, and the greatest among them have
     found it a worthy adversary, and one that always comes up fresh and
     smiling after every throw.  The great Confucius said that he would
     rather be a profound political economist than chief of police.
     Cicero frequently said that political economy was the grandest
     consummation that the human mind was capable of consuming; and even
     our own Greeley had said vaguely but forcibly that "Political--

[Here the lightning-rod man sent up another call for me.  I went down in
a state of mind bordering on impatience.  He said he would rather have
died than interrupt me, but when he was employed to do a job, and that
job was expected to be done in a clean, workmanlike manner, and when it
was finished and fatigue urged him to seek the rest and recreation he
stood so much in need of, and he was about to do it, but looked up and
saw at a glance that all the calculations had been a little out, and if a
thunder-storm were to come up, and that house, which he felt a personal
interest in, stood there with nothing on earth to protect it but sixteen
lightning-rods--"Let us have peace!" I shrieked.  "Put up a hundred and
fifty!  Put some on the kitchen!  Put a dozen on the barn!  Put a couple
on the cow!  Put one on the cook!--scatter them all over the persecuted
place till it looks like a zinc-plated, spiral-twisted, silver-mounted
canebrake!  Move!  Use up all the material you can get your hands on, and
when you run out of lightning-rods put up ramrods, cam-rods, stair-rods,
piston-rods--anything that will pander to your dismal appetite for
artificial scenery, and bring respite to my raging brain and healing to
my lacerated soul!"  Wholly unmoved--further than to smile sweetly--this
iron being simply turned back his wrist-bands daintily, and said he would
now proceed to hump himself.  Well, all that was nearly three hours ago.
It is questionable whether I am calm enough yet to write on the noble
theme of political economy, but I cannot resist the desire to try, for it
is the one subject that is nearest to my heart and dearest to my brain of
all this world's philosophy.]

     economy is heaven's best boon to man."  When the loose but gifted
     Byron lay in his Venetian exile he observed that, if it could be
     granted him to go back and live his misspent life over again, he
     would give his lucid and unintoxicated intervals to the composition,
     not of frivolous rhymes, but of essays upon political economy.
     Washington loved this exquisite science; such names as Baker,
     Beckwith, Judson, Smith, are imperishably linked with it; and even
     imperial Homer, in the ninth book of the Iliad, has said:

                    Fiat justitia, ruat coelum,
                    Post mortem unum, ante bellum,
                    Hic facet hoc, ex-parte res,
                    Politicum e-conomico est.

     The grandeur of these conceptions of the old poet, together with the
     felicity of the wording which clothes them, and the sublimity of the
     imagery whereby they are illustrated, have singled out that stanza,
     and made it more celebrated than any that ever--

["Now, not a word out of you--not a single word.  Just state your bill
and relapse into impenetrable silence for ever and ever on these
premises.  Nine hundred, dollars?  Is that all?  This check for the
amount will be honored at any respectable bank in America.  What is that
multitude of people gathered in the street for?  How?--'looking at the
lightning-rods!'  Bless my life, did they never see any lightning-rods
before?  Never saw 'such a stack of them on one establishment,' did I
understand you to say?  I will step down and critically observe this
popular ebullition of ignorance."]

THREE DAYS LATER.--We are all about worn out.  For four-and-twenty hours
our bristling premises were the talk and wonder of the town.  The
theaters languished, for their happiest scenic inventions were tame and
commonplace compared with my lightning-rods.  Our street was blocked
night and day with spectators, and among them were many who came from
the country to see.  It was a blessed relief on the second day when a
thunderstorm came up and the lightning began to "go for" my house, as the
historian Josephus quaintly phrases it.  It cleared the galleries, so to
speak.  In five minutes there was not a spectator within half a mile of
my place; but all the high houses about that distance away were full,
windows, roof, and all.  And well they might be, for all the falling
stars and Fourth-of-July fireworks of a generation, put together and
rained down simultaneously out of heaven in one brilliant shower upon one
helpless roof, would not have any advantage of the pyrotechnic display
that was making my house so magnificently conspicuous in the general
gloom of the storm.

By actual count, the lightning struck at my establishment seven
hundred and sixty-four times in forty minutes, but tripped on one of
those faithful rods every time, and slid down the spiral-twist and shot
into the earth before it probably had time to be surprised at the way the
thing was done. And through all that bombardment only one patch of slates
was ripped up, and that was because, for a single instant, the rods in
the vicinity were transporting all the lightning they could possibly
accommodate.  Well, nothing was ever seen like it since the world began.
For one whole day and night not a member of my family stuck his head out
of the window but he got the hair snatched off it as smooth as a
billiard-ball; and; if the reader will believe me, not one of us ever
dreamt of stirring abroad.  But at last the awful siege came to an
end-because there was absolutely no more electricity left in the clouds
above us within grappling distance of my insatiable rods.  Then I sallied
forth, and gathered daring workmen together, and not a bite or a nap did
we take till the premises were utterly stripped of all their terrific
armament except just three rods on the house, one on the kitchen, and one
on the barn--and, behold, these remain there even unto this day.  And
then, and not till then, the people ventured to use our street again.
I will remark here, in passing, that during that fearful time I did not
continue my essay upon political economy.  I am not even yet settled
enough in nerve and brain to resume it.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.--Parties having need of three thousand two
hundred and eleven feet of best quality zinc-plated spiral-twist
lightning-rod stuff, and sixteen hundred and thirty-one silver-tipped
points, all in tolerable repair (and, although much worn by use, still
equal to any ordinary emergency), can hear of a bargains by addressing
the publisher.






THE JUMPING FROG [written about 1865]

IN ENGLISH.  THEN IN FRENCH.  THEN CLAWED BACK INTO A CIVILIZED LANGUAGE
ONCE MORE BY PATIENT, UNREMUNERATED TOIL.

Even a criminal is entitled to fair play; and certainly when a man who
has done no harm has been unjustly treated, he is privileged to do his
best to right himself.  My attention has just beep called to an article
some three years old in a French Magazine entitled, 'Revue des Deux
Mondes' (Review of Some Two Worlds), wherein the writer treats of "Les
Humoristes Americaines" (These Humorist Americans).  I am one of these
humorists American dissected by him, and hence the complaint I am making.

This gentleman's article is an able one (as articles go, in the French,
where they always tangle up everything to that degree that when you start
into a sentence you never know whether you are going to come out alive or
not).  It is a very good article and the writer says all manner of kind
and complimentary things about me--for which I am sure thank him with all
my heart; but then why should he go and spoil all his praise by one
unlucky experiment?  What I refer to is this: he says my jumping Frog is
a funny story, but still he can't see why it should ever really convulse
any one with laughter--and straightway proceeds to translate it into
French in order to prove to his nation that there is nothing so very
extravagantly funny about it.  Just there is where my complaint
originates.  He has not translated it at all; he has simply mixed it all
up; it is no more like the jumping Frog when he gets through with it than
I am like a meridian of longitude.  But my mere assertion is not proof;
wherefore I print the French version, that all may see that I do not
speak falsely; furthermore, in order that even the unlettered may know my
injury and give me their compassion, I have been at infinite pains and
trouble to retranslate this French version back into English; and to tell
the truth I have well-nigh worn myself out at it, having scarcely rested
from my work during five days and nights.  I cannot speak the French
language, but I can translate very well, though not fast, I being
self-educated.  I ask the reader to run his eye over the original English
version of the jumping Frog, and then read the French or my
retranslation, and kindly take notice how the Frenchman has riddled the
grammar.  I think it is the worst I ever saw; and yet the French are
called a polished nation.  If I had a boy that put sentences together as
they do, I would polish him to some purpose.  Without further
introduction, the jumping Frog, as I originally wrote it, was as follows
[after it will be found the French version--(French version is deleted
from this edition)--, and after the latter my retranslation from the
French]




THE NOTORIOUS JUMPING FROG OF CALAVERAS COUNTY [Pronounced Cal-e-va-ras]

In compliance with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote me from the
East, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and inquired
after my friend's friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as requested to do, and I
hereunto append the result.  I have a lurking suspicion that Leonidas W.
Smiley is a myth that my friend never knew such a personage; and that he
on conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler about him, it would remind him
of his infamous Jim Smiley, and he would go to work and bore me to death
with some exasperating reminiscence him as long and as tedious as it
should be useless to me.  If that was the design, it succeeded.

I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room stove of the
dilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp Angel's, and I noticed that
he was fat and bald-headed, and had an expression of winning gentleness
and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance.  He roused up, and gave me
good day.  I told him that a friend of mine had commissioned me to make
some inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood named Leonidas
W. Smiley--Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, a young minister of the Gospel, who
he had heard was at one time resident of Angel's Camp.  I added that if
Mr. Wheeler could tell me anything about this Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley,
I would feel under many obligations to him.

Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his
chair, and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which
follows this paragraph.  He never smiled he never frowned, he never
changed his voice from the gentle flowing key to which he tuned his
initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of
enthusiasm; but all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein
of impressive earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainly that,
so far from his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or funny
about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired
its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in 'finesse.'  I let him go
on in his own way, and never interrupted him once.

"Rev. Leonidas W.  H'm, Reverend Le--well, there was a feller here, once
by the name of Jim Smiley, in the winter of '49--or maybe it was the
spring of '50--I don't recollect exactly, somehow, though what makes me
think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume warn't
finished when he first come to the camp; but anyway, he was the
curiousest man about always betting on anything that turned up you ever
see, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and if he couldn't
he'd change sides.  Any way that suited the other man would suit him any
way just so's he got a bet, he was satisfied.  But still he was lucky,
uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner.  He was always ready and
laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solit'ry thing mentioned but
that feller'd offer to bet on it, and take any side you please, as I was
just telling you.  If there was a horse-race, you'd find him flush or
you'd find him busted at the end of it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd
bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a
chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a
fence, he would bet you which one would fly first; or if there was a
camp-meeting, he would be there reg'lar to bet on Parson Walker, which he
judged to be the best exhorter about here, and so he was too, and a good
man.  If he even see a straddle-bug start to go anywheres, he would bet
you how long it would take him to get to--to wherever he was going to,
and if you took him up, he would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but
what he would find out where he was bound for and how long he was on the
road.  Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about
him.  Why, it never made no difference to him--he'd bet on any thing--the
dangdest feller.  Parson Walker's wife laid very sick once, for a good
while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one morning
he come in, and Smiley up and asked him how she was, and he said she was
considerable better--thank the Lord for his inf'nite mercy--and coming on
so smart that with the blessing of Prov'dence she'd get well yet; and
Smiley, before he thought, says, 'Well, I'll resk two-and-a-half she
don't anyway.'

"Thish-yer Smiley had a mare--the boys called her the fifteen-minute nag,
but that was only in fun, you know, because of course she was faster than
that--and he used to win money on that horse, for all she was so slow and
always had the asthma, or the distemper, or the consumption, or something
of that kind.  They used to give her two or three hundred yards' start,
and then pass her under way; but always at the fag end of the race she
get excited and desperate like, and come cavorting and straddling up,
and scattering her legs around limber, sometimes in the air, and
sometimes out to one side among the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e dust
and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her
nose--and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as near
as you could cipher it down.

"And he had a little small bull-pup, that to look at him you'd think he
warn't worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay for a
chance to steal something.  But as soon as money was up on him he was a
different dog; his under-jaw'd begin to stick out like the fo'castle of
a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover and shine like the furnaces.
And a dog might tackle him and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him
over his shoulder two or three times, and Andrew Jackson--which was the
name of the pup--Andrew Jackson would never let on but what he was
satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else--and the bets being doubled
and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up;
and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j'int
of his hind leg and freeze to it--not chaw, you understand, but only just
grip and hang on till they throwed up the sponge, if it was a year.
Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he harnessed a dog once
that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off in a
circular saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money
was all up, and he come to make a snatch for his pet holt, he see in a
minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other dog had him in the
door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter
discouraged-like and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got
shucked out bad.  He give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was
broke, and it was his fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind
legs for him to take holt of, which was his main dependence in a fight,
and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died.  It was a good
pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if
he'd lived, for the stuff was in him and he had genius--I know it,
because he hadn't no opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to
reason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under them
circumstances if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when
I think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out.

"Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tomcats
and all them kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't
fetch nothing for him to bet on but he'd match you.  He ketched a frog
one day, and took him home, and said he cal'lated to educate him; and so
he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn
that frog to jump. And you bet you he did learn him, too. He'd give him a
little punch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog whirling in
the air like a doughnut--see him turn one summerset, or maybe a couple,
if he got a good start, and come down flat-footed and all right, like a
cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching flies, and kep' him in
practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as fur as he could
see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do
'most anything--and I believe him.  Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster
down here on this floor--Dan'l Webster was the name of the frog--and sing
out, 'Flies, Dan'l, flies!' and quicker'n you could wink he'd spring
straight up and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on the
floor ag'in as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of
his head with his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd
been doin' any more'n any frog might do. You never see a frog so modest
and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted.  And when it
come to fair and square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more
ground at one straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see.
Jumping on a dead level was his strong suit, you understand; and when it
come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he had a red.
Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers
that had traveled and been everywheres all said he laid over any frog
that ever they see.

"Well, Smiley kep' the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to
fetch him down-town sometimes and lay for a bet.  One day a feller
--a stranger in the camp, he was--come acrost him with his box, and says:

"'What might it be that you've got in the box?'

"And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, 'It might be a parrot, or it
might be a canary, maybe, but it ain't--it's only just a frog.'

"And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round
this way and that, and says, 'H'm--so 'tis.  Well, what's HE good for.

"'Well,' Smiley says, easy and careless, 'he's good enough for one thing,
I should judge--he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County.

"The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look,
and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate,  'Well,' he says,
'I don't see no pints about that frog that's any better'n any other
frog.'

"'Maybe you don't,' Smiley says.  'Maybe you understand frogs and maybe
you don't understand 'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you
ain't only a amature, as it were.  Anyways, I've got my opinion, and I'll
resk forty dollars the he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County.'

"And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad-like, 'Well,
I'm only a, stranger here, and I ain't got no frog; but if I had a frog,
I'd bet you.

"And then Smiley says, 'That's all right--that's all right if you'll hold
my box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog.'  Any so the feller took the
box, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley's, and set down to
wait.

"So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to himself and then
he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon and
filled him full of quail-shot-filled him pretty near up to his chin--and
set him on the floor.  Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped around in
the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him
in, and give him to this feller and says:

"'Now, if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore paws
just even with Dan'l's, and I'll give the word.' Then he says,
'One-two-three--git' and him and the feller touches up the frogs from
behind, and the new frog hopped off lively but Dan'l give a heave, and
hysted up his shoulders---so-like a Frenchman, but it warn't no use--he
couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as a church, and he couldn't no
more stir than if he was anchored out.  Smiley was a good deal surprised,
and he was disgusted too, but he didn't have no idea what the matter was
of course.

"The Teller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at
the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder--so--at Dan'l, and
says again, very deliberate, 'Well,' he says, 'I don't see no pints about
that frog that's any better'n any other frog.'

"Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long
time, and at last he says, 'I do wonder what in the nation that frog
throw'd off for--I wonder if there ain't something the matter with him
--he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow.'  And he ketched Dan'l by the
nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, 'Why blame my cats if he don't
weigh five pound!' and turned him upside down and he belched out a double
handful of shot.  And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man
--he set the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never
ketched him.  And--"

[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up
to see what was wanted.]  And turning to me as he moved away, he said:
"Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy--I ain't going to be
gone a second."

But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of
the enterprising vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely to afford me much
information concerning the Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and so I started
away.

At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholed me
and recommenced:

"Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller one-eyed cow that didn't have no
tail, only just a short stump like a bannanner, and--"

However, lacking both time and inclination, I did not wait to hear about
the afflicted cow, but took my leave.


Now let the learned look upon this picture and say if iconoclasm can
further go:

THE JUMPING FROG

"--Il y avait, une fois ici un individu connu sous le nom de Jim Smiley:
c'etait dans l'hiver de 49, peut-etre bien au printemps de 50, je ne me
reappelle pas exactement.  Ce qui me fait croire que c'etait l'un ou
l'autre, c'est que je me souviens que le grand bief n'etait pas acheve
lorsqu'il arriva au camp pour la premiere fois, mais de toutes facons il
etait l'homme le plus friand de paris qui se put voir, pariant sur tout
ce qui se presentaat, quand il pouvait trouver un adversaire, et, quand
n'en trouvait pas il passait du cote oppose.  Tout ce qui convenaiat
l'autre lui convenait; pourvu qu'il eut un pari, Smiley etait satisfait.
Et il avait une chance! une chance inouie:  presque toujours il gagnait.
It faut dire qu'il etait toujours pret a'exposer, qu'on ne pouvait
mentionner la moindre chose sans que ce gaillard offrit de parier
la-dessus n'importe quoi et de prendre le cote que l'on voudrait, comme
je vous le disais tout a l'heure.  S'il y avait des courses, vous le
trouviez riche ou ruine a la fin; s'il y avait un combat de chiens, il
apportait son enjeu; il l'apportait pour un combat de chats, pour un
combat de coqs;--parbleu! si vous aviez vu deux oiseaux sur une haie il
vous aurait offert de parier lequel s'envolerait le premier, et s'il y
aviat 'meeting' au camp, il venait parier regulierement pour le cure
Walker, qu'il jugeait etre le meilleur predicateur des environs, et qui
l'etait en effet, et un brave homme.  Il aurai rencontre une punaise de
bois en chemin, qu'il aurait parie sur le temps qu'il lui faudrait pour
aller ou elle voudrait aller, et si vous l'aviez pris au mot, it aurait
suivi la punaise jusqu'au Mexique, sans se soucier d'aller si loin, ni du
temps qu'il y perdrait.  Une fois la femme du cure Walker fut tres malade
pendant longtemps, il semblait qu'on ne la sauverait pas; mai un matin le
cure arrive, et Smiley lui demande comment ella va et il dit qu'elle est
bien mieux, grace a l'infinie misericorde tellement mieux qu'avec la
benediction de la Providence elle s'en tirerait, et voila que, sans y
penser, Smiley repond:--Eh bien! ye gage deux et demi qu'elle mourra tout
de meme.

"Ce Smiley avait une jument que les gars appelaient le bidet du quart
d'heure, mais seulement pour plaisanter, vous comprenez, parse que, bien
entendu, elle etait plus vite que ca!  Et il avait coutume de gagner de
l'argent avec cette bete, quoi-qu'elle fut poussive, cornarde, toujours
prise d'asthme, de colique ou de consomption, ou de quelque chose
d'approchant. On lui donnait 2 ou 300 'yards' au depart, puffs on la
depassait sans peine; mais jamais a la fin elle ne manquait de
s'echauffer, de s'exasperer et elle arrivait, s'ecartant, se defendant,
ses jambes greles en l'ai devant les obstacles, quelquefois les evitant
et faisant avec cela plus de poussiare qu'aucun cheval, plus de bruit
surtout avec ses eternumens et reniflemens.---crac! elle arrivaat donc
toujour premiere d'une tete, aussi juste qu'on peut le mesurer.  Et il
avait un petit bouledogue qui, a le voir, ne valait pas un sou; on aurait
cru que parier contre lui c'etait voler, tant il etait ordinaire; mais
aussitot les enjeux faits, il devenait un autre chien.  Sa machoire
inferieure commencait a ressortir comme un gaillard d'avant, ses dents se
decouvcraient brillantes commes des fournaises, et un chien pouvait le
taquiner, l'exciter, le mordre, le jeter deux ou trois fois par-dessus
son epaule, Andre Jackson, c'etait le nom du chien, Andre Jackson prenait
cela tranquillement, comme s'il ne se fut jamais attendu a autre chose,
et quand les paris etaient doubles et redoubles contre lui, il vous
saisissait l'autre chien juste a l'articulation de la jambe de derriere,
et il ne la lachait plus, non pas qu'il la machat, vous concevez, mais il
s'y serait tenu pendu jusqu'a ce qu'on jetat l'eponge en l'air, fallut-il
attendre un an.  Smiley gagnait toujours avec cette bete-la;
malheureusement ils ont fini par dresser un chien qui n'avait pas de
pattes de derriere, parce qu'on les avait sciees, et quand les choses
furent au point qu'il voulait, et qu'il en vint a se jeter sur son
morceau favori, le pauvre chien comprit en un instant qu'on s'etait moque
de lui, et que l'autre le tenait.  Vous n'avez jamais vu personne avoir
l'air plus penaud et plus decourage; il ne fit aucun effort pour gagner
le combat et fut rudement secoue, de sorte que, regardant Smiley comme
pour lui dire:--Mon coeur est brise, c'est to faute; pourquoi m'avoir
livre a un chien qui n'a pas de pattes de derriere, puisque c'est par la
que je les bats?--il s'en alla en clopinant, et se coucha pour mourir.
Ah! c'etait un bon chien, cet Andre Jackson, et il se serait fait un nom,
s'il avait vecu, car il y avait de l'etoffe en lui, il avait du genie,
je la sais, bien que de grandes occasions lui aient manque; mais il est
impossible de supposer qu'un chien capable de se battre comme lui,
certaines circonstances etant donnees, ait manque de talent.  Je me sens
triste toutes les fois que je pense a son dernier combat et au denoument
qu'il a eu.  Eh bien! ce Smiley nourrissait des terriers a rats, et des
coqs combat, et des chats, et toute sorte de choses, au point qu'il etait
toujours en mesure de vous tenir tete, et qu'avec sa rage de paris on
n'avait plus de repos. Il attrapa un jour une grenouille et l'emporta
chez lui, disant qu'il pretendait faire son Education; vous me croirez si
vous voulez, mais pendant trois mois il n'a rien fait que lui apprendre a
sauter dans une cour retire de sa maison. Et je vous reponds qu'il avait
reussi.  Il lui donnait un petit coup par derriere, et l'instant d'apres
vous voyiez la grenouille tourner en l'air comme un beignet au-dessus de
la poele, faire une culbute, quelquefois deux, lorsqu'elle etait bien
partie, et retomber sur ses pattes comme un chat.  Il l'avait dressee
dans l'art de gober des mouches, er l'y exercait continuellement, si bien
qu'une mouche, du plus loin qu'elle apparaissait, etait une mouche
perdue. Smiley avait coutume de dire que tout ce qui manquait a une
grenouille, c'etait l'education, qu'avec l'education elle pouvait faire
presque tout, et je le crois.  Tenez, je l'ai vu poser Daniel Webster la
sur se plancher,--Daniel Webster etait le nom de la grenouille,--et lui
chanter: Des mouches! Daniel, des mouches!--En un clin d'oeil, Daniel
avait bondi et saisi une mouche ici sur le comptoir, puis saute de
nouveau par terre, ou il restait vraiment a se gratter la tete avec sa
patte de derriere, comme s'il n'avait pas eu la moindre idee de sa
superiorite.  Jamais vous n'avez grenouille vu de aussi modeste, aussi
naturelle, douee comme elle l'etait!  Et quand il s'agissait de sauter
purement et simplement sur terrain plat, elle faisait plus de chemin en
un saut qu'aucune bete de son espece que vous puissiez connaitre. Sauter
a plat, c'etait son fort! Quand il s'agissait de cela, Smiley en tassait
les enjeux sur elle tant qu'il lui, restait un rouge liard. Il faut le
reconnaitre, Smiley etait monstrueusement fier de sa grenouille, et il en
avait le droit, car des gens qui avaient voyage, qui avaient tout vu,
disaient qu'on lui ferait injure de la comparer a une autre; de facon que
Smiley gardait Daniel dans une petite boite a claire-voie qu'il emportait
parfois a la Ville pour quelque pari.

"Un jour, un individu etranger au camp l'arrete aver sa boite et lui
dit:--Qu'est-ce que vous avez donc serre la dedans?

"Smiley dit d'un air indifferent:--Cela pourrait etre un perroquet ou un
serin, mais ce n'est rien de pareil, ce n'est qu'une grenouille.

"L'individu la prend, la regarde avec soin, la tourne d'un cote et de
l'autre puis il dit.--Tiens! en effet!  A quoi estelle bonne?

"--Mon Dieu! repond Smiley, toujours d'un air degage, elle est bonne pour
une chose a mon avis, elle peut battre en sautant toute grenouille du
comte de Calaveras.

"L'individu reprend la boite, l'examine de nouveau longuement, et la rend
a Smiley en disant d'un air delibere:--Eh bien! je ne vois pas que cette
grenouille ait rien de mieux qu'aucune grenouille.

"--Possible qua vous ne le voyiez pat, dit Smiley, possible que vous vous
entendiez en grenouilles, possible que vous ne vous y entendez point,
possible qua vous avez de l'experience, et possible que vous ne soyez
qu'un amateur.  De toute maniere, je parie quarante dollars qu'elle
battra en sautant n'importe quelle grenouille du comte de Calaveras.

"L'individu reflechit one seconde et dit comma attriste:--Je ne suis
qu'un etranger ici, je n'ai pas de grenouille; mais, si j'en
avais une, je tiendrais le pari.

"--Fort bien! repond Smiley.  Rien de plus facile. Si vous voulez tenir
ma boite one minute, j'irai vous chercher une grenouille.--Voile donc
l'individu qui garde la boite, qui met ses quarante dollars sur ceux de
Smiley et qui attend.  Il attend assez longtemps, reflechissant tout
seul, et figurez-vous qu'il prend Daniel, lui ouvre la bouche de force at
avec une cuiller a the l'emplit de menu plomb de chasse, mail l'emplit
jusqu'au menton, puis il le pose par terre.  Smiley pendant ce temps
etait a barboter dans une mare.  Finalement il attrape une grenouille,
l'apporte cet individu et dit:--Maintenant, si vous etes pret, mettez-la
tout contra Daniel, avec leurs pattes de devant sur la meme ligne, et je
donnerai le signal; puis il ajoute:--Un, deux, trois, sautez!

"Lui et l'individu touchent leurs grenouilles par derriere, et la
grenouille neuve se met h sautiller, mais Daniel se souleve lourdement,
hausse les epaules ainsi, comma un Francais; a quoi bon? il ne pouvait
bouger, il etait plante solide comma une enclume, il n'avancait pas plus
que si on l'eut mis a l'ancre. Smiley fut surpris et degoute, mais il ne
se doutait pas du tour, bien entendu.  L'individu empoche l'argent, s'en
va, et en s'en allant est-ce qu'il ne donna pas un coup de pouce
pardessus l'epaule, comma ca, au pauvre Daniel, en disant de son air
delibere:--Eh bien! je ne vois pas qua cette grenouille ait rien de muiex
qu'une autre.

"Smiley se gratta longtemps la tete, les yeux fixes Sur Daniel; jusqu'a
ce qu'enfin il dit:--je me demande comment diable il se fait qua cette
bite ait refuse, . . . Est-ce qu'elle aurait quelque chose? . . . On
croirait qu'elle est enflee.

"Il empoigne Daniel par la peau du coo, le souleve et dit:--Le loup me
croque, s'il ne pese pas cinq livres.

"Il le retourne, et le malheureux crache deux poignees de plomb.  Quand
Smiley reconnut ce qui en etait, il fut comme fou.  Vous le voyez d'ici
poser sa grenouille par terra et courir apres cet individu, mais il ne le
rattrapa jamais, et ...."



[Translation of the above back from the French:]

THE FROG JUMPING OF THE COUNTY OF CALAVERAS

It there was one time here an individual known under the name of Jim
Smiley; it was in the winter of '89, possibly well at the spring of '50,
I no me recollect not exactly.  This which me makes to believe that it
was the one or the other, it is that I shall remember that the grand
flume is not achieved when he arrives at the camp for the first time, but
of all sides he was the man the most fond of to bet which one have seen,
betting upon all that which is presented, when he could find an
adversary; and when he not of it could not, he passed to the side
opposed.  All that which convenienced to the other to him convenienced
also; seeing that he had a bet Smiley was satisfied.  And he had a
chance! a chance even worthless; nearly always he gained.  It must to say
that he was always near to himself expose, but one no could mention the
least thing without that this gaillard offered to bet the bottom, no
matter what, and to take the side that one him would, as I you it said
all at the hour (tout a l'heure).  If it there was of races, you him find
rich or ruined at the end; if it, here is a combat of dogs, he bring his
bet; he himself laid always for a combat of cats, for a combat of cocks
--by-blue!  If you have see two birds upon a fence, he you should have
offered of to bet which of those birds shall fly the first; and if there
is meeting at the camp (meeting au camp) he comes to bet regularly for
the cure Walker, which he judged to be the best predicator of the
neighborhood (predicateur des environs) and which he was in effect, and a
brave man.  He would encounter a bug of wood in the road, whom he will
bet upon the time which he shall take to go where she would go--and if
you him have take at the word, he will follow the bug as far as Mexique,
without himself caring to go so far; neither of the time which he there
lost.  One time the woman of the cure Walker is very sick during long
time, it seemed that one not her saved not; but one morning the cure
arrives, and Smiley him demanded how she goes, and he said that she is
well better, grace to the infinite misery (lui demande comment elle va,
et il dit qu'elle est bien mieux, grace a l'infinie misericorde) so much
better that with the benediction of the Providence she herself of it
would pull out (elle s'en tirerait); and behold that without there
thinking Smiley responds: "Well, I gage two-and-half that she will die
all of same."

This Smiley had an animal which the boys called the nag of the quarter of
hour, but solely for pleasantry, you comprehend, because, well
understand, she was more fast as that! [Now why that exclamation?--M. T.]
And it was custom of to gain of the silver with this beast,
notwithstanding she was poussive, cornarde, always taken of asthma, of
colics or of consumption, or something of approaching.  One him would
give two or three hundred yards at the departure, then one him passed
without pain; but never at the last she not fail of herself echauffer,
of herself exasperate, and she arrives herself ecartant, se defendant,
her legs greles in the air before the obstacles, sometimes them elevating
and making with this more of dust than any horse, more of noise above
with his eternumens and reniflemens--crac! she arrives then always first
by one head, as just as one can it measure.  And he had a small bulldog
(bouledogue!) who, to him see, no value, not a cent; one would believe
that to bet against him it was to steal, so much he was ordinary; but as
soon as the game made, she becomes another dog.  Her jaw inferior
commence to project like a deck of before, his teeth themselves discover
brilliant like some furnaces, and a dog could him tackle (le taquiner),
him excite, him murder (le mordre), him throw two or three times over his
shoulder, Andre Jackson--this was the name of the dog--Andre Jackson
takes that tranquilly, as if he not himself was never expecting other
thing, and when the bets were doubled and redoubled against him, he you
seize the other dog just at the articulation of the leg of behind, and he
not it leave more, not that he it masticate, you conceive, but he himself
there shall be holding during until that one throws the sponge in the
air, must he wait a year.  Smiley gained always with this beast-la;
unhappily they have finished by elevating a dog who no had not of feet of
behind, because one them had sawed; and when things were at the point
that he would, and that he came to himself throw upon his morsel
favorite, the poor dog comprehended in an instant that he himself was
deceived in him, and that the other dog him had.  You no have never seen
person having the air more penaud and more discouraged; he not made no
effort to gain the combat, and was rudely shucked.

Eh bien! this Smiley nourished some terriers a rats, and some cocks of
combat, and some pats, and all sorts of things; and with his rage of
betting one no had more of repose.  He trapped one day a frog and him
imported with him (et l'emporta chez lui) saying that he pretended to
make his education.  You me believe if you will, but during three months
he not has nothing done but to him apprehend to jump (apprendre a sauter)
in a court retired of her mansion (de sa maison).  And I you respond that
he have succeeded.  He him gives a small blow by behind, and the instant
after you shall see the frog turn in the air like a grease-biscuit, make
one summersault, sometimes two, when she was well started, and refall
upon his feet like a cat.  He him had accomplished in the art of to
gobble the flies (gober des mouches), and him there exercised continually
--so well that a fly at the most far that she appeared was a fly lost.
Smiley had custom to say that all which lacked to a frog it was the
education, but with the education she could do nearly all--and I him
believe.  Tenez, I him have seen pose Daniel Webster there upon this
plank--Daniel Webster was the name of the frog--and to him sing, "Some
flies, Daniel, some fifes!"--in a flash of the eye Daniel 30
had bounded and seized a fly here upon the counter, then jumped anew at
the earth, where he rested truly to himself scratch the head with his
behind foot, as if he no had not the least idea of his superiority.
Never you not have seen frog as modest, as natural, sweet as she was.
And when he himself agitated to jump purely and simply upon plain earth,
she does more ground in one jump than any beast of his species than you
can know.  To jump plain-this was his strong.  When he himself agitated
for that, Smiley multiplied the bets upon her as long as there to him
remained a red.  It must to know, Smiley was monstrously proud of his
frog, and he of it was right, for some men who were traveled, who had all
seen, said that they to him would be injurious to him compare, to another
frog.  Smiley guarded Daniel in a little box latticed which he carried
bytimes to the village for some bet.

One day an individual stranger at the camp him arrested with his box and
him said:

"What is this that you have them shut up there within?"

Smiley said, with an air indifferent:

"That could be a paroquet, or a syringe (ou un serin), but this no is
nothing of such, it not is but a frog."

The individual it took, it regarded with care, it turned from one side
and from the other, then he said:

"Tiens! in effect!--At what is she good?"

"My God!" respond Smiley, always with an air disengaged, "she is good for
one thing, to my notice (A mon avis), she can better in jumping (elle pent
battre en sautant) all frogs of the county of Calaveras."

The individual retook the box, it examined of new longly, and it rendered
to Smiley in saying with an air deliberate:

"Eh bien! I no saw not that that frog had nothing of better than each
frog."  (Je ne vois pas que cette grenouille ait rien de mieux qu'aucune
grenouille.) [If that isn't grammar gone to seed, then I count myself no
judge.--M.  T.]

"Possible that you not it saw not," said Smiley, "possible that you--you
comprehend frogs; possible that you not you there comprehend nothing;
possible that you had of the experience, and possible that you not be but
an amateur.  Of all manner (De toute maniere) I bet forty dollars that
she better in jumping no matter which frog of the county of Calaveras."

The individual reflected a second, and said like sad:

"I not am but a stranger here, I no have not a frog; but if I of it had
one, I would embrace the bet."

"Strong well!" respond Smiley; "nothing of more facility.  If you will
hold my box a minute, I go you to search a frog (j'irai vous chercher)."

Behold, then, the individual, who guards the box, who puts his forty
dollars upon those of Smiley, and who attends (et qui attend).  He
attended enough long times, reflecting all solely.  And figure you that
he takes Daniel, him opens the mouth by force and with a teaspoon him
fills with shot of the hunt, even him fills just to the chin, then he him
puts by the earth.  Smiley during these times was at slopping in a swamp.
Finally he trapped (attrape) a frog, him carried to that individual, and
said:

"Now if you be ready, put him all against Daniel with their before feet
upon the same line, and I give the signal"--then he added: "One, two,
three--advance!"

Him and the individual touched their frogs by behind, and the frog new
put to jump smartly, but Daniel himself lifted ponderously, exalted the
shoulders thus, like a Frenchman--to what good? he not could budge, he
is planted solid like a church he not advance no more than if one him had
put at the anchor.

Smiley was surprised and disgusted, but he no himself doubted not of the
turn being intended (mais il ne se doutait pas du tour, bien entendu).
The individual empocketed the silver, himself with it went, and of it
himself in going is it that he no gives not a jerk of thumb over the
shoulder--like that--at the poor Daniel, in saying with his air
deliberate--(L'individu empoche l'argent, s'en va et en s'en allant
est-ce qu'il ne donne pas un coup d pouce par-dessus l'epaule, comme ga,
au pauvre Daniel, en disant de son air delibere):

"Eh bien! I no see not that that frog has nothin of better than another."

Smiley himself scratched longtimes the head, the eyes fixed upon Daniel,
until that which at last he said:

"I me demand how the devil it makes itself that this beast has refused.
Is it that she had something?  One would believe that she is stuffed."

He grasped Daniel by the skin of the neck, him lifted and said:

"The wolf me bite if he no weigh not five pounds:"

He him reversed and the unhappy belched two handfuls of shot (et le
malheureux, etc.).  When Smiley recognized how it was, he was like mad.
He deposited his frog by the earth and ran after that individual, but he
not him caught never.


Such is the jumping Frog, to the distorted French eye.  I claim that I
never put together such an odious mixture of bad grammar and delirium
tremens in my life.  And what has a poor foreigner like me done, to be
abused and misrepresented like this?  When I say, "Well, I don't see no
pints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog," is it kind,
is it just, for this Frenchman to try to make it appear that I said, "Eh
bien! I no saw not that that frog had nothing of better than each frog"?
I have no heart to write more.  I never felt so about anything before.

HARTFORD, March, 1875.






JOURNALISM IN TENNESSEE--[Written about 1871.]

     The editor of the Memphis Avalanche swoops thus mildly down upon a
     correspondent who posted him as a Radical:--"While he was writing
     the first word, the middle, dotting his i's, crossing his t's, and
     punching his period, he knew he was concocting a sentence that was
     saturated with infamy and reeking with falsehood."--Exchange.

I was told by the physician that a Southern climate would improve my
health, and so I went down to Tennessee, and got a berth on the Morning
Glory and Johnson County War-Whoop as associate editor.  When I went on
duty I found the chief editor sitting tilted back in a three-legged chair
with his feet on a pine table.  There was another pine table in the room
and another afflicted chair, and both were half buried under newspapers
and scraps and sheets of manuscript.  There was a wooden box of sand,
sprinkled with cigar stubs and "old soldiers," and a stove with a door
hanging by its upper hinge.  The chief editor had a long-tailed black
cloth frock-coat on, and white linen pants.  His boots were small and
neatly blacked.  He wore a ruffled shirt, a large seal-ring, a standing
collar of obsolete pattern, and a checkered neckerchief with the ends
hanging down.  Date of costume about 1848.  He was smoking a cigar, and
trying to think of a word, and in pawing his hair he had rumpled his
locks a good deal.  He was scowling fearfully, and I judged that he was
concocting a particularly knotty editorial.  He told me to take the
exchanges and skim through them and write up the "Spirit of the Tennessee
Press," condensing into the article all of their contents that seemed of
interest.

I wrote as follows:

                    SPIRIT OF THE TENNESSEE PRESS

     The editors of the Semi-Weekly Earthquake evidently labor under a
     misapprehension with regard to the Dallyhack railroad.  It is not
     the object of the company to leave Buzzardville off to one side.
     On the contrary, they consider it one of the most important points
     along the line, and consequently can have no desire to slight it.
     The gentlemen of the Earthquake will, of course, take pleasure in
     making the correction.

     John W. Blossom, Esq., the able editor of the Higginsville
     Thunderbolt and Battle Cry of Freedom, arrived in the city
     yesterday.  He is stopping at the Van Buren House.

     We observe that our contemporary of the Mud Springs Morning Howl has
     fallen into the error of supposing that the election of Van Werter
     is not an established fact, but he will have discovered his mistake
     before this reminder reaches him, no doubt.  He was doubtless misled
     by incomplete election returns.

     It is pleasant to note that the city of Blathersville is endeavoring
     to contract with some New York gentlemen to pave its well-nigh
     impassable streets with the Nicholson pavement.  The Daily Hurrah
     urges the measure with ability, and seems confident of ultimate
     success.

I passed my manuscript over to the chief editor for acceptance,
alteration, or destruction.  He glanced at it and his face clouded.  He
ran his eye down the pages, and his countenance grew portentous.  It was
easy to see that something was wrong.  Presently he sprang up and said:

"Thunder and lightning! Do you suppose I am going to speak of those
cattle that way?  Do you suppose my subscribers are going to stand such
gruel as that?  Give me the pen!"

I never saw a pen scrape and scratch its way so viciously, or plow
through another man's verbs and adjectives so relentlessly.  While he was
in the midst of his work, somebody shot at him through the open window,
and marred the symmetry of my ear.

"Ah," said he, "that is that scoundrel Smith, of the Moral Volcano--he
was due yesterday."  And he snatched a navy revolver from his belt and
fired--Smith dropped, shot in the thigh.  The shot spoiled Smith's aim,
who was just taking a second chance and he crippled a stranger.  It was
me.  Merely a finger shot off.

Then the chief editor went on with his erasure; and interlineations.
Just as he finished them a hand grenade came down the stove-pipe, and the
explosion shivered the stove into a thousand fragments.  However, it did
no further damage, except that a vagrant piece knocked a couple of my
teeth out.

"That stove is utterly ruined," said the chief editor.

I said I believed it was.

"Well, no matter--don't want it this kind of weather.  I know the man
that did it.  I'll get him.  Now, here is the way this stuff ought to be
written."

I took the manuscript.  It was scarred with erasures and interlineations
till its mother wouldn't have known it if it had had one.  It now read as
follows:

                    SPIRIT OF THE TENNESSEE PRESS

     The inveterate liars of the Semi-Weekly Earthquake are evidently
     endeavoring to palm off upon a noble and chivalrous people another
     of their vile and brutal falsehoods with regard to that most
     glorious conception of the nineteenth century, the Ballyhack
     railroad.  The idea that Buzzardville was to be left off at one side
     originated in their own fulsome brains--or rather in the settlings
     which they regard as brains.  They had better, swallow this lie if
     they want to save their abandoned reptile carcasses the cowhiding
     they so richly deserve.

     That ass, Blossom, of the Higginsville Thunderbolt and Battle Cry of
     Freedom, is down here again sponging at the Van Buren.

     We observe that the besotted blackguard of the Mud Springs Morning
     Howl is giving out, with his usual propensity for lying, that Van
     Werter is not elected.  The heaven-born mission of journalism is to
     disseminate truth; to eradicate error; to educate, refine, and
     elevate the tone of public morals and manners, and make all men more
     gentle, more virtuous, more charitable, and in all ways better, and
     holier, and happier; and yet this blackhearted scoundrel degrades
     his great office persistently to the dissemination of falsehood,
     calumny, vituperation, and vulgarity.

     Blathersville wants a Nicholson pavement--it wants a jail and a
     poorhouse more.  The idea of a pavement in a one-horse town composed
     of two gin-mills, a blacksmith shop, and that mustard-plaster of a
     newspaper, the Daily Hurrah!  The crawling insect, Buckner, who
     edits the Hurrah, is braying about his business with his customary
     imbecility, and imagining that he is talking sense.


"Now that is the way to write--peppery and to the point.  Mush-and-milk
journalism gives me the fan-tods."

About this time a brick came through the window with a splintering crash,
and gave me a considerable of a jolt in the back.  I moved out of range
--I began to feel in the way.

The chief said, "That was the Colonel, likely.  I've been expecting him
for two days.  He will be up now right away."

He was correct.  The Colonel appeared in the door a moment afterward with
a dragoon revolver in his hand.

He said, "Sir, have I the honor of addressing the poltroon who edits this
mangy sheet?"

"You have.  Be seated, sir.  Be careful of the chair, one of its legs is
gone.  I believe I have the honor of addressing the putrid liar, Colonel
Blatherskite Tecumseh?"

"Right, Sir.  I have a little account to settle with you.  If you are at
leisure we will begin."

"I have an article on the 'Encouraging Progress of Moral and Intellectual
Development in America' to finish, but there is no hurry.  Begin."

Both pistols rang out their fierce clamor at the same instant.  The chief
lost a lock of his hair, and the Colonel's bullet ended its career in the
fleshy part of my thigh.  The Colonel's left shoulder was clipped a
little.  They fired again.  Both missed their men this time, but I got my
share, a shot in the arm.  At the third fire both gentlemen were wounded
slightly, and I had a knuckle chipped.  I then said, I believed I would
go out and take a walk, as this was a private matter, and I had a
delicacy about participating in it further.  But both gentlemen begged me
to keep my seat, and assured me that I was not in the way.

They then talked about the elections and the crops while they reloaded,
and I fell to tying up my wounds.  But presently they opened fire again
with animation, and every shot took effect--but it is proper to remark
that five out of the six fell to my share.  The sixth one mortally
wounded the Colonel, who remarked, with fine humor, that he would have to
say good morning now, as he had business uptown.  He then inquired the
way to the undertaker's and left.

The chief turned to me and said, "I am expecting company to dinner, and
shall have to get ready.  It will be a favor to me if you will read proof
and attend to the customers."

I winced a little at the idea of attending to the customers, but I was
too bewildered by the fusillade that was still ringing in my ears to
think of anything to say.

He continued, "Jones will be here at three--cowhide him.  Gillespie will
call earlier, perhaps--throw him out of the window.  Ferguson will be
along about four--kill him.  That is all for today, I believe.  If you
have any odd time, you may write a blistering article on the police--give
the chief inspector rats.  The cowhides are under the table; weapons in
the drawer--ammunition there in the corner--lint and bandages up there in
the pigeonholes.  In case of accident, go to Lancet, the surgeon,
downstairs.  He advertises--we take it out in trade."

He was gone.  I shuddered.  At the end of the next three hours I had been
through perils so awful that all peace of mind and all cheerfulness were
gone from me.  Gillespie had called and thrown me out of the window.
Jones arrived promptly, and when I got ready to do the cowhiding he took
the job off my hands.  In an encounter with a stranger, not in the bill
of fare, I had lost my scalp.  Another stranger, by the name of Thompson,
left me a mere wreck and ruin of chaotic rags.  And at last, at bay in
the corner, and beset by an infuriated mob of editors, blacklegs,
politicians, and desperadoes, who raved and swore and flourished their
weapons about my head till the air shimmered with glancing flashes of
steel, I was in the act of resigning my berth on the paper when the chief
arrived, and with him a rabble of charmed and enthusiastic friends.  Then
ensued a scene of riot and carnage such as no human pen, or steel one
either, could describe.  People were shot, probed, dismembered, blown up,
thrown out of the window.  There was a brief tornado of murky blasphemy,
with a confused and frantic war-dance glimmering through it, and then all
was over.  In five minutes there was silence, and the gory chief and I
sat alone and surveyed the sanguinary ruin that strewed the floor around
us.

He said, "You'll like this place when you get used to it."

I said, "I'll have to get you to excuse me; I think maybe I might write
to suit you after a while; as soon as I had had some practice and learned
the language I am confident I could.  But, to speak the plain truth, that
sort of energy of expression has its inconveniences, and a, man is liable
to interruption.

"You see that yourself.  Vigorous writing is calculated to elevate the
public, no doubt, but then I do not like to attract so much attention as
it calls forth.  I can't write with comfort when I am interrupted so much
as I have been to-day.  I like this berth well enough, but I don't like
to be left here to wait on the customers.  The experiences are novel,
I grant you, and entertaining, too, after a fashion, but they are not
judiciously distributed.  A gentleman shoots at you through the window
and cripples me; a bombshell comes down the stovepipe for your
gratification and sends the stove door down my throat; a friend drops in
to swap compliments with you, and freckles me with bullet-holes till my
skin won't hold my principles; you go to dinner, and Jones comes with his
cowhide, Gillespie throws me out of the window, Thompson tears all my
clothes off, and an entire stranger takes my scalp with the easy freedom
of an old acquaintance; and in less than five minutes all the blackguards
in the country arrive in their war-paint, and proceed to scare the rest
of me to death with their tomahawks.  Take it altogether, I never had
such a spirited time in all my life as I have had to-day.  No; I like
you, and I like your calm unruffled way of explaining things to the
customers, but you see I am not used to it.  The Southern heart is too
impulsive; Southern hospitality is too lavish with the stranger.  The
paragraphs which I have written to-day, and into whose cold sentences
your masterly hand has infused the fervent spirit of Tennesseean
journalism, will wake up another nest of hornets.  All that mob of
editors will come--and they will come hungry, too, and want somebody for
breakfast.  I shall have to bid you adieu.  I decline to be present at
these festivities.  I came South for my health, I will go back on the
same errand, and suddenly.  Tennesseean journalism is too stirring for
me."

After which we parted with mutual regret, and I took apartments at the
hospital.






THE STORY OF THE BAD LITTLE BOY--[Written about 1865]

Once there was a bad little boy whose name was Jim--though, if you will
notice, you will find that bad little boys are nearly always called James
in your Sunday-school books.  It was strange, but still it was true, that
this one was called Jim.

He didn't have any sick mother, either--a sick mother who was pious and
had the consumption, and would be glad to lie down in the grave and be at
rest but for the strong love she bore her boy, and the anxiety she felt
that the world might be harsh and cold toward him when she was gone.
Most bad boys in the Sunday books are named James, and have sick mothers,
who teach them to say, "Now, I lay me down," etc., and sing them to sleep
with sweet, plaintive voices, and then kiss them good night, and kneel
down by the bedside and weep.  But it was different with this fellow.
He was named Jim, and there wasn't anything the matter with his mother
--no consumption, nor anything of that kind.  She was rather stout than
otherwise, and she was not pious; moreover, she was not anxious on Jim's
account.  She said if he were to break his neck it wouldn't be much loss.
She always spanked Jim to sleep, and she never kissed him good night; on
the contrary, she boxed his ears when she was ready to leave him.

Once this little bad boy stole the key of the pantry, and slipped in
there and helped himself to some jam, and filled up the vessel with tar,
so that his mother would never know the difference; but all at once a
terrible feeling didn't come over him, and something didn't seem to
whisper to him, "Is it right to disobey my mother?  Isn't it sinful to do
this?  Where do bad little boys go who gobble up their good kind mother's
jam?" and then he didn't kneel down all alone and promise never to be
wicked any more, and rise up with a light, happy heart, and go and tell
his mother all about it, and beg her forgiveness, and be blessed by her
with tears of pride and thankfulness in her eyes.  No; that is the way
with all other bad boys in the books; but it happened otherwise with this
Jim, strangely enough.  He ate that jam, and said it was bully, in his
sinful, vulgar way; and he put in the tar, and said that was bully also,
and laughed, and observed "that the old woman would get up and snort"
when she found it out; and when she did find it out, he denied knowing
anything about it, and she whipped him severely, and he did the crying
himself.  Everything about this boy was curious--everything turned out
differently with him from the way it does to the bad Jameses in the
books.

Once he climbed up in Farmer Acorn's apple tree to steal apples, and the
limb didn't break, and he didn't fall and break his arm, and get torn by
the farmer's great dog, and then languish on a sickbed for weeks, and
repent and become good.  Oh, no; he stole as many apples as he wanted and
came down all right; and he was all ready for the dog, too, and knocked
him endways with a brick when he came to tear him.  It was very strange
--nothing like it ever happened in those mild little books with marbled
backs, and with pictures in them of men with swallow-tailed coats and
bell-crowned hats, and pantaloons that are short in the legs, and women
with the waists of their dresses under their arms, and no hoops on.
Nothing like it in any of the Sunday-school books.

Once he stole the teacher's penknife, and, when he was afraid it would be
found out and he would get whipped, he slipped it into George Wilson's
cap poor Widow Wilson's son, the moral boy, the good little boy of the
village, who always obeyed his mother, and never told an untruth, and was
fond of his lessons, and infatuated with Sunday-school.  And when the
knife dropped from the cap, and poor George hung his head and blushed,
as if in conscious guilt, and the grieved teacher charged the theft upon
him, and was just in the very act of bringing the switch down upon his
trembling shoulders, a white-haired, improbable justice of the peace did
not suddenly appear in their midst, and strike an attitude and say,
"Spare this noble boy--there stands the cowering culprit!  I was passing
the school door at recess, and, unseen myself, I saw the theft
committed!"  And then Jim didn't get whaled, and the venerable justice
didn't read the tearful school a homily, and take George by the hand and
say such boy deserved to be exalted, and then tell him come and make his
home with him, and sweep out the office, and make fires, and run errands,
and chop wood, and study law, and help his wife do household labors, and
have all the balance of the time to play and get forty cents a month, and
be happy.  No it would have happened that way in the books, but didn't
happen that way to Jim.  No meddling old clam of a justice dropped in to
make trouble, and so the model boy George got thrashed, and Jim was glad
of it because, you know, Jim hated moral boys.  Jim said he was "down on
them milksops."  Such was the coarse language of this bad, neglected boy.

But the strangest thing that ever happened to Jim was the time he went
boating on Sunday, and didn't get drowned, and that other time that he
got caught out in the storm when he was fishing on Sunday and didn't get
struck by lightning.  Why, you might look, and look, all through the
Sunday-school books from now till next Christmas, and you would never
come across anything like this.  Oh, no; you would find that all the bad
boys who go boating on Sunday invariably get drowned; and all the bad
boys who get caught out in storms when they are fishing on Sunday
infallibly get struck by lightning.  Boats with bad boys in them always
upset on Sunday, and it always storms when bad boys go fishing on the
Sabbath.  How this Jim ever escaped is a  mystery to me.

This Jim bore a charmed life--that must have been the way of it.  Nothing
could hurt him.  He even gave the elephant in the menagerie a plug of
tobacco, and the elephant didn't knock the top of his head off with his
trunk.  He browsed around the cupboard after essence-of peppermint, and
didn't make a mistake and drink aqua fortis.  He stole his father's gun
and went hunting on the Sabbath, and didn't shoot three or four of his
fingers off.  He struck his little sister on the temple with his fist
when he was angry, and she didn't linger in pain through long summer
days, and die with sweet words of forgiveness upon her lips that
redoubled the anguish of his breaking heart.  No; she got over it.  He
ran off and went to sea at last, and didn't come back and find himself
sad and alone in the world, his loved ones sleeping in the quiet
churchyard, and the vine-embowered home of his boyhood tumbled down and
gone to decay.  Ah, no; he came home as drunk as a piper, and got into
the station-house the first thing.

And he grew up and married, and raised a large family, and brained them
all with an ax one night, and got wealthy by all manner of cheating and
rascality; and now he is the infernalest wickedest scoundrel in his
native village, and is universally respected, and belongs to the
legislature.

So you see there never was a bad James in the Sunday-school books that
had such a streak of luck as this sinful Jim with the charmed life.






THE STORY OF THE GOOD LITTLE BOY--[Written about 1865]

Once there was a good little boy by the name of Jacob Blivens.  He always
obeyed his parents, no matter how absurd and unreasonable their demands
were; and he always learned his book, and never was late at
Sabbath-school.  He would not play hookey, even when his sober judgment
told him it was the most profitable thing he could do.  None of the other
boys could ever make that boy out, he acted so strangely.  He wouldn't
lie, no matter how convenient it was.  He just said it was wrong to lie,
and that was sufficient for him.  And he was so honest that he was simply
ridiculous.  The curious ways that that Jacob had, surpassed everything.
He wouldn't play marbles on Sunday, he wouldn't rob birds' nests, he
wouldn't give hot pennies to organ-grinders' monkeys; he didn't seem to
take any interest in any kind of rational amusement.  So the other boys
used to try to reason it out and come to an understanding of him, but
they couldn't arrive at any satisfactory conclusion.  As I said before,
they could only figure out a sort of vague idea that he was "afflicted,"
and so they took him under their protection, and never allowed any harm
to come to him.

This good little boy read all the Sunday-school books; they were his
greatest delight.  This was the whole secret of it.  He believed in the
good little boys they put in the Sunday-school book; he had every
confidence in them.  He longed to come across one of them alive once;
but he never did.  They all died before his time, maybe.  Whenever he
read about a particularly good one he turned over quickly to the end to
see what became of him, because he wanted to travel thousands of miles
and gaze on him; but it wasn't any use; that good little boy always died
in the last chapter, and there was a picture of the funeral, with all his
relations and the Sunday-school children standing around the grave in
pantaloons that were too short, and bonnets that were too large, and
everybody crying into handkerchiefs that had as much as a yard and a half
of stuff in them.  He was always headed off in this way.  He never could
see one of those good little boys on account of his always dying in the
last chapter.

Jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday school book.  He wanted
to be put in, with pictures representing him gloriously declining to lie
to his mother, and her weeping for joy about it; and pictures
representing him standing on the doorstep giving a penny to a poor
beggar-woman with six children, and telling her to spend it freely, but
not to be extravagant, because extravagance is a sin; and pictures of him
magnanimously refusing to tell on the bad boy who always lay in wait for
him around the corner as he came from school, and welted him so over the
head with a lath, and then chased him home, saying, "Hi! hi!" as he
proceeded.  That was the ambition of young Jacob Blivens.  He wished to
be put in a Sunday-school book.  It made him feel a lithe uncomfortable
sometimes when he reflected that the good little boys always died.  He
loved to live, you know, and this was the most unpleasant feature about
being a Sunday-school-boo boy.  He knew it was not healthy to be good.
He knew it was more fatal than consumption to be so supernaturally good
as the boys in the books were he knew that none of them had ever been
able to stand it long, and it pained him to think that if they put him in
a book he wouldn't ever see it, or even if they did get the book out
before he died it wouldn't be popular without any picture of his funeral
in the back part of it.  It couldn't be much of a Sunday-school book that
couldn't tell about the advice he gave to the community when he was
dying.  So at last, of course, he had to make up his mind to do the best
he could under the circumstances--to live right, and hang on as long as
he could and have his dying speech all ready when his time came.

But somehow nothing ever went right with the good little boy; nothing
ever turned out with him the way it turned out with the good little boys
in the books.  They always had a good time, and the bad boys had the
broken legs; but in his case there was a screw loose somewhere, and it
all happened just the other way.  When he found Jim Blake stealing
apples, and went under the tree to read to him about the bad little boy
who fell out of a neighbor's apple tree and broke his arm, Jim fell out
of the tree, too, but he fell on him and broke his arm, and Jim wasn't
hurt at all.  Jacob couldn't understand that.  There wasn't anything in
the books like it.

And once, when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in the mud, and
Jacob ran to help him up and receive his blessing, the blind man did not
give him any blessing at all, but whacked him over the head with his
stick and said he would like to catch him shoving him again, and then
pretending to help him up.  This was not in accordance with any of the
books.  Jacob looked them all over to see.

One thing that Jacob wanted to do was to find a lame dog that hadn't any
place to stay, and was hungry and persecuted, and bring him home and pet
him and have that dog's imperishable gratitude.  And at last he found one
and was happy; and he brought him home and fed him, but when he was going
to pet him the dog flew at him and tore all the clothes off him except
those that were in front, and made a spectacle of him that was
astonishing.  He examined authorities, but he could not understand the
matter.  It was of the same breed of dogs that was in the books, but it
acted very differently.  Whatever this boy did he got into trouble.  The
very things the boys in the books got rewarded for turned out to be about
the most unprofitable things he could invest in.

Once, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, he saw some bad boys
starting off pleasuring in a sailboat.  He was filled with consternation,
because he knew from his reading that boys who went sailing on Sunday
invariably got drowned.  So he ran out on a raft to warn them, but a log
turned with him and slid him into the river.  A man got him out pretty
soon, and the doctor pumped the water out of him, and gave him a fresh
start with his bellows, but he caught cold and lay sick abed nine weeks.
But the most unaccountable thing about it was that the bad boys in the
boat had a good time all day, and then reached home alive and well in the
most surprising manner.  Jacob Blivens said there was nothing like these
things in the books.  He was perfectly dumfounded.

When he got well he was a little discouraged, but he resolved to keep on
trying anyhow.  He knew that so far his experiences wouldn't do to go in
a book, but he hadn't yet reached the allotted term of life for good
little boys, and he hoped to be able to make a record yet if he could
hold on till his time was fully up.  If everything else failed he had his
dying speech to fall back on.

He examined his authorities, and found that it was now time for him to go
to sea as a cabin-boy.  He called on a ship-captain and made his
application, and when the captain asked for his recommendations he
proudly drew out a tract and pointed to the word, "To Jacob Blivens, from
his affectionate teacher."  But the captain was a coarse, vulgar man, and
he said, "Oh, that be blowed! that wasn't any proof that he knew how to
wash dishes or handle a slush-bucket, and he guessed he didn't want him."
This was altogether the most extraordinary thing that ever happened to
Jacob in all his life.  A compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had
never failed to move the tenderest emotions of ship-captains, and open
the way to all offices of honor and profit in their gift it never had in
any book that ever he had read.  He could hardly believe his senses.

This boy always had a hard time of it.  Nothing ever came out according
to the authorities with him.  At last, one day, when he was around
hunting up bad little boys to admonish, he found a lot of them in the old
iron-foundry fixing up a little joke on fourteen or fifteen dogs, which
they had tied together in long procession, and were going to ornament
with empty nitroglycerin cans made fast to their tails.  Jacob's heart
was touched.  He sat down on one of those cans (for he never minded
grease when duty was before him), and he took hold of the foremost dog by
the collar, and turned his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones.  But just
at that moment Alderman McWelter, full of wrath, stepped in.  All the bad
boys ran away, but Jacob Blivens rose in conscious innocence and began
one of those stately little Sunday-school-book speeches which always
commence with "Oh, sir!" in dead opposition to the fact that no boy, good
or bad, ever starts a remark with "Oh, sir."  But the alderman never
waited to hear the rest.  He took Jacob Blivens by the ear and turned him
around, and hit him a whack in the rear with the flat of his hand; and in
an instant that good little boy shot out through the roof and soared away
toward the sun with the fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing after
him like the tail of a kite.  And there wasn't a sign of that alderman or
that old iron-foundry left on the face of the earth; and, as for young
Jacob Blivens, he never got a chance to make his last dying speech after
all his trouble fixing it up, unless he made it to the birds; because,
although the bulk of him came down all right in a tree-top in an
adjoining county, the rest of him was apportioned around among four
townships, and so they had to hold five inquests on him to find out
whether he was dead or not, and how it occurred.  You never saw a boy
scattered so.--[This glycerin catastrophe is borrowed from a floating
newspaper item, whose author's name I would give if I knew it.--M. T.]

Thus perished the good little boy who did the best he could, but didn't
come out according to the books.  Every boy who ever did as he did
prospered except him.  His case is truly remarkable.  It will probably
never be accounted for.






A COUPLE OF POEMS BY TWAIN AND MOORE--[Written about 1865]


                         THOSE EVENING BELLS

                           BY THOMAS MOORE

               Those evening bells! those evening bells!
               How many a tale their music tells
               Of youth, and home, and that sweet time
               When last I heard their soothing chime.

               Those joyous hours are passed away;
               And many a heart that then was gay,
               Within the tomb now darkly dwells,
               And hears no more those evening bells.

               And so 'twill be when I am gone
               That tuneful peal will still ring on;
               While other bards shall walk these dells,
               And sing your praise, sweet evening bells.


                         THOSE ANNUAL BILLS

                           BY MARK TWAIN

               These annual bills! these annual bills!
               How many a song their discord trills
               Of "truck" consumed, enjoyed, forgot,
               Since I was skinned by last year's lot!

               Those joyous beans are passed away;
               Those onions blithe, O where are they?
               Once loved, lost, mourned--now vexing ILLS
               Your shades troop back in annual bills!

               And so 'twill be when I'm aground
               These yearly duns will still go round,
               While other bards, with frantic quills,
               Shall damn and damn these annual bills!






NIAGARA [ Written about 1871.]

Niagara Falls is a most enjoyable place of resort.  The hotels are
excellent, and the prices not at all exorbitant.  The opportunities for
fishing are not surpassed in the country; in fact, they are not even
equaled elsewhere.  Because, in other localities, certain places in the
streams are much better than others; but at Niagara one place is just as
good as another, for the reason that the fish do not bite anywhere, and
so there is no use in your walking five miles to fish, when you can
depend on being just as unsuccessful nearer home.  The advantages of this
state of things have never heretofore been properly placed before the
public.

The weather is cool in summer, and the walks and drives are all pleasant
and none of them fatiguing.  When you start out to "do" the Falls you
first drive down about a mile, and pay a small sum for the privilege of
looking down from a precipice into the narrowest part of the Niagara
River.  A railway "cut" through a hill would be as comely if it had the
angry river tumbling and foaming through its bottom.  You can descend a
staircase here a hundred and fifty feet down, and stand at the edge of
the water.  After you have done it, you will wonder why you did it; but
you will then be too late.

The guide will explain to you, in his blood-curdling way, how he saw the
little steamer, Maid of the Mist, descend the fearful rapids--how first
one paddle-box was out of sight behind the raging billows and then the
other, and at what point it was that her smokestack toppled overboard,
and where her planking began to break and part asunder--and how she did
finally live through the trip, after accomplishing the incredible feat of
traveling seventeen miles in six minutes, or six miles in seventeen
minutes, I have really forgotten which.  But it was very extraordinary,
anyhow.  It is worth the price of admission to hear the guide tell the
story nine times in succession to different parties, and never miss a
word or alter a sentence or a gesture.

Then you drive over to Suspension Bridge, and divide your misery between
the chances of smashing down two hundred feet into the river below, and
the chances of having the railway-train overhead smashing down onto you.
Either possibility is discomforting taken by itself, but, mixed together,
they amount in the aggregate to positive unhappiness.

On the Canada side you drive along the chasm between long ranks of
photographers standing guard behind their cameras, ready to make an
ostentatious frontispiece of you and your decaying ambulance, and your
solemn crate with a hide on it, which you are expected to regard in the
light of a horse, and a diminished and unimportant background of sublime
Niagara; and a great many people have the incredible effrontery or the
native depravity to aid and abet this sort of crime.

Any day, in the hands of these photographers, you may see stately
pictures of papa and mamma, Johnny and Bub and Sis or a couple of country
cousins, all smiling vacantly, and all disposed in studied and
uncomfortable attitudes in their carriage, and all looming up in their
awe-inspiring imbecility before the snubbed and diminished presentment of
that majestic presence whose ministering spirits are the rainbows, whose
voice is the thunder, whose awful front is veiled in clouds, who was
monarch here dead and forgotten ages before this sackful of small
reptiles was deemed temporarily necessary to fill a crack in the world's
unnoted myriads, and will still be monarch here ages and decades of ages
after they shall have gathered themselves to their blood-relations, the
other worms, and been mingled with the unremembering dust.

There is no actual harm in making Niagara a background whereon to display
one's marvelous insignificance in a good strong light, but it requires a
sort of superhuman self-complacency to enable one to do it.

When you have examined the stupendous Horseshoe Fall till you are
satisfied you cannot improve on it, you return to America by the new
Suspension Bridge, and follow up the bank to where they exhibit the Cave
of the Winds.

Here I followed instructions, and divested myself of all my clothing, and
put on a waterproof jacket and overalls.  This costume is picturesque,
but not beautiful.  A guide, similarly dressed, led the way down a flight
of winding stairs, which wound and wound, and still kept on winding long
after the thing ceased to be a novelty, and then terminated long before
it had begun to be a pleasure.  We were then well down under the
precipice, but still considerably above the level of the river.

We now began to creep along flimsy bridges of a single plank, our persons
shielded from destruction by a crazy wooden railing, to which I clung
with both hands--not because I was afraid, but because I wanted to.
Presently the descent became steeper and the bridge flimsier, and sprays
from the American Fall began to rain down on us in fast increasing sheets
that soon became blinding, and after that our progress was mostly in the
nature of groping.  Nova a furious wind began to rush out from behind the
waterfall, which seemed determined to sweep us from the bridge, and
scatter us on the rocks and among the torrents below.  I remarked that I
wanted to go home; but it was too late.  We were almost under the
monstrous wall of water thundering down from above, and speech was in
vain in the midst of such a pitiless crash of sound.

In another moment the guide disappeared behind the deluge, and bewildered
by the thunder, driven helplessly by the wind, and smitten by the arrowy
tempest of rain, I followed.  All was darkness.  Such a mad storming,
roaring, and bellowing of warring wind and water never crazed my ears
before.  I bent my head, and seemed to receive the Atlantic on my back.
The world seemed going to destruction.  I could not see anything, the
flood poured down savagely.  I raised my head, with open mouth, and the
most of the American cataract went down my throat.  If I had sprung a
leak now I had been lost.  And at this moment I discovered that the
bridge had ceased, and we must trust for a foothold to the slippery and
precipitous rocks.  I never was so scared before and survived it.  But we
got through at last, and emerged into the open day, where we could stand
in front of the laced and frothy and seething world of descending water,
and look at it.  When I saw how much of it there was, and how fearfully
in earnest it was, I was sorry I had gone behind it.

The noble Red Man has always been a friend and darling of mine.  I love
to read about him in tales and legends and romances.  I love to read of
his inspired sagacity, and his love of the wild free life of mountain and
forest, and his general nobility of character, and his stately
metaphorical manner of speech, and his chivalrous love for the dusky
maiden, and the picturesque pomp of his dress and accoutrements.
Especially the picturesque pomp of his dress and accoutrements.  When I
found the shops at Niagara Falls full of dainty Indian beadwork, and
stunning moccasins, and equally stunning toy figures representing human
beings who carried their weapons in holes bored through their arms and
bodies, and had feet shaped like a pie, I was filled with emotion.
I knew that now, at last, I was going to come face to face with the noble
Red Man.

A lady clerk in a shop told me, indeed, that all her grand array of
curiosities were made by the Indians, and that they were plenty about the
Falls, and that they were friendly, and it would not be dangerous to
speak to them.  And sure enough, as I approached the bridge leading over
to Luna Island, I came upon a noble Son of the Forest sitting under a
tree, diligently at work on a bead reticule.  He wore a slouch hat and
brogans, and had a short black pipe in his mouth.  Thus does the baneful
contact with our effeminate civilization dilute the picturesque pomp
which is so natural to the Indian when far removed from us in his native
haunts.  I addressed the relic as follows:

"Is the Wawhoo-Wang-Wang of the Whack-a-Whack happy?  Does the great
Speckled Thunder sigh for the war-path, or is his heart contented with
dreaming of the dusky maiden, the Pride of the Forest?  Does the mighty
Sachem yearn to drink the blood of his enemies, or is he satisfied to
make bead reticules for the pappooses of the paleface?  Speak, sublime
relic of bygone grandeur--venerable ruin, speak!"

The relic said:

"An' is it mesilf, Dennis Hooligan, that ye'd be takon' for a dirty
Injin, ye drawlin', lantern-jawed, spider-legged divil!  By the piper
that played before Moses, I'll ate ye!"

I went away from there.

By and by, in the neighborhood of the Terrapin Tower, I came upon a
gentle daughter of the aborigines in fringed and beaded buckskin
moccasins and leggins, seated on a bench with her pretty wares about her.
She had just carved out a wooden chief that had a strong family
resemblance to a clothes-pin, and was now boring a hole through his
abdomen to put his bow through.  I hesitated a moment, and then addressed
her:

"Is the heart of the forest maiden heavy?  Is the Laughing Tadpole
lonely?  Does she mourn over the extinguished council-fires of her race,
and the vanished glory of her ancestors?  Or does her sad spirit wander
afar toward the hunting-grounds whither her brave Gobbler-of-the-
Lightnings is gone?  Why is my daughter silent?  Has she ought against
the paleface stranger?"

The maiden said:

"Faix, an' is it Biddy Malone ye dare to be callin' names?  Lave this, or
I'll shy your lean carcass over the cataract, ye sniveling blaggard!"

I adjourned from there also.

"Confound these Indians!" I said.  "They told me they were tame; but, if
appearances go for anything, I should say they were all on the warpath."

I made one more attempt to fraternize with them, and only one.  I came
upon a camp of them gathered in the shade of a great tree, making wampum
and moccasins, and addressed them in the language of friendship:

"Noble Red Men, Braves, Grand Sachems, War Chiefs, Squaws, and High
Muck-a-Mucks, the paleface from the land of the setting sun greets you!
You, Beneficent Polecat--you, Devourer of Mountains--you, Roaring
Thundergust --you, Bully Boy with a Glass eye--the paleface from beyond
the great waters greets you all! War and pestilence have thinned your
ranks and destroyed your once proud nation.  Poker and seven-up, and a
vain modern expense for soap, unknown to your glorious ancestors, have
depleted your purses.  Appropriating, in your simplicity, the property of
others has gotten you into trouble.  Misrepresenting facts, in your
simple innocence, has damaged your reputation with the soulless usurper.
Trading for forty-rod whisky, to enable you to get drunk and happy and
tomahawk your families, has played the everlasting mischief with the
picturesque pomp of your dress, and here you are, in the broad light of
the nineteenth century, gotten up like the ragtag and bobtail of the
purlieus of New York.  For shame!  Remember your ancestors!  Recall their
mighty deeds!  Remember Uncas!--and Red jacket! and Hole in the Day!--and
Whoopdedoodledo!  Emulate their achievements!  Unfurl yourselves under my
banner, noble savages, illustrious guttersnipes--"

"Down wid him!"  "Scoop the blaggard!"  "Burn him!"  "Bang him!"
"Dhround him!"

It was the quickest operation that ever was.  I simply saw a sudden flash
in the air of clubs, brickbats, fists, bead-baskets, and moccasins--a
single flash, and they all appeared to hit me at once, and no two of them
in the same place.  In the next instant the entire tribe was upon me.
They tore half the clothes off me; they broke my arms and legs; they gave
me a thump that dented the top of my head till it would hold coffee like
a saucer; and, to crown their disgraceful proceedings and add insult to
injury, they threw me over the Niagara Falls, and I got wet.

About ninety or a hundred feet from the top, the remains of my vest
caught on a projecting rock, and I was almost drowned before I could get
loose.  I finally fell, and brought up in a world of white foam at the
foot of the Fall, whose celled and bubbly masses towered up several
inches above my head.  Of course I got into the eddy.  I sailed round and
round in it forty-four times--chasing a chip and gaining on it--each
round trip a half-mile--reaching for the same bush on the bank forty-four
times, and just exactly missing it by a hair's-breadth every time.

At last a man walked down and sat down close to that bush, and put a pipe
in his mouth, and lit a match, and followed me with one eye and kept the
other on the match, while he sheltered it in his hands from the wind.
Presently a puff of wind blew it out.  The next time I swept around he
said:

"Got a match?"

"Yes; in my other vest.  Help me out, please."

"Not for Joe."

When I came round again, I said:

"Excuse the seemingly impertinent curiosity of a drowning man, but will
you explain this singular conduct of yours?"

"With pleasure.  I am the coroner.  Don't hurry on my account.  I can
wait for you.  But I wish I had a match."

I said: "Take my place, and I'll go and get you one."

He declined.  This lack of confidence on his part created a coldness
between us, and from that time forward I avoided him.  It was my idea,
in case anything happened to me, to so time the occurrence as to throw my
custom into the hands of the opposition coroner on the American side.

At last a policeman came along, and arrested me for disturbing the peace
by yelling at people on shore for help.  The judge fined me, but had the
advantage of him.  My money was with my pantaloons, and my pantaloons
were with the Indians.

Thus I escaped.  I am now lying in a very critical condition.  At least I
am lying anyway---critical or not critical.  I am hurt all over, but I
cannot tell the full extent yet, because the doctor is not done taking
inventory.  He will make out my manifest this evening.  However, thus far
he thinks only sixteen of my wounds are fatal.  I don't mind the others.

Upon regaining my right mind, I said:

"It is an awful savage tribe of Indians that do the beadwork and
moccasins for Niagara Falls, doctor.  Where are they from?"

"Limerick, my son."

PREFACE


Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two
were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates
of mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an
individual—he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom
I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.

The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and
slaves in the West at the period of this story—that is to say, thirty or
forty years ago.

Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and
girls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account,
for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what
they once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked,
and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.

THE AUTHOR.

HARTFORD, 1876.




CHAPTER I


“Tom!”

No answer.

“TOM!”

No answer.

“What’s gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!”

No answer.

The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the
room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or
never looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were
her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for “style,” not
service—she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.
She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but
still loud enough for the furniture to hear:

“Well, I lay if I get hold of you I’ll—”

She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching
under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the
punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.

“I never did see the beat of that boy!”

She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the
tomato vines and “jimpson” weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So
she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:

“Y-o-u-u TOM!”

There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize
a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.

“There! I might ’a’ thought of that closet. What you been doing in
there?”

“Nothing.”

“Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that
truck?”

“I don’t know, aunt.”

“Well, I know. It’s jam—that’s what it is. Forty times I’ve said if you
didn’t let that jam alone I’d skin you. Hand me that switch.”

The switch hovered in the air—the peril was desperate—

“My! Look behind you, aunt!”

The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.
The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and
disappeared over it.

His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle
laugh.

“Hang the boy, can’t I never learn anything? Ain’t he played me tricks
enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old
fools is the biggest fools there is. Can’t learn an old dog new tricks,
as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,
and how is a body to know what’s coming? He ’pears to know just how long
he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make
out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it’s all down again and
I can’t hit him a lick. I ain’t doing my duty by that boy, and that’s
the Lord’s truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as
the Good Book says. I’m a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I
know. He’s full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he’s my own dead
sister’s boy, poor thing, and I ain’t got the heart to lash him,
somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and
every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is
born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says,
and I reckon it’s so. He’ll play hookey this evening,[*] and I’ll just
be obleeged to make him work, tomorrow, to punish him. It’s mighty hard
to make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he
hates work more than he hates anything else, and I’ve _got_ to do some
of my duty by him, or I’ll be the ruination of the child.”

[*] Southwestern for “afternoon”

Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home
barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day’s wood
and split the kindlings before supper—at least he was there in time
to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.
Tom’s younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through
with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,
and had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.

While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity
offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and
very deep—for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like
many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she
was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she
loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low
cunning. Said she:

“Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn’t it?”

“Yes’m.”

“Powerful warm, warn’t it?”

“Yes’m.”

“Didn’t you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?”

A bit of a scare shot through Tom—a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He
searched Aunt Polly’s face, but it told him nothing. So he said:

“No’m—well, not very much.”

The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom’s shirt, and said:

“But you ain’t too warm now, though.” And it flattered her to reflect
that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing
that that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew
where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:

“Some of us pumped on our heads—mine’s damp yet. See?”

Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of
circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new
inspiration:

“Tom, you didn’t have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to
pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!”

The trouble vanished out of Tom’s face. He opened his jacket. His shirt
collar was securely sewed.

“Bother! Well, go ’long with you. I’d made sure you’d played hookey
and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you’re a kind of a
singed cat, as the saying is—better’n you look. _This_ time.”

She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom
had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.

But Sidney said:

“Well, now, if I didn’t think you sewed his collar with white thread,
but it’s black.”

“Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!”

But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:

“Siddy, I’ll lick you for that.”

In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into
the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them—one needle
carried white thread and the other black. He said:

“She’d never noticed if it hadn’t been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes
she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to
gee-miny she’d stick to one or t’other—I can’t keep the run of ’em. But
I bet you I’ll lam Sid for that. I’ll learn him!”

He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well
though—and loathed him.

Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not
because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a
man’s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore
them down and drove them out of his mind for the time—just as men’s
misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new
interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired
from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. It
consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,
produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short
intervals in the midst of the music—the reader probably remembers how to
do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him
the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of
harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer
feels who has discovered a new planet—no doubt, as far as strong, deep,
unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the
astronomer.

The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom
checked his whistle. A stranger was before him—a boy a shade larger
than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an impressive
curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy
was well dressed, too—well dressed on a week-day. This was simply
astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth
roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes
on—and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of
ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom’s vitals. The
more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose
at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to
him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved—but only
sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the
time. Finally Tom said:

“I can lick you!”

“I’d like to see you try it.”

“Well, I can do it.”

“No you can’t, either.”

“Yes I can.”

“No you can’t.”

“I can.”

“You can’t.”

“Can!”

“Can’t!”

An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:

“What’s your name?”

“’Tisn’t any of your business, maybe.”

“Well I ’low I’ll _make_ it my business.”

“Well why don’t you?”

“If you say much, I will.”

“Much—much—_much_. There now.”

“Oh, you think you’re mighty smart, _don’t_ you? I could lick you with
one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.”

“Well why don’t you _do_ it? You _say_ you can do it.”

“Well I _will_, if you fool with me.”

“Oh yes—I’ve seen whole families in the same fix.”

“Smarty! You think you’re _some_, now, _don’t_ you? Oh, what a hat!”

“You can lump that hat if you don’t like it. I dare you to knock it
off—and anybody that’ll take a dare will suck eggs.”

“You’re a liar!”

“You’re another.”

“You’re a fighting liar and dasn’t take it up.”

“Aw—take a walk!”

“Say—if you give me much more of your sass I’ll take and bounce a rock
off’n your head.”

“Oh, of _course_ you will.”

“Well I _will_.”

“Well why don’t you _do_ it then? What do you keep _saying_ you will
for? Why don’t you _do_ it? It’s because you’re afraid.”

“I _ain’t_ afraid.”

“You are.”

“I ain’t.”

“You are.”

Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently
they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:

“Get away from here!”

“Go away yourself!”

“I won’t.”

“I won’t either.”

So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both
shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But
neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and
flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:

“You’re a coward and a pup. I’ll tell my big brother on you, and he can
thrash you with his little finger, and I’ll make him do it, too.”

“What do I care for your big brother? I’ve got a brother that’s bigger
than he is—and what’s more, he can throw him over that fence, too.”
 [Both brothers were imaginary.]

“That’s a lie.”

“_Your_ saying so don’t make it so.”

Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:

“I dare you to step over that, and I’ll lick you till you can’t stand
up. Anybody that’ll take a dare will steal sheep.”

The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:

“Now you said you’d do it, now let’s see you do it.”

“Don’t you crowd me now; you better look out.”

“Well, you _said_ you’d do it—why don’t you do it?”

“By jingo! for two cents I _will_ do it.”

The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out
with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys
were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and
for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other’s hair and
clothes, punched and scratched each other’s nose, and covered themselves
with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the
fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him
with his fists. “Holler ’nuff!” said he.

The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying—mainly from rage.

“Holler ’nuff!”—and the pounding went on.

At last the stranger got out a smothered “’Nuff!” and Tom let him up and
said:

“Now that’ll learn you. Better look out who you’re fooling with next
time.”

The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,
snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
threatening what he would do to Tom the “next time he caught him out.”
 To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and
as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it
and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like
an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he
lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the
enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the
window and declined. At last the enemy’s mother appeared, and called Tom
a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but
he said he “’lowed” to “lay” for that boy.

He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in
at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and
when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his
Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its
firmness.




CHAPTER II


Saturday morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and
fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if
the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in
every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom
and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond
the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far
enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.

Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a
long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and
a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board
fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a
burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost
plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant
whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed
fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at
the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from
the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom’s eyes, before, but
now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at
the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there
waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,
skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred
and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an
hour—and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:

“Say, Jim, I’ll fetch the water if you’ll whitewash some.”

Jim shook his head and said:

“Can’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an’ git dis water
an’ not stop foolin’ roun’ wid anybody. She say she spec’ Mars Tom gwine
to ax me to whitewash, an’ so she tole me go ’long an’ ’tend to my own
business—she ’lowed _she’d_ ’tend to de whitewashin’.”

“Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That’s the way she always talks.
Gimme the bucket—I won’t be gone only a a minute. _She_ won’t ever
know.”

“Oh, I dasn’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis she’d take an’ tar de head off’n me.
’Deed she would.”

“_She_! She never licks anybody—whacks ’em over the head with her
thimble—and who cares for that, I’d like to know. She talks awful, but
talk don’t hurt—anyways it don’t if she don’t cry. Jim, I’ll give you a
marvel. I’ll give you a white alley!”

Jim began to waver.

“White alley, Jim! And it’s a bully taw.”

“My! Dat’s a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I’s powerful
’fraid ole missis—”

“And besides, if you will I’ll show you my sore toe.”

Jim was only human—this attraction was too much for him. He put down
his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing
interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he
was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was
whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with
a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.

But Tom’s energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had
planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys
would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and
they would make a world of fun of him for having to work—the very
thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and
examined it—bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange
of _work_, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour
of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and
gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless
moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great,
magnificent inspiration.

He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in
sight presently—the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been
dreading. Ben’s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump—proof enough that his
heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and
giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned
ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As
he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned
far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp
and circumstance—for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered
himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and
engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own
hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:

“Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!” The headway ran almost out, and he
drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.

“Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!” His arms straightened and stiffened
down his sides.

“Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!
Chow!” His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles—for it was
representing a forty-foot wheel.

“Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!”
 The left hand began to describe circles.

“Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on
the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow!
Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! _lively_ now!
Come—out with your spring-line—what’re you about there! Take a turn
round that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now—let her
go! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH’T! S’H’T! SH’T!”
(trying the gauge-cocks).

Tom went on whitewashing—paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared
a moment and then said: “_Hi-Yi! You’re_ up a stump, ain’t you!”

No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then
he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as
before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom’s mouth watered for the
apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:

“Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?”

Tom wheeled suddenly and said:

“Why, it’s you, Ben! I warn’t noticing.”

“Say—I’m going in a-swimming, I am. Don’t you wish you could? But of
course you’d druther _work_—wouldn’t you? Course you would!”

Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:

“What do you call work?”

“Why, ain’t _that_ work?”

Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:

“Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain’t. All I know, is, it suits Tom
Sawyer.”

“Oh come, now, you don’t mean to let on that you _like_ it?”

The brush continued to move.

“Like it? Well, I don’t see why I oughtn’t to like it. Does a boy get a
chance to whitewash a fence every day?”

That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple.
Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth—stepped back to note the
effect—added a touch here and there—criticised the effect again—Ben
watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more
absorbed. Presently he said:

“Say, Tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.”

Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:

“No—no—I reckon it wouldn’t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly’s awful
particular about this fence—right here on the street, you know—but if it
was the back fence I wouldn’t mind and _she_ wouldn’t. Yes, she’s awful
particular about this fence; it’s got to be done very careful; I reckon
there ain’t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it
the way it’s got to be done.”

“No—is that so? Oh come, now—lemme just try. Only just a little—I’d let
_you_, if you was me, Tom.”

“Ben, I’d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly—well, Jim wanted to do
it, but she wouldn’t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn’t let
Sid. Now don’t you see how I’m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence
and anything was to happen to it—”

“Oh, shucks, I’ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say—I’ll give you
the core of my apple.”

“Well, here—No, Ben, now don’t. I’m afeard—”

“I’ll give you _all_ of it!”

Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his
heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the
sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,
dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more
innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every
little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time
Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for
a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in
for a dead rat and a string to swing it with—and so on, and so on, hour
after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a
poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in
wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part
of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool
cannon, a key that wouldn’t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a
glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,
six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a
dog-collar—but no dog—the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel,
and a dilapidated old window sash.

He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while—plenty of company—and
the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn’t run out of
whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.

Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He
had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it—namely,
that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary
to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and
wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have
comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is _obliged_ to do,
and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And
this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or
performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing
Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England
who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a
daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable
money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn
it into work and then they would resign.

The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place
in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to
report.




CHAPTER III


Tom presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an
open window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,
breakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer
air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing
murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her
knitting—for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her
lap. Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had
thought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at
seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He
said: “Mayn’t I go and play now, aunt?”

“What, a’ready? How much have you done?”

“It’s all done, aunt.”

“Tom, don’t lie to me—I can’t bear it.”

“I ain’t, aunt; it _is_ all done.”

Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for
herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of
Tom’s statement true. When she found the entire fence white-washed, and
not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a
streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She
said:

“Well, I never! There’s no getting round it, you can work when you’re a
mind to, Tom.” And then she diluted the compliment by adding, “But it’s
powerful seldom you’re a mind to, I’m bound to say. Well, go ’long and
play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I’ll tan you.”

She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took
him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,
along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat
took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.
And while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he “hooked” a
doughnut.

Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway
that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and
the air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a
hail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties
and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect,
and Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general
thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at
peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his
black thread and getting him into trouble.

Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the
back of his aunt’s cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach
of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the
village, where two “military” companies of boys had met for conflict,
according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these
armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two
great commanders did not condescend to fight in person—that being better
suited to the still smaller fry—but sat together on an eminence
and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through
aides-de-camp. Tom’s army won a great victory, after a long and
hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged,
the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the
necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and
marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.

As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new
girl in the garden—a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow
hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered
pantalettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A
certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a
memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction;
he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor
little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had
confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest
boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time
she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is
done.

He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had
discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and
began to “show off” in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win
her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time;
but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic
performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending
her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it,
grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a
moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great
sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up,
right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she
disappeared.

The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and
then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as
if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.
Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his
nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side,
in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his
bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped
away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a
minute—only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next
his heart—or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in
anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.

He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, “showing
off,” as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom
comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some
window, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode
home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.

All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered “what
had got into the child.” He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and
did not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his
aunt’s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:

“Aunt, you don’t whack Sid when he takes it.”

“Well, Sid don’t torment a body the way you do. You’d be always into
that sugar if I warn’t watching you.”

Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity,
reached for the sugar-bowl—a sort of glorying over Tom which was
wellnigh unbearable. But Sid’s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and
broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled
his tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a
word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she
asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be
nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model “catch it.” He was
so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old
lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath
from over her spectacles. He said to himself, “Now it’s coming!” And the
next instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted
to strike again when Tom cried out:

“Hold on, now, what ’er you belting _me_ for?—Sid broke it!”

Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when
she got her tongue again, she only said:

“Umf! Well, you didn’t get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some
other audacious mischief when I wasn’t around, like enough.”

Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something
kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a
confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.
So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.
Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart
his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the
consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice
of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then,
through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured
himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching
one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and
die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured
himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and
his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how
her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back
her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would
lie there cold and white and make no sign—a poor little sufferer, whose
griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of
these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke;
and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked,
and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to
him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any
worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too
sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced
in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit
of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness
out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.

He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate
places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the river
invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated
the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could
only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the
uncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought of his flower.
He got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal
felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would she
cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and
comfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world?
This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he
worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and
varied lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing
and departed in the darkness.

About half-past nine or ten o’clock he came along the deserted street to
where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon
his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain
of a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the
fence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under
that window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him
down on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his
hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower.
And thus he would die—out in the cold world, with no shelter over his
homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow,
no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And
thus _she_ would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and
oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would
she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted,
so untimely cut down?

The window went up, a maid-servant’s discordant voice profaned the holy
calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr’s remains!

The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz
as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound
as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the
fence and shot away in the gloom.

Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his
drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he
had any dim idea of making any “references to allusions,” he thought
better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom’s eye.

Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made mental
note of the omission.




CHAPTER IV


The sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful
village like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family
worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid
courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of
originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of
the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.

Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to “get
his verses.” Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his
energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the
Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.
At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,
but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human
thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took
his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the
fog:

“Blessed are the—a—a—”

“Poor”—

“Yes—poor; blessed are the poor—a—a—”

“In spirit—”

“In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they—they—”

“_Theirs_—”

“For _theirs_. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they—they—”

“Sh—”

“For they—a—”

“S, H, A—”

“For they S, H—Oh, I don’t know what it is!”

“_Shall_!”

“Oh, _shall_! for they shall—for they shall—a—a—shall
mourn—a—a—blessed are they that shall—they that—a—they that
shall mourn, for they shall—a—shall _what_? Why don’t you tell me,
Mary?—what do you want to be so mean for?”

“Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I’m not teasing you. I wouldn’t
do that. You must go and learn it again. Don’t you be discouraged, Tom,
you’ll manage it—and if you do, I’ll give you something ever so nice.
There, now, that’s a good boy.”

“All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.”

“Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it’s nice, it is nice.”

“You bet you that’s so, Mary. All right, I’ll tackle it again.”

And he did “tackle it again”—and under the double pressure of curiosity
and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a
shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new “Barlow” knife worth twelve
and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system
shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything,
but it was a “sure-enough” Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur
in that—though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a
weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing
mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the
cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was
called off to dress for Sunday-school.

Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went
outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he
dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;
poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen
and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But
Mary removed the towel and said:

“Now ain’t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn’t be so bad. Water won’t hurt
you.”

Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he
stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath
and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut
and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of
suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from
the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped
short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line
there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in
front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she
was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of
color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls
wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately
smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his
hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his
own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his
clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years—they were
simply called his “other clothes”—and so by that we know the size of his
wardrobe. The girl “put him to rights” after he had dressed himself;
she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt
collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with
his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and
uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there
was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He
hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she
coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought
them out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do
everything he didn’t want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:

“Please, Tom—that’s a good boy.”

So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three
children set out for Sunday-school—a place that Tom hated with his whole
heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.

Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church
service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,
and the other always remained too—for stronger reasons. The church’s
high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons;
the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board
tree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step
and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:

“Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?”

“Yes.”

“What’ll you take for her?”

“What’ll you give?”

“Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.”

“Less see ’em.”

Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.
Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some
small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other
boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten
or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm
of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started
a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave,
elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a
boy’s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy
turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear
him say “Ouch!” and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom’s whole
class were of a pattern—restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came
to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but
had to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each
got his reward—in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture
on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten
blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red
tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent
gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy
times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and
application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Doré Bible? And
yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way—it was the patient work of
two years—and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once
recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his
mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot
from that day forth—a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great
occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it)
had always made this boy come out and “spread himself.” Only the older
pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work
long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes
was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so
great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar’s
heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple
of weeks. It is possible that Tom’s mental stomach had never really
hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being
had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.

In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with
a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its
leaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent
makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as
necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer
who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert—though
why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music
is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim
creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he
wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears
and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth—a
fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the
whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a
spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had
fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion
of the day, like sleigh-runners—an effect patiently and laboriously
produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a
wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very
sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places
in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that
unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar
intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this
fashion:

“Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as
you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There—that
is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one
little girl who is looking out of the window—I am afraid she thinks I
am out there somewhere—perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech
to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it
makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a
place like this, learning to do right and be good.” And so forth and so
on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a
pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.

The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights
and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings
and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of
isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound
ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters’ voice, and the
conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.

A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was
more or less rare—the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied
by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman
with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter’s
wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of
chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too—he could not meet Amy
Lawrence’s eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this
small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next
moment he was “showing off” with all his might—cuffing boys, pulling
hair, making faces—in a word, using every art that seemed likely to
fascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one
alloy—the memory of his humiliation in this angel’s garden—and that
record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that
were sweeping over it now.

The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.
Walters’ speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The
middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage—no less a one
than the county judge—altogether the most august creation these children
had ever looked upon—and they wondered what kind of material he was made
of—and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might,
too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away—so he had travelled,
and seen the world—these very eyes had looked upon the county
court-house—which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these
reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the
ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of
their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar
with the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music
to his soul to hear the whisperings:

“Look at him, Jim! He’s a going up there. Say—look! he’s a going to
shake hands with him—he _is_ shaking hands with him! By jings, don’t you
wish you was Jeff?”

Mr. Walters fell to “showing off,” with all sorts of official bustlings
and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging
directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The
librarian “showed off”—running hither and thither with his arms full of
books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority
delights in. The young lady teachers “showed off”—bending sweetly over
pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers
at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen
teachers “showed off” with small scoldings and other little displays of
authority and fine attention to discipline—and most of the teachers, of
both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was
business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times
(with much seeming vexation). The little girls “showed off” in various
ways, and the little boys “showed off” with such diligence that the air
was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it
all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all
the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur—for he was
“showing off,” too.

There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters’ ecstasy complete,
and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.
Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough—he had been
around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now,
to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.

And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with
nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded
a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not
expecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But
there was no getting around it—here were the certified checks, and they
were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with
the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from
headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and
so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the
judicial one’s altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon
in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy—but those that
suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they
themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to
Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.
These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a
guileful snake in the grass.

The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the
superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked
somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow’s instinct taught him
that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,
perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two
thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises—a dozen would
strain his capacity, without a doubt.

Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in
her face—but he wouldn’t look. She wondered; then she was just a grain
troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went—came again; she watched;
a furtive glance told her worlds—and then her heart broke, and she was
jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most
of all (she thought).

Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath
would hardly come, his heart quaked—partly because of the awful
greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would
have liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The
Judge put his hand on Tom’s head and called him a fine little man, and
asked him what his name was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:

“Tom.”

“Oh, no, not Tom—it is—”

“Thomas.”

“Ah, that’s it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That’s very well.
But you’ve another one I daresay, and you’ll tell it to me, won’t you?”

“Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,” said Walters, “and say
sir. You mustn’t forget your manners.”

“Thomas Sawyer—sir.”

“That’s it! That’s a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two
thousand verses is a great many—very, very great many. And you never can
be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth
more than anything there is in the world; it’s what makes great men
and good men; you’ll be a great man and a good man yourself, some
day, Thomas, and then you’ll look back and say, It’s all owing to the
precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood—it’s all owing to
my dear teachers that taught me to learn—it’s all owing to the good
superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a
beautiful Bible—a splendid elegant Bible—to keep and have it all for my
own, always—it’s all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will
say, Thomas—and you wouldn’t take any money for those two thousand
verses—no indeed you wouldn’t. And now you wouldn’t mind telling me and
this lady some of the things you’ve learned—no, I know you wouldn’t—for
we are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no doubt you know the names
of all the twelve disciples. Won’t you tell us the names of the first
two that were appointed?”

Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed,
now, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters’ heart sank within him. He said
to himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest
question—why _did_ the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up
and say:

“Answer the gentleman, Thomas—don’t be afraid.”

Tom still hung fire.

“Now I know you’ll tell me,” said the lady. “The names of the first two
disciples were—”

“_David and Goliah!_”

Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.




CHAPTER V


About half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,
and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The
Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and
occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt
Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her—Tom being placed next
the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window
and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up
the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days;
the mayor and his wife—for they had a mayor there, among other
unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglas, fair,
smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill
mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much
the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could
boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the
new notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by
a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all
the young clerks in town in a body—for they had stood in the vestibule
sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering
admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came
the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as
if she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was
the pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so
good. And besides, he had been “thrown up to them” so much. His
white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on
Sundays—accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys
who had as snobs.

The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,
to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the
church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the
choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all
through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,
but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago,
and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in
some foreign country.

The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a
peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His
voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a
certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word
and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:

  Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow’ry _beds_
                                                        of ease,

  Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro’ _blood_
                                                        -y seas?

He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church “sociables” he was
always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies
would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,
and “wall” their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, “Words
cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal
earth.”

After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into
a bulletin-board, and read off “notices” of meetings and societies and
things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of
doom—a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities,
away here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is
to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.

And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went
into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the
church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;
for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United
States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the
President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed
by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of
European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light
and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear
withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with
a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace
and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a
grateful harvest of good. Amen.

There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.
The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he
only endured it—if he even did that much. He was restive all through it;
he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously—for he was not
listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman’s regular
route over it—and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,
his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered
additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had
lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by
calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and
polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with
the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping
its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they
had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if
it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom’s
hands itched to grab for it they did not dare—he believed his soul would
be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going
on. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal
forward; and the instant the “Amen” was out the fly was a prisoner of
war. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.

The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an
argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod—and
yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and
thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly
worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he
always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything
else about the discourse. However, this time he was really interested
for a little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the
assembling together of the world’s hosts at the millennium when the lion
and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead
them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle
were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the
principal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the
thought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child,
if it was a tame lion.

Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.
Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was
a large black beetle with formidable jaws—a “pinchbug,” he called it. It
was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to
take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went
floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went
into the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,
unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out
of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in
the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came
idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the
quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the
drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around
it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew
bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly
snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy
the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,
and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent
and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin
descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp,
a flirt of the poodle’s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards
away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators
shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and
hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,
and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a
craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on
it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his
fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at
it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But
he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a
fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close
to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the
beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony
and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so
did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew
down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the
home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was
but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of
light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang
into its master’s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of
distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.

By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with
suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.
The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all
possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest
sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of
unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson
had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole
congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.

Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was
some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety
in it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog
should play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in
him to carry it off.




CHAPTER VI


Monday morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found
him so—because it began another week’s slow suffering in school. He
generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday,
it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.

Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was
sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility.
He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated
again. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he
began to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew
feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly
he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This
was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a “starter,” as he
called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that
argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought
he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.
Nothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing
the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or
three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly
drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.
But now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed
well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable
spirit.

But Sid slept on unconscious.

Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.

No result from Sid.

Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then
swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.

Sid snored on.

Tom was aggravated. He said, “Sid, Sid!” and shook him. This course
worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then
brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.
Tom went on groaning. Sid said:

“Tom! Say, Tom!” [No response.] “Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter,
Tom?” And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.

Tom moaned out:

“Oh, don’t, Sid. Don’t joggle me.”

“Why, what’s the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.”

“No—never mind. It’ll be over by and by, maybe. Don’t call anybody.”

“But I must! _Don’t_ groan so, Tom, it’s awful. How long you been this
way?”

“Hours. Ouch! Oh, don’t stir so, Sid, you’ll kill me.”

“Tom, why didn’t you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, _don’t!_ It makes my flesh
crawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?”

“I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you’ve ever done to
me. When I’m gone—”

“Oh, Tom, you ain’t dying, are you? Don’t, Tom—oh, don’t. Maybe—”

“I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell ’em so, Sid. And Sid, you give
my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that’s come to
town, and tell her—”

But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality,
now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had
gathered quite a genuine tone.

Sid flew downstairs and said:

“Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom’s dying!”

“Dying!”

“Yes’m. Don’t wait—come quick!”

“Rubbage! I don’t believe it!”

But she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels.
And her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the
bedside she gasped out:

“You, Tom! Tom, what’s the matter with you?”

“Oh, auntie, I’m—”

“What’s the matter with you—what is the matter with you, child?”

“Oh, auntie, my sore toe’s mortified!”

The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a
little, then did both together. This restored her and she said:

“Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and
climb out of this.”

The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a
little foolish, and he said:

“Aunt Polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my
tooth at all.”

“Your tooth, indeed! What’s the matter with your tooth?”

“One of them’s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.”

“There, there, now, don’t begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.
Well—your tooth _is_ loose, but you’re not going to die about that.
Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.”

Tom said:

“Oh, please, auntie, don’t pull it out. It don’t hurt any more. I wish
I may never stir if it does. Please don’t, auntie. I don’t want to stay
home from school.”

“Oh, you don’t, don’t you? So all this row was because you thought you’d
get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so,
and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your
outrageousness.” By this time the dental instruments were ready. The old
lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom’s tooth with a loop
and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and
suddenly thrust it almost into the boy’s face. The tooth hung dangling
by the bedpost, now.

But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after
breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his
upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable
way. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition;
and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and
homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,
and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain
which he did not feel that it wasn’t anything to spit like Tom Sawyer;
but another boy said, “Sour grapes!” and he wandered away a dismantled
hero.

Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry
Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and
dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless
and vulgar and bad—and because all their children admired him so, and
delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like
him. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied
Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders
not to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.
Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown
men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat
was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat,
when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons
far down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of
the trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged
in the dirt when not rolled up.

Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps
in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to
school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could
go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it
suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he
pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring
and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor
put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything
that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed,
hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.

Tom hailed the romantic outcast:

“Hello, Huckleberry!”

“Hello yourself, and see how you like it.”

“What’s that you got?”

“Dead cat.”

“Lemme see him, Huck. My, he’s pretty stiff. Where’d you get him?”

“Bought him off’n a boy.”

“What did you give?”

“I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.”

“Where’d you get the blue ticket?”

“Bought it off’n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.”

“Say—what is dead cats good for, Huck?”

“Good for? Cure warts with.”

“No! Is that so? I know something that’s better.”

“I bet you don’t. What is it?”

“Why, spunk-water.”

“Spunk-water! I wouldn’t give a dern for spunk-water.”

“You wouldn’t, wouldn’t you? D’you ever try it?”

“No, I hain’t. But Bob Tanner did.”

“Who told you so!”

“Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny
told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the
nigger told me. There now!”

“Well, what of it? They’ll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I
don’t know _him_. But I never see a nigger that _wouldn’t_ lie. Shucks!
Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.”

“Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water
was.”

“In the daytime?”

“Certainly.”

“With his face to the stump?”

“Yes. Least I reckon so.”

“Did he say anything?”

“I don’t reckon he did. I don’t know.”

“Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool
way as that! Why, that ain’t a-going to do any good. You got to go all
by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there’s a
spunk-water stump, and just as it’s midnight you back up against the
stump and jam your hand in and say:

    ‘Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,
    Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,’

and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then
turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.
Because if you speak the charm’s busted.”

“Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain’t the way Bob Tanner
done.”

“No, sir, you can bet he didn’t, becuz he’s the wartiest boy in this
town; and he wouldn’t have a wart on him if he’d knowed how to work
spunk-water. I’ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,
Huck. I play with frogs so much that I’ve always got considerable many
warts. Sometimes I take ’em off with a bean.”

“Yes, bean’s good. I’ve done that.”

“Have you? What’s your way?”

“You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood,
and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig
a hole and bury it ’bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the
moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece
that’s got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to
fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the
wart, and pretty soon off she comes.”

“Yes, that’s it, Huck—that’s it; though when you’re burying it if you
say ‘Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!’ it’s better.
That’s the way Joe Harper does, and he’s been nearly to Coonville and
most everywheres. But say—how do you cure ’em with dead cats?”

“Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard ’long about
midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it’s
midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can’t see
’em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear ’em talk;
and when they’re taking that feller away, you heave your cat after ’em
and say, ‘Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I’m
done with ye!’ That’ll fetch _any_ wart.”

“Sounds right. D’you ever try it, Huck?”

“No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.”

“Well, I reckon it’s so, then. Becuz they say she’s a witch.”

“Say! Why, Tom, I _know_ she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own
self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he
took up a rock, and if she hadn’t dodged, he’d a got her. Well, that
very night he rolled off’n a shed wher’ he was a layin drunk, and broke
his arm.”

“Why, that’s awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?”

“Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right
stiddy, they’re a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when
they mumble they’re saying the Lord’s Prayer backards.”

“Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?”

“To-night. I reckon they’ll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.”

“But they buried him Saturday. Didn’t they get him Saturday night?”

“Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?—and
_then_ it’s Sunday. Devils don’t slosh around much of a Sunday, I don’t
reckon.”

“I never thought of that. That’s so. Lemme go with you?”

“Of course—if you ain’t afeard.”

“Afeard! ’Tain’t likely. Will you meow?”

“Yes—and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep’ me
a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says
‘Dern that cat!’ and so I hove a brick through his window—but don’t you
tell.”

“I won’t. I couldn’t meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but
I’ll meow this time. Say—what’s that?”

“Nothing but a tick.”

“Where’d you get him?”

“Out in the woods.”

“What’ll you take for him?”

“I don’t know. I don’t want to sell him.”

“All right. It’s a mighty small tick, anyway.”

“Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don’t belong to them. I’m
satisfied with it. It’s a good enough tick for me.”

“Sho, there’s ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of ’em if I wanted
to.”

“Well, why don’t you? Becuz you know mighty well you can’t. This is a
pretty early tick, I reckon. It’s the first one I’ve seen this year.”

“Say, Huck—I’ll give you my tooth for him.”

“Less see it.”

Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed
it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:

“Is it genuwyne?”

Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.

“Well, all right,” said Huckleberry, “it’s a trade.”

Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the
pinchbug’s prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than
before.

When Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in
briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He
hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like
alacrity. The master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom
arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The
interruption roused him.

“Thomas Sawyer!”

Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.

“Sir!”

“Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?”

Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of
yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric
sympathy of love; and by that form was _the only vacant place_ on the
girls’ side of the school-house. He instantly said:

“_I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn!_”

The master’s pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of
study ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his
mind. The master said:

“You—you did what?”

“Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.”

There was no mistaking the words.

“Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever
listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your
jacket.”

The master’s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches
notably diminished. Then the order followed:

“Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.”

The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but
in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe
of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good
fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched
herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and
whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the
long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.

By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur
rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal
furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, “made a mouth” at him
and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she
cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it
away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less
animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it
remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, “Please take it—I got more.” The
girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw
something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time
the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began
to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,
apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt
to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she
gave in and hesitatingly whispered:

“Let me see it.”

Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends
to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl’s
interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything
else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:

“It’s nice—make a man.”

The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He
could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;
she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:

“It’s a beautiful man—now make me coming along.”

Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed
the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:

“It’s ever so nice—I wish I could draw.”

“It’s easy,” whispered Tom, “I’ll learn you.”

“Oh, will you? When?”

“At noon. Do you go home to dinner?”

“I’ll stay if you will.”

“Good—that’s a whack. What’s your name?”

“Becky Thatcher. What’s yours? Oh, I know. It’s Thomas Sawyer.”

“That’s the name they lick me by. I’m Tom when I’m good. You call me
Tom, will you?”

“Yes.”

Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from
the girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom
said:

“Oh, it ain’t anything.”

“Yes it is.”

“No it ain’t. You don’t want to see.”

“Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.”

“You’ll tell.”

“No I won’t—deed and deed and double deed won’t.”

“You won’t tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?”

“No, I won’t ever tell _any_body. Now let me.”

“Oh, _you_ don’t want to see!”

“Now that you treat me so, I _will_ see.” And she put her small hand
upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in
earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were
revealed: “_I love you_.”

“Oh, you bad thing!” And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and
looked pleased, nevertheless.

Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his
ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the
house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles
from the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful
moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But
although Tom’s ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.

As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but
the turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the
reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and
turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into
continents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and
got “turned down,” by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought
up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with
ostentation for months.




CHAPTER VII


The harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas
wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed
to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead.
There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days.
The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed
the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the
flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a
shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds
floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible
but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom’s heart ached to be free, or
else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.
His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of
gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively
the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on
the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that
amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when
he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and
made him take a new direction.

Tom’s bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and
now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in
an instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn
friends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a
pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.
The sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were
interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit
of the tick. So he put Joe’s slate on the desk and drew a line down the
middle of it from top to bottom.

“Now,” said he, “as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and
I’ll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,
you’re to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.”

“All right, go ahead; start him up.”

The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe
harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This
change of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with
absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the
two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all
things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The
tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as
anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would
have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom’s fingers would
be twitching to begin, Joe’s pin would deftly head him off, and keep
possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too
strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in
a moment. Said he:

“Tom, you let him alone.”

“I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.”

“No, sir, it ain’t fair; you just let him alone.”

“Blame it, I ain’t going to stir him much.”

“Let him alone, I tell you.”

“I won’t!”

“You shall—he’s on my side of the line.”

“Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?”

“I don’t care whose tick he is—he’s on my side of the line, and you
sha’n’t touch him.”

“Well, I’ll just bet I will, though. He’s my tick and I’ll do what I
blame please with him, or die!”

A tremendous whack came down on Tom’s shoulders, and its duplicate on
Joe’s; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from
the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been
too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile
before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them.
He had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed
his bit of variety to it.

When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered
in her ear:

“Put on your bonnet and let on you’re going home; and when you get to
the corner, give the rest of ’em the slip, and turn down through the
lane and come back. I’ll go the other way and come it over ’em the same
way.”

So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with
another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and
when they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they
sat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil
and held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising
house. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking.
Tom was swimming in bliss. He said:

“Do you love rats?”

“No! I hate them!”

“Well, I do, too—_live_ ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your
head with a string.”

“No, I don’t care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.”

“Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.”

“Do you? I’ve got some. I’ll let you chew it awhile, but you must give
it back to me.”

That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs
against the bench in excess of contentment.

“Was you ever at a circus?” said Tom.

“Yes, and my pa’s going to take me again some time, if I’m good.”

“I been to the circus three or four times—lots of times. Church ain’t
shucks to a circus. There’s things going on at a circus all the time.
I’m going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.”

“Oh, are you! That will be nice. They’re so lovely, all spotted up.”

“Yes, that’s so. And they get slathers of money—most a dollar a day, Ben
Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?”

“What’s that?”

“Why, engaged to be married.”

“No.”

“Would you like to?”

“I reckon so. I don’t know. What is it like?”

“Like? Why it ain’t like anything. You only just tell a boy you won’t
ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that’s
all. Anybody can do it.”

“Kiss? What do you kiss for?”

“Why, that, you know, is to—well, they always do that.”

“Everybody?”

“Why, yes, everybody that’s in love with each other. Do you remember
what I wrote on the slate?”

“Ye—yes.”

“What was it?”

“I sha’n’t tell you.”

“Shall I tell _you_?”

“Ye—yes—but some other time.”

“No, now.”

“No, not now—to-morrow.”

“Oh, no, _now_. Please, Becky—I’ll whisper it, I’ll whisper it ever so
easy.”

Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about
her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to
her ear. And then he added:

“Now you whisper it to me—just the same.”

She resisted, for a while, and then said:

“You turn your face away so you can’t see, and then I will. But you
mustn’t ever tell anybody—_will_ you, Tom? Now you won’t, _will_ you?”

“No, indeed, indeed I won’t. Now, Becky.”

He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred
his curls and whispered, “I—love—you!”

Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,
with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little
white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:

“Now, Becky, it’s all done—all over but the kiss. Don’t you be afraid
of that—it ain’t anything at all. Please, Becky.” And he tugged at her
apron and the hands.

By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing
with the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and
said:

“Now it’s all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain’t
ever to love anybody but me, and you ain’t ever to marry anybody but me,
ever never and forever. Will you?”

“No, I’ll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I’ll never marry anybody
but you—and you ain’t to ever marry anybody but me, either.”

“Certainly. Of course. That’s _part_ of it. And always coming to school
or when we’re going home, you’re to walk with me, when there ain’t
anybody looking—and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because
that’s the way you do when you’re engaged.”

“It’s so nice. I never heard of it before.”

“Oh, it’s ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence—”

The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.

“Oh, Tom! Then I ain’t the first you’ve ever been engaged to!”

The child began to cry. Tom said:

“Oh, don’t cry, Becky, I don’t care for her any more.”

“Yes, you do, Tom—you know you do.”

Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and
turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with
soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was
up, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and
uneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping
she would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began
to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle
with him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and
entered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with
her face to the wall. Tom’s heart smote him. He went to her and stood a
moment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:

“Becky, I—I don’t care for anybody but you.”

No reply—but sobs.

“Becky”—pleadingly. “Becky, won’t you say something?”

More sobs.

Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron,
and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:

“Please, Becky, won’t you take it?”

She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over
the hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently
Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she
flew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:

“Tom! Come back, Tom!”

She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions
but silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid
herself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she
had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross
of a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers about
her to exchange sorrows with.




CHAPTER VIII


Tom dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the
track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed
a small “branch” two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile
superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later
he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff
Hill, and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the
valley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to
the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.
There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even
stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken
by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and
this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the
more profound. The boy’s soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings
were in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows
on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him
that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy
Hodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie
and slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through
the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and
nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a
clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with
it all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant
the best in the world, and been treated like a dog—like a very dog. She
would be sorry some day—maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only
die _temporarily_!

But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained
shape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into
the concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and
disappeared mysteriously? What if he went away—ever so far away, into
unknown countries beyond the seas—and never came back any more! How
would she feel then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only
to fill him with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights
were an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was
exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be
a soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious.
No—better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on
the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the
Far West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with
feathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy
summer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs
of all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was
something gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it!
_now_ his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable
splendor. How his name would fill the world, and make people shudder!
How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low,
black-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying
at the fore! And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear
at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in
his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson
sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass
at his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled,
with the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy
the whisperings, “It’s Tom Sawyer the Pirate!—the Black Avenger of the
Spanish Main!”

Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from
home and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore
he must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together.
He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of
it with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He
put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:

“What hasn’t come here, come! What’s here, stay here!”

Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it
up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides
were of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom’s astonishment was boundless!
He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:

“Well, that beats anything!”

Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The
truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and
all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried
a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a
fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just
used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered
themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been
separated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed.
Tom’s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had
many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing
before. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times
before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He
puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch
had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself
on that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot
with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and
put his mouth close to this depression and called—

“Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,
doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!”

The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a
second and then darted under again in a fright.

“He dasn’t tell! So it _was_ a witch that done it. I just knowed it.”

He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he
gave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have
the marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a
patient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to his
treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing
when he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his
pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:

“Brother, go find your brother!”

He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must
have fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last
repetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each
other.

Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green
aisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned
a suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,
disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and
in a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged,
with fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an
answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way
and that. He said cautiously—to an imaginary company:

“Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.”

Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.
Tom called:

“Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?”

“Guy of Guisborne wants no man’s pass. Who art thou that—that—”

“Dares to hold such language,” said Tom, prompting—for they talked “by
the book,” from memory.

“Who art thou that dares to hold such language?”

“I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.”

“Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute
with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!”

They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,
struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful
combat, “two up and two down.” Presently Tom said:

“Now, if you’ve got the hang, go it lively!”

So they “went it lively,” panting and perspiring with the work. By and
by Tom shouted:

“Fall! fall! Why don’t you fall?”

“I sha’n’t! Why don’t you fall yourself? You’re getting the worst of
it.”

“Why, that ain’t anything. I can’t fall; that ain’t the way it is in the
book. The book says, ‘Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy
of Guisborne.’ You’re to turn around and let me hit you in the back.”

There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the
whack and fell.

“Now,” said Joe, getting up, “you got to let me kill _you_. That’s
fair.”

“Why, I can’t do that, it ain’t in the book.”

“Well, it’s blamed mean—that’s all.”

“Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller’s son, and lam
me with a quarter-staff; or I’ll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be
Robin Hood a little while and kill me.”

This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then
Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to
bleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe,
representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,
gave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, “Where this arrow
falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.” Then he
shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle
and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.

The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off
grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern
civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.
They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than
President of the United States forever.




CHAPTER IX


At half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.
They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and
waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be
nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He
would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was
afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark.
Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little,
scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking
of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack
mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad.
A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly’s chamber. And now the
tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate,
began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the
bed’s head made Tom shudder—it meant that somebody’s days were numbered.
Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered
by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last
he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to
doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear
it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most
melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed
him. A cry of “Scat! you devil!” and the crash of an empty bottle
against the back of his aunt’s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a
single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping
along the roof of the “ell” on all fours. He “meow’d” with caution once
or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence
to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys
moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they
were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.

It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill,
about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence
around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the
time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the
whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a
tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over
the graves, leaning for support and finding none. “Sacred to the memory
of” So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have
been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.

A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the
spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked
little, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the
pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the
sharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the
protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of
the grave.

Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of
a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom’s
reflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a
whisper:

“Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?”

Huckleberry whispered:

“I wisht I knowed. It’s awful solemn like, _ain’t_ it?”

“I bet it is.”

There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter
inwardly. Then Tom whispered:

“Say, Hucky—do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?”

“O’ course he does. Least his sperrit does.”

Tom, after a pause:

“I wish I’d said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody
calls him Hoss.”

“A body can’t be too partic’lar how they talk ’bout these-yer dead
people, Tom.”

This was a damper, and conversation died again.

Presently Tom seized his comrade’s arm and said:

“Sh!”

“What is it, Tom?” And the two clung together with beating hearts.

“Sh! There ’tis again! Didn’t you hear it?”

“I—”

“There! Now you hear it.”

“Lord, Tom, they’re coming! They’re coming, sure. What’ll we do?”

“I dono. Think they’ll see us?”

“Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn’t
come.”

“Oh, don’t be afeard. I don’t believe they’ll bother us. We ain’t doing
any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won’t notice us at
all.”

“I’ll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I’m all of a shiver.”

“Listen!”

The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled
sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.

“Look! See there!” whispered Tom. “What is it?”

“It’s devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.”

Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an
old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable
little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a
shudder:

“It’s the devils sure enough. Three of ’em! Lordy, Tom, we’re goners!
Can you pray?”

“I’ll try, but don’t you be afeard. They ain’t going to hurt us. ‘Now I
lay me down to sleep, I—’”

“Sh!”

“What is it, Huck?”

“They’re _humans_! One of ’em is, anyway. One of ’em’s old Muff Potter’s
voice.”

“No—’tain’t so, is it?”

“I bet I know it. Don’t you stir nor budge. He ain’t sharp enough to
notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely—blamed old rip!”

“All right, I’ll keep still. Now they’re stuck. Can’t find it. Here they
come again. Now they’re hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They’re
p’inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o’ them voices; it’s
Injun Joe.”

“That’s so—that murderin’ half-breed! I’d druther they was devils a dern
sight. What kin they be up to?”

The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the
grave and stood within a few feet of the boys’ hiding-place.

“Here it is,” said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern
up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.

Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple
of shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open the grave.
The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat
down with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so close the
boys could have touched him.

“Hurry, men!” he said, in a low voice; “the moon might come out at any
moment.”

They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no
noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of
mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon
the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two
the men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with
their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The
moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.
The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a
blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a large
spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:

“Now the cussed thing’s ready, Sawbones, and you’ll just out with
another five, or here she stays.”

“That’s the talk!” said Injun Joe.

“Look here, what does this mean?” said the doctor. “You required your
pay in advance, and I’ve paid you.”

“Yes, and you done more than that,” said Injun Joe, approaching the
doctor, who was now standing. “Five years ago you drove me away from
your father’s kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to
eat, and you said I warn’t there for any good; and when I swore I’d get
even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for
a vagrant. Did you think I’d forget? The Injun blood ain’t in me for
nothing. And now I’ve _got_ you, and you got to _settle_, you know!”

He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time.
The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.
Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:

“Here, now, don’t you hit my pard!” and the next moment he had grappled
with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main,
trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe
sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter’s
knife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about
the combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung
himself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams’ grave and felled
Potter to the earth with it—and in the same instant the half-breed saw
his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man’s breast. He
reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in
the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the
two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.

Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the
two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave
a long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:

“_That_ score is settled—damn you.”

Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter’s
open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three—four—five
minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed
upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a
shudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and
then around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe’s.

“Lord, how is this, Joe?” he said.

“It’s a dirty business,” said Joe, without moving.

“What did you do it for?”

“I! I never done it!”

“Look here! That kind of talk won’t wash.”

Potter trembled and grew white.

“I thought I’d got sober. I’d no business to drink to-night. But it’s
in my head yet—worse’n when we started here. I’m all in a muddle;
can’t recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe—_honest_, now,
old feller—did I do it? Joe, I never meant to—’pon my soul and honor, I
never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it’s awful—and him so
young and promising.”

“Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard
and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering
like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched
you another awful clip—and here you’ve laid, as dead as a wedge til
now.”

“Oh, I didn’t know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I
did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon.
I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I’ve fought, but never
with weepons. They’ll all say that. Joe, don’t tell! Say you won’t tell,
Joe—that’s a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you,
too. Don’t you remember? You _won’t_ tell, _will_ you, Joe?” And the
poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and
clasped his appealing hands.

“No, you’ve always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I
won’t go back on you. There, now, that’s as fair as a man can say.”

“Oh, Joe, you’re an angel. I’ll bless you for this the longest day I
live.” And Potter began to cry.

“Come, now, that’s enough of that. This ain’t any time for blubbering.
You be off yonder way and I’ll go this. Move, now, and don’t leave any
tracks behind you.”

Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed
stood looking after him. He muttered:

“If he’s as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he
had the look of being, he won’t think of the knife till he’s gone so
far he’ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by
himself—chicken-heart!”

Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the
lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the
moon’s. The stillness was complete again, too.




CHAPTER X


The two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with
horror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,
apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump
that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them
catch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay
near the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give
wings to their feet.

“If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!” whispered
Tom, in short catches between breaths. “I can’t stand it much longer.”

Huckleberry’s hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed
their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.
They gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst
through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering
shadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:

“Huckleberry, what do you reckon’ll come of this?”

“If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging’ll come of it.”

“Do you though?”

“Why, I _know_ it, Tom.”

Tom thought a while, then he said:

“Who’ll tell? We?”

“What are you talking about? S’pose something happened and Injun Joe
_didn’t_ hang? Why, he’d kill us some time or other, just as dead sure
as we’re a laying here.”

“That’s just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.”

“If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he’s fool enough. He’s
generally drunk enough.”

Tom said nothing—went on thinking. Presently he whispered:

“Huck, Muff Potter don’t know it. How can he tell?”

“What’s the reason he don’t know it?”

“Because he’d just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D’you reckon
he could see anything? D’you reckon he knowed anything?”

“By hokey, that’s so, Tom!”

“And besides, look-a-here—maybe that whack done for _him_!”

“No, ’taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and
besides, he always has. Well, when pap’s full, you might take and belt
him over the head with a church and you couldn’t phase him. He says so,
his own self. So it’s the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man
was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.”

After another reflective silence, Tom said:

“Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?”

“Tom, we _got_ to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn’t
make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak
’bout this and they didn’t hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take
and swear to one another—that’s what we got to do—swear to keep mum.”

“I’m agreed. It’s the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear
that we—”

“Oh no, that wouldn’t do for this. That’s good enough for little
rubbishy common things—specially with gals, cuz _they_ go back on you
anyway, and blab if they get in a huff—but there orter be writing ’bout
a big thing like this. And blood.”

Tom’s whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful;
the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it.
He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a
little fragment of “red keel” out of his pocket, got the moon on
his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow
down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the
pressure on the up-strokes.

  “Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and
   They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell
   and Rot.”

Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom’s facility in writing, and
the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and
was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:

“Hold on! Don’t do that. A pin’s brass. It might have verdigrease on
it.”

“What’s verdigrease?”

“It’s p’ison. That’s what it is. You just swaller some of it once—you’ll
see.”

So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked
the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after
many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his
little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and
an F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the
wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters
that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown
away.

A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined
building, now, but they did not notice it.

“Tom,” whispered Huckleberry, “does this keep us from _ever_
telling—_always_?”

“Of course it does. It don’t make any difference _what_ happens, we got
to keep mum. We’d drop down dead—don’t _you_ know that?”

“Yes, I reckon that’s so.”

They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up
a long, lugubrious howl just outside—within ten feet of them. The boys
clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.

“Which of us does he mean?” gasped Huckleberry.

“I dono—peep through the crack. Quick!”

“No, _you_, Tom!”

“I can’t—I can’t _do_ it, Huck!”

“Please, Tom. There ’tis again!”

“Oh, lordy, I’m thankful!” whispered Tom. “I know his voice. It’s Bull
Harbison.” *

[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of
him as “Harbison’s Bull,” but a son or a dog of that name was “Bull
Harbison.”]

“Oh, that’s good—I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I’d a bet
anything it was a _stray_ dog.”

The dog howled again. The boys’ hearts sank once more.

“Oh, my! that ain’t no Bull Harbison!” whispered Huckleberry. “_Do_,
Tom!”

Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His
whisper was hardly audible when he said:

“Oh, Huck, _it’s a stray dog_!”

“Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?”

“Huck, he must mean us both—we’re right together.”

“Oh, Tom, I reckon we’re goners. I reckon there ain’t no mistake ’bout
where _I’ll_ go to. I been so wicked.”

“Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a
feller’s told _not_ to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I’d a
tried—but no, I wouldn’t, of course. But if ever I get off this time,
I lay I’ll just _waller_ in Sunday-schools!” And Tom began to snuffle a
little.

“_You_ bad!” and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. “Consound it, Tom
Sawyer, you’re just old pie, ’long-side o’ what I am. Oh, _lordy_,
lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.”

Tom choked off and whispered:

“Look, Hucky, look! He’s got his _back_ to us!”

Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.

“Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?”

“Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you
know. _Now_ who can he mean?”

The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.

“Sh! What’s that?” he whispered.

“Sounds like—like hogs grunting. No—it’s somebody snoring, Tom.”

“That _is_ it! Where ’bouts is it, Huck?”

“I bleeve it’s down at ’tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep
there, sometimes, ’long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts
things when _he_ snores. Besides, I reckon he ain’t ever coming back to
this town any more.”

The spirit of adventure rose in the boys’ souls once more.

“Hucky, do you das’t to go if I lead?”

“I don’t like to, much. Tom, s’pose it’s Injun Joe!”

Tom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the
boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their
heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down,
the one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the
snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man
moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was
Muff Potter. The boys’ hearts had stood still, and their hopes too,
when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tip-toed out,
through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance
to exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night
air again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few
feet of where Potter was lying, and _facing_ Potter, with his nose
pointing heavenward.

“Oh, geeminy, it’s _him_!” exclaimed both boys, in a breath.

“Say, Tom—they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller’s
house, ’bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come
in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there
ain’t anybody dead there yet.”

“Well, I know that. And suppose there ain’t. Didn’t Gracie Miller fall
in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?”

“Yes, but she ain’t _dead_. And what’s more, she’s getting better, too.”

“All right, you wait and see. She’s a goner, just as dead sure as Muff
Potter’s a goner. That’s what the niggers say, and they know all about
these kind of things, Huck.”

Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window
the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and
fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He
was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for
an hour.

When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the
light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not
been called—persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled
him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs,
feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had
finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted
eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill
to the culprit’s heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it
was up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into
silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.

After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in
the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt
wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so;
and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs
with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more.
This was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom’s heart was sorer now
than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform
over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that
he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble
confidence.

He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward
Sid; and so the latter’s prompt retreat through the back gate was
unnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,
along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the
air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to
trifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his
desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony
stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.
His elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time
he slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with
a sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal
sigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!

This final feather broke the camel’s back.




CHAPTER XI


Close upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified
with the ghastly news. No need of the as yet un-dreamed-of telegraph;
the tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house,
with little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave
holiday for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of
him if he had not.

A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been
recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter—so the story ran. And
it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself
in the “branch” about one or two o’clock in the morning, and that Potter
had at once sneaked off—suspicious circumstances, especially the washing
which was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town had
been ransacked for this “murderer” (the public are not slow in the
matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he
could not be found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every
direction, and the Sheriff “was confident” that he would be captured
before night.

All the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom’s heartbreak
vanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not
a thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,
unaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he
wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle.
It seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody pinched
his arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry’s. Then both looked
elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their
mutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly
spectacle before them.

“Poor fellow!” “Poor young fellow!” “This ought to be a lesson to grave
robbers!” “Muff Potter’ll hang for this if they catch him!” This was the
drift of remark; and the minister said, “It was a judgment; His hand is
here.”

Now Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid
face of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,
and voices shouted, “It’s him! it’s him! he’s coming himself!”

“Who? Who?” from twenty voices.

“Muff Potter!”

“Hallo, he’s stopped!—Look out, he’s turning! Don’t let him get away!”

People in the branches of the trees over Tom’s head said he wasn’t
trying to get away—he only looked doubtful and perplexed.

“Infernal impudence!” said a bystander; “wanted to come and take a quiet
look at his work, I reckon—didn’t expect any company.”

The crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously
leading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow’s face was haggard, and
his eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the
murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands
and burst into tears.

“I didn’t do it, friends,” he sobbed; “’pon my word and honor I never
done it.”

“Who’s accused you?” shouted a voice.

This shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around
him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and
exclaimed:

“Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you’d never—”

“Is that your knife?” and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.

Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the
ground. Then he said:

“Something told me ’t if I didn’t come back and get—” He shuddered; then
waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, “Tell ’em,
Joe, tell ’em—it ain’t any use any more.”

Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the
stony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every
moment that the clear sky would deliver God’s lightnings upon his head,
and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had
finished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to
break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner’s life faded and
vanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and
it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.

“Why didn’t you leave? What did you want to come here for?” somebody
said.

“I couldn’t help it—I couldn’t help it,” Potter moaned. “I wanted to
run away, but I couldn’t seem to come anywhere but here.” And he fell to
sobbing again.

Injun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes
afterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the
lightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that
Joe had sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the most
balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could
not take their fascinated eyes from his face.

They inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should
offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.

Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in
a wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering
crowd that the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy
circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were
disappointed, for more than one villager remarked:

“It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.”

Tom’s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as
much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:

“Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me
awake half the time.”

Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.

“It’s a bad sign,” said Aunt Polly, gravely. “What you got on your mind,
Tom?”

“Nothing. Nothing ’t I know of.” But the boy’s hand shook so that he
spilled his coffee.

“And you do talk such stuff,” Sid said. “Last night you said, ‘It’s
blood, it’s blood, that’s what it is!’ You said that over and over.
And you said, ‘Don’t torment me so—I’ll tell!’ Tell _what_? What is it
you’ll tell?”

Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have
happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly’s face
and she came to Tom’s relief without knowing it. She said:

“Sho! It’s that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night
myself. Sometimes I dream it’s me that done it.”

Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied.
Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after
that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every
night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently
slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good
while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place
again. Tom’s distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew
irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of
Tom’s disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.

It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding
inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind.
Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries,
though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises;
he noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness—and that was strange;
and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion
to these inquests, and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled,
but said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and
ceased to torture Tom’s conscience.

Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his
opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such
small comforts through to the “murderer” as he could get hold of. The
jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge
of the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it
was seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom’s
conscience.

The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride
him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character
that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the
matter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of his
inquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery
that preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in
the courts at present.




CHAPTER XII


One of the reasons why Tom’s mind had drifted away from its secret
troubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest
itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had
struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to “whistle her down the
wind,” but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father’s
house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she
should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an
interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there
was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;
there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to
try all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who
are infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of
producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in
these things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a
fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing,
but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the
“Health” periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance
they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the “rot” they
contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up,
and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and
what frame of mind to keep one’s self in, and what sort of clothing
to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her
health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they
had recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest
as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered
together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed
with death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with
“hell following after.” But she never suspected that she was not an
angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering
neighbors.

The water treatment was new, now, and Tom’s low condition was a windfall
to her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the
wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed
him down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she
rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she
sweated his soul clean and “the yellow stains of it came through his
pores”—as Tom said.

Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and
pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and
plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the
water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his
capacity as she would a jug’s, and filled him up every day with quack
cure-alls.

Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase
filled the old lady’s heart with consternation. This indifference must
be broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first
time. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with
gratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water
treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer.
She gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the
result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again;
for the “indifference” was broken up. The boy could not have shown a
wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.

Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be
romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have
too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he
thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of
professing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he
became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and
quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings
to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle
clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it
did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in
the sitting-room floor with it.

One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt’s yellow
cat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging
for a taste. Tom said:

“Don’t ask for it unless you want it, Peter.”

But Peter signified that he did want it.

“You better make sure.”

Peter was sure.

“Now you’ve asked for it, and I’ll give it to you, because there ain’t
anything mean about me; but if you find you don’t like it, you mustn’t
blame anybody but your own self.”

Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down
the Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then
delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging
against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next
he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment,
with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his
unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again
spreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time
to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah,
and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots
with him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over
her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.

“Tom, what on earth ails that cat?”

“I don’t know, aunt,” gasped the boy.

“Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?”

“Deed I don’t know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they’re having a
good time.”

“They do, do they?” There was something in the tone that made Tom
apprehensive.

“Yes’m. That is, I believe they do.”

“You _do_?”

“Yes’m.”

The old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized
by anxiety. Too late he divined her “drift.” The handle of the telltale
tea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it
up. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual
handle—his ear—and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.

“Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?”

“I done it out of pity for him—because he hadn’t any aunt.”

“Hadn’t any aunt!—you numskull. What has that got to do with it?”

“Heaps. Because if he’d had one she’d a burnt him out herself! She’d a
roasted his bowels out of him ’thout any more feeling than if he was a
human!”

Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in
a new light; what was cruelty to a cat _might_ be cruelty to a boy, too.
She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she
put her hand on Tom’s head and said gently:

“I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it _did_ do you good.”

Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping
through his gravity.

“I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It
done _him_ good, too. I never see him get around so since—”

“Oh, go ’long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try
and see if you can’t be a good boy, for once, and you needn’t take any
more medicine.”

Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing
had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late,
he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his
comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to
be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking—down the road.
Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom’s face lighted; he gazed
a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom
accosted him; and “led up” warily to opportunities for remark about
Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and
watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the
owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks
ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered
the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed
in at the gate, and Tom’s heart gave a great bound. The next instant he
was out, and “going on” like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys,
jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings,
standing on his head—doing all the heroic things he could conceive of,
and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher
was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never
looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there?
He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping
around, snatched a boy’s cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse,
broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and
fell sprawling, himself, under Becky’s nose, almost upsetting her—and
she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: “Mf! some
people think they’re mighty smart—always showing off!”

Tom’s cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and
crestfallen.




CHAPTER XIII


Tom’s mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a
forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out
what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried
to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing
would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame
_him_ for the consequences—why shouldn’t they? What right had the
friendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would
lead a life of crime. There was no choice.

By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to
“take up” tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he
should never, never hear that old familiar sound any more—it was very
hard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold
world, he must submit—but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick and
fast.

Just at this point he met his soul’s sworn comrade, Joe
Harper—hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his
heart. Plainly here were “two souls with but a single thought.” Tom,
wiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about
a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by
roaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping
that Joe would not forget him.

But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going
to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother
had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and
knew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished
him to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but
succumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her
poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.

As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand
by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved
them of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for
being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying,
some time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he
conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of
crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.

Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River
was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island,
with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a
rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further
shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson’s
Island was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a
matter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn,
and he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was
indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the
river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour—which was
midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture.
Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal
in the most dark and mysterious way—as became outlaws. And before the
afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of
spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would “hear something.” All
who got this vague hint were cautioned to “be mum and wait.”

About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,
and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the
meeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay
like an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the
quiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under
the bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the
same way. Then a guarded voice said:

“Who goes there?”

“Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.”

“Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.” Tom
had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.

“’Tis well. Give the countersign.”

Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the
brooding night:

“_Blood_!”

Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,
tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was
an easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked
the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.

The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn
himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a
skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought
a few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or
“chewed” but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it
would never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought;
matches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering
upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily
thither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing
adventure of it, saying, “Hist!” every now and then, and suddenly
halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts;
and giving orders in dismal whispers that if “the foe” stirred, to “let
him have it to the hilt,” because “dead men tell no tales.” They knew
well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying
in stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their
conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.

They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and
Joe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded
arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:

“Luff, and bring her to the wind!”

“Aye-aye, sir!”

“Steady, steady-y-y-y!”

“Steady it is, sir!”

“Let her go off a point!”

“Point it is, sir!”

As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream
it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for
“style,” and were not intended to mean anything in particular.

“What sail’s she carrying?”

“Courses, tops’ls, and flying-jib, sir.”

“Send the r’yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of
ye—foretopmaststuns’l! Lively, now!”

“Aye-aye, sir!”

“Shake out that maintogalans’l! Sheets and braces! _now_ my hearties!”

“Aye-aye, sir!”

“Hellum-a-lee—hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port,
port! _Now_, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!”

“Steady it is, sir!”

The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head
right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was
not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during
the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before
the distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay,
peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water,
unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black
Avenger stood still with folded arms, “looking his last” upon the scene
of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing “she” could see
him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless
heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but
a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson’s Island beyond
eye-shot of the village, and so he “looked his last” with a broken and
satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and
they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift
them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in
time, and made shift to avert it. About two o’clock in the morning the
raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,
and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part
of the little raft’s belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they
spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions;
but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as
became outlaws.

They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps
within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in
the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn “pone” stock
they had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild,
free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,
far from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to
civilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy
glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the
varnished foliage and festooning vines.

When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance
of corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,
filled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but
they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting
campfire.

“_Ain’t_ it gay?” said Joe.

“It’s _nuts_!” said Tom. “What would the boys say if they could see us?”

“Say? Well, they’d just die to be here—hey, Hucky!”

“I reckon so,” said Huckleberry; “anyways, I’m suited. I don’t want
nothing better’n this. I don’t ever get enough to eat, gen’ally—and here
they can’t come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.”

“It’s just the life for me,” said Tom. “You don’t have to get up,
mornings, and you don’t have to go to school, and wash, and all that
blame foolishness. You see a pirate don’t have to do _anything_, Joe,
when he’s ashore, but a hermit _he_ has to be praying considerable, and
then he don’t have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.”

“Oh yes, that’s so,” said Joe, “but I hadn’t thought much about it, you
know. I’d a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I’ve tried it.”

“You see,” said Tom, “people don’t go much on hermits, nowadays, like
they used to in old times, but a pirate’s always respected. And
a hermit’s got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put
sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and—”

“What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?” inquired Huck.

“I dono. But they’ve _got_ to do it. Hermits always do. You’d have to do
that if you was a hermit.”

“Dern’d if I would,” said Huck.

“Well, what would you do?”

“I dono. But I wouldn’t do that.”

“Why, Huck, you’d _have_ to. How’d you get around it?”

“Why, I just wouldn’t stand it. I’d run away.”

“Run away! Well, you _would_ be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You’d be
a disgrace.”

The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished
gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with
tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of
fragrant smoke—he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The
other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to
acquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:

“What does pirates have to do?”

Tom said:

“Oh, they have just a bully time—take ships and burn them, and get the
money and bury it in awful places in their island where there’s ghosts
and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships—make ’em walk a
plank.”

“And they carry the women to the island,” said Joe; “they don’t kill the
women.”

“No,” assented Tom, “they don’t kill the women—they’re too noble. And
the women’s always beautiful, too.”

“And don’t they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver
and di’monds,” said Joe, with enthusiasm.

“Who?” said Huck.

“Why, the pirates.”

Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.

“I reckon I ain’t dressed fitten for a pirate,” said he, with a
regretful pathos in his voice; “but I ain’t got none but these.”

But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,
after they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand
that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for
wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.

Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the
eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the
Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.
The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had
more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly,
and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them
kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at
all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they
might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at
once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep—but an
intruder came, now, that would not “down.” It was conscience. They began
to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and
next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came.
They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had
purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not
to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the
end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking
sweetmeats was only “hooking,” while taking bacon and hams and such
valuables was plain simple stealing—and there was a command against that
in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in
the business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the
crime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously
inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.




CHAPTER XIV


When Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and
rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool
gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the
deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not
a sound obtruded upon great Nature’s meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood
upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire,
and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck
still slept.

Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently
the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray
of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life
manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going
to work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came
crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air
from time to time and “sniffing around,” then proceeding again—for he
was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own
accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,
by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to
go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its
curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom’s leg and
began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad—for that meant that
he was going to have a new suit of clothes—without the shadow of a
doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared,
from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled
manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,
and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed
the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and
said, “Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your
children’s alone,” and she took wing and went off to see about it—which
did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was
credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity
more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and
Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body
and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A
catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom’s head, and trilled
out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then
a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig
almost within the boy’s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the
strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow
of the “fox” kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to
inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never
seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.
All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight
pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few
butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.

Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with
a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and
tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white
sandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the
distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a
slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only
gratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge
between them and civilization.

They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and
ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a
spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak
or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood
charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While Joe
was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a
minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in
their lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time
to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass,
a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish—provisions enough for quite a
family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for
no fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the
quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better
he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping,
open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.

They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,
and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They
tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush,
among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the
ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came
upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.

They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be
astonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles
long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to
was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards
wide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle
of the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too hungry to
stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw
themselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag,
and then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods,
and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys.
They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This
took dim shape, presently—it was budding homesickness. Even Finn the
Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they
were all ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak
his thought.

For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar
sound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a
clock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound
became more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started,
glanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude. There
was a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came
floating down out of the distance.

“What is it!” exclaimed Joe, under his breath.

“I wonder,” said Tom in a whisper.

“’Tain’t thunder,” said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, “becuz thunder—”

“Hark!” said Tom. “Listen—don’t talk.”

They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom
troubled the solemn hush.

“Let’s go and see.”

They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They
parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little
steam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the
current. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great
many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood
of the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in
them were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the
ferryboat’s side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same
dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.

“I know now!” exclaimed Tom; “somebody’s drownded!”

“That’s it!” said Huck; “they done that last summer, when Bill Turner
got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes
him come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put
quicksilver in ’em and set ’em afloat, and wherever there’s anybody
that’s drownded, they’ll float right there and stop.”

“Yes, I’ve heard about that,” said Joe. “I wonder what makes the bread
do that.”

“Oh, it ain’t the bread, so much,” said Tom; “I reckon it’s mostly what
they _say_ over it before they start it out.”

“But they don’t say anything over it,” said Huck. “I’ve seen ’em and
they don’t.”

“Well, that’s funny,” said Tom. “But maybe they say it to themselves. Of
_course_ they do. Anybody might know that.”

The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because
an ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not
be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such
gravity.

“By jings, I wish I was over there, now,” said Joe.

“I do too,” said Huck. “I’d give heaps to know who it is.”

The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought
flashed through Tom’s mind, and he exclaimed:

“Boys, I know who’s drownded—it’s us!”

They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they
were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account;
tears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor
lost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being
indulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town,
and the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was
concerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.

As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business
and the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were
jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble
they were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then
fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them;
and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were
gratifying to look upon—from their point of view. But when the shadows
of night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing
into the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The
excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts
of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as
much as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a
sigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a
roundabout “feeler” as to how the others might look upon a return to
civilization—not right now, but—

Tom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined
in with Tom, and the waverer quickly “explained,” and was glad to get
out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness
clinging to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to
rest for the moment.

As the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore.
Joe followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time,
watching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees,
and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung
by the campfire. He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders
of the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed
to suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something
upon each of these with his “red keel”; one he rolled up and put in his
jacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe’s hat and removed it to a
little distance from the owner. And he also put into the hat certain
schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value—among them a lump of
chalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind
of marbles known as a “sure ’nough crystal.” Then he tiptoed his way
cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and
straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.




CHAPTER XV


A few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward
the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway
over; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out
confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering
upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had
expected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till
he found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket
pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods,
following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten
o’clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the
ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything
was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching
with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes
and climbed into the skiff that did “yawl” duty at the boat’s stern. He
laid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.

Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to “cast
off.” A minute or two later the skiff’s head was standing high up,
against the boat’s swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in
his success, for he knew it was the boat’s last trip for the night. At
the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and
Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards
downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.

He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his
aunt’s back fence. He climbed over, approached the “ell,” and looked
in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There
sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper’s mother, grouped together,
talking. They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the
door. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then
he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing
cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might
squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,
warily.

“What makes the candle blow so?” said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. “Why,
that door’s open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange
things now. Go ’long and shut it, Sid.”

Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and “breathed”
 himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his
aunt’s foot.

“But as I was saying,” said Aunt Polly, “he warn’t _bad_, so to say—only
misch_ee_vous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn’t
any more responsible than a colt. _He_ never meant any harm, and he was
the best-hearted boy that ever was”—and she began to cry.

“It was just so with my Joe—always full of his devilment, and up to
every kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he
could be—and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking
that cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because
it was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never, never,
never, poor abused boy!” And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would
break.

“I hope Tom’s better off where he is,” said Sid, “but if he’d been
better in some ways—”

“_Sid!_” Tom felt the glare of the old lady’s eye, though he could not
see it. “Not a word against my Tom, now that he’s gone! God’ll take care
of _him_—never you trouble _your_self, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don’t
know how to give him up! I don’t know how to give him up! He was such a
comfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, ’most.”

“The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away—Blessed be the name of
the Lord! But it’s so hard—Oh, it’s so hard! Only last Saturday my Joe
busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling.
Little did I know then, how soon—Oh, if it was to do over again I’d hug
him and bless him for it.”

“Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just
exactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took
and filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would
tear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom’s head with my
thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he’s out of all his troubles now.
And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach—”

But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely
down. Tom was snuffling, now, himself—and more in pity of himself than
anybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word
for him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself
than ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt’s grief
to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy—and
the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his
nature, too, but he resisted and lay still.

He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was
conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim;
then the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing
lads had promised that the village should “hear something” soon; the
wise-heads had “put this and that together” and decided that the lads
had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below,
presently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the
Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village—and then hope
perished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home
by nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the
bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must
have occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would
otherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the bodies
continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the
funerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered.

Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. Then with a
mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other’s
arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was
tender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to Sid and Mary. Sid
snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.

Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly,
and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,
that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.

He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making
broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and
turning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her
sleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the
candle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full
of pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the
candle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.
His face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark
hastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and
straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.

He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large
there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was
tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and
slept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped
into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a
mile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself
stoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for
this was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture
the skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore
legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be
made for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and
entered the woods.

He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep
awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far
spent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the
island bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the
great river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream. A
little later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and
heard Joe say:

“No, Tom’s true-blue, Huck, and he’ll come back. He won’t desert. He
knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom’s too proud for that
sort of thing. He’s up to something or other. Now I wonder what?”

“Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain’t they?”

“Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain’t
back here to breakfast.”

“Which he is!” exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping
grandly into camp.

A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the
boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.
They were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done.
Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the
other pirates got ready to fish and explore.




CHAPTER XVI


After dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar.
They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft
place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes
they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly
round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a
famous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.

After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and
chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until
they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal
water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their
legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.
And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each
other’s faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with
averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and
struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all
went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing,
sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.

When they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry,
hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by
break for the water again and go through the original performance once
more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented
flesh-colored “tights” very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and
had a circus—with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest
post to his neighbor.

Next they got their marbles and played “knucks” and “ringtaw” and
“keeps” till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another
swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off
his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his
ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the
protection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he
had found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to
rest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the “dumps,” and
fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay
drowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing “BECKY” in the sand with
his big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his
weakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He
erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving
the other boys together and joining them.

But Joe’s spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so
homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay
very near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted,
but tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready
to tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he
would have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:

“I bet there’s been pirates on this island before, boys. We’ll explore
it again. They’ve hid treasures here somewhere. How’d you feel to light
on a rotten chest full of gold and silver—hey?”

But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply.
Tom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was
discouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking
very gloomy. Finally he said:

“Oh, boys, let’s give it up. I want to go home. It’s so lonesome.”

“Oh no, Joe, you’ll feel better by and by,” said Tom. “Just think of the
fishing that’s here.”

“I don’t care for fishing. I want to go home.”

“But, Joe, there ain’t such another swimming-place anywhere.”

“Swimming’s no good. I don’t seem to care for it, somehow, when there
ain’t anybody to say I sha’n’t go in. I mean to go home.”

“Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.”

“Yes, I _do_ want to see my mother—and you would, too, if you had one. I
ain’t any more baby than you are.” And Joe snuffled a little.

“Well, we’ll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won’t we, Huck? Poor
thing—does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here,
don’t you, Huck? We’ll stay, won’t we?”

Huck said, “Y-e-s”—without any heart in it.

“I’ll never speak to you again as long as I live,” said Joe, rising.
“There now!” And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.

“Who cares!” said Tom. “Nobody wants you to. Go ’long home and get
laughed at. Oh, you’re a nice pirate. Huck and me ain’t crybabies. We’ll
stay, won’t we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get
along without him, per’aps.”

But Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly
on with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying
Joe’s preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence.
Presently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the
Illinois shore. Tom’s heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck
could not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:

“I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now
it’ll be worse. Let’s us go, too, Tom.”

“I won’t! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.”

“Tom, I better go.”

“Well, go ’long—who’s hendering you.”

Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:

“Tom, I wisht you’d come, too. Now you think it over. We’ll wait for you
when we get to shore.”

“Well, you’ll wait a blame long time, that’s all.”

Huck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a
strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along
too. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It
suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made
one final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades,
yelling:

“Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!”

They presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they
were, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till
at last they saw the “point” he was driving at, and then they set up a
warwhoop of applause and said it was “splendid!” and said if he had
told them at first, they wouldn’t have started away. He made a plausible
excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret
would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had
meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.

The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will,
chattering all the time about Tom’s stupendous plan and admiring the
genius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to
learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to
try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never
smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they “bit” the
tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.

Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,
charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste,
and they gagged a little, but Tom said:

“Why, it’s just as easy! If I’d a knowed this was all, I’d a learnt long
ago.”

“So would I,” said Joe. “It’s just nothing.”

“Why, many a time I’ve looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish
I could do that; but I never thought I could,” said Tom.

“That’s just the way with me, hain’t it, Huck? You’ve heard me talk just
that way—haven’t you, Huck? I’ll leave it to Huck if I haven’t.”

“Yes—heaps of times,” said Huck.

“Well, I have too,” said Tom; “oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the
slaughter-house. Don’t you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and
Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don’t you remember,
Huck, ’bout me saying that?”

“Yes, that’s so,” said Huck. “That was the day after I lost a white
alley. No, ’twas the day before.”

“There—I told you so,” said Tom. “Huck recollects it.”

“I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,” said Joe. “I don’t feel
sick.”

“Neither do I,” said Tom. “I could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff
Thatcher couldn’t.”

“Jeff Thatcher! Why, he’d keel over just with two draws. Just let him
try it once. _He’d_ see!”

“I bet he would. And Johnny Miller—I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle
it once.”

“Oh, don’t I!” said Joe. “Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn’t any more
do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch _him_.”

“’Deed it would, Joe. Say—I wish the boys could see us now.”

“So do I.”

“Say—boys, don’t say anything about it, and some time when they’re
around, I’ll come up to you and say, ‘Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.’
And you’ll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn’t anything, you’ll
say, ‘Yes, I got my _old_ pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain’t
very good.’ And I’ll say, ‘Oh, that’s all right, if it’s _strong_
enough.’ And then you’ll out with the pipes, and we’ll light up just as
ca’m, and then just see ’em look!”

“By jings, that’ll be gay, Tom! I wish it was _now_!”

“So do I! And when we tell ’em we learned when we was off pirating,
won’t they wish they’d been along?”

“Oh, I reckon not! I’ll just _bet_ they will!”

So the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and
grow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously
increased. Every pore inside the boys’ cheeks became a spouting
fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues
fast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their
throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings
followed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,
now. Joe’s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom’s followed. Both
fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and
main. Joe said feebly:

“I’ve lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.”

Tom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:

“I’ll help you. You go over that way and I’ll hunt around by the spring.
No, you needn’t come, Huck—we can find it.”

So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,
and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both
very pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had
had any trouble they had got rid of it.

They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,
and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare
theirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well—something they ate
at dinner had disagreed with them.

About midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding
oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys
huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of
the fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was
stifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued.
Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the
blackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that
vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by
another came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came
sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting
breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit
of the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned
night into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and
distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,
startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling
down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A
sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the
flaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the
forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops
right over the boys’ heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick
gloom that followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves.

“Quick! boys, go for the tent!” exclaimed Tom.

They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no
two plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through
the trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after
another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching
rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the
ground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the
booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one
they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared,
and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something
to be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so
furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest
rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its
fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each
others’ hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter
of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its
highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed
in the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless
distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the
driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on
the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting
veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight
and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging
thunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp,
and unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort
that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to
the treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one
and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be
out in.

But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and
weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The
boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still
something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter
of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were
not under it when the catastrophe happened.

Everything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but
heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against
rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and
chilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently
discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had
been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from
the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they
patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under
sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they
piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were
gladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast,
and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their
midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep
on, anywhere around.

As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over
them, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got
scorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After
the meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once
more. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as
he could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or
anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of
cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was
to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change.
They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were
stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many
zebras—all of them chiefs, of course—and then they went tearing through
the woods to attack an English settlement.

By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each
other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each
other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely
satisfactory one.

They assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now
a difficulty arose—hostile Indians could not break the bread of
hospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple
impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other
process that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished
they had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such
show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and
took their whiff as it passed, in due form.

And behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had
gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without
having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to
be seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high
promise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper,
with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were
prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been
in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We will leave them to
smoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at
present.




CHAPTER XVII


But there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil Saturday
afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly’s family, were being put into
mourning, with great grief and many tears. An unusual quiet possessed
the village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience.
The villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air, and talked
little; but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to
the children. They had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them
up.

In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted
schoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found nothing
there to comfort her. She soliloquized:

“Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven’t got
anything now to remember him by.” And she choked back a little sob.

Presently she stopped, and said to herself:

“It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn’t say
that—I wouldn’t say it for the whole world. But he’s gone now; I’ll
never, never, never see him any more.”

This thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling
down her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls—playmates of Tom’s
and Joe’s—came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and talking
in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw
him, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with awful
prophecy, as they could easily see now!)—and each speaker pointed out
the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and then added
something like “and I was a-standing just so—just as I am now, and as if
you was him—I was as close as that—and he smiled, just this way—and then
something seemed to go all over me, like—awful, you know—and I never
thought what it meant, of course, but I can see now!”

Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and
many claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or
less tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided
who _did_ see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them,
the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance,
and were gaped at and envied by all the rest. One poor chap, who had
no other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the
remembrance:

“Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.”

But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that,
and so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered away,
still recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.

When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell
began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still
Sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush
that lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment
in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there
was no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses
as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. None
could remember when the little church had been so full before. There
was finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly
entered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in
deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose
reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.
There was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled
sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving
hymn was sung, and the text followed: “I am the Resurrection and the
Life.”

As the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the
graces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that
every soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang
in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always
before, and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor
boys. The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the
departed, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the
people could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes
were, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had
seemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The congregation
became more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last
the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus
of anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and
crying in the pulpit.

There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later
the church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above
his handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then another pair
of eyes followed the minister’s, and then almost with one impulse the
congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up
the aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags,
sneaking sheepishly in the rear! They had been hid in the unused gallery
listening to their own funeral sermon!

Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored
ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while
poor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what
to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and
started to slink away, but Tom seized him and said:

“Aunt Polly, it ain’t fair. Somebody’s got to be glad to see Huck.”

“And so they shall. I’m glad to see him, poor motherless thing!” And
the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing
capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.

Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: “Praise God from
whom all blessings flow—_sing_!—and put your hearts in it!”

And they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and
while it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the
envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the
proudest moment of his life.

As the “sold” congregation trooped out they said they would almost be
willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that
once more.

Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day—according to Aunt Polly’s varying
moods—than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew which
expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.




CHAPTER XVIII


That was Tom’s great secret—the scheme to return home with his brother
pirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to the
Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six miles
below the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town
till nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and alleys
and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of
invalided benches.

At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to
Tom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of
talk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:

“Well, I don’t say it wasn’t a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody
suffering ’most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you
could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come over
on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a
hint some way that you warn’t dead, but only run off.”

“Yes, you could have done that, Tom,” said Mary; “and I believe you
would if you had thought of it.”

“Would you, Tom?” said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. “Say,
now, would you, if you’d thought of it?”

“I—well, I don’t know. ’Twould ’a’ spoiled everything.”

“Tom, I hoped you loved me that much,” said Aunt Polly, with a grieved
tone that discomforted the boy. “It would have been something if you’d
cared enough to _think_ of it, even if you didn’t _do_ it.”

“Now, auntie, that ain’t any harm,” pleaded Mary; “it’s only Tom’s giddy
way—he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.”

“More’s the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and
_done_ it, too. Tom, you’ll look back, some day, when it’s too late,
and wish you’d cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so
little.”

“Now, auntie, you know I do care for you,” said Tom.

“I’d know it better if you acted more like it.”

“I wish now I’d thought,” said Tom, with a repentant tone; “but I dreamt
about you, anyway. That’s something, ain’t it?”

“It ain’t much—a cat does that much—but it’s better than nothing. What
did you dream?”

“Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the
bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.”

“Well, so we did. So we always do. I’m glad your dreams could take even
that much trouble about us.”

“And I dreamt that Joe Harper’s mother was here.”

“Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?”

“Oh, lots. But it’s so dim, now.”

“Well, try to recollect—can’t you?”

“Somehow it seems to me that the wind—the wind blowed the—the—”

“Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!”

Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then
said:

“I’ve got it now! I’ve got it now! It blowed the candle!”

“Mercy on us! Go on, Tom—go on!”

“And it seems to me that you said, ‘Why, I believe that that door—’”

“Go _on_, Tom!”

“Just let me study a moment—just a moment. Oh, yes—you said you believed
the door was open.”

“As I’m sitting here, I did! Didn’t I, Mary! Go on!”

“And then—and then—well I won’t be certain, but it seems like as if you
made Sid go and—and—”

“Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?”

“You made him—you—Oh, you made him shut it.”

“Well, for the land’s sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my
days! Don’t tell _me_ there ain’t anything in dreams, any more. Sereny
Harper shall know of this before I’m an hour older. I’d like to see her
get around _this_ with her rubbage ’bout superstition. Go on, Tom!”

“Oh, it’s all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I warn’t
_bad_, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible
than—than—I think it was a colt, or something.”

“And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!”

“And then you began to cry.”

“So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then—”

“Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and
she wished she hadn’t whipped him for taking cream when she’d throwed it
out her own self—”

“Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying—that’s what you
was doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!”

“Then Sid he said—he said—”

“I don’t think I said anything,” said Sid.

“Yes you did, Sid,” said Mary.

“Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?”

“He said—I _think_ he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone
to, but if I’d been better sometimes—”

“_There_, d’you hear that! It was his very words!”

“And you shut him up sharp.”

“I lay I did! There must ’a’ been an angel there. There _was_ an angel
there, somewheres!”

“And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you
told about Peter and the Pain-killer—”

“Just as true as I live!”

“And then there was a whole lot of talk ’bout dragging the river for us,
and ’bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper
hugged and cried, and she went.”

“It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I’m a-sitting in
these very tracks. Tom, you couldn’t told it more like if you’d ’a’ seen
it! And then what? Go on, Tom!”

“Then I thought you prayed for me—and I could see you and hear every
word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and
wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, ‘We ain’t dead—we are only off being
pirates,’ and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked
so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and
kissed you on the lips.”

“Did you, Tom, _did_ you! I just forgive you everything for that!” And
she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the
guiltiest of villains.

“It was very kind, even though it was only a—dream,” Sid soliloquized
just audibly.

“Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he’d do if he was
awake. Here’s a big Milum apple I’ve been saving for you, Tom, if you
was ever found again—now go ’long to school. I’m thankful to the good
God and Father of us all I’ve got you back, that’s long-suffering and
merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness
knows I’m unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings
and had His hand to help them over the rough places, there’s few enough
would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes.
Go ’long Sid, Mary, Tom—take yourselves off—you’ve hendered me long
enough.”

The children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper
and vanquish her realism with Tom’s marvellous dream. Sid had better
judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the
house. It was this: “Pretty thin—as long a dream as that, without any
mistakes in it!”

What a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing,
but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the
public eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see
the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and
drink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as proud
to be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer
at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into
town. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at
all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would have
given anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of his, and his
glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a
circus.

At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered
such eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were
not long in becoming insufferably “stuck-up.” They began to tell their
adventures to hungry listeners—but they only began; it was not a
thing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish
material. And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely
puffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.

Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory
was sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished,
maybe she would be wanting to “make up.” Well, let her—she should see
that he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she
arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group
of boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was
tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,
pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter
when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her
captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye
in his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity
that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only “set him up”
 the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he
knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved
irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and
wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more
particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang
and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her
feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to
a girl almost at Tom’s elbow—with sham vivacity:

“Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn’t you come to Sunday-school?”

“I did come—didn’t you see me?”

“Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?”

“I was in Miss Peters’ class, where I always go. I saw _you_.”

“Did you? Why, it’s funny I didn’t see you. I wanted to tell you about
the picnic.”

“Oh, that’s jolly. Who’s going to give it?”

“My ma’s going to let me have one.”

“Oh, goody; I hope she’ll let _me_ come.”

“Well, she will. The picnic’s for me. She’ll let anybody come that I
want, and I want you.”

“That’s ever so nice. When is it going to be?”

“By and by. Maybe about vacation.”

“Oh, won’t it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?”

“Yes, every one that’s friends to me—or wants to be”; and she glanced
ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence
about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the
great sycamore tree “all to flinders” while he was “standing within
three feet of it.”

“Oh, may I come?” said Grace Miller.

“Yes.”

“And me?” said Sally Rogers.

“Yes.”

“And me, too?” said Susy Harper. “And Joe?”

“Yes.”

And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged
for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still
talking, and took Amy with him. Becky’s lips trembled and the tears
came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on
chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of
everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and
had what her sex call “a good cry.” Then she sat moody, with wounded
pride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast
in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what
_she’d_ do.

At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant
self-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate
her with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden
falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind
the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple—and so
absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,
that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.
Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom’s veins. He began to hate himself for
throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He
called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He
wanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,
for her heart was singing, but Tom’s tongue had lost its function. He
did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly
he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced
as otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and
again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could
not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that
Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the
living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her
fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.

Amy’s happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had
to attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in
vain—the girl chirped on. Tom thought, “Oh, hang her, ain’t I ever going
to get rid of her?” At last he must be attending to those things—and she
said artlessly that she would be “around” when school let out. And he
hastened away, hating her for it.

“Any other boy!” Tom thought, grating his teeth. “Any boy in the whole
town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is
aristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw this
town, mister, and I’ll lick you again! You just wait till I catch you
out! I’ll just take and—”

And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy—pummelling
the air, and kicking and gouging. “Oh, you do, do you? You holler
’nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!” And so the imaginary
flogging was finished to his satisfaction.

Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy’s
grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other
distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the
minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to
cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absentmindedness followed,
and then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at
a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew
entirely miserable and wished she hadn’t carried it so far. When
poor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept
exclaiming: “Oh, here’s a jolly one! look at this!” she lost patience at
last, and said, “Oh, don’t bother me! I don’t care for them!” and burst
into tears, and got up and walked away.

Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she
said:

“Go away and leave me alone, can’t you! I hate you!”

So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done—for she had said
she would look at pictures all through the nooning—and she walked on,
crying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was
humiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth—the girl
had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.
He was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.
He wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much
risk to himself. Tom’s spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his
opportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and
poured ink upon the page.

Becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,
and moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now,
intending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their
troubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she
had changed her mind. The thought of Tom’s treatment of her when she was
talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame.
She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book’s
account, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.




CHAPTER XIX


Tom arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said
to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising
market:

“Tom, I’ve a notion to skin you alive!”

“Auntie, what have I done?”

“Well, you’ve done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old
softy, expecting I’m going to make her believe all that rubbage about
that dream, when lo and behold you she’d found out from Joe that you was
over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don’t know
what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so
bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool
of myself and never say a word.”

This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had
seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked
mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to
say for a moment. Then he said:

“Auntie, I wish I hadn’t done it—but I didn’t think.”

“Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your
own selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from
Jackson’s Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could
think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn’t ever think
to pity us and save us from sorrow.”

“Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn’t mean to be mean. I didn’t,
honest. And besides, I didn’t come over here to laugh at you that
night.”

“What did you come for, then?”

“It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn’t got
drownded.”

“Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could
believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never
did—and I know it, Tom.”

“Indeed and ’deed I did, auntie—I wish I may never stir if I didn’t.”

“Oh, Tom, don’t lie—don’t do it. It only makes things a hundred times
worse.”

“It ain’t a lie, auntie; it’s the truth. I wanted to keep you from
grieving—that was all that made me come.”

“I’d give the whole world to believe that—it would cover up a power
of sins, Tom. I’d ’most be glad you’d run off and acted so bad. But it
ain’t reasonable; because, why didn’t you tell me, child?”

“Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all
full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn’t
somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and
kept mum.”

“What bark?”

“The bark I had wrote on to tell you we’d gone pirating. I wish, now,
you’d waked up when I kissed you—I do, honest.”

The hard lines in his aunt’s face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned
in her eyes.

“_Did_ you kiss me, Tom?”

“Why, yes, I did.”

“Are you sure you did, Tom?”

“Why, yes, I did, auntie—certain sure.”

“What did you kiss me for, Tom?”

“Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.”

The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in
her voice when she said:

“Kiss me again, Tom!—and be off with you to school, now, and don’t
bother me any more.”

The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a
jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her
hand, and said to herself:

“No, I don’t dare. Poor boy, I reckon he’s lied about it—but it’s a
blessed, blessed lie, there’s such a comfort come from it. I hope
the Lord—I _know_ the Lord will forgive him, because it was such
good-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don’t want to find out it’s a
lie. I won’t look.”

She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out
her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more
she ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought:
“It’s a good lie—it’s a good lie—I won’t let it grieve me.” So she
sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom’s piece of
bark through flowing tears and saying: “I could forgive the boy, now, if
he’d committed a million sins!”




CHAPTER XX


There was something about Aunt Polly’s manner, when she kissed Tom, that
swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again. He
started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the
head of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner. Without a
moment’s hesitation he ran to her and said:

“I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I’m so sorry. I won’t ever, ever
do that way again, as long as ever I live—please make up, won’t you?”

The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:

“I’ll thank you to keep yourself _to_ yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I’ll
never speak to you again.”

She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not
even presence of mind enough to say “Who cares, Miss Smarty?” until the
right time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a
fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were
a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently
encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled
one in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in
her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to “take in,”
 she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book.
If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple, Tom’s
offensive fling had driven it entirely away.

Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.
The master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied
ambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but
poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village
schoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and
absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept
that book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was
perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy
and girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories
were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.
Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she
noticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She
glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the
book in her hands. The titlepage—Professor Somebody’s _Anatomy_—carried
no information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She came at
once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece—a human figure,
stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer
stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky
snatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the
pictured page half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk,
turned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.

“Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person
and look at what they’re looking at.”

“How could I know you was looking at anything?”

“You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you’re
going to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I’ll be
whipped, and I never was whipped in school.”

Then she stamped her little foot and said:

“_Be_ so mean if you want to! I know something that’s going to happen.
You just wait and you’ll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!”—and she flung
out of the house with a new explosion of crying.

Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said
to himself:

“What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in
school! Shucks! What’s a licking! That’s just like a girl—they’re so
thin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain’t going to tell
old Dobbins on this little fool, because there’s other ways of getting
even on her, that ain’t so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask
who it was tore his book. Nobody’ll answer. Then he’ll do just the way
he always does—ask first one and then t’other, and when he comes to the
right girl he’ll know it, without any telling. Girls’ faces always tell
on them. They ain’t got any backbone. She’ll get licked. Well, it’s a
kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain’t any way
out of it.” Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: “All
right, though; she’d like to see me in just such a fix—let her sweat it
out!”

Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the
master arrived and school “took in.” Tom did not feel a strong interest
in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls’ side of the
room Becky’s face troubled him. Considering all things, he did not want
to pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He could get
up no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently the
spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom’s mind was entirely full
of his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her
lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She
did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he
spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only
seemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad
of that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she
was not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse
to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced
herself to keep still—because, said she to herself, “he’ll tell about me
tearing the picture sure. I wouldn’t say a word, not to save his life!”

Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all
broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly
upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout—he
had denied it for form’s sake and because it was custom, and had stuck
to the denial from principle.

A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air
was drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened
himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book,
but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the
pupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched
his movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently
for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!
Tom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit
look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot
his quarrel with her. Quick—something must be done! done in a flash,
too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.
Good!—he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring
through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little
instant, and the chance was lost—the master opened the volume. If Tom
only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help
for Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.
Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even
the innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten—the
master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: “Who tore this book?”

There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness
continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.

“Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?”

A denial. Another pause.

“Joseph Harper, did you?”

Another denial. Tom’s uneasiness grew more and more intense under the
slow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of
boys—considered a while, then turned to the girls:

“Amy Lawrence?”

A shake of the head.

“Gracie Miller?”

The same sign.

“Susan Harper, did you do this?”

Another negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling
from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the
situation.

“Rebecca Thatcher” [Tom glanced at her face—it was white with
terror]—“did you tear—no, look me in the face” [her hands rose in
appeal]—“did you tear this book?”

A thought shot like lightning through Tom’s brain. He sprang to his feet
and shouted—“I done it!”

The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a
moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward
to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that
shone upon him out of poor Becky’s eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred
floggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without
an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever
administered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a
command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed—for he
knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not
count the tedious time as loss, either.

Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for
with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own
treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to
pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky’s latest words
lingering dreamily in his ear—

“Tom, how _could_ you be so noble!”




CHAPTER XXI


Vacation was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer
and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good
showing on “Examination” day. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle
now—at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young
ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins’ lashings
were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a
perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there
was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached,
all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a
vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence
was, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and
their nights in plotting revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do
the master a mischief. But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution
that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that
the boys always retired from the field badly worsted. At last they
conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory.
They swore in the signpainter’s boy, told him the scheme, and asked his
help. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded
in his father’s family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him.
The master’s wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and
there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always
prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and
the signpainter’s boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper
condition on Examination Evening he would “manage the thing” while he
napped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time
and hurried away to school.

In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in
the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with
wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in
his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.
He was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and
six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town
and by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of
citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the
scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of
small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;
rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in
lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their
grandmothers’ ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and
the flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with
non-participating scholars.

The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited,
“You’d scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,”
 etc.—accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic
gestures which a machine might have used—supposing the machine to be a
trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared,
and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and
retired.

A little shamefaced girl lisped, “Mary had a little lamb,” etc.,
performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and
sat down flushed and happy.

Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into
the unquenchable and indestructible “Give me liberty or give me death”
 speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the
middle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under
him and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the
house but he had the house’s silence, too, which was even worse than
its sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom
struggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak
attempt at applause, but it died early.

“The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck” followed; also “The Assyrian Came
Down,” and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises,
and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The
prime feature of the evening was in order, now—original “compositions”
by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the
platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty
ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to “expression”
and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon
similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and
doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the
Crusades. “Friendship” was one; “Memories of Other Days”; “Religion in
History”; “Dream Land”; “The Advantages of Culture”; “Forms of Political
Government Compared and Contrasted”; “Melancholy”; “Filial Love”; “Heart
Longings,” etc., etc.

A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted
melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of “fine language”;
another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words
and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that
conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable
sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of
them. No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was
made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious
mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of
these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the
fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will
be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in all
our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their
compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the
most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the
longest and the most relentlessly pious. But enough of this. Homely
truth is unpalatable.

Let us return to the “Examination.” The first composition that was read
was one entitled “Is this, then, Life?” Perhaps the reader can endure an
extract from it:

“In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the
youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity!
Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the
voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, ‘the
observed of all observers.’ Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes,
is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest,
her step is lightest in the gay assembly.

“In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour
arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has
had such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her
enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the last. But
after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is
vanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly
upon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and with wasted health
and imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly
pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!”

And so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to
time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of “How
sweet!” “How eloquent!” “So true!” etc., and after the thing had closed
with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.

Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the “interesting”
 paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a “poem.” Two
stanzas of it will do:

“A MISSOURI MAIDEN’S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA

“Alabama, goodbye! I love thee well!
    But yet for a while do I leave thee now!
Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,
    And burning recollections throng my brow!
For I have wandered through thy flowery woods;
    Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa’s stream;
Have listened to Tallassee’s warring floods,
    And wooed on Coosa’s side Aurora’s beam.

“Yet shame I not to bear an o’erfull heart,
    Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;
’Tis from no stranger land I now must part,
    ’Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.
Welcome and home were mine within this State,
    Whose vales I leave—whose spires fade fast from me
And cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tête,
    When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!”

There were very few there who knew what “_tête_” meant, but the poem
was very satisfactory, nevertheless.

Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady,
who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began
to read in a measured, solemn tone:

                              A VISION

Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single
star quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly
vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry
mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the power
exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous
winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered
about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.

At such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit
sighed; but instead thereof,

     ‘My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide—
     My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,’ came to my side.

She moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks
of fancy’s Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned
save by her own transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it
failed to make even a sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by
her genial touch, as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided
away unperceived—unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features,
like icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the
contending elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings
presented.

This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a
sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took
the first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest
effort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize
to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by
far the most “eloquent” thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel
Webster himself might well be proud of it.

It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which
the word “beauteous” was over-fondled, and human experience referred to
as “life’s page,” was up to the usual average.

Now the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair
aside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of
America on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he
made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter
rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to
right it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted
them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his
entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down
by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined
he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly
increased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced with
a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat,
suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about
her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she
curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed
at the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher—the cat was
within six inches of the absorbed teacher’s head—down, down, a little
lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it,
and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still
in her possession! And how the light did blaze abroad from the master’s
bald pate—for the signpainter’s boy had _gilded_ it!

That broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.

[*] NOTE:—The pretended “compositions” quoted in this chapter are taken
without alteration from a volume entitled “Prose and Poetry, by a
Western Lady”—but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl
pattern, and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be.




CHAPTER XXII


Tom joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the
showy character of their “regalia.” He promised to abstain from smoking,
chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he found out
a new thing—namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way
in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon
found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire
grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display
himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth
of July was coming; but he soon gave that up—gave it up before he had
worn his shackles over forty-eight hours—and fixed his hopes upon old
Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed
and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official.
During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge’s condition
and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high—so high that
he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the
looking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating.
At last he was pronounced upon the mend—and then convalescent. Tom was
disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation
at once—and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom
resolved that he would never trust a man like that again.

The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated
to kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again,
however—there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now—but
found to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he
could, took the desire away, and the charm of it.

Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning
to hang a little heavily on his hands.

He attempted a diary—but nothing happened during three days, and so he
abandoned it.

The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a
sensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were happy
for two days.

Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained
hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man
in the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States
Senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment—for he was not
twenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.

A circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents
made of rag carpeting—admission, three pins for boys, two for girls—and
then circusing was abandoned.

A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came—and went again and left the village
duller and drearier than ever.

There were some boys-and-girls’ parties, but they were so few and so
delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.

Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her
parents during vacation—so there was no bright side to life anywhere.

The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very
cancer for permanency and pain.

Then came the measles.

During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its
happenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got
upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown, a melancholy change had
come over everything and every creature. There had been a “revival,” and
everybody had “got religion,” not only the adults, but even the boys and
girls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed
sinful face, but disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Joe
Harper studying a Testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing
spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him visiting the poor with a
basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his attention to
the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. Every boy
he encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in
desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn
and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he
crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost,
forever and forever.

And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful
claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his head
with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for
he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him.
He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the
extremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might have
seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a
battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the
getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from
under an insect like himself.

By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its
object. The boy’s first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His
second was to wait—for there might not be any more storms.

The next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks he
spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad
at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how
lonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted
listlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a
juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her
victim, a bird. He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a
stolen melon. Poor lads! they—like Tom—had suffered a relapse.




CHAPTER XXIII


At last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred—and vigorously: the murder
trial came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village
talk immediately. Tom could not get away from it. Every reference to
the murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience
and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in
his hearing as “feelers”; he did not see how he could be suspected of
knowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable
in the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the time.
He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It would be some
relief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of
distress with another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself
that Huck had remained discreet.

“Huck, have you ever told anybody about—that?”

“’Bout what?”

“You know what.”

“Oh—’course I haven’t.”

“Never a word?”

“Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?”

“Well, I was afeard.”

“Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn’t be alive two days if that got found out.
_You_ know that.”

Tom felt more comfortable. After a pause:

“Huck, they couldn’t anybody get you to tell, could they?”

“Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they
could get me to tell. They ain’t no different way.”

“Well, that’s all right, then. I reckon we’re safe as long as we keep
mum. But let’s swear again, anyway. It’s more surer.”

“I’m agreed.”

So they swore again with dread solemnities.

“What is the talk around, Huck? I’ve heard a power of it.”

“Talk? Well, it’s just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the
time. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so’s I want to hide som’ers.”

“That’s just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he’s a goner.
Don’t you feel sorry for him, sometimes?”

“Most always—most always. He ain’t no account; but then he hain’t ever
done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to
get drunk on—and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do
that—leastways most of us—preachers and such like. But he’s kind of
good—he give me half a fish, once, when there warn’t enough for two; and
lots of times he’s kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.”

“Well, he’s mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line.
I wish we could get him out of there.”

“My! we couldn’t get him out, Tom. And besides, ’twouldn’t do any good;
they’d ketch him again.”

“Yes—so they would. But I hate to hear ’em abuse him so like the dickens
when he never done—that.”

“I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear ’em say he’s the bloodiest looking villain
in this country, and they wonder he wasn’t ever hung before.”

“Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I’ve heard ’em say that if he
was to get free they’d lynch him.”

“And they’d do it, too.”

The boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the
twilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood
of the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that
something would happen that might clear away their difficulties. But
nothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in
this luckless captive.

The boys did as they had often done before—went to the cell grating and
gave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor and
there were no guards.

His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences
before—it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and
treacherous to the last degree when Potter said:

“You’ve been mighty good to me, boys—better’n anybody else in this town.
And I don’t forget it, I don’t. Often I says to myself, says I, ‘I used
to mend all the boys’ kites and things, and show ’em where the good
fishin’ places was, and befriend ’em what I could, and now they’ve
all forgot old Muff when he’s in trouble; but Tom don’t, and Huck
don’t—_they_ don’t forget him,’ says I, ‘and I don’t forget them.’ Well,
boys, I done an awful thing—drunk and crazy at the time—that’s the only
way I account for it—and now I got to swing for it, and it’s right.
Right, and _best_, too, I reckon—hope so, anyway. Well, we won’t talk
about that. I don’t want to make _you_ feel bad; you’ve befriended me.
But what I want to say, is, don’t _you_ ever get drunk—then you won’t
ever get here. Stand a litter furder west—so—that’s it; it’s a prime
comfort to see faces that’s friendly when a body’s in such a muck
of trouble, and there don’t none come here but yourn. Good friendly
faces—good friendly faces. Git up on one another’s backs and let me
touch ’em. That’s it. Shake hands—yourn’ll come through the bars, but
mine’s too big. Little hands, and weak—but they’ve helped Muff Potter a
power, and they’d help him more if they could.”

Tom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors.
The next day and the day after, he hung about the courtroom, drawn by an
almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out.
Huck was having the same experience. They studiously avoided each other.
Each wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination
always brought them back presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers
sauntered out of the courtroom, but invariably heard distressing
news—the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor
Potter. At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect
that Injun Joe’s evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was
not the slightest question as to what the jury’s verdict would be.

Tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He
was in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to
sleep. All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning, for
this was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented
in the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took
their places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and
hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all
the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,
stolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and
the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings
among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These
details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation
that was as impressive as it was fascinating.

Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing
in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was
discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After some further
questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:

“Take the witness.”

The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when
his own counsel said:

“I have no questions to ask him.”

The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.
Counsel for the prosecution said:

“Take the witness.”

“I have no questions to ask him,” Potter’s lawyer replied.

A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter’s
possession.

“Take the witness.”

Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience
began to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his
client’s life without an effort?

Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter’s guilty behavior when
brought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the stand
without being cross-questioned.

Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the
graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was
brought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined
by Potter’s lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house
expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.
Counsel for the prosecution now said:

“By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have
fastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the
unhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.”

A groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and
rocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned
in the courtroom. Many men were moved, and many women’s compassion
testified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:

“Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we
foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed
while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced
by drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer that plea.” [Then
to the clerk:] “Call Thomas Sawyer!”

A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting
Potter’s. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as
he rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked wild enough,
for he was badly scared. The oath was administered.

“Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the
hour of midnight?”

Tom glanced at Injun Joe’s iron face and his tongue failed him. The
audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few
moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed
to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:

“In the graveyard!”

“A little bit louder, please. Don’t be afraid. You were—”

“In the graveyard.”

A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe’s face.

“Were you anywhere near Horse Williams’ grave?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Speak up—just a trifle louder. How near were you?”

“Near as I am to you.”

“Were you hidden, or not?”

“I was hid.”

“Where?”

“Behind the elms that’s on the edge of the grave.”

Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.

“Any one with you?”

“Yes, sir. I went there with—”

“Wait—wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion’s name. We
will produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with
you.”

Tom hesitated and looked confused.

“Speak out, my boy—don’t be diffident. The truth is always respectable.
What did you take there?”

“Only a—a—dead cat.”

There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.

“We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us
everything that occurred—tell it in your own way—don’t skip anything,
and don’t be afraid.”

Tom began—hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his
words flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased
but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and
bated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time,
rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent
emotion reached its climax when the boy said:

“—and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell, Injun
Joe jumped with the knife and—”

Crash! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window, tore his
way through all opposers, and was gone!




CHAPTER XXIV


Tom was a glittering hero once more—the pet of the old, the envy of the
young. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper
magnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet,
if he escaped hanging.

As usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom
and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort
of conduct is to the world’s credit; therefore it is not well to find
fault with it.

Tom’s days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights
were seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always
with doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy
to stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of
wretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer
the night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid
that his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding
Injun Joe’s flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.
The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of
that? Since Tom’s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the
lawyer’s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had
been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck’s
confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated.

Daily Muff Potter’s gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly
he wished he had sealed up his tongue.

Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the
other half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a
safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.

Rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun
Joe was found. One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels, a
detective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked
wise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that
craft usually achieve. That is to say, he “found a clew.” But you can’t
hang a “clew” for murder, and so after that detective had got through
and gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.

The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened
weight of apprehension.




CHAPTER XXV


There comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy’s life when he has
a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This desire
suddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find Joe Harper,
but failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone fishing.
Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck would
answer. Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him
confidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was always willing to take a hand
in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital,
for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is
not money. “Where’ll we dig?” said Huck.

“Oh, most anywhere.”

“Why, is it hid all around?”

“No, indeed it ain’t. It’s hid in mighty particular places,
Huck—sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of
a limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but
mostly under the floor in ha’nted houses.”

“Who hides it?”

“Why, robbers, of course—who’d you reckon? Sunday-school
sup’rintendents?”

“I don’t know. If ’twas mine I wouldn’t hide it; I’d spend it and have a
good time.”

“So would I. But robbers don’t do that way. They always hide it and
leave it there.”

“Don’t they come after it any more?”

“No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or else
they die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and
by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks—a
paper that’s got to be ciphered over about a week because it’s mostly
signs and hy’roglyphics.”

“Hyro—which?”

“Hy’roglyphics—pictures and things, you know, that don’t seem to mean
anything.”

“Have you got one of them papers, Tom?”

“No.”

“Well then, how you going to find the marks?”

“I don’t want any marks. They always bury it under a ha’nted house or on
an island, or under a dead tree that’s got one limb sticking out. Well,
we’ve tried Jackson’s Island a little, and we can try it again some
time; and there’s the old ha’nted house up the Still-House branch, and
there’s lots of dead-limb trees—dead loads of ’em.”

“Is it under all of them?”

“How you talk! No!”

“Then how you going to know which one to go for?”

“Go for all of ’em!”

“Why, Tom, it’ll take all summer.”

“Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars
in it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di’monds. How’s
that?”

Huck’s eyes glowed.

“That’s bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred
dollars and I don’t want no di’monds.”

“All right. But I bet you I ain’t going to throw off on di’monds. Some
of ’em’s worth twenty dollars apiece—there ain’t any, hardly, but’s
worth six bits or a dollar.”

“No! Is that so?”

“Cert’nly—anybody’ll tell you so. Hain’t you ever seen one, Huck?”

“Not as I remember.”

“Oh, kings have slathers of them.”

“Well, I don’ know no kings, Tom.”

“I reckon you don’t. But if you was to go to Europe you’d see a raft of
’em hopping around.”

“Do they hop?”

“Hop?—your granny! No!”

“Well, what did you say they did, for?”

“Shucks, I only meant you’d _see_ ’em—not hopping, of course—what do
they want to hop for?—but I mean you’d just see ’em—scattered around,
you know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard.”

“Richard? What’s his other name?”

“He didn’t have any other name. Kings don’t have any but a given name.”

“No?”

“But they don’t.”

“Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don’t want to be a king
and have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say—where you going
to dig first?”

“Well, I don’t know. S’pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the
hill t’other side of Still-House branch?”

“I’m agreed.”

So they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their
three-mile tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves
down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.

“I like this,” said Tom.

“So do I.”

“Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your
share?”

“Well, I’ll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I’ll go to every
circus that comes along. I bet I’ll have a gay time.”

“Well, ain’t you going to save any of it?”

“Save it? What for?”

“Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by.”

“Oh, that ain’t any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day
and get his claws on it if I didn’t hurry up, and I tell you he’d clean
it out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn, Tom?”

“I’m going to buy a new drum, and a sure’nough sword, and a red necktie
and a bull pup, and get married.”

“Married!”

“That’s it.”

“Tom, you—why, you ain’t in your right mind.”

“Wait—you’ll see.”

“Well, that’s the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my
mother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty
well.”

“That ain’t anything. The girl I’m going to marry won’t fight.”

“Tom, I reckon they’re all alike. They’ll all comb a body. Now you
better think ’bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What’s the name
of the gal?”

“It ain’t a gal at all—it’s a girl.”

“It’s all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl—both’s
right, like enough. Anyway, what’s her name, Tom?”

“I’ll tell you some time—not now.”

“All right—that’ll do. Only if you get married I’ll be more lonesomer
than ever.”

“No you won’t. You’ll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and
we’ll go to digging.”

They worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled another
halfhour. Still no result. Huck said:

“Do they always bury it as deep as this?”

“Sometimes—not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven’t got the right
place.”

So they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little,
but still they made progress. They pegged away in silence for some time.
Finally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from his
brow with his sleeve, and said:

“Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?”

“I reckon maybe we’ll tackle the old tree that’s over yonder on Cardiff
Hill back of the widow’s.”

“I reckon that’ll be a good one. But won’t the widow take it away from
us, Tom? It’s on her land.”

“_She_ take it away! Maybe she’d like to try it once. Whoever finds one
of these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don’t make any difference
whose land it’s on.”

That was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said:

“Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?”

“It is mighty curious, Huck. I don’t understand it. Sometimes witches
interfere. I reckon maybe that’s what’s the trouble now.”

“Shucks! Witches ain’t got no power in the daytime.”

“Well, that’s so. I didn’t think of that. Oh, I know what the matter is!
What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow
of the limb falls at midnight, and that’s where you dig!”

“Then consound it, we’ve fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang
it all, we got to come back in the night. It’s an awful long way. Can
you get out?”

“I bet I will. We’ve got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees
these holes they’ll know in a minute what’s here and they’ll go for it.”

“Well, I’ll come around and maow tonight.”

“All right. Let’s hide the tools in the bushes.”

The boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in
the shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by
old traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked
in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the
distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were
subdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged
that twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to
dig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and
their industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened,
but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon
something, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone
or a chunk. At last Tom said:

“It ain’t any use, Huck, we’re wrong again.”

“Well, but we _can’t_ be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.”

“I know it, but then there’s another thing.”

“What’s that?”

“Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too
early.”

Huck dropped his shovel.

“That’s it,” said he. “That’s the very trouble. We got to give this one
up. We can’t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing’s
too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering
around so. I feel as if something’s behind me all the time; and I’m
afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there’s others in front a-waiting for
a chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.”

“Well, I’ve been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a
dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.”

“Lordy!”

“Yes, they do. I’ve always heard that.”

“Tom, I don’t like to fool around much where there’s dead people. A
body’s bound to get into trouble with ’em, sure.”

“I don’t like to stir ’em up, either. S’pose this one here was to stick
his skull out and say something!”

“Don’t Tom! It’s awful.”

“Well, it just is. Huck, I don’t feel comfortable a bit.”

“Say, Tom, let’s give this place up, and try somewheres else.”

“All right, I reckon we better.”

“What’ll it be?”

Tom considered awhile; and then said:

“The ha’nted house. That’s it!”

“Blame it, I don’t like ha’nted houses, Tom. Why, they’re a dern sight
worse’n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don’t come
sliding around in a shroud, when you ain’t noticing, and peep over your
shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I
couldn’t stand such a thing as that, Tom—nobody could.”

“Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don’t travel around only at night. They won’t
hender us from digging there in the daytime.”

“Well, that’s so. But you know mighty well people don’t go about that
ha’nted house in the day nor the night.”

“Well, that’s mostly because they don’t like to go where a man’s been
murdered, anyway—but nothing’s ever been seen around that house except
in the night—just some blue lights slipping by the windows—no regular
ghosts.”

“Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom,
you can bet there’s a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason.
Becuz you know that they don’t anybody but ghosts use ’em.”

“Yes, that’s so. But anyway they don’t come around in the daytime, so
what’s the use of our being afeard?”

“Well, all right. We’ll tackle the ha’nted house if you say so—but I
reckon it’s taking chances.”

They had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle of the
moonlit valley below them stood the “ha’nted” house, utterly isolated,
its fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the
chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof
caved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit
past a window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the
circumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted
house a wide berth, and took their way homeward through the woods that
adorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.




CHAPTER XXVI


About noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come
for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was
measurably so, also—but suddenly said:

“Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?”

Tom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his
eyes with a startled look in them—

“My! I never once thought of it, Huck!”

“Well, I didn’t neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was
Friday.”

“Blame it, a body can’t be too careful, Huck. We might ’a’ got into an
awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.”

“_Might_! Better say we _would_! There’s some lucky days, maybe, but
Friday ain’t.”

“Any fool knows that. I don’t reckon _you_ was the first that found it
out, Huck.”

“Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain’t all, neither. I had a
rotten bad dream last night—dreampt about rats.”

“No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?”

“No.”

“Well, that’s good, Huck. When they don’t fight it’s only a sign that
there’s trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty
sharp and keep out of it. We’ll drop this thing for today, and play. Do
you know Robin Hood, Huck?”

“No. Who’s Robin Hood?”

“Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England—and the
best. He was a robber.”

“Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?”

“Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But
he never bothered the poor. He loved ’em. He always divided up with ’em
perfectly square.”

“Well, he must ’a’ been a brick.”

“I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was.
They ain’t any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in
England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow
and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.”

“What’s a _yew_ bow?”

“I don’t know. It’s some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that
dime only on the edge he would set down and cry—and curse. But we’ll
play Robin Hood—it’s nobby fun. I’ll learn you.”

“I’m agreed.”

So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a
yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the
morrow’s prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink
into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows
of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff
Hill.

On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again.
They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their
last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were
so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down
within six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and
turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this
time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling
that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the
requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.

When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and
grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun,
and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the
place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they
crept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown,
floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows,
a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and
abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened
pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound,
and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.

In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the
place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own
boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look upstairs.
This was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring
each other, and of course there could be but one result—they threw their
tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of
decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the
promise was a fraud—there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now
and well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work when—

“Sh!” said Tom.

“What is it?” whispered Huck, blanching with fright.

“Sh!... There!... Hear it?”

“Yes!... Oh, my! Let’s run!”

“Keep still! Don’t you budge! They’re coming right toward the door.”

The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to
knotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.

“They’ve stopped.... No—coming.... Here they are. Don’t whisper another
word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!”

Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: “There’s the old deaf and
dumb Spaniard that’s been about town once or twice lately—never saw
t’other man before.”

“T’other” was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant
in his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white
whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore
green goggles. When they came in, “t’other” was talking in a low voice;
they sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the
wall, and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became less
guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:

“No,” said he, “I’ve thought it all over, and I don’t like it. It’s
dangerous.”

“Dangerous!” grunted the “deaf and dumb” Spaniard—to the vast surprise
of the boys. “Milksop!”

This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe’s! There was
silence for some time. Then Joe said:

“What’s any more dangerous than that job up yonder—but nothing’s come of
it.”

“That’s different. Away up the river so, and not another house about.
’Twon’t ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn’t succeed.”

“Well, what’s more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!—anybody
would suspicion us that saw us.”

“I know that. But there warn’t any other place as handy after that fool
of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it
warn’t any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys
playing over there on the hill right in full view.”

“Those infernal boys” quaked again under the inspiration of this remark,
and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and
concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had waited a
year.

The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and
thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:

“Look here, lad—you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there
till you hear from me. I’ll take the chances on dropping into this town
just once more, for a look. We’ll do that ‘dangerous’ job after I’ve
spied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas!
We’ll leg it together!”

This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe
said:

“I’m dead for sleep! It’s your turn to watch.”

He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred
him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to
nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.

The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:

“Now’s our chance—come!”

Huck said:

“I can’t—I’d die if they was to wake.”

Tom urged—Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and
started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak
from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never
made a second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging moments
till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray;
and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.

Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around—smiled grimly upon
his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees—stirred him up with
his foot and said:

“Here! _You’re_ a watchman, ain’t you! All right, though—nothing’s
happened.”

“My! have I been asleep?”

“Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What’ll we
do with what little swag we’ve got left?”

“I don’t know—leave it here as we’ve always done, I reckon. No use to
take it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver’s
something to carry.”

“Well—all right—it won’t matter to come here once more.”

“No—but I’d say come in the night as we used to do—it’s better.”

“Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right
chance at that job; accidents might happen; ’tain’t in such a very good
place; we’ll just regularly bury it—and bury it deep.”

“Good idea,” said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down,
raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled
pleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself
and as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on
his knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.

The boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. With
gloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck!—the splendor of it was
beyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make
half a dozen boys rich! Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest
auspices—there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to
dig. They nudged each other every moment—eloquent nudges and easily
understood, for they simply meant—“Oh, but ain’t you glad _now_ we’re
here!”

Joe’s knife struck upon something.

“Hello!” said he.

“What is it?” said his comrade.

“Half-rotten plank—no, it’s a box, I believe. Here—bear a hand and we’ll
see what it’s here for. Never mind, I’ve broke a hole.”

He reached his hand in and drew it out—

“Man, it’s money!”

The two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys
above were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.

Joe’s comrade said:

“We’ll make quick work of this. There’s an old rusty pick over amongst
the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace—I saw it a
minute ago.”

He ran and brought the boys’ pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the
pick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to
himself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was
not very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the
slow years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in
blissful silence.

“Pard, there’s thousands of dollars here,” said Injun Joe.

“’Twas always said that Murrel’s gang used to be around here one
summer,” the stranger observed.

“I know it,” said Injun Joe; “and this looks like it, I should say.”

“Now you won’t need to do that job.”

The halfbreed frowned. Said he:

“You don’t know me. Least you don’t know all about that thing. ’Tain’t
robbery altogether—it’s _revenge_!” and a wicked light flamed in his
eyes. “I’ll need your help in it. When it’s finished—then Texas. Go home
to your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.”

“Well—if you say so; what’ll we do with this—bury it again?”

“Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] _No_! by the great Sachem, no!
[Profound distress overhead.] I’d nearly forgot. That pick had fresh
earth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What business
has a pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth on
them? Who brought them here—and where are they gone? Have you heard
anybody?—seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and
see the ground disturbed? Not exactly—not exactly. We’ll take it to my
den.”

“Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number
One?”

“No—Number Two—under the cross. The other place is bad—too common.”

“All right. It’s nearly dark enough to start.”

Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping
out. Presently he said:

“Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be
upstairs?”

The boys’ breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife,
halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The
boys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came
creaking up the stairs—the intolerable distress of the situation woke
the stricken resolution of the lads—they were about to spring for the
closet, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on
the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself
up cursing, and his comrade said:

“Now what’s the use of all that? If it’s anybody, and they’re up there,
let them _stay_ there—who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and get
into trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes—and then
let them follow us if they want to. I’m willing. In my opinion, whoever
hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or
devils or something. I’ll bet they’re running yet.”

Joe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight
was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving.
Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening
twilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.

Tom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them
through the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not they. They
were content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take the
townward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were too much
absorbed in hating themselves—hating the ill luck that made them take
the spade and the pick there. But for that, Injun Joe never would have
suspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait
there till his “revenge” was satisfied, and then he would have had the
misfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that
the tools were ever brought there!

They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to
town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to
“Number Two,” wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred to
Tom.

“Revenge? What if he means _us_, Huck!”

“Oh, don’t!” said Huck, nearly fainting.

They talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe
that he might possibly mean somebody else—at least that he might at
least mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.

Very, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company
would be a palpable improvement, he thought.




CHAPTER XXVII


The adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom’s dreams that night.
Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times
it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and
wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay
in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he
noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away—somewhat as if
they had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it
occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There
was one very strong argument in favor of this idea—namely, that the
quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen
as much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of
his age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to
“hundreds” and “thousands” were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that
no such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for
a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in
actual money in any one’s possession. If his notions of hidden treasure
had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of
real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.

But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer
under the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found
himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a
dream, after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a
hurried breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale
of a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking
very melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If
he did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a
dream.

“Hello, Huck!”

“Hello, yourself.”

Silence, for a minute.

“Tom, if we’d ’a’ left the blame tools at the dead tree, we’d ’a’ got
the money. Oh, ain’t it awful!”

“’Tain’t a dream, then, ’tain’t a dream! Somehow I most wish it was.
Dog’d if I don’t, Huck.”

“What ain’t a dream?”

“Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.”

“Dream! If them stairs hadn’t broke down you’d ’a’ seen how much dream
it was! I’ve had dreams enough all night—with that patch-eyed Spanish
devil going for me all through ’em—rot him!”

“No, not rot him. _Find_ him! Track the money!”

“Tom, we’ll never find him. A feller don’t have only one chance for such
a pile—and that one’s lost. I’d feel mighty shaky if I was to see him,
anyway.”

“Well, so’d I; but I’d like to see him, anyway—and track him out—to his
Number Two.”

“Number Two—yes, that’s it. I been thinking ’bout that. But I can’t make
nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?”

“I dono. It’s too deep. Say, Huck—maybe it’s the number of a house!”

“Goody!... No, Tom, that ain’t it. If it is, it ain’t in this one-horse
town. They ain’t no numbers here.”

“Well, that’s so. Lemme think a minute. Here—it’s the number of a
room—in a tavern, you know!”

“Oh, that’s the trick! They ain’t only two taverns. We can find out
quick.”

“You stay here, Huck, till I come.”

Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck’s company in public
places. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No.
2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied.
In the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper’s
young son said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody
go into it or come out of it except at night; he did not know any
particular reason for this state of things; had had some little
curiosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery
by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was “ha’nted”; had
noticed that there was a light in there the night before.

“That’s what I’ve found out, Huck. I reckon that’s the very No. 2 we’re
after.”

“I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?”

“Lemme think.”

Tom thought a long time. Then he said:

“I’ll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out
into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap
of a brick store. Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and
I’ll nip all of auntie’s, and the first dark night we’ll go there and
try ’em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he
was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get
his revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don’t go to
that No. 2, that ain’t the place.”

“Lordy, I don’t want to foller him by myself!”

“Why, it’ll be night, sure. He mightn’t ever see you—and if he did,
maybe he’d never think anything.”

“Well, if it’s pretty dark I reckon I’ll track him. I dono—I dono. I’ll
try.”

“You bet I’ll follow him, if it’s dark, Huck. Why, he might ’a’ found
out he couldn’t get his revenge, and be going right after that money.”

“It’s so, Tom, it’s so. I’ll foller him; I will, by jingoes!”

“Now you’re _talking_! Don’t you ever weaken, Huck, and I won’t.”




CHAPTER XXVIII


That night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung about
the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley
at a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or
left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern
door. The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the
understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck
was to come and “maow,” whereupon he would slip out and try the keys.
But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to
bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.

Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday
night promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt’s
old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the
lantern in Huck’s sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before
midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts)
were put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the
alley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned,
the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of
distant thunder.

Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the
towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.
Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was
a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck’s spirits like a
mountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern—it
would frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive
yet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have
fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and
excitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer
and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and
momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away
his breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to
inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the
way it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came
tearing by him: “Run!” said he; “run, for your life!”

He needn’t have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or
forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never
stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the
lower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm
burst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breath he said:

“Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;
but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn’t hardly
get my breath I was so scared. They wouldn’t turn in the lock, either.
Well, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and
open comes the door! It warn’t locked! I hopped in, and shook off the
towel, and, _Great Caesar’s Ghost!_”

“What!—what’d you see, Tom?”

“Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe’s hand!”

“No!”

“Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch
on his eye and his arms spread out.”

“Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?”

“No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and
started!”

“I’d never ’a’ thought of the towel, I bet!”

“Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.”

“Say, Tom, did you see that box?”

“Huck, I didn’t wait to look around. I didn’t see the box, I didn’t see
the cross. I didn’t see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor
by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room.
Don’t you see, now, what’s the matter with that ha’nted room?”

“How?”

“Why, it’s ha’nted with whiskey! Maybe _all_ the Temperance Taverns have
got a ha’nted room, hey, Huck?”

“Well, I reckon maybe that’s so. Who’d ’a’ thought such a thing? But
say, Tom, now’s a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe’s
drunk.”

“It is, that! You try it!”

Huck shuddered.

“Well, no—I reckon not.”

“And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain’t
enough. If there’d been three, he’d be drunk enough and I’d do it.”

There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:

“Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun
Joe’s not in there. It’s too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we’ll
be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we’ll
snatch that box quicker’n lightning.”

“Well, I’m agreed. I’ll watch the whole night long, and I’ll do it every
night, too, if you’ll do the other part of the job.”

“All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a
block and maow—and if I’m asleep, you throw some gravel at the window
and that’ll fetch me.”

“Agreed, and good as wheat!”

“Now, Huck, the storm’s over, and I’ll go home. It’ll begin to be
daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will
you?”

“I said I would, Tom, and I will. I’ll ha’nt that tavern every night for
a year! I’ll sleep all day and I’ll stand watch all night.”

“That’s all right. Now, where you going to sleep?”

“In Ben Rogers’ hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap’s nigger man,
Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any
time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.
That’s a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don’t ever act as
if I was above him. Sometime I’ve set right down and eat _with_ him. But
you needn’t tell that. A body’s got to do things when he’s awful hungry
he wouldn’t want to do as a steady thing.”

“Well, if I don’t want you in the daytime, I’ll let you sleep. I won’t
come bothering around. Any time you see something’s up, in the night,
just skip right around and maow.”




CHAPTER XXIX


The first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of
news—Judge Thatcher’s family had come back to town the night before.
Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a
moment, and Becky took the chief place in the boy’s interest. He saw her
and they had an exhausting good time playing “hispy” and “gully-keeper”
 with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in
a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint
the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she
consented. The child’s delight was boundless; and Tom’s not more
moderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway
the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation
and pleasurable anticipation. Tom’s excitement enabled him to keep
awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck’s
“maow,” and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers
with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.

Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o’clock a giddy and
rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher’s, and everything was
ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the
picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough
under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young
gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was
chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main
street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss
the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.
Thatcher said to Becky, was:

“You’ll not get back till late. Perhaps you’d better stay all night with
some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.”

“Then I’ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.”

“Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don’t be any trouble.”

Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:

“Say—I’ll tell you what we’ll do. ’Stead of going to Joe Harper’s we’ll
climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas’. She’ll have
ice-cream! She has it most every day—dead loads of it. And she’ll be
awful glad to have us.”

“Oh, that will be fun!”

Then Becky reflected a moment and said:

“But what will mamma say?”

“How’ll she ever know?”

The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:

“I reckon it’s wrong—but—”

“But shucks! Your mother won’t know, and so what’s the harm? All she
wants is that you’ll be safe; and I bet you she’d ’a’ said go there if
she’d ’a’ thought of it. I know she would!”

The Widow Douglas’ splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and
Tom’s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say
nothing to anybody about the night’s programme. Presently it occurred to
Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The
thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he
could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas’. And why should he
give it up, he reasoned—the signal did not come the night before, so
why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the
evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined
to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of
the box of money another time that day.

Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody
hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest
distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and
laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone
through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified
with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things
began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in
the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:

“Who’s ready for the cave?”

Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there
was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the
hillside—an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood
unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled
by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was
romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out
upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the
situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment
a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a
struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked
down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a
new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went
filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of
lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of
junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than
eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower
crevices branched from it on either hand—for McDougal’s cave was but a
vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again
and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights
together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never
find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and
still down, into the earth, and it was just the same—labyrinth under
labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man “knew” the cave. That was
an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it
was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer
knew as much of the cave as any one.

The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of
a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch
avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise
at points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude
each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the
“known” ground.

By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth
of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow
drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of
the day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking
no note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had
been calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day’s
adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat
with her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for
the wasted time but the captain of the craft.

Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat’s lights went
glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young
people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly
tired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not
stop at the wharf—and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his
attention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten
o’clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began
to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village
betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the
silence and the ghosts. Eleven o’clock came, and the tavern lights were
put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long
time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use?
Was there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?

A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley
door closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next
moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under
his arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure.
Why call Tom now? It would be absurd—the men would get away with the box
and never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow
them; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So
communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the
men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough
ahead not to be invisible.

They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up
a crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the
path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old
Welshman’s house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still
climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry.
But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit.
They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and
were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his
distance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along
awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved
on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that
he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an
owl came over the hill—ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was
everything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man
cleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck’s heart shot into his
throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as
if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he
thought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He
knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas’
grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won’t be hard
to find.

Now there was a voice—a very low voice—Injun Joe’s:

“Damn her, maybe she’s got company—there’s lights, late as it is.”

“I can’t see any.”

This was that stranger’s voice—the stranger of the haunted house. A
deadly chill went to Huck’s heart—this, then, was the “revenge” job! His
thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been
kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder
her. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn’t
dare—they might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in
the moment that elapsed between the stranger’s remark and Injun Joe’s
next—which was—

“Because the bush is in your way. Now—this way—now you see, don’t you?”

“Yes. Well, there _is_ company there, I reckon. Better give it up.”

“Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and
maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I’ve told you
before, I don’t care for her swag—you may have it. But her husband was
rough on me—many times he was rough on me—and mainly he was the justice
of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain’t all. It ain’t
a millionth part of it! He had me _horsewhipped_!—horsewhipped in
front of the jail, like a nigger!—with all the town looking on!
_Horsewhipped_!—do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But
I’ll take it out of _her_.”

“Oh, don’t kill her! Don’t do that!”

“Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill _him_ if he was
here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don’t
kill her—bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils—you notch her
ears like a sow!”

“By God, that’s—”

“Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I’ll tie her
to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I’ll not cry, if
she does. My friend, you’ll help me in this thing—for _my_ sake—that’s
why you’re here—I mightn’t be able alone. If you flinch, I’ll kill you.
Do you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I’ll kill her—and
then I reckon nobody’ll ever know much about who done this business.”

“Well, if it’s got to be done, let’s get at it. The quicker the
better—I’m all in a shiver.”

“Do it _now_? And company there? Look here—I’ll get suspicious of you,
first thing you know. No—we’ll wait till the lights are out—there’s no
hurry.”

Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue—a thing still more awful
than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped
gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,
one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one
side and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same
elaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and—a twig
snapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no
sound—the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he
turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes—turned
himself as carefully as if he were a ship—and then stepped quickly but
cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and
so he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he
reached the Welshman’s. He banged at the door, and presently the heads
of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.

“What’s the row there? Who’s banging? What do you want?”

“Let me in—quick! I’ll tell everything.”

“Why, who are you?”

“Huckleberry Finn—quick, let me in!”

“Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain’t a name to open many doors, I judge!
But let him in, lads, and let’s see what’s the trouble.”

“Please don’t ever tell I told you,” were Huck’s first words when he got
in. “Please don’t—I’d be killed, sure—but the widow’s been good friends
to me sometimes, and I want to tell—I _will_ tell if you’ll promise you
won’t ever say it was me.”

“By George, he _has_ got something to tell, or he wouldn’t act so!”
 exclaimed the old man; “out with it and nobody here’ll ever tell, lad.”

Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the
hill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in
their hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great
bowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence, and
then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.

Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as
fast as his legs could carry him.




CHAPTER XXX


As the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came
groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman’s door. The
inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger,
on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a
window:

“Who’s there!”

Huck’s scared voice answered in a low tone:

“Please let me in! It’s only Huck Finn!”

“It’s a name that can open this door night or day, lad!—and welcome!”

These were strange words to the vagabond boy’s ears, and the pleasantest
he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever
been applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he
entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall
sons speedily dressed themselves.

“Now, my boy, I hope you’re good and hungry, because breakfast will be
ready as soon as the sun’s up, and we’ll have a piping hot one, too—make
yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you’d turn up and stop
here last night.”

“I was awful scared,” said Huck, “and I run. I took out when the pistols
went off, and I didn’t stop for three mile. I’ve come now becuz I wanted
to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn’t
want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.”

“Well, poor chap, you do look as if you’d had a hard night of it—but
there’s a bed here for you when you’ve had your breakfast. No, they
ain’t dead, lad—we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right
where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along
on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them—dark as a cellar that
sumach path was—and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the
meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use—’twas bound to
come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when
the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path,
I sung out, ‘Fire boys!’ and blazed away at the place where the rustling
was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and
we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them.
They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by
and didn’t do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet
we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a
posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it
is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys
will be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of
those rascals—’twould help a good deal. But you couldn’t see what they
were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?”

“Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.”

“Splendid! Describe them—describe them, my boy!”

“One’s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that’s ben around here once or
twice, and t’other’s a mean-looking, ragged—”

“That’s enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back
of the widow’s one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and
tell the sheriff—get your breakfast tomorrow morning!”

The Welshman’s sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck
sprang up and exclaimed:

“Oh, please don’t tell _any_body it was me that blowed on them! Oh,
please!”

“All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what
you did.”

“Oh no, no! Please don’t tell!”

When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:

“They won’t tell—and I won’t. But why don’t you want it known?”

Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too
much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew
anything against him for the whole world—he would be killed for knowing
it, sure.

The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:

“How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking
suspicious?”

Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:

“Well, you see, I’m a kind of a hard lot,—least everybody says so, and
I don’t see nothing agin it—and sometimes I can’t sleep much, on account
of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of
doing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn’t sleep, and so I
come along upstreet ’bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I
got to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed
up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes
these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their
arm, and I reckoned they’d stole it. One was a-smoking, and t’other one
wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up
their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard,
by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t’other one was a
rusty, ragged-looking devil.”

“Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?”

This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:

“Well, I don’t know—but somehow it seems as if I did.”

“Then they went on, and you—”

“Follered ’em—yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up—they sneaked
along so. I dogged ’em to the widder’s stile, and stood in the dark and
heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he’d
spile her looks just as I told you and your two—”

“What! The _deaf and dumb_ man said all that!”

Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep
the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be,
and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of
all he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape,
but the old man’s eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder.
Presently the Welshman said:

“My boy, don’t be afraid of me. I wouldn’t hurt a hair of your head for
all the world. No—I’d protect you—I’d protect you. This Spaniard is
not deaf and dumb; you’ve let that slip without intending it; you can’t
cover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want
to keep dark. Now trust me—tell me what it is, and trust me—I won’t
betray you.”

Huck looked into the old man’s honest eyes a moment, then bent over and
whispered in his ear:

“’Tain’t a Spaniard—it’s Injun Joe!”

The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:

“It’s all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and
slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because
white men don’t take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That’s a
different matter altogether.”

During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man
said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going
to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for
marks of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of—

“Of _what_?”

If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more
stunning suddenness from Huck’s blanched lips. His eyes were staring
wide, now, and his breath suspended—waiting for the answer. The Welshman
started—stared in return—three seconds—five seconds—ten—then replied:

“Of burglar’s tools. Why, what’s the _matter_ with you?”

Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The
Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously—and presently said:

“Yes, burglar’s tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what
did give you that turn? What were _you_ expecting we’d found?”

Huck was in a close place—the inquiring eye was upon him—he would have
given anything for material for a plausible answer—nothing suggested
itself—the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper—a senseless
reply offered—there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered
it—feebly:

“Sunday-school books, maybe.”

Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and
joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and
ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man’s pocket, because
it cut down the doctor’s bill like everything. Then he added:

“Poor old chap, you’re white and jaded—you ain’t well a bit—no wonder
you’re a little flighty and off your balance. But you’ll come out of it.
Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.”

Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such
a suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel
brought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the
talk at the widow’s stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure,
however—he had not known that it wasn’t—and so the suggestion of a
captured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole
he felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all
question that that bundle was not _the_ bundle, and so his mind was
at rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be
drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still
in No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and
Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of
interruption.

Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck
jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even
remotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and
gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of
citizens were climbing up the hill—to stare at the stile. So the news
had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the
visitors. The widow’s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.

“Don’t say a word about it, madam. There’s another that you’re more
beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don’t allow me
to tell his name. We wouldn’t have been there but for him.”

Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the
main matter—but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his
visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he
refused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the
widow said:

“I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that
noise. Why didn’t you come and wake me?”

“We judged it warn’t worth while. Those fellows warn’t likely to come
again—they hadn’t any tools left to work with, and what was the use of
waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard
at your house all the rest of the night. They’ve just come back.”

More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple
of hours more.

There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody
was early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came
that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the
sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher’s wife dropped alongside of Mrs.
Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:

“Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired
to death.”

“Your Becky?”

“Yes,” with a startled look—“didn’t she stay with you last night?”

“Why, no.”

Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly,
talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:

“Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I’ve got a boy
that’s turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last
night—one of you. And now he’s afraid to come to church. I’ve got to
settle with him.”

Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.

“He didn’t stay with us,” said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A
marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly’s face.

“Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?”

“No’m.”

“When did you see him last?”

Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had
stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding
uneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously
questioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed
whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip;
it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One
young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave!
Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her
hands.

The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to
street, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and
the whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant
insignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs
were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half
an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward
the cave.

All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women
visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They
cried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the
tedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at
last, all the word that came was, “Send more candles—and send food.”
 Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher
sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed
no real cheer.

The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with
candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck
still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with
fever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came
and took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him,
because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord’s,
and nothing that was the Lord’s was a thing to be neglected. The
Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:

“You can depend on it. That’s the Lord’s mark. He don’t leave it off.
He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his
hands.”

Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the
village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the
news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being
ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and
crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered
through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither
and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their
hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place,
far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names “BECKY &
TOM” had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and
near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the
ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever
have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so
precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the
awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away
speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst
forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle—and then a
sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there;
it was only a searcher’s light.

Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and
the village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything.
The accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the
Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the
public pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck
feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked—dimly
dreading the worst—if anything had been discovered at the Temperance
Tavern since he had been ill.

“Yes,” said the widow.

Huck started up in bed, wildeyed:

“What? What was it?”

“Liquor!—and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child—what a turn you
did give me!”

“Only tell me just one thing—only just one—please! Was it Tom Sawyer
that found it?”

The widow burst into tears. “Hush, hush, child, hush! I’ve told you
before, you must _not_ talk. You are very, very sick!”

Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great
powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever—gone
forever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should
cry.

These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck’s mind, and under the
weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:

“There—he’s asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody
could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain’t many left, now, that’s got hope
enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.”




CHAPTER XXXI


Now to return to Tom and Becky’s share in the picnic. They tripped along
the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar
wonders of the cave—wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names,
such as “The Drawing-Room,” “The Cathedral,” “Aladdin’s Palace,” and
so on. Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky
engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle
wearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their
candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates,
postoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been
frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they
scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls
were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging
shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream
of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with
it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara
in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind
it in order to illuminate it for Becky’s gratification. He found that
it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between
narrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.

Becky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future
guidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that,
far down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and
branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In
one place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a
multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of
a man’s leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and
presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into
it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was
incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst
of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which
had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites
together, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the
roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a
bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by
hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their
ways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky’s hand and
hurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for
a bat struck Becky’s light out with its wing while she was passing out
of the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the
fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got
rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly,
which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the
shadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would
be best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the
deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the
children. Becky said:

“Why, I didn’t notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of
the others.”

“Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them—and I don’t know how
far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn’t hear
them here.”

Becky grew apprehensive.

“I wonder how long we’ve been down here, Tom? We better start back.”

“Yes, I reckon we better. P’raps we better.”

“Can you find the way, Tom? It’s all a mixed-up crookedness to me.”

“I reckon I could find it—but then the bats. If they put our candles
out it will be an awful fix. Let’s try some other way, so as not to go
through there.”

“Well. But I hope we won’t get lost. It would be so awful!” and the girl
shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.

They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long
way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar
about the look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an
examination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he
would say cheerily:

“Oh, it’s all right. This ain’t the one, but we’ll come to it right
away!”

But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began
to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of
finding the one that was wanted. He still said it was “all right,” but
there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their
ring and sounded just as if he had said, “All is lost!” Becky clung to
his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears,
but they would come. At last she said:

“Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let’s go back that way! We seem to get
worse and worse off all the time.”

“Listen!” said he.

Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were
conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down
the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that
resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.

“Oh, don’t do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,” said Becky.

“It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,” and
he shouted again.

The “might” was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so
confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but
there was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried
his steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his
manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky—he could not find his way
back!

“Oh, Tom, you didn’t make any marks!”

“Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to
come back! No—I can’t find the way. It’s all mixed up.”

“Tom, Tom, we’re lost! we’re lost! We never can get out of this awful
place! Oh, why _did_ we ever leave the others!”

She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom
was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He
sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in
his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing
regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom
begged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell
to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable
situation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope
again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he
would not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she,
she said.

So they moved on again—aimlessly—simply at random—all they could do
was to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of
reviving—not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its
nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and
familiarity with failure.

By-and-by Tom took Becky’s candle and blew it out. This economy meant so
much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again.
She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his
pockets—yet he must economize.

By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay
attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was
grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction,
was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to
invite death and shorten its pursuit.

At last Becky’s frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down.
Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there,
and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom
tried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements
were grown thread-bare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore
so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful.
He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural
under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and
rested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing
into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and
dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a
breezy little laugh—but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan
followed it.

“Oh, how _could_ I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I
don’t, Tom! Don’t look so! I won’t say it again.”

“I’m glad you’ve slept, Becky; you’ll feel rested, now, and we’ll find
the way out.”

“We can try, Tom; but I’ve seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I
reckon we are going there.”

“Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let’s go on trying.”

They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried
to estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was
that it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not
be, for their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this—they
could not tell how long—Tom said they must go softly and listen for
dripping water—they must find a spring. They found one presently, and
Tom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky
said she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to
hear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom
fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought
was soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the
silence:

“Tom, I am so hungry!”

Tom took something out of his pocket.

“Do you remember this?” said he.

Becky almost smiled.

“It’s our wedding-cake, Tom.”

“Yes—I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it’s all we’ve got.”

“I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup
people do with wedding-cake—but it’ll be our—”

She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky
ate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was
abundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky
suggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he
said:

“Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?”

Becky’s face paled, but she thought she could.

“Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there’s water to drink.
That little piece is our last candle!”

Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort
her, but with little effect. At length Becky said:

“Tom!”

“Well, Becky?”

“They’ll miss us and hunt for us!”

“Yes, they will! Certainly they will!”

“Maybe they’re hunting for us now, Tom.”

“Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.”

“When would they miss us, Tom?”

“When they get back to the boat, I reckon.”

“Tom, it might be dark then—would they notice we hadn’t come?”

“I don’t know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they
got home.”

A frightened look in Becky’s face brought Tom to his senses and he saw
that he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night!
The children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of
grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers
also—that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher
discovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper’s.

The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it
melt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone
at last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of
smoke, linger at its top a moment, and then—the horror of utter darkness
reigned!

How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that
she was crying in Tom’s arms, neither could tell. All that they knew
was, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of
a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said
it might be Sunday, now—maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but
her sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that
they must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going
on. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in
the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no
more.

The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A
portion of Tom’s half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But
they seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted
desire.

By-and-by Tom said:

“SH! Did you hear that?”

Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the
faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by
the hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently
he listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little
nearer.

“It’s them!” said Tom; “they’re coming! Come along, Becky—we’re all
right now!”

The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow,
however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded
against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three
feet deep, it might be a hundred—there was no passing it at any rate.
Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No
bottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They
listened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant!
a moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking
misery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He
talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no
sounds came again.

The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged
on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed
it must be Tuesday by this time.

Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It
would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the
heavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to
a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the
line as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended
in a “jumping-off place.” Tom got down on his knees and felt below,
and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands
conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the
right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding
a candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout,
and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to—Injun
Joe’s! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the
next moment, to see the “Spaniard” take to his heels and get himself out
of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come
over and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have
disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom’s
fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he
had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and
nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He
was careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he
had only shouted “for luck.”

But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.
Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought
changes. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed
that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now,
and that the search had been given over. He proposed to explore another
passage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But
Becky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be
roused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and die—it would
not be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he
chose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak
to her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would
stay by her and hold her hand until all was over.

Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show
of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave;
then he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the
passages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with
bodings of coming doom.




CHAPTER XXXII


Tuesday afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St.
Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public
prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer
that had the petitioner’s whole heart in it; but still no good news came
from the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the quest
and gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the
children could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great
part of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her
call her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time,
then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into
a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The
village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.

Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village
bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad
people, who shouted, “Turn out! turn out! they’re found! they’re found!”
 Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself
and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage
drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward
march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after
huzzah!

The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the
greatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour
a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher’s house, seized
the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher’s hand, tried to
speak but couldn’t—and drifted out raining tears all over the place.

Aunt Polly’s happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher’s nearly so. It
would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the
great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon
a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the
wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it
withal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went
on an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his
kite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch
of the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off
speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,
pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad
Mississippi rolling by!

And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that
speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He
told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told
him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was
going to die, and wanted to. He described how he labored with her and
convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to
where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way
out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried
for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them
and told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men
didn’t believe the wild tale at first, “because,” said they, “you are
five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in”—then took
them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two
or three hours after dark and then brought them home.

Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him
were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind
them, and informed of the great news.

Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to
be shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were
bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and
more tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday,
was downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky
did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had
passed through a wasting illness.

Tom learned of Huck’s sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could
not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday.
He was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his
adventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by
to see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event;
also that the “ragged man’s” body had eventually been found in the river
near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape,
perhaps.

About a fortnight after Tom’s rescue from the cave, he started off to
visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting
talk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge
Thatcher’s house was on Tom’s way, and he stopped to see Becky. The
Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him
ironically if he wouldn’t like to go to the cave again. Tom said he
thought he wouldn’t mind it. The Judge said:

“Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I’ve not the least doubt.
But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any
more.”

“Why?”

“Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and
triple-locked—and I’ve got the keys.”

Tom turned as white as a sheet.

“What’s the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!”

The water was brought and thrown into Tom’s face.

“Ah, now you’re all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?”

“Oh, Judge, Injun Joe’s in the cave!”




CHAPTER XXXIII


Within a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of
men were on their way to McDougal’s cave, and the ferryboat, well filled
with passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore
Judge Thatcher.

When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in
the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,
dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing
eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer
of the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own
experience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but
nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,
which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated
before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day
he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.

Injun Joe’s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great
foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with
tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a
sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought
no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there
had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless
still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have
squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked
that place in order to be doing something—in order to pass the weary
time—in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could
find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this
vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner
had searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a
few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The
poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a
stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded
by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off
the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had
scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once
in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick—a
dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling
when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome
were laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the
British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was
“news.”

It is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall
have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition,
and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a
purpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand
years to be ready for this flitting human insect’s need? and has it
another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No
matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped
out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist
stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when
he comes to see the wonders of McDougal’s cave. Injun Joe’s cup stands
first in the list of the cavern’s marvels; even “Aladdin’s Palace”
 cannot rival it.

Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked
there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and
hamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and
all sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as
satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the
hanging.

This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing—the petition to the
governor for Injun Joe’s pardon. The petition had been largely signed;
many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of
sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the
governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty
under foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the
village, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself there would
have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a
pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired
and leaky water-works.

The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have
an important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom’s adventure from the
Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned
there was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted
to talk about now. Huck’s face saddened. He said:

“I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but
whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must ’a’ ben
you, soon as I heard ’bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you
hadn’t got the money becuz you’d ’a’ got at me some way or other and
told me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something’s always
told me we’d never get holt of that swag.”

“Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. _You_ know his tavern
was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don’t you remember you
was to watch there that night?”

“Oh yes! Why, it seems ’bout a year ago. It was that very night that I
follered Injun Joe to the widder’s.”

“_You_ followed him?”

“Yes—but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe’s left friends behind him, and
I don’t want ’em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn’t
ben for me he’d be down in Texas now, all right.”

Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only
heard of the Welshman’s part of it before.

“Well,” said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, “whoever
nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon—anyways
it’s a goner for us, Tom.”

“Huck, that money wasn’t ever in No. 2!”

“What!” Huck searched his comrade’s face keenly. “Tom, have you got on
the track of that money again?”

“Huck, it’s in the cave!”

Huck’s eyes blazed.

“Say it again, Tom.”

“The money’s in the cave!”

“Tom—honest injun, now—is it fun, or earnest?”

“Earnest, Huck—just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in
there with me and help get it out?”

“I bet I will! I will if it’s where we can blaze our way to it and not
get lost.”

“Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the
world.”

“Good as wheat! What makes you think the money’s—”

“Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don’t find it I’ll
agree to give you my drum and every thing I’ve got in the world. I will,
by jings.”

“All right—it’s a whiz. When do you say?”

“Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?”

“Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,
now, but I can’t walk more’n a mile, Tom—least I don’t think I could.”

“It’s about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck,
but there’s a mighty short cut that they don’t anybody but me know
about. Huck, I’ll take you right to it in a skiff. I’ll float the skiff
down there, and I’ll pull it back again all by myself. You needn’t ever
turn your hand over.”

“Less start right off, Tom.”

“All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little
bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled
things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many’s the time I wished I
had some when I was in there before.”

A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who
was absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles
below “Cave Hollow,” Tom said:

“Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the
cave hollow—no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see
that white place up yonder where there’s been a landslide? Well, that’s
one of my marks. We’ll get ashore, now.”

They landed.

“Now, Huck, where we’re a-standing you could touch that hole I got out
of with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.”

Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly
marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:

“Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it’s the snuggest hole in this country.
You just keep mum about it. All along I’ve been wanting to be a robber,
but I knew I’d got to have a thing like this, and where to run across
it was the bother. We’ve got it now, and we’ll keep it quiet, only we’ll
let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in—because of course there’s got to be a
Gang, or else there wouldn’t be any style about it. Tom Sawyer’s Gang—it
sounds splendid, don’t it, Huck?”

“Well, it just does, Tom. And who’ll we rob?”

“Oh, most anybody. Waylay people—that’s mostly the way.”

“And kill them?”

“No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.”

“What’s a ransom?”

“Money. You make them raise all they can, off’n their friends; and after
you’ve kept them a year, if it ain’t raised then you kill them. That’s
the general way. Only you don’t kill the women. You shut up the women,
but you don’t kill them. They’re always beautiful and rich, and awfully
scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat
off and talk polite. They ain’t anybody as polite as robbers—you’ll see
that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they’ve
been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that
you couldn’t get them to leave. If you drove them out they’d turn right
around and come back. It’s so in all the books.”

“Why, it’s real bully, Tom. I believe it’s better’n to be a pirate.”

“Yes, it’s better in some ways, because it’s close to home and circuses
and all that.”

By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in
the lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then
made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought
them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him.
He showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay
against the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame
struggle and expire.

The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and
gloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently
entered and followed Tom’s other corridor until they reached the
“jumping-off place.” The candles revealed the fact that it was not
really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet
high. Tom whispered:

“Now I’ll show you something, Huck.”

He held his candle aloft and said:

“Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There—on the
big rock over yonder—done with candle-smoke.”

“Tom, it’s a _cross_!”

“_Now_ where’s your Number Two? ‘_under the cross_,’ hey? Right yonder’s
where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!”

Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:

“Tom, less git out of here!”

“What! and leave the treasure?”

“Yes—leave it. Injun Joe’s ghost is round about there, certain.”

“No it ain’t, Huck, no it ain’t. It would ha’nt the place where he
died—away out at the mouth of the cave—five mile from here.”

“No, Tom, it wouldn’t. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of
ghosts, and so do you.”

Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in his mind.
But presently an idea occurred to him—

“Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we’re making of ourselves! Injun Joe’s
ghost ain’t a going to come around where there’s a cross!”

The point was well taken. It had its effect.

“Tom, I didn’t think of that. But that’s so. It’s luck for us, that
cross is. I reckon we’ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.”

Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.
Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the
great rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result.
They found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with
a pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some
bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there
was no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this place, but in
vain. Tom said:

“He said _under_ the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the
cross. It can’t be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the
ground.”

They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck
could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:

“Lookyhere, Huck, there’s footprints and some candle-grease on the clay
about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what’s
that for? I bet you the money _is_ under the rock. I’m going to dig in
the clay.”

“That ain’t no bad notion, Tom!” said Huck with animation.

Tom’s “real Barlow” was out at once, and he had not dug four inches
before he struck wood.

“Hey, Huck!—you hear that?”

Huck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and
removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.
Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he
could, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed
to explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended
gradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to
the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and
exclaimed:

“My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!”

It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern,
along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two
or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish
well soaked with the water-drip.

“Got it at last!” said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with
his hand. “My, but we’re rich, Tom!”

“Huck, I always reckoned we’d get it. It’s just too good to believe, but
we _have_ got it, sure! Say—let’s not fool around here. Let’s snake it
out. Lemme see if I can lift the box.”

It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward
fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.

“I thought so,” he said; “_They_ carried it like it was heavy, that day
at the ha’nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of
fetching the little bags along.”

The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross
rock.

“Now less fetch the guns and things,” said Huck.

“No, Huck—leave them there. They’re just the tricks to have when we
go to robbing. We’ll keep them there all the time, and we’ll hold our
orgies there, too. It’s an awful snug place for orgies.”

“What orgies?”

“I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we’ve got to
have them, too. Come along, Huck, we’ve been in here a long time. It’s
getting late, I reckon. I’m hungry, too. We’ll eat and smoke when we get
to the skiff.”

They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily
out, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the
skiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got
under way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting
cheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.

“Now, Huck,” said Tom, “we’ll hide the money in the loft of the widow’s
woodshed, and I’ll come up in the morning and we’ll count it and divide,
and then we’ll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be
safe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook
Benny Taylor’s little wagon; I won’t be gone a minute.”

He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small
sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off,
dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman’s
house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the
Welshman stepped out and said:

“Hallo, who’s that?”

“Huck and Tom Sawyer.”

“Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.
Here—hurry up, trot ahead—I’ll haul the wagon for you. Why, it’s not as
light as it might be. Got bricks in it?—or old metal?”

“Old metal,” said Tom.

“I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away
more time hunting up six bits’ worth of old iron to sell to the foundry
than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that’s
human nature—hurry along, hurry along!”

The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.

“Never mind; you’ll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas’.”

Huck said with some apprehension—for he was long used to being falsely
accused:

“Mr. Jones, we haven’t been doing nothing.”

The Welshman laughed.

“Well, I don’t know, Huck, my boy. I don’t know about that. Ain’t you
and the widow good friends?”

“Yes. Well, she’s ben good friends to me, anyway.”

“All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?”

This question was not entirely answered in Huck’s slow mind before he
found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas’ drawing-room.
Mr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.

The place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence
in the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the
Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great
many more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys
as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They
were covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson
with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered
half as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:

“Tom wasn’t at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and
Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.”

“And you did just right,” said the widow. “Come with me, boys.”

She took them to a bedchamber and said:

“Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of
clothes—shirts, socks, everything complete. They’re Huck’s—no, no
thanks, Huck—Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they’ll fit both
of you. Get into them. We’ll wait—come down when you are slicked up
enough.”

Then she left.




CHAPTER XXXIV


Huck said: “Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain’t
high from the ground.”

“Shucks! what do you want to slope for?”

“Well, I ain’t used to that kind of a crowd. I can’t stand it. I ain’t
going down there, Tom.”

“Oh, bother! It ain’t anything. I don’t mind it a bit. I’ll take care of
you.”

Sid appeared.

“Tom,” said he, “auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon. Mary
got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody’s been fretting about you.
Say—ain’t this grease and clay, on your clothes?”

“Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist ’tend to your own business. What’s all this
blowout about, anyway?”

“It’s one of the widow’s parties that she’s always having. This time
it’s for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they
helped her out of the other night. And say—I can tell you something, if
you want to know.”

“Well, what?”

“Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people
here tonight, but I overheard him tell auntie today about it, as a
secret, but I reckon it’s not much of a secret now. Everybody knows—the
widow, too, for all she tries to let on she don’t. Mr. Jones was bound
Huck should be here—couldn’t get along with his grand secret without
Huck, you know!”

“Secret about what, Sid?”

“About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow’s. I reckon Mr. Jones was
going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop
pretty flat.”

Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.

“Sid, was it you that told?”

“Oh, never mind who it was. _Somebody_ told—that’s enough.”

“Sid, there’s only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and
that’s you. If you had been in Huck’s place you’d ’a’ sneaked down the
hill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can’t do any but mean
things, and you can’t bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.
There—no thanks, as the widow says”—and Tom cuffed Sid’s ears and helped
him to the door with several kicks. “Now go and tell auntie if you
dare—and tomorrow you’ll catch it!”

Some minutes later the widow’s guests were at the supper-table, and a
dozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room,
after the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr.
Jones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the
honor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was
another person whose modesty—

And so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck’s share in
the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the
surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and
effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However,
the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many
compliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot
the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely
intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody’s gaze
and everybody’s laudations.

The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him
educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in
business in a modest way. Tom’s chance was come. He said:

“Huck don’t need it. Huck’s rich.”

Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept
back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But
the silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:

“Huck’s got money. Maybe you don’t believe it, but he’s got lots of it.
Oh, you needn’t smile—I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute.”

Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed
interest—and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.

“Sid, what ails Tom?” said Aunt Polly. “He—well, there ain’t ever any
making of that boy out. I never—”

Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly
did not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the
table and said:

“There—what did I tell you? Half of it’s Huck’s and half of it’s mine!”

The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for
a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said
he could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of
interest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the
charm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:

“I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it
don’t amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I’m
willing to allow.”

The money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand
dollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time
before, though several persons were there who were worth considerably
more than that in property.




CHAPTER XXXV


The reader may rest satisfied that Tom’s and Huck’s windfall made a
mighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a
sum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked
about, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the citizens
tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every “haunted”
house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected,
plank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden
treasure—and not by boys, but men—pretty grave, unromantic men, too,
some of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted, admired,
stared at. The boys were not able to remember that their remarks had
possessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and
repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as
remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying
commonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and
discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper
published biographical sketches of the boys.

The Widow Douglas put Huck’s money out at six per cent., and Judge
Thatcher did the same with Tom’s at Aunt Polly’s request. Each lad had
an income, now, that was simply prodigious—a dollar for every weekday in
the year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got—no,
it was what he was promised—he generally couldn’t collect it. A dollar
and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old
simple days—and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.

Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no
commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When
Becky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her
whipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded
grace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that
whipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine
outburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie—a lie that
was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to
breast with George Washington’s lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky
thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he
walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight
off and told Tom about it.

Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some
day. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the
National Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school
in the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or
both.

Huck Finn’s wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas’
protection introduced him into society—no, dragged him into it, hurled
him into it—and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The
widow’s servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they
bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot
or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. He had
to eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate;
he had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so
properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he
turned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him
hand and foot.

He bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up
missing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in
great distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched high
and low, they dragged the river for his body. Early the third morning
Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind
the abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee.
Huck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and
ends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. He was
unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made
him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him
out, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home.
Huck’s face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy cast. He
said:

“Don’t talk about it, Tom. I’ve tried it, and it don’t work; it don’t
work, Tom. It ain’t for me; I ain’t used to it. The widder’s good to me,
and friendly; but I can’t stand them ways. She makes me get up just
at the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all
to thunder; she won’t let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them
blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don’t seem to any air
git through ’em, somehow; and they’re so rotten nice that I can’t
set down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher’s; I hain’t slid on a
cellar-door for—well, it ’pears to be years; I got to go to church
and sweat and sweat—I hate them ornery sermons! I can’t ketch a fly in
there, I can’t chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by
a bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell—everything’s so
awful reg’lar a body can’t stand it.”

“Well, everybody does that way, Huck.”

“Tom, it don’t make no difference. I ain’t everybody, and I can’t
_stand_ it. It’s awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy—I don’t
take no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing;
I got to ask to go in a-swimming—dern’d if I hain’t got to ask to do
everything. Well, I’d got to talk so nice it wasn’t no comfort—I’d got
to go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste
in my mouth, or I’d a died, Tom. The widder wouldn’t let me smoke;
she wouldn’t let me yell, she wouldn’t let me gape, nor stretch, nor
scratch, before folks—” [Then with a spasm of special irritation and
injury]—“And dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a
woman! I _had_ to shove, Tom—I just had to. And besides, that school’s
going to open, and I’d a had to go to it—well, I wouldn’t stand _that_,
Tom. Looky-here, Tom, being rich ain’t what it’s cracked up to be. It’s
just worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead
all the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar’l suits me, and
I ain’t ever going to shake ’em any more. Tom, I wouldn’t ever got into
all this trouble if it hadn’t ’a’ ben for that money; now you just take
my sheer of it along with your’n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes—not
many times, becuz I don’t give a dern for a thing ’thout it’s tollable
hard to git—and you go and beg off for me with the widder.”

“Oh, Huck, you know I can’t do that. ’Tain’t fair; and besides if you’ll
try this thing just a while longer you’ll come to like it.”

“Like it! Yes—the way I’d like a hot stove if I was to set on it long
enough. No, Tom, I won’t be rich, and I won’t live in them cussed
smothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and
I’ll stick to ’em, too. Blame it all! just as we’d got guns, and a cave,
and all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to come up
and spile it all!”

Tom saw his opportunity—

“Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain’t going to keep me back from turning
robber.”

“No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?”

“Just as dead earnest as I’m sitting here. But Huck, we can’t let you
into the gang if you ain’t respectable, you know.”

Huck’s joy was quenched.

“Can’t let me in, Tom? Didn’t you let me go for a pirate?”

“Yes, but that’s different. A robber is more high-toned than what a
pirate is—as a general thing. In most countries they’re awful high up in
the nobility—dukes and such.”

“Now, Tom, hain’t you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn’t shet me
out, would you, Tom? You wouldn’t do that, now, _would_ you, Tom?”

“Huck, I wouldn’t want to, and I _don’t_ want to—but what would people
say? Why, they’d say, ‘Mph! Tom Sawyer’s Gang! pretty low characters in
it!’ They’d mean you, Huck. You wouldn’t like that, and I wouldn’t.”

Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he
said:

“Well, I’ll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I
can come to stand it, if you’ll let me b’long to the gang, Tom.”

“All right, Huck, it’s a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I’ll ask the
widow to let up on you a little, Huck.”

“Will you, Tom—now will you? That’s good. If she’ll let up on some of
the roughest things, I’ll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd
through or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?”

“Oh, right off. We’ll get the boys together and have the initiation
tonight, maybe.”

“Have the which?”

“Have the initiation.”

“What’s that?”

“It’s to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang’s
secrets, even if you’re chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and
all his family that hurts one of the gang.”

“That’s gay—that’s mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.”

“Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing’s got to be done at midnight,
in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find—a ha’nted house is the
best, but they’re all ripped up now.”

“Well, midnight’s good, anyway, Tom.”

“Yes, so it is. And you’ve got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with
blood.”

“Now, that’s something _like_! Why, it’s a million times bullier than
pirating. I’ll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be
a reg’lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking ’bout it, I reckon
she’ll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.”

CONCLUSION

So endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a _boy_, it
must stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the
history of a _man_. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows
exactly where to stop—that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of
juveniles, he must stop where he best can.

Most of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are
prosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the
story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they
turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that
part of their lives at present.





        
            






Extracts From Adam’s Diary

Translated from the original MS.

by Mark Twain




[NOTE.—I translated a portion of this diary some years ago, and a
friend of mine printed a few copies in an incomplete form, but the
public never got them. Since then I have deciphered some more of Adam’s
hieroglyphics, and think he has now become sufficiently important as a
public character to justify this publication.—M. T.]




Monday


This new creature with the long hair is a good deal in the way. It is
always hanging around and following me about. I don’t like this; I am
not used to company. I wish it would stay with the other animals.
Cloudy to-day, wind in the east; think we shall have rain…. Where did I
get that word?… I remember now—the new creature uses it.




Tuesday


Been examining the great waterfall. It is the finest thing on the
estate, I think. The new creature calls it Niagara Falls—why, I am sure
I do not know. Says it looks like Niagara Falls. That is not a reason;
it is mere waywardness and imbecility. I get no chance to name anything
myself. The new creature names everything that comes along, before I
can get in a protest. And always that same pretext is offered—it looks
like the thing. There is the dodo, for instance. Says the moment one
looks at it one sees at a glance that it “looks like a dodo.” It will
have to keep that name, no doubt. It wearies me to fret about it, and
it does no good, anyway. Dodo! It looks no more like a dodo than I do.




Wednesday


Built me a shelter against the rain, but could not have it to myself in
peace. The new creature intruded. When I tried to put it out it shed
water out of the holes it looks with, and wiped it away with the back
of its paws, and made a noise such as some of the other animals make
when they are in distress. I wish it would not talk; it is always
talking. That sounds like a cheap fling at the poor creature, a slur;
but I do not mean it so. I have never heard the human voice before, and
any new and strange sound intruding itself here upon the solemn hush of
these dreaming solitudes offends my ear and seems a false note. And
this new sound is so close to me; it is right at my shoulder, right at
my ear, first on one side and then on the other, and I am used only to
sounds that are more or less distant from me.




Friday


The naming goes recklessly on, in spite of anything I can do. I had a
very good name for the estate, and it was musical and pretty
—GARDEN-OF-EDEN. Privately, I continue to call it that, but not any
longer publicly. The new creature says it is all woods and rocks and
scenery, and therefore has no resemblance to a garden. Says it looks
like a park, and does not look like anything but a park. Consequently,
without consulting me, it has been new-named —NIAGARA FALLS PARK. This
is sufficiently high-handed, it seems to me. And already there is a
sign up:

KEEP OFF THE GRASS

My life is not as happy as it was.




Saturday


The new creature eats too much fruit. We are going to run short, most
likely. “We” again—that is its word; mine too, now, from hearing it so
much. Good deal of fog this morning. I do not go out in the fog myself.
The new creature does. It goes out in all weathers, and stumps right in
with its muddy feet. And talks. It used to be so pleasant and quiet
here.




Sunday


Pulled through. This day is getting to be more and more trying. It was
selected and set apart last November as a day of rest. I already had
six of them per week, before. This morning found the new creature
trying to clod apples out of that forbidden tree.




Monday


The new creature says its name is Eve. That is all right, I have no
objections. Says it is to call it by when I want it to come. I said it
was superfluous, then. The word evidently raised me in its respect; and
indeed it is a large, good word, and will bear repetition. It says it
is not an It, it is a She. This is probably doubtful; yet it is all one
to me; what she is were nothing to me if she would but go by herself
and not talk.




Tuesday


She has littered the whole estate with execrable names and offensive
signs:

THIS WAY TO THE WHIRLPOOL.

THIS WAY TO GOAT ISLAND.

CAVE OF THE WINDS THIS WAY.

She says this park would make a tidy summer resort, if there was any
custom for it. Summer resort—another invention of hers—just words,
without any meaning. What is a summer resort? But it is best not to ask
her, she has such a rage for explaining.




Friday


She has taken to beseeching me to stop going over the Falls. What harm
does it do? Says it makes her shudder. I wonder why. I have always done
it—always liked the plunge, and the excitement, and the coolness. I
supposed it was what the Falls were for. They have no other use that I
can see, and they must have been made for something. She says they were
only made for scenery—like the rhinoceros and the mastodon.

I went over the Falls in a barrel—not satisfactory to her. Went over in
a tub—still not satisfactory. Swam the Whirlpool and the Rapids in a
fig-leaf suit. It got much damaged. Hence, tedious complaints about my
extravagance. I am too much hampered here. What I need is change of
scene.




Saturday


I escaped last Tuesday night, and travelled two days, and built me
another shelter, in a secluded place, and obliterated my tracks as well
as I could, but she hunted me out by means of a beast which she has
tamed and calls a wolf, and came making that pitiful noise again, and
shedding that water out of the places she looks with. I was obliged to
return with her, but will presently emigrate again, when occasion
offers. She engages herself in many foolish things: among others,
trying to study out why the animals called lions and tigers live on
grass and flowers, when, as she says, the sort of teeth they wear would
indicate that they were intended to eat each other. This is foolish,
because to do that would be to kill each other, and that would
introduce what, as I understand it, is called “death;” and death, as I
have been told, has not yet entered the Park. Which is a pity, on some
accounts.




Sunday


Pulled through.




Monday


I believe I see what the week is for: it is to give time to rest up
from the weariness of Sunday. It seems a good idea…. She has been
climbing that tree again. Clodded her out of it. She said nobody was
looking. Seems to consider that a sufficient justification for chancing
any dangerous thing. Told her that. The word justification moved her
admiration—and envy too, I thought. It is a good word.




Thursday


She told me she was made out of a rib taken from my body. This is at
least doubtful, if not more than that. I have not missed any rib…. She
is in much trouble about the buzzard; says grass does not agree with
it; is afraid she can’t raise it; thinks it was intended to live on
decayed flesh. The buzzard must get along the best it can with what is
provided. We cannot overturn the whole scheme to accommodate the
buzzard.




Saturday


She fell in the pond yesterday, when she was looking at herself in it,
which she is always doing. She nearly strangled, and said it was most
uncomfortable. This made her sorry for the creatures which live in
there, which she calls fish, for she continues to fasten names on to
things that don’t need them and don’t come when they are called by
them, which is a matter of no consequence to her, as she is such a
numskull anyway; so she got a lot of them out and brought them in last
night and put them in my bed to keep warm, but I have noticed them now
and then all day, and I don’t see that they are any happier there than
they were before, only quieter. When night comes I shall throw them
out-doors. I will not sleep with them again, for I find them clammy and
unpleasant to lie among when a person hasn’t anything on.




Sunday


Pulled through.




Tuesday


She has taken up with a snake now. The other animals are glad, for she
was always experimenting with them and bothering them; and I am glad,
because the snake talks, and this enables me to get a rest.




Friday


She says the snake advises her to try the fruit of that tree, and says
the result will be a great and fine and noble education. I told her
there would be another result, too—it would introduce death into the
world. That was a mistake—it had been better to keep the remark to
myself; it only gave her an idea—she could save the sick buzzard, and
furnish fresh meat to the despondent lions and tigers. I advised her to
keep away from the tree. She said she wouldn’t. I foresee trouble. Will
emigrate.




Wednesday


I have had a variegated time. I escaped that night, and rode a horse
all night as fast as he could go, hoping to get clear out of the Park
and hide in some other country before the trouble should begin; but it
was not to be. About an hour after sunup, as I was riding through a
flowery plain where thousands of animals were grazing, slumbering, or
playing with each other, according to their wont, all of a sudden they
broke into a tempest of frightful noises, and in one moment the plain
was in a frantic commotion and every beast was destroying its neighbor.
I knew what it meant—Eve had eaten that fruit, and death was come into
the world…. The tigers ate my horse, paying no attention when I ordered
them to desist, and they would even have eaten me if I had stayed—which
I didn’t, but went away in much haste…. I found this place, outside the
Park, and was fairly comfortable for a few days, but she has found me
out. Found me out, and has named the place Tonawanda—says it looks like
that. In fact, I was not sorry she came, for there are but meagre
pickings here, and she brought some of those apples. I was obliged to
eat them, I was so hungry. It was against my principles, but I find
that principles have no real force except when one is well fed…. She
came curtained in boughs and bunches of leaves, and when I asked her
what she meant by such nonsense, and snatched them away and threw them
down, she tittered and blushed. I had never seen a person titter and
blush before, and to me it seemed unbecoming and idiotic. She said I
would soon know how it was myself. This was correct. Hungry as I was, I
laid down the apple half eaten—certainly the best one I ever saw,
considering the lateness of the season—and arrayed myself in the
discarded boughs and branches, and then spoke to her with some severity
and ordered her to go and get some more and not make such a spectacle
of herself. She did it, and after this we crept down to where the
wild-beast battle had been, and collected some skins, and I made her
patch together a couple of suits proper for public occasions. They are
uncomfortable, it is true, but stylish, and that is the main point
about clothes. … I find she is a good deal of a companion. I see I
should be lonesome and depressed without her, now that I have lost my
property. Another thing, she says it is ordered that we work for our
living hereafter. She will be useful. I will superintend.




Ten Days Later


She accuses me of being the cause of our disaster! She says, with
apparent sincerity and truth, that the Serpent assured her that the
forbidden fruit was not apples, it was chestnuts. I said I was
innocent, then, for I had not eaten any chestnuts. She said the Serpent
informed her that “chestnut” was a figurative term meaning an aged and
mouldy joke. I turned pale at that, for I have made many jokes to pass
the weary time, and some of them could have been of that sort, though I
had honestly supposed that they were new when I made them. She asked me
if I had made one just at the time of the catastrophe. I was obliged to
admit that I had made one to myself, though not aloud. It was this. I
was thinking about the Falls, and I said to myself, “How wonderful it
is to see that vast body of water tumble down there!” Then in an
instant a bright thought flashed into my head, and I let it fly,
saying, “It would be a deal more wonderful to see it tumble up
there!”—and I was just about to kill myself with laughing at it when
all nature broke loose in war and death, and I had to flee for my life.
“There,” she said, with triumph, “that is just it; the Serpent
mentioned that very jest, and called it the First Chestnut, and said it
was coeval with the creation.” Alas, I am indeed to blame. Would that I
were not witty; oh, would that I had never had that radiant thought!




Next Year


We have named it Cain. She caught it while I was up country trapping on
the North Shore of the Erie; caught it in the timber a couple of miles
from our dug-out—or it might have been four, she isn’t certain which.
It resembles us in some ways, and may be a relation. That is what she
thinks, but this is an error, in my judgment. The difference in size
warrants the conclusion that it is a different and new kind of animal—a
fish, perhaps, though when I put it in the water to see, it sank, and
she plunged in and snatched it out before there was opportunity for the
experiment to determine the matter. I still think it is a fish, but she
is indifferent about what it is, and will not let me have it to try. I
do not understand this. The coming of the creature seems to have
changed her whole nature and made her unreasonable about experiments.
She thinks more of it than she does of any of the other animals, but is
not able to explain why. Her mind is disordered—everything shows it.
Sometimes she carries the fish in her arms half the night when it
complains and wants to get to the water. At such times the water comes
out of the places in her face that she looks out of, and she pats the
fish on the back and makes soft sounds with her mouth to soothe it, and
betrays sorrow and solicitude in a hundred ways. I have never seen her
do like this with any other fish, and it troubles me greatly. She used
to carry the young tigers around so, and play with them, before we lost
our property; but it was only play; she never took on about them like
this when their dinner disagreed with them.




Sunday


She doesn’t work Sundays, but lies around all tired out, and likes to
have the fish wallow over her; and she makes fool noises to amuse it,
and pretends to chew its paws, and that makes it laugh. I have not seen
a fish before that could laugh. This makes me doubt…. I have come to
like Sunday myself. Superintending all the week tires a body so. There
ought to be more Sundays. In the old days they were tough, but now they
come handy.




Wednesday


It isn’t a fish. I cannot quite make out what it is. It makes curious,
devilish noises when not satisfied, and says “goo-goo” when it is. It
is not one of us, for it doesn’t walk; it is not a bird, for it doesn’t
fly; it is not a frog, for it doesn’t hop; it is not a snake, for it
doesn’t crawl; I feel sure it is not a fish, though I cannot get a
chance to find out whether it can swim or not. It merely lies around,
and mostly on its back, with its feet up. I have not seen any other
animal do that before. I said I believed it was an enigma, but she only
admired the word without understanding it. In my judgment it is either
an enigma or some kind of a bug. If it dies, I will take it apart and
see what its arrangements are. I never had a thing perplex me so.




Three Months Later


The perplexity augments instead of diminishing. I sleep but little. It
has ceased from lying around, and goes about on its four legs now. Yet
it differs from the other four-legged animals in that its front legs
are unusually short, consequently this causes the main part of its
person to stick up uncomfortably high in the air, and this is not
attractive. It is built much as we are, but its method of travelling
shows that it is not of our breed. The short front legs and long hind
ones indicate that it is of the kangaroo family, but it is a marked
variation of the species, since the true kangaroo hops, whereas this
one never does. Still, it is a curious and interesting variety, and has
not been catalogued before. As I discovered it, I have felt justified
in securing the credit of the discovery by attaching my name to it, and
hence have called it Kangaroorum Adamiensis…. It must have been a young
one when it came, for it has grown exceedingly since. It must be five
times as big, now, as it was then, and when discontented is able to
make from twenty-two to thirty-eight times the noise it made at first.
Coercion does not modify this, but has the contrary effect. For this
reason I discontinued the system. She reconciles it by persuasion, and
by giving it things which she had previously told it she wouldn’t give
it. As already observed, I was not at home when it first came, and she
told me she found it in the woods. It seems odd that it should be the
only one, yet it must be so, for I have worn myself out these many
weeks trying to find another one to add to my collection, and for this
one to play with; for surely then it would be quieter, and we could
tame it more easily. But I find none, nor any vestige of any; and
strangest of all, no tracks. It has to live on the ground, it cannot
help itself; therefore, how does it get about without leaving a track?
I have set a dozen traps, but they do no good. I catch all small
animals except that one; animals that merely go into the trap out of
curiosity, I think, to see what the milk is there for. They never drink
it.




Three Months Later


The kangaroo still continues to grow, which is very strange and
perplexing. I never knew one to be so long getting its growth. It has
fur on its head now; not like kangaroo fur, but exactly like our hair,
except that it is much finer and softer, and instead of being black is
red. I am like to lose my mind over the capricious and harassing
developments of this unclassifiable zoological freak. If I could catch
another one—but that is hopeless; it is a new variety, and the only
sample; this is plain. But I caught a true kangaroo and brought it in,
thinking that this one, being lonesome, would rather have that for
company than have no kin at all, or any animal it could feel a nearness
to or get sympathy from in its forlorn condition here among strangers
who do not know its ways or habits, or what to do to make it feel that
it is among friends; but it was a mistake—it went into such fits at the
sight of the kangaroo that I was convinced it had never seen one
before. I pity the poor noisy little animal, but there is nothing I can
do to make it happy. If I could tame it—but that is out of the
question; the more I try, the worse I seem to make it. It grieves me to
the heart to see it in its little storms of sorrow and passion. I
wanted to let it go, but she wouldn’t hear of it. That seemed cruel and
not like her; and yet she may be right. It might be lonelier than ever;
for since I cannot find another one, how could it?




Five Months Later


It is not a kangaroo. No, for it supports itself by holding to her
finger, and thus goes a few steps on its hind legs, and then falls
down. It is probably some kind of a bear; and yet it has no tail—as
yet—and no fur, except on its head. It still keeps on growing—that is a
curious circumstance, for bears get their growth earlier than this.
Bears are dangerous—since our catastrophe—and I shall not be satisfied
to have this one prowling about the place much longer without a muzzle
on. I have offered to get her a kangaroo if she would let this one go,
but it did no good—she is determined to run us into all sorts of
foolish risks, I think. She was not like this before she lost her mind.




A Fortnight Later


I examined its mouth. There is no danger yet; it has only one tooth. It
has no tail yet. It makes more noise now than it ever did before—and
mainly at night. I have moved out. But I shall go over, mornings, to
breakfast, and to see if it has more teeth. If it gets a mouthful of
teeth, it will be time for it to go, tail or no tail, for a bear does
not need a tail in order to be dangerous.




Four Months Later


I have been off hunting and fishing a month, up in the region that she
calls Buffalo; I don’t know why, unless it is because there are not any
buffaloes there. Meantime the bear has learned to paddle around all by
itself on its hind legs, and says “poppa” and “momma.” It is certainly
a new species. This resemblance to words may be purely accidental, of
course, and may have no purpose or meaning; but even in that case it is
still extraordinary, and is a thing which no other bear can do. This
imitation of speech, taken together with general absence of fur and
entire absence of tail, sufficiently indicates that this is a new kind
of bear. The further study of it will be exceedingly interesting.
Meantime I will go off on a far expedition among the forests of the
North and make an exhaustive search. There must certainly be another
one somewhere, and this one will be less dangerous when it has company
of its own species. I will go straightway; but I will muzzle this one
first.




Three Months Later


It has been a weary, weary hunt, yet I have had no success. In the mean
time, without stirring from the home estate, she has caught another
one! I never saw such luck. I might have hunted these woods a hundred
years, I never should have run across that thing.




Next Day


I have been comparing the new one with the old one, and it is perfectly
plain that they are the same breed. I was going to stuff one of them
for my collection, but she is prejudiced against it for some reason or
other; so I have relinquished the idea, though I think it is a mistake.
It would be an irreparable loss to science if they should get away. The
old one is tamer than it was, and can laugh and talk like the parrot,
having learned this, no doubt, from being with the parrot so much, and
having the imitative faculty in a highly developed degree. I shall be
astonished if it turns out to be a new kind of parrot, and yet I ought
not to be astonished, for it has already been everything else it could
think of, since those first days when it was a fish. The new one is as
ugly now as the old one was at first; has the same sulphur-and-raw-meat
complexion and the same singular head without any fur on it. She calls
it Abel.




Ten Years Later


They are boys; we found it out long ago. It was their coming in that
small, immature shape that puzzled us; we were not used to it. There
are some girls now. Abel is a good boy, but if Cain had stayed a bear
it would have improved him. After all these years, I see that I was
mistaken about Eve in the beginning; it is better to live outside the
Garden with her than inside it without her. At first I thought she
talked too much; but now I should be sorry to have that voice fall
silent and pass out of my life. Blessed be the chestnut that brought us
near together and taught me to know the goodness of her heart and the
sweetness of her spirit!

CHAPTER XI.

And sure enough, two or three years afterward, we did hear him again.
News came to the Pacific coast that the Vigilance Committee in Montana
(whither Slade had removed from Rocky Ridge) had hanged him.  I find an
account of the affair in the thrilling little book I quoted a paragraph
from in the last chapter--"The Vigilantes of Montana; being a Reliable
Account of the Capture, Trial and Execution of Henry Plummer's Notorious
Road Agent Band: By Prof. Thos. J. Dimsdale, Virginia City, M.T."
Mr. Dimsdale's chapter is well worth reading, as a specimen of how the
people of the frontier deal with criminals when the courts of law prove
inefficient.  Mr. Dimsdale makes two remarks about Slade, both of which
are accurately descriptive, and one of which is exceedingly picturesque:
"Those who saw him in his natural state only, would pronounce him to be a
kind husband, a most hospitable host and a courteous gentleman; on the
contrary, those who met him when maddened with liquor and surrounded by a
gang of armed roughs, would pronounce him a fiend incarnate."  And this:
"From Fort Kearney, west, he was feared a great deal more than the
almighty."  For compactness, simplicity and vigor of expression, I will
"back" that sentence against anything in literature.  Mr. Dimsdale's
narrative is as follows.  In all places where italics occur, they are
mine:

      After the execution of the five men on the 14th of January, the
      Vigilantes considered that their work was nearly ended.  They had
      freed the country of highwaymen and murderers to a great extent, and
      they determined that in the absence of the regular civil authority
      they would establish a People's Court where all offenders should be
      tried by judge and jury.  This was the nearest approach to social
      order that the circumstances permitted, and, though strict legal
      authority was wanting, yet the people were firmly determined to
      maintain its efficiency, and to enforce its decrees.  It may here be
      mentioned that the overt act which was the last round on the fatal
      ladder leading to the scaffold on which Slade perished, was the
      tearing in pieces and stamping upon a writ of this court, followed
      by his arrest of the Judge Alex. Davis, by authority of a presented
      Derringer, and with his own hands.

      J. A. Slade was himself, we have been informed, a Vigilante; he
      openly boasted of it, and said he knew all that they knew.  He was
      never accused, or even suspected, of either murder or robbery,
      committed in this Territory (the latter crime was never laid to his
      charge, in any place); but that he had killed several men in other
      localities was notorious, and his bad reputation in this respect was
      a most powerful argument in determining his fate, when he was
      finally arrested for the offence above mentioned.  On returning from
      Milk River he became more and more addicted to drinking, until at
      last it was a common feat for him and his friends to "take the
      town."  He and a couple of his dependents might often be seen on one
      horse, galloping through the streets, shouting and yelling, firing
      revolvers, etc.  On many occasions he would ride his horse into
      stores, break up bars, toss the scales out of doors and use most
      insulting language to parties present.  Just previous to the day of
      his arrest, he had given a fearful beating to one of his followers;
      but such was his influence over them that the man wept bitterly at
      the gallows, and begged for his life with all his power.  It had
      become quite common, when Slade was on a spree, for the shop-keepers
      and citizens to close the stores and put out all the lights; being
      fearful of some outrage at his hands.  For his wanton destruction of
      goods and furniture, he was always ready to pay, when sober, if he
      had money; but there were not a few who regarded payment as small
      satisfaction for the outrage, and these men were his personal
      enemies.

      From time to time Slade received warnings from men that he well knew
      would not deceive him, of the certain end of his conduct.  There was
      not a moment, for weeks previous to his arrest, in which the public
      did not expect to hear of some bloody outrage.  The dread of his
      very name, and the presence of the armed band of hangers-on who
      followed him alone prevented a resistance which must certainly have
      ended in the instant murder or mutilation of the opposing party.

      Slade was frequently arrested by order of the court whose
      organization we have described, and had treated it with respect by
      paying one or two fines and promising to pay the rest when he had
      money; but in the transaction that occurred at this crisis, he
      forgot even this caution, and goaded by passion and the hatred of
      restraint, he sprang into the embrace of death.

      Slade had been drunk and "cutting up" all night.  He and his
      companions had made the town a perfect hell.  In the morning, J. M.
      Fox, the sheriff, met him, arrested him, took him into court and
      commenced reading a warrant that he had for his arrest, by way of
      arraignment.  He became uncontrollably furious, and seizing the
      writ, he tore it up, threw it on the ground and stamped upon it.

      The clicking of the locks of his companions' revolvers was instantly
      heard, and a crisis was expected.  The sheriff did not attempt his
      retention; but being at least as prudent as he was valiant, he
      succumbed, leaving Slade the master of the situation and the
      conqueror and ruler of the courts, law and law-makers.  This was a
      declaration of war, and was so accepted.  The Vigilance Committee
      now felt that the question of social order and the preponderance of
      the law-abiding citizens had then and there to be decided.  They
      knew the character of Slade, and they were well aware that they must
      submit to his rule without murmur, or else that he must be dealt
      with in such fashion as would prevent his being able to wreak his
      vengeance on the committee, who could never have hoped to live in
      the Territory secure from outrage or death, and who could never
      leave it without encountering his friend, whom his victory would
      have emboldened and stimulated to a pitch that would have rendered
      them reckless of consequences.  The day previous he had ridden into
      Dorris's store, and on being requested to leave, he drew his
      revolver and threatened to kill the gentleman who spoke to him.
      Another saloon he had led his horse into, and buying a bottle of
      wine, he tried to make the animal drink it.  This was not considered
      an uncommon performance, as he had often entered saloons and
      commenced firing at the lamps, causing a wild stampede.

      A leading member of the committee met Slade, and informed him in the
      quiet, earnest manner of one who feels the importance of what he is
      saying: "Slade, get your horse at once, and go home, or there will
      be ---- to pay."  Slade started and took a long look, with his dark
      and piercing eyes, at the gentleman.  "What do you mean?"  said he.
      "You have no right to ask me what I mean," was the quiet reply, "get
      your horse at once, and remember what I tell you."  After a short
      pause he promised to do so, and actually got into the saddle; but,
      being still intoxicated, he began calling aloud to one after another
      of his friends, and at last seemed to have forgotten the warning he
      had received and became again uproarious, shouting the name of a
      well-known courtezan in company with those of two men whom he
      considered heads of the committee, as a sort of challenge; perhaps,
      however, as a simple act of bravado.  It seems probable that the
      intimation of personal danger he had received had not been forgotten
      entirely; though fatally for him, he took a foolish way of showing
      his remembrance of it.  He sought out Alexander Davis, the Judge of
      the Court, and drawing a cocked Derringer, he presented it at his
      head, and told him that he should hold him as a hostage for his own
      safety.  As the judge stood perfectly quiet, and offered no
      resistance to his captor, no further outrage followed on this score.
      Previous to this, on account of the critical state of affairs, the
      committee had met, and at last resolved to arrest him.  His
      execution had not been agreed upon, and, at that time, would have
      been negatived, most assuredly.  A messenger rode down to Nevada to
      inform the leading men of what was on hand, as it was desirable to
      show that there was a feeling of unanimity on the subject, all along
      the gulch.

      The miners turned out almost en masse, leaving their work and
      forming in solid column about six hundred strong, armed to the
      teeth, they marched up to Virginia.  The leader of the body well
      knew the temper of his men on the subject.  He spurred on ahead of
      them, and hastily calling a meeting of the executive, he told them
      plainly that the miners meant "business," and that, if they came up,
      they would not stand in the street to be shot down by Slade's
      friends; but that they would take him and hang him.  The meeting was
      small, as the Virginia men were loath to act at all.  This momentous
      announcement of the feeling of the Lower Town was made to a cluster
      of men, who were deliberation behind a wagon, at the rear of a store
      on Main street.

      The committee were most unwilling to proceed to extremities.  All
      the duty they had ever performed seemed as nothing to the task
      before them; but they had to decide, and that quickly.  It was
      finally agreed that if the whole body of the miners were of the
      opinion that he should be hanged, that the committee left it in
      their hands to deal with him.  Off, at hot speed, rode the leader of
      the Nevada men to join his command.

      Slade had found out what was intended, and the news sobered him
      instantly.  He went into P. S. Pfouts' store, where Davis was, and
      apologized for his conduct, saying that he would take it all back.

      The head of the column now wheeled into Wallace street and marched
      up at quick time.  Halting in front of the store, the executive
      officer of the committee stepped forward and arrested Slade, who was
      at once informed of his doom, and inquiry was made as to whether he
      had any business to settle.  Several parties spoke to him on the
      subject; but to all such inquiries he turned a deaf ear, being
      entirely absorbed in the terrifying reflections on his own awful
      position.  He never ceased his entreaties for life, and to see his
      dear wife.  The unfortunate lady referred to, between whom and Slade
      there existed a warm affection, was at this time living at their
      ranch on the Madison.  She was possessed of considerable personal
      attractions; tall, well-formed, of graceful carriage, pleasing
      manners, and was, withal, an accomplished horsewoman.

      A messenger from Slade rode at full speed to inform her of her
      husband's arrest.  In an instant she was in the saddle, and with all
      the energy that love and despair could lend to an ardent temperament
      and a strong physique, she urged her fleet charger over the twelve
      miles of rough and rocky ground that intervened between her and the
      object of her passionate devotion.

      Meanwhile a party of volunteers had made the necessary preparations
      for the execution, in the valley traversed by the branch.  Beneath
      the site of Pfouts and Russell's stone building there was a corral,
      the gate-posts of which were strong and high.  Across the top was
      laid a beam, to which the rope was fastened, and a dry-goods box
      served for the platform.  To this place Slade was marched,
      surrounded by a guard, composing the best armed and most numerous
      force that has ever appeared in Montana Territory.

      The doomed man had so exhausted himself by tears, prayers and
      lamentations, that he had scarcely strength left to stand under the
      fatal beam.  He repeatedly exclaimed, "My God! my God! must I die?
      Oh, my dear wife!"

      On the return of the fatigue party, they encountered some friends of
      Slade, staunch and reliable citizens and members of the committee,
      but who were personally attached to the condemned.  On hearing of
      his sentence, one of them, a stout-hearted man, pulled out his
      handkerchief and walked away, weeping like a child.  Slade still
      begged to see his wife, most piteously, and it seemed hard to deny
      his request; but the bloody consequences that were sure to follow
      the inevitable attempt at a rescue, that her presence and entreaties
      would have certainly incited, forbade the granting of his request.
      Several gentlemen were sent for to see him, in his last moments, one
      of whom (Judge Davis) made a short address to the people; but in
      such low tones as to be inaudible, save to a few in his immediate
      vicinity.  One of his friends, after exhausting his powers of
      entreaty, threw off his coat and declared that the prisoner could
      not be hanged until he himself was killed.  A hundred guns were
      instantly leveled at him; whereupon he turned and fled; but, being
      brought back, he was compelled to resume his coat, and to give a
      promise of future peaceable demeanor.

      Scarcely a leading man in Virginia could be found, though numbers of
      the citizens joined the ranks of the guard when the arrest was made.
      All lamented the stern necessity which dictated the execution.

      Everything being ready, the command was given, "Men, do your duty,"
      and the box being instantly slipped from beneath his feet, he died
      almost instantaneously.

      The body was cut down and carried to the Virginia Hotel, where, in a
      darkened room, it was scarcely laid out, when the unfortunate and
      bereaved companion of the deceased arrived, at headlong speed, to
      find that all was over, and that she was a widow.  Her grief and
      heart-piercing cries were terrible evidences of the depth of her
      attachment for her lost husband, and a considerable period elapsed
      before she could regain the command of her excited feelings.

There is something about the desperado-nature that is wholly
unaccountable--at least it looks unaccountable.  It is this.  The true
desperado is gifted with splendid courage, and yet he will take the most
infamous advantage of his enemy; armed and free, he will stand up before
a host and fight until he is shot all to pieces, and yet when he is under
the gallows and helpless he will cry and plead like a child.  Words are
cheap, and it is easy to call Slade a coward (all executed men who do not
"die game" are promptly called cowards by unreflecting people), and when
we read of Slade that he "had so exhausted himself by tears, prayers and
lamentations, that he had scarcely strength left to stand under the fatal
beam," the disgraceful word suggests itself in a moment--yet in
frequently defying and inviting the vengeance of banded Rocky Mountain
cut-throats by shooting down their comrades and leaders, and never
offering to hide or fly, Slade showed that he was a man of peerless
bravery.  No coward would dare that.  Many a notorious coward, many a
chicken-livered poltroon, coarse, brutal, degraded, has made his dying
speech without a quaver in his voice and been swung into eternity with
what looked liked the calmest fortitude, and so we are justified in
believing, from the low intellect of such a creature, that it was not
moral courage that enabled him to do it.  Then, if moral courage is not
the requisite quality, what could it have been that this stout-hearted
Slade lacked?--this bloody, desperate, kindly-mannered, urbane gentleman,
who never hesitated to warn his most ruffianly enemies that he would kill
them whenever or wherever he came across them next!  I think it is a
conundrum worth investigating.




CHAPTER XII.

Just beyond the breakfast-station we overtook a Mormon emigrant train of
thirty-three wagons; and tramping wearily along and driving their herd of
loose cows, were dozens of coarse-clad and sad-looking men, women and
children, who had walked as they were walking now, day after day for
eight lingering weeks, and in that time had compassed the distance our
stage had come in eight days and three hours--seven hundred and
ninety-eight miles!  They were dusty and uncombed, hatless, bonnetless
and ragged, and they did look so tired!

After breakfast, we bathed in Horse Creek, a (previously) limpid,
sparkling stream--an appreciated luxury, for it was very seldom that our
furious coach halted long enough for an indulgence of that kind.  We
changed horses ten or twelve times in every twenty-four hours--changed
mules, rather--six mules--and did it nearly every time in four minutes.
It was lively work.  As our coach rattled up to each station six
harnessed mules stepped gayly from the stable; and in the twinkling of an
eye, almost, the old team was out, and the new one in and we off and away
again.

During the afternoon we passed Sweetwater Creek, Independence Rock,
Devil's Gate and the Devil's Gap.  The latter were wild specimens of
rugged scenery, and full of interest--we were in the heart of the Rocky
Mountains, now.  And we also passed by "Alkali" or "Soda Lake," and we
woke up to the fact that our journey had stretched a long way across the
world when the driver said that the Mormons often came there from Great
Salt Lake City to haul away saleratus.  He said that a few days gone by
they had shoveled up enough pure saleratus from the ground (it was a dry
lake) to load two wagons, and that when they got these two wagons-loads
of a drug that cost them nothing, to Salt Lake, they could sell it for
twenty-five cents a pound.

In the night we sailed by a most notable curiosity, and one we had been
hearing a good deal about for a day or two, and were suffering to see.
This was what might be called a natural ice-house.  It was August, now,
and sweltering weather in the daytime, yet at one of the stations the men
could scape the soil on the hill-side under the lee of a range of
boulders, and at a depth of six inches cut out pure blocks of ice--hard,
compactly frozen, and clear as crystal!

Toward dawn we got under way again, and presently as we sat with raised
curtains enjoying our early-morning smoke and contemplating the first
splendor of the rising sun as it swept down the long array of mountain
peaks, flushing and gilding crag after crag and summit after summit, as
if the invisible Creator reviewed his gray veterans and they saluted with
a smile, we hove in sight of South Pass City.  The hotel-keeper, the
postmaster, the blacksmith, the mayor, the constable, the city marshal
and the principal citizen and property holder, all came out and greeted
us cheerily, and we gave him good day.  He gave us a little Indian news,
and a little Rocky Mountain news, and we gave him some Plains information
in return.  He then retired to his lonely grandeur and we climbed on up
among the bristling peaks and the ragged clouds.  South Pass City
consisted of four log cabins, one if which was unfinished, and the
gentleman with all those offices and titles was the chiefest of the ten
citizens of the place.  Think of hotel-keeper, postmaster, blacksmith,
mayor, constable, city marshal and principal citizen all condensed into
one person and crammed into one skin.  Bemis said he was "a perfect
Allen's revolver of dignities."  And he said that if he were to die as
postmaster, or as blacksmith, or as postmaster and blacksmith both, the
people might stand it; but if he were to die all over, it would be a
frightful loss to the community.

Two miles beyond South Pass City we saw for the first time that
mysterious marvel which all Western untraveled boys have heard of and
fully believe in, but are sure to be astounded at when they see it with
their own eyes, nevertheless--banks of snow in dead summer time.  We were
now far up toward the sky, and knew all the time that we must presently
encounter lofty summits clad in the "eternal snow" which was so common
place a matter of mention in books, and yet when I did see it glittering
in the sun on stately domes in the distance and knew the month was August
and that my coat was hanging up because it was too warm to wear it, I was
full as much amazed as if I never had heard of snow in August before.
Truly, "seeing is believing"--and many a man lives a long life through,
thinking he believes certain universally received and well established
things, and yet never suspects that if he were confronted by those things
once, he would discover that he did not really believe them before, but
only thought he believed them.

In a little while quite a number of peaks swung into view with long claws
of glittering snow clasping them; and with here and there, in the shade,
down the mountain side, a little solitary patch of snow looking no larger
than a lady's pocket-handkerchief but being in reality as large as a
"public square."

And now, at last, we were fairly in the renowned SOUTH PASS, and whirling
gayly along high above the common world.  We were perched upon the
extreme summit of the great range of the Rocky Mountains, toward which we
had been climbing, patiently climbing, ceaselessly climbing, for days and
nights together--and about us was gathered a convention of Nature's kings
that stood ten, twelve, and even thirteen thousand feet high--grand old
fellows who would have to stoop to see Mount Washington, in the twilight.
We were in such an airy elevation above the creeping populations of the
earth, that now and then when the obstructing crags stood out of the way
it seemed that we could look around and abroad and contemplate the whole
great globe, with its dissolving views of mountains, seas and continents
stretching away through the mystery of the summer haze.

As a general thing the Pass was more suggestive of a valley than a
suspension bridge in the clouds--but it strongly suggested the latter at
one spot.  At that place the upper third of one or two majestic purple
domes projected above our level on either hand and gave us a sense of a
hidden great deep of mountains and plains and valleys down about their
bases which we fancied we might see if we could step to the edge and look
over.  These Sultans of the fastnesses were turbaned with tumbled volumes
of cloud, which shredded away from time to time and drifted off fringed
and torn, trailing their continents of shadow after them; and catching
presently on an intercepting peak, wrapped it about and brooded there
--then shredded away again and left the purple peak, as they had left the
purple domes, downy and white with new-laid snow.  In passing, these
monstrous rags of cloud hung low and swept along right over the
spectator's head, swinging their tatters so nearly in his face that his
impulse was to shrink when they came closet.  In the one place I speak
of, one could look below him upon a world of diminishing crags and
canyons leading down, down, and away to a vague plain with a thread in it
which was a road, and bunches of feathers in it which were trees,--a
pretty picture sleeping in the sunlight--but with a darkness stealing
over it and glooming its features  deeper and deeper under the frown of a
coming storm; and then, while no film or shadow marred the noon
brightness of his high perch, he could watch the tempest break forth down
there and see the lightnings leap from crag to crag and the sheeted rain
drive along the canyon-sides, and hear the thunders peal and crash and
roar.  We had this spectacle; a familiar one to many, but to us a
novelty.

We bowled along cheerily, and presently, at the very summit (though it
had been all summit to us, and all equally level, for half an hour or
more), we came to a spring which spent its water through two outlets and
sent it in opposite directions.  The conductor said that one of those
streams which we were looking at, was just starting on a journey westward
to the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean, through hundreds and
even thousands of miles of desert solitudes.  He said that the other was
just leaving its home among the snow-peaks on a similar journey eastward
--and we knew that long after we should have forgotten the simple rivulet
it would still be plodding its patient way down the mountain sides, and
canyon-beds, and between the banks of the Yellowstone; and by and by
would join the broad Missouri and flow through unknown plains and deserts
and unvisited wildernesses; and add a long and troubled pilgrimage among
snags and wrecks and sandbars; and enter the Mississippi, touch the
wharves of St. Louis and still drift on, traversing shoals and rocky
channels, then endless chains of bottomless and ample bends, walled with
unbroken forests, then mysterious byways and secret passages among woody
islands, then the chained bends again, bordered with wide levels of
shining sugar-cane in place of the sombre forests; then by New Orleans
and still other chains of bends--and finally, after two long months of
daily and nightly harassment, excitement, enjoyment, adventure, and awful
peril of parched throats, pumps and evaporation, pass the Gulf and enter
into its rest upon the bosom of the tropic sea, never to look upon its
snow-peaks again or regret them.

I freighted a leaf with a mental message for the friends at home, and
dropped it in the stream.  But I put no stamp on it and it was held for
postage somewhere.

On the summit we overtook an emigrant train of many wagons, many tired
men and women, and many a disgusted sheep and cow.

In the wofully dusty horseman in charge of the expedition I recognized
John -----.  Of all persons in the world to meet on top of the Rocky
Mountains thousands of miles from home, he was the last one I should have
looked for.  We were school-boys together and warm friends for years.
But a boyish prank of mine had disruptured this friendship and it had
never been renewed.  The act of which I speak was this.  I had been
accustomed to visit occasionally an editor whose room was in the third
story of a building and overlooked the street.  One day this editor gave
me a watermelon which I made preparations to devour on the spot, but
chancing to look out of the window, I saw John standing directly under it
and an irresistible desire came upon me to drop the melon on his head,
which I immediately did.  I was the loser, for it spoiled the melon, and
John never forgave me and we dropped all intercourse and parted, but now
met again under these circumstances.

We recognized each other simultaneously, and hands were grasped as warmly
as if no coldness had ever existed between us, and no allusion was made
to any.  All animosities were buried and the simple fact of meeting a
familiar face in that isolated spot so far from home, was sufficient to
make us forget all things but pleasant ones, and we parted again with
sincere "good-bye" and "God bless you" from both.

We had been climbing up the long shoulders of the Rocky Mountains for
many tedious hours--we started down them, now.  And we went spinning away
at a round rate too.

We left the snowy Wind River Mountains and Uinta Mountains behind, and
sped away, always through splendid scenery but occasionally through long
ranks of white skeletons of mules and oxen--monuments of the huge
emigration of other days--and here and there were up-ended boards or
small piles of stones which the driver said marked the resting-place of
more precious remains.

It was the loneliest land for a grave!  A land given over to the cayote
and the raven--which is but another name for desolation and utter
solitude.  On damp, murky nights, these scattered skeletons gave forth a
soft, hideous glow, like very faint spots of moonlight starring the vague
desert.  It was because of the phosphorus in the bones.  But no
scientific explanation could keep a body from shivering when he drifted
by one of those ghostly lights and knew that a skull held it.

At midnight it began to rain, and I never saw anything like it--indeed, I
did not even see this, for it was too dark.  We fastened down the
curtains and even caulked them with clothing, but the rain streamed in in
twenty places, nothwithstanding.  There was no escape.  If one moved his
feet out of a stream, he brought his body under one; and if he moved his
body he caught one somewhere else.  If he struggled out of the drenched
blankets and sat up, he was bound to get one down the back of his neck.
Meantime the stage was wandering about a plain with gaping gullies in it,
for the driver could not see an inch before his face nor keep the road,
and the storm pelted so pitilessly that there was no keeping the horses
still.  With the first abatement the conductor turned out with lanterns
to look for the road, and the first dash he made was into a chasm about
fourteen feet deep, his lantern following like a meteor.  As soon as he
touched bottom he sang out frantically:

"Don't come here!"

To which the driver, who was looking over the precipice where he had
disappeared, replied, with an injured air: "Think I'm a dam fool?"

The conductor was more than an hour finding the road--a matter which
showed us how far we had wandered and what chances we had been taking.
He traced our wheel-tracks to the imminent verge of danger, in two
places.  I have always been glad that we were not killed that night.
I do not know any particular reason, but I have always been glad.
In the morning, the tenth day out, we crossed Green River, a fine, large,
limpid stream--stuck in it with the water just up to the top of our
mail-bed, and waited till extra teams were put on to haul us up the steep
bank.  But it was nice cool water, and besides it could not find any
fresh place on us to wet.

At the Green River station we had breakfast--hot biscuits, fresh antelope
steaks, and coffee--the only decent meal we tasted between the United
States and Great Salt Lake City, and the only one we were ever really
thankful for.

Think of the monotonous execrableness of the thirty that went before it,
to leave this one simple breakfast looming up in my memory like a
shot-tower after all these years have gone by!

At five P.M.  we reached Fort Bridger, one hundred and seventeen miles
from the South Pass, and one thousand and twenty-five miles from St.
Joseph.  Fifty-two miles further on, near the head of Echo Canyon, we met
sixty United States soldiers from Camp Floyd.  The day before, they had
fired upon three hundred or four hundred Indians, whom they supposed
gathered together for no good purpose.  In the fight that had ensued,
four Indians were captured, and the main body chased four miles, but
nobody killed.  This looked like business.  We had a notion to get out
and join the sixty soldiers, but upon reflecting that there were four
hundred of the Indians, we concluded to go on and join the Indians.

Echo Canyon is twenty miles long.  It was like a long, smooth, narrow
street, with a gradual descending grade, and shut in by enormous
perpendicular walls of coarse conglomerate, four hundred feet high in
many places, and turreted like mediaeval castles.  This was the most
faultless piece of road in the mountains, and the driver said he would
"let his team out."  He did, and if the Pacific express trains whiz
through there now any faster than we did then in the stage-coach, I envy
the passengers the exhilaration of it.  We fairly seemed to pick up our
wheels and fly--and the mail matter was lifted up free from everything
and held in solution!  I am not given to exaggeration, and when I say a
thing I mean it.

However, time presses.  At four in the afternoon we arrived on the summit
of Big Mountain, fifteen miles from Salt Lake City, when all the world
was glorified with the setting sun, and the most stupendous panorama of
mountain peaks yet encountered burst on our sight.  We looked out upon
this sublime spectacle from under the arch of a brilliant rainbow!  Even
the overland stage-driver stopped his horses and gazed!

Half an hour or an hour later, we changed horses, and took supper with a
Mormon "Destroying Angel."

"Destroying Angels," as I understand it, are Latter-Day Saints who are
set apart by the Church to conduct permanent disappearances of obnoxious
citizens.  I had heard a deal about these Mormon Destroying Angels and
the dark and bloody deeds they had done, and when I entered this one's
house I had my shudder all ready.  But alas for all our romances, he was
nothing but a loud, profane, offensive, old blackguard!  He was murderous
enough, possibly, to fill the bill of a Destroyer, but would you have any
kind of an Angel devoid of dignity?  Could you abide an Angel in an
unclean shirt and no suspenders?  Could you respect an Angel with a
horse-laugh and a swagger like a buccaneer?

There were other blackguards present--comrades of this one.  And there
was one person that looked like a gentleman--Heber C. Kimball's son, tall
and well made, and thirty years old, perhaps.  A lot of slatternly women
flitted hither and thither in a hurry, with coffee-pots, plates of bread,
and other appurtenances to supper, and these were said to be the wives of
the Angel--or some of them, at least.  And of course they were; for if
they had been hired "help" they would not have let an angel from above
storm and swear at them as he did, let alone one from the place this one
hailed from.

This was our first experience of the western "peculiar institution," and
it was not very prepossessing.  We did not tarry long to observe it, but
hurried on to the home of the Latter-Day Saints, the stronghold of the
prophets, the capital of the only absolute monarch in America--Great Salt
Lake City.  As the night closed in we took sanctuary in the Salt Lake
House and unpacked our baggage.




CHAPTER XIII.

We had a fine supper, of the freshest meats and fowls and vegetables--a
great variety and as great abundance.  We walked about the streets some,
afterward, and glanced in at shops and stores; and there was fascination
in surreptitiously staring at every creature we took to be a Mormon.
This was fairy-land to us, to all intents and purposes--a land of
enchantment, and goblins, and awful mystery.  We felt a curiosity to ask
every child how many mothers it had, and if it could tell them apart; and
we experienced a thrill every time a dwelling-house door opened and shut
as we passed, disclosing a glimpse of human heads and backs and
shoulders--for we so longed to have a good satisfying look at a Mormon
family in all its comprehensive ampleness, disposed in the customary
concentric rings of its home circle.

By and by the Acting Governor of the Territory introduced us to other
"Gentiles," and we spent a sociable hour with them.  "Gentiles" are
people who are not Mormons.  Our fellow-passenger, Bemis, took care of
himself, during this part of the evening, and did not make an
overpowering success of it, either, for he came into our room in the
hotel about eleven o'clock, full of cheerfulness, and talking loosely,
disjointedly and indiscriminately, and every now and then tugging out a
ragged word by the roots that had more hiccups than syllables in it.
This, together with his hanging his coat on the floor on one side of a
chair, and his vest on the floor on the other side, and piling his pants
on the floor just in front of the same chair, and then comtemplating the
general result with superstitious awe, and finally pronouncing it "too
many for him" and going to bed with his boots on, led us to fear that
something he had eaten had not agreed with him.

But we knew afterward that it was something he had been drinking.  It was
the exclusively Mormon refresher, "valley tan."

Valley tan (or, at least, one form of valley tan) is a kind of whisky,
or first cousin to it; is of Mormon invention and manufactured only in
Utah.  Tradition says it is made of (imported) fire and brimstone.  If I
remember rightly no public drinking saloons were allowed in the kingdom
by Brigham Young, and no private drinking permitted among the faithful,
except they confined themselves to "valley tan."

Next day we strolled about everywhere through the broad, straight, level
streets, and enjoyed the pleasant strangeness of a city of fifteen
thousand inhabitants with no loafers perceptible in it; and no visible
drunkards or noisy people; a limpid stream rippling and dancing through
every street in place of a filthy gutter; block after block of trim
dwellings, built of "frame" and sunburned brick--a great thriving orchard
and garden behind every one of them, apparently--branches from the street
stream winding and sparkling among the garden beds and fruit trees--and a
grand general air of neatness, repair, thrift and comfort, around and
about and over the whole.  And everywhere were workshops, factories, and
all manner of industries; and intent faces and busy hands were to be seen
wherever one looked; and in one's ears was the ceaseless clink of
hammers, the buzz of trade and the contented hum of drums and fly-wheels.

The armorial crest of my own State consisted of two dissolute bears
holding up the head of a dead and gone cask between them and making the
pertinent remark, "UNITED, WE STAND--(hic!)--DIVIDED, WE FALL."  It was
always too figurative for the author of this book.  But the Mormon crest
was easy.  And it was simple, unostentatious, and fitted like a glove.
It was a representation of a GOLDEN BEEHIVE, with the bees all at work!

The city lies in the edge of a level plain as broad as the State of
Connecticut, and crouches close down to the ground under a curving wall
of mighty mountains whose heads are hidden in the clouds, and whose
shoulders bear relics of the snows of winter all the summer long.

Seen from one of these dizzy heights, twelve or fifteen miles off, Great
Salt Lake City is toned down and diminished till it is suggestive of a
child's toy-village reposing under the majestic protection of the Chinese
wall.

On some of those mountains, to the southwest, it had been raining every
day for two weeks, but not a drop had fallen in the city.  And on hot
days in late spring and early autumn the citizens could quit fanning and
growling and go out and cool off by looking at the luxury of a glorious
snow-storm going on in the mountains.  They could enjoy it at a distance,
at those seasons, every day, though no snow would fall in their streets,
or anywhere near them.

Salt Lake City was healthy--an extremely healthy city.

They declared there was only one physician in the place and he was
arrested every week regularly and held to answer under the vagrant act
for having "no visible means of support."  They always give you a good
substantial article of truth in Salt Lake, and good measure and good
weight, too. [Very often, if you wished to weigh one of their airiest
little commonplace statements you would want the hay scales.]

We desired to visit the famous inland sea, the American "Dead Sea," the
great Salt Lake--seventeen miles, horseback, from the city--for we had
dreamed about it, and thought about it, and talked about it, and yearned
to see it, all the first part of our trip; but now when it was only arm's
length away it had suddenly lost nearly every bit of its interest.  And
so we put it off, in a sort of general way, till next day--and that was
the last we ever thought of it.  We dined with some hospitable Gentiles;
and visited the foundation of the prodigious temple; and talked long with
that shrewd Connecticut Yankee, Heber C. Kimball (since deceased), a
saint of high degree and a mighty man of commerce.

We saw the "Tithing-House," and the "Lion House," and I do not know or
remember how many more church and government buildings of various kinds
and curious names.  We flitted hither and thither and enjoyed every hour,
and picked up a great deal of useful information and entertaining
nonsense, and went to bed at night satisfied.

The second day, we made the acquaintance of Mr. Street (since deceased)
and put on white shirts and went and paid a state visit to the king.
He seemed a quiet, kindly, easy-mannered, dignified, self-possessed old
gentleman of fifty-five or sixty, and had a gentle craft in his eye that
probably belonged there.  He was very simply dressed and was just taking
off a straw hat as we entered.  He talked about Utah, and the Indians,
and Nevada, and general American matters and questions, with our
secretary and certain government officials who came with us.  But he
never paid any attention to me, notwithstanding I made several attempts
to "draw him out" on federal politics and his high handed attitude toward
Congress.  I thought some of the things I said were rather fine.  But he
merely looked around at me, at distant intervals, something as I have
seen a benignant old cat look around to see which kitten was meddling
with her tail.

By and by I subsided into an indignant silence, and so sat until the end,
hot and flushed, and execrating him in my heart for an ignorant savage.
But he was calm.  His conversation with those gentlemen flowed on as
sweetly and peacefully and musically as any summer brook.  When the
audience was ended and we were retiring from the presence, he put his
hand on my head, beamed down on me in an admiring way and said to my
brother:

"Ah--your child, I presume?  Boy, or girl?"




CHAPTER XIV.

Mr. Street was very busy with his telegraphic matters--and considering
that he had eight or nine hundred miles of rugged, snowy, uninhabited
mountains, and waterless, treeless, melancholy deserts to traverse with
his wire, it was natural and needful that he should be as busy as
possible.  He could not go comfortably along and cut his poles by the
road-side, either, but they had to be hauled by ox teams across those
exhausting deserts--and it was two days' journey from water to water, in
one or two of them.  Mr. Street's contract was a vast work, every way one
looked at it; and yet to comprehend what the vague words "eight hundred
miles of rugged mountains and dismal deserts" mean, one must go over the
ground in person--pen and ink descriptions cannot convey the dreary
reality to the reader.  And after all, Mr. S.'s mightiest difficulty
turned out to be one which he had never taken into the account at all.
Unto Mormons he had sub-let the hardest and heaviest half of his great
undertaking, and all of a sudden they concluded that they were going to
make little or nothing, and so they tranquilly threw their poles
overboard in mountain or desert, just as it happened when they took the
notion, and drove home and went about their customary business!  They
were under written contract to Mr. Street, but they did not care anything
for that.  They said they would "admire" to see a "Gentile" force a
Mormon to fulfil a losing contract in Utah!  And they made themselves
very merry over the matter.  Street said--for it was he that told us
these things:

"I was in dismay.  I was under heavy bonds to complete my contract in a
given time, and this disaster looked very much like ruin.  It was an
astounding thing; it was such a wholly unlooked-for difficulty, that I
was entirely nonplussed.  I am a business man--have always been a
business man--do not know anything but business--and so you can imagine
how like being struck by lightning it was to find myself in a country
where written contracts were worthless!--that main security, that
sheet-anchor, that absolute necessity, of business.  My confidence left
me. There was no use in making new contracts--that was plain.  I talked
with first one prominent citizen and then another.  They all sympathized
with me, first rate, but they did not know how to help me.  But at last a
Gentile said, 'Go to Brigham Young!--these small fry cannot do you any
good.'  I did not think much of the idea, for if the law could not help
me, what could an individual do who had not even anything to do with
either making the laws or executing them?  He might be a very good
patriarch of a church and preacher in its tabernacle, but something
sterner than religion and moral suasion was needed to handle a hundred
refractory, half-civilized sub-contractors.  But what was a man to do? I
thought if Mr. Young could not do anything else, he might probably be
able to give me some advice and a valuable hint or two, and so I went
straight to him and laid the whole case before him.  He said very little,
but he showed strong interest all the way through.  He examined all the
papers in detail, and whenever there seemed anything like a hitch, either
in the papers or my statement, he would go back and take up the thread
and follow it patiently out to an intelligent and satisfactory result.
Then he made a list of the contractors' names.  Finally he said:

"'Mr. Street, this is all perfectly plain.  These contracts are strictly
and legally drawn, and are duly signed and certified.  These men
manifestly entered into them with their eyes open.  I see no fault or
flaw anywhere.'

"Then Mr. Young turned to a man waiting at the other end of the room and
said: 'Take this list of names to So-and-so, and tell him to have these
men here at such-and-such an hour.'

"They were there, to the minute.  So was I.  Mr. Young asked them a
number of questions, and their answers made my statement good.  Then he
said to them:

"'You signed these contracts and assumed these obligations of your own
free will and accord?'

"'Yes.'

"'Then carry them out to the letter, if it makes paupers of you!  Go!'

"And they did go, too!  They are strung across the deserts now, working
like bees.  And I never hear a word out of them.

"There is a batch of governors, and judges, and other officials here,
shipped from Washington, and they maintain the semblance of a republican
form of government--but the petrified truth is that Utah is an absolute
monarchy and Brigham Young is king!"

Mr. Street was a fine man, and I believe his story.  I knew him well
during several years afterward in San Francisco.

Our stay in Salt Lake City amounted to only two days, and therefore we
had no time to make the customary inquisition into the workings of
polygamy and get up the usual statistics and deductions preparatory to
calling the attention of the nation at large once more to the matter.

I had the will to do it.  With the gushing self-sufficiency of youth I
was feverish to plunge in headlong and achieve a great reform here--until
I saw the Mormon women.  Then I was touched.  My heart was wiser than my
head.  It warmed toward these poor, ungainly and pathetically "homely"
creatures, and as I turned to hide the generous moisture in my eyes, I
said, "No--the man that marries one of them has done an act of Christian
charity which entitles him to the kindly applause of mankind, not their
harsh censure--and the man that marries sixty of them has done a deed of
open-handed generosity so sublime that the nations should stand uncovered
in his presence and worship in silence."

      [For a brief sketch of Mormon history, and the noted Mountain Meadow
      massacre, see Appendices A and B. ]




CHAPTER XV.

It is a luscious country for thrilling evening stories about
assassinations of intractable Gentiles.  I cannot easily conceive of
anything more cosy than the night in Salt Lake which we spent in a
Gentile den, smoking pipes and listening to tales of how Burton galloped
in among the pleading and defenceless "Morisites" and shot them down, men
and women, like so many dogs.  And how Bill Hickman, a Destroying Angel,
shot Drown and Arnold dead for bringing suit against him for a debt.
And how Porter Rockwell did this and that dreadful thing.  And how
heedless people often come to Utah and make remarks about Brigham, or
polygamy, or some other sacred matter, and the very next morning at
daylight such parties are sure to be found lying up some back alley,
contentedly waiting for the hearse.

And the next most interesting thing is to sit and listen to these
Gentiles talk about polygamy; and how some portly old frog of an elder,
or a bishop, marries a girl--likes her, marries her sister--likes her,
marries another sister--likes her, takes another--likes her, marries her
mother--likes her, marries her father, grandfather, great grandfather,
and then comes back hungry and asks for more.  And how the pert young
thing of eleven will chance to be the favorite wife and her own venerable
grandmother have to rank away down toward D 4 in their mutual husband's
esteem, and have to sleep in the kitchen, as like as not.  And how this
dreadful sort of thing, this hiving together in one foul nest of mother
and daughters, and the making a young daughter superior to her own mother
in rank and authority, are things which Mormon women submit to because
their religion teaches them that the more wives a man has on earth, and
the more children he rears, the higher the place they will all have in
the world to come--and the warmer, maybe, though they do not seem to say
anything about that.

According to these Gentile friends of ours, Brigham Young's harem
contains twenty or thirty wives.  They said that some of them had grown
old and gone out of active service, but were comfortably housed and cared
for in the henery--or the Lion House, as it is strangely named.  Along
with each wife were her children--fifty altogether.  The house was
perfectly quiet and orderly, when the children were still.  They all took
their meals in one room, and a happy and home-like sight it was
pronounced to be.  None of our party got an opportunity to take dinner
with Mr. Young, but a Gentile by the name of Johnson professed to have
enjoyed a sociable breakfast in the Lion House.  He gave a preposterous
account of the "calling of the roll," and other preliminaries, and the
carnage that ensued when the buckwheat cakes came in.  But he embellished
rather too much.  He said that Mr. Young told him several smart sayings
of certain of his "two-year-olds," observing with some pride that for
many years he had been the heaviest contributor in that line to one of
the Eastern magazines; and then he wanted to show Mr. Johnson one of the
pets that had said the last good thing, but he could not find the child.

He searched the faces of the children in detail, but could not decide
which one it was.  Finally he gave it up with a sigh and said:

"I thought I would know the little cub again but I don't."  Mr. Johnson
said further, that Mr. Young observed that life was a sad, sad thing
--"because the joy of every new marriage a man contracted was so apt to be
blighted by the inopportune funeral of a less recent bride."  And Mr.
Johnson said that while he and Mr. Young were pleasantly conversing in
private, one of the Mrs. Youngs came in and demanded a breast-pin,
remarking that she had found out that he had been giving a breast-pin to
No. 6, and she, for one, did not propose to let this partiality go on
without making a satisfactory amount of trouble about it.  Mr. Young
reminded her that there was a stranger present.  Mrs. Young said that if
the state of things inside the house was not agreeable to the stranger,
he could find room outside.  Mr. Young promised the breast-pin, and she
went away.  But in a minute or two another Mrs. Young came in and
demanded a breast-pin.  Mr. Young began a remonstrance, but Mrs. Young
cut him short.  She said No. 6 had got one, and No. 11 was promised one,
and it was "no use for him to try to impose on her--she hoped she knew
her rights."  He gave his promise, and she went.  And presently three
Mrs. Youngs entered in a body and opened on their husband a tempest of
tears, abuse, and entreaty.  They had heard all about No. 6, No. 11, and
No. 14.  Three more breast-pins were promised.  They were hardly gone
when nine more Mrs. Youngs filed into the presence, and a new tempest
burst forth and raged round about the prophet and his guest.  Nine
breast-pins were promised, and the weird sisters filed out again.  And in
came eleven more, weeping and wailing and gnashing their teeth.  Eleven
promised breast-pins purchased peace once more.

"That is a specimen," said Mr. Young.  "You see how it is.  You see what
a life I lead.  A man can't be wise all the time.  In a heedless moment I
gave my darling No. 6--excuse my calling her thus, as her other name has
escaped me for the moment--a breast-pin.  It was only worth twenty-five
dollars--that is, apparently that was its whole cost--but its ultimate
cost was inevitably bound to be a good deal more.  You yourself have seen
it climb up to six hundred and fifty dollars--and alas, even that is not
the end!  For I have wives all over this Territory of Utah.  I have
dozens of wives whose numbers, even, I do not know without looking in the
family Bible.  They are scattered far and wide among the mountains and
valleys of my realm.  And mark you, every solitary one of them will hear
of this wretched breast pin, and every last one of them will have one or
die.  No. 6's breast pin will cost me twenty-five hundred dollars before
I see the end of it.  And these creatures will compare these pins
together, and if one is a shade finer than the rest, they will all be
thrown on my hands, and I will have to order a new lot to keep peace in
the family.  Sir, you probably did not know it, but all the time you were
present with my children your every movement was watched by vigilant
servitors of mine.  If you had offered to give a child a dime, or a stick
of candy, or any trifle of the kind, you would have been snatched out of
the house instantly, provided it could be done before your gift left your
hand.  Otherwise it would be absolutely necessary for you to make an
exactly similar gift to all my children--and knowing by experience the
importance of the thing, I would have stood by and seen to it myself that
you did it, and did it thoroughly.  Once a gentleman gave one of my
children a tin whistle--a veritable invention of Satan, sir, and one
which I have an unspeakable horror of, and so would you if you had eighty
or ninety children in your house.  But the deed was done--the man
escaped.  I knew what the result was going to be, and I thirsted for
vengeance.  I ordered out a flock of Destroying Angels, and they hunted
the man far into the fastnesses of the Nevada mountains.  But they never
caught him.  I am not cruel, sir--I am not vindictive except when sorely
outraged--but if I had caught him, sir, so help me Joseph Smith, I would
have locked him into the nursery till the brats whistled him to death.
By the slaughtered body of St. Parley Pratt (whom God assail!) there
was never anything on this earth like it!  I knew who gave the whistle to
the child, but I could, not make those jealous mothers believe me.  They
believed I did it, and the result was just what any man of reflection
could have foreseen: I had to order a hundred and ten whistles--I think
we had a hundred and ten children in the house then, but some of them are
off at college now--I had to order a hundred and ten of those shrieking
things, and I wish I may never speak another word if we didn't have to
talk on our fingers entirely, from that time forth until the children got
tired of the whistles.  And if ever another man gives a whistle to a
child of mine and I get my hands on him, I will hang him higher than
Haman!  That is the word with the bark on it!  Shade of Nephi!  You don't
know anything about married life.  I am rich, and everybody knows it.  I
am benevolent, and everybody takes advantage of it.  I have a strong
fatherly instinct and all the foundlings are foisted on me.

"Every time a woman wants to do well by her darling, she puzzles her brain
to cipher out some scheme for getting it into my hands.  Why, sir, a
woman came here once with a child of a curious lifeless sort of
complexion (and so had the woman), and swore that the child was mine and
she my wife--that I had married her at such-and-such a time in
such-and-such a place, but she had forgotten her number, and of course I
could not remember her name.  Well, sir, she called my attention to the
fact that the child looked like me, and really it did seem to resemble
me--a common thing in the Territory--and, to cut the story short, I put
it in my nursery, and she left.  And by the ghost of Orson Hyde, when
they came to wash the paint off that child it was an Injun!  Bless my
soul, you don't know anything about married life.  It is a perfect dog's
life, sir--a perfect dog's life.  You can't economize.  It isn't
possible.  I have tried keeping one set of bridal attire for all
occasions.  But it is of no use.  First you'll marry a combination of
calico and consumption that's as thin as a rail, and next you'll get a
creature that's nothing more than the dropsy in disguise, and then you've
got to eke out that bridal dress with an old balloon.  That is the way it
goes.  And think of the wash-bill--(excuse these tears)--nine hundred and
eighty-four pieces a week!  No, sir, there is no such a thing as economy
in a family like mine.  Why, just the one item of cradles--think of it!
And vermifuge! Soothing syrup!  Teething rings!  And 'papa's watches' for
the babies to play with!  And things to scratch the furniture with!  And
lucifer matches for them to eat, and pieces of glass to cut themselves
with! The item of glass alone would support your family, I venture to
say, sir. Let me scrimp and squeeze all I can, I still can't get ahead as
fast as I feel I ought to, with my opportunities.  Bless you, sir, at a
time when I had seventy-two wives in this house, I groaned under the
pressure of keeping thousands of dollars tied up in seventy-two bedsteads
when the money ought to have been out at interest; and I just sold out
the whole stock, sir, at a sacrifice, and built a bedstead seven feet
long and ninety-six feet wide.  But it was a failure, sir.  I could not
sleep. It appeared to me that the whole seventy-two women snored at once.
The roar was deafening.  And then the danger of it!  That was what I was
looking at.  They would all draw in their breath at once, and you could
actually see the walls of the house suck in--and then they would all
exhale their breath at once, and you could see the walls swell out, and
strain, and hear the rafters crack, and the shingles grind together. My
friend, take an old man's advice, and don't encumber yourself with a
large family--mind, I tell you, don't do it.  In a small family, and in a
small family only, you will find that comfort and that peace of mind
which are the best at last of the blessings this world is able to afford
us, and for the lack of which no accumulation of wealth, and no
acquisition of fame, power, and greatness can ever compensate us. Take my
word for it, ten or eleven wives is all you need--never go over it."

Some instinct or other made me set this Johnson down as being unreliable.
And yet he was a very entertaining person, and I doubt if some of the
information he gave us could have been acquired from any other source.
He was a pleasant contrast to those reticent Mormons.




CHAPTER XVI.

All men have heard of the Mormon Bible, but few except the "elect" have
seen it, or, at least, taken the trouble to read it.  I brought away a
copy from Salt Lake.  The book is a curiosity to me, it is such a
pretentious affair, and yet so "slow," so sleepy; such an insipid mess of
inspiration.  It is chloroform in print.  If Joseph Smith composed this
book, the act was a miracle--keeping awake while he did it was, at any
rate.  If he, according to tradition, merely translated it from certain
ancient and mysteriously-engraved plates of copper, which he declares he
found under a stone, in an out-of-the-way locality, the work of
translating was equally a miracle, for the same reason.

The book seems to be merely a prosy detail of imaginary history, with the
Old Testament for a model; followed by a tedious plagiarism of the New
Testament.  The author labored to give his words and phrases the quaint,
old-fashioned sound and structure of our King James's translation of the
Scriptures; and the result is a mongrel--half modern glibness, and half
ancient simplicity and gravity.  The latter is awkward and constrained;
the former natural, but grotesque by the contrast.  Whenever he found his
speech growing too modern--which was about every sentence or two--he
ladled in a few such Scriptural phrases as "exceeding sore," "and it came
to pass," etc., and made things satisfactory again.  "And it came to
pass" was his pet.  If he had left that out, his Bible would have been
only a pamphlet.

The title-page reads as follows:

      THE BOOK OF MORMON: AN ACCOUNT WRITTEN BY THE HAND OF MORMON, UPON
      PLATES TAKEN FROM THE PLATES OF NEPHI.

      Wherefore it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi,
      and also of the Lamanites; written to the Lamanites, who are a
      remnant of the House of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile; written
      by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of
      revelation.  Written and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that
      they might not be destroyed; to come forth by the gift and power of
      God unto the interpretation thereof; sealed by the hand of Moroni,
      and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by the way of
      Gentile; the interpretation thereof by the gift of God.  An
      abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also; which is a record of
      the people of Jared; who were scattered at the time the Lord
      confounded the language of the people when they were building a
      tower to get to Heaven.

"Hid up" is good.  And so is "wherefore"--though why "wherefore"?  Any
other word would have answered as well--though--in truth it would not
have sounded so Scriptural.

Next comes:

      THE TESTIMONY OF THREE WITNESSES.
      Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people unto
      whom this work shall come, that we, through the grace of God the
      Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which
      contain this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi, and
      also of the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of the people of
      Jared, who came from the tower of which hath been spoken; and we
      also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of
      God, for His voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a
      surety that the work is true.  And we also testify that we have seen
      the engravings which are upon the plates; and they have been shown
      unto us by the power of God, and not of man.  And we declare with
      words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and
      he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the
      plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the
      grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld
      and bear record that these things are true; and it is marvellous in
      our eyes; nevertheless the voice of the Lord commanded us that we
      should bear record of it; wherefore, to be obedient unto the
      commandments of God, we bear testimony of these things.  And we know
      that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall rid our garments of the
      blood of all men, and be found spotless before the judgment-seat of
      Christ, and shall dwell with Him eternally in the heavens.  And the
      honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which
      is one God.  Amen.

                          MARTIN HARRIS.

Some people have to have a world of evidence before they can come
anywhere in the neighborhood of believing anything; but for me, when a
man tells me that he has "seen the engravings which are upon the plates,"
and not only that, but an angel was there at the time, and saw him see
them, and probably took his receipt for it, I am very far on the road to
conviction, no matter whether I ever heard of that man before or not, and
even if I do not know the name of the angel, or his nationality either.

Next is this:

      AND ALSO THE TESTIMONY OF EIGHT WITNESSES.
      Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people unto
      whom this work shall come, that Joseph Smith, Jr., the translator of
      this work, has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken,
      which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the
      said Smith has translated, we did handle with our hands; and we also
      saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of
      ancient work, and of curious workmanship.  And this we bear record
      with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shown unto us, for
      we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith
      has got the plates of which we have spoken.  And we give our names
      unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen;
      and we lie not, God bearing witness of it.
                          CHRISTIAN WHITMER,
                          JACOB WHITMER,
                          PETER WHITMER, JR.,
                          JOHN WHITMER,
                          HIRAM PAGE,
                          JOSEPH SMITH, SR.,
                          HYRUM SMITH,
                          SAMUEL H.  SMITH.

And when I am far on the road to conviction, and eight men, be they
grammatical or otherwise, come forward and tell me that they have seen
the plates too; and not only seen those plates but "hefted" them, I am
convinced.  I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire
Whitmer family had testified.

The Mormon Bible consists of fifteen "books"--being the books of Jacob,
Enos, Jarom, Omni, Mosiah, Zeniff, Alma, Helaman, Ether, Moroni, two
"books" of Mormon, and three of Nephi.

In the first book of Nephi is a plagiarism of the Old Testament, which
gives an account of the exodus from Jerusalem of the "children of Lehi";
and it goes on to tell of their wanderings in the wilderness, during
eight years, and their supernatural protection by one of their number, a
party by the name of Nephi.  They finally reached the land of
"Bountiful," and camped by the sea.  After they had remained there "for
the space of many days"--which is more Scriptural than definite--Nephi
was commanded from on high to build a ship wherein to "carry the people
across the waters."  He travestied Noah's ark--but he obeyed orders in
the matter of the plan.  He finished the ship in a single day, while his
brethren stood by and made fun of it--and of him, too--"saying, our
brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship."  They did
not wait for the timbers to dry, but the whole tribe or nation sailed the
next day.  Then a bit of genuine nature cropped out, and is revealed by
outspoken Nephi with Scriptural frankness--they all got on a spree!
They, "and also their wives, began to make themselves merry, insomuch
that they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much rudeness;
yea, they were lifted up unto exceeding rudeness."

Nephi tried to stop these scandalous proceedings; but they tied him neck
and heels, and went on with their lark.  But observe how Nephi the
prophet circumvented them by the aid of the invisible powers:

      And it came to pass that after they had bound me, insomuch that I
      could not move, the compass, which had been prepared of the Lord,
      did cease to work; wherefore, they knew not whither they should
      steer the ship, insomuch that there arose a great storm, yea, a
      great and terrible tempest, and we were driven back upon the waters
      for the space of three days; and they began to be frightened
      exceedingly, lest they should be drowned in the sea; nevertheless
      they did not loose me.  And on the fourth day, which we had been
      driven back, the tempest began to be exceeding sore.  And it came to
      pass that we were about to be swallowed up in the depths of the sea.

Then they untied him.

      And it came to pass after they had loosed me, behold, I took the
      compass, and it did work whither I desired it.  And it came to pass
      that I prayed unto the Lord; and after I had prayed, the winds did
      cease, and the storm did cease, and there was a great calm.

Equipped with their compass, these ancients appear to have had the
advantage of Noah.

Their voyage was toward a "promised land"--the only name they give it.
They reached it in safety.

Polygamy is a recent feature in the Mormon religion, and was added by
Brigham Young after Joseph Smith's death.  Before that, it was regarded
as an "abomination."  This verse from the Mormon Bible occurs in Chapter
II. of the book of Jacob:

      For behold, thus saith the Lord, this people begin to wax in
      iniquity; they understand not the Scriptures; for they seek to
      excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things
      which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.  Behold,
      David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing
      was abominable before me, saith the Lord; wherefore, thus saith the
      Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by
      the power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous
      branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.  Wherefore, I the Lord
      God, will no suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old.

However, the project failed--or at least the modern Mormon end of it--for
Brigham "suffers" it.  This verse is from the same chapter:

      Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate, because of their
      filthiness and the cursings which hath come upon their skins, are
      more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment
      of the Lord, which was given unto our fathers, that they should
      have, save it were one wife; and concubines they should have none.

The following verse (from Chapter IX. of the Book of Nephi) appears to
contain information not familiar to everybody:

      And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ascended into heaven,
      the multitude did disperse, and every man did take his wife and his
      children, and did return to his own home.

      And it came to pass that on the morrow, when the multitude was
      gathered together, behold, Nephi and his brother whom he had raised
      from the dead, whose name was Timothy, and also his son, whose name
      was Jonas, and also Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his brother, and Kumen,
      and Kumenenhi, and Jeremiah, and Shemnon, and Jonas, and Zedekiah,
      and Isaiah; now these were the names of the disciples whom Jesus had
      chosen.

In order that the reader may observe how much more grandeur and
picturesqueness (as seen by these Mormon twelve) accompanied on of the
tenderest episodes in the life of our Saviour than other eyes seem to
have been aware of, I quote the following from the same "book"--Nephi:

      And it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise.
      And they arose from the earth, and He said unto them, Blessed are ye
      because of your faith.  And now behold, My joy is full.  And when He
      had said these words, He wept, and the multitude bear record of it,
      and He took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and
      prayed unto the Father for them.  And when He had done this He wept
      again, and He spake unto the multitude, and saith unto them, Behold
      your little ones.  And as they looked to behold, they cast their
      eyes toward heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw
      angels descending out of heaven as it were, in the midst of fire;
      and they came down and encircled those little ones about, and they
      were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto
      them, and the multitude did see and hear and bear record; and they
      know that their record is true, for they all of them did see and
      hear, every man for himself; and they were in number about two
      thousand and five hundred souls; and they did consist of men, women,
      and children.

And what else would they be likely to consist of?

The Book of Ether is an incomprehensible medley of if "history," much of
it relating to battles and sieges among peoples whom the reader has
possibly never heard of; and who inhabited a country which is not set
down in the geography.  These was a King with the remarkable name of
Coriantumr,^^ and he warred with Shared, and Lib, and Shiz, and others,
in the "plains of Heshlon"; and the "valley of Gilgal"; and the
"wilderness of Akish"; and the "land of Moran"; and the "plains of
Agosh"; and "Ogath," and "Ramah," and the "land of Corihor," and the
"hill Comnor," by "the waters of Ripliancum," etc., etc., etc.  "And it
came to pass," after a deal of fighting, that Coriantumr, upon making
calculation of his losses, found that "there had been slain two millions
of mighty men, and also their wives and their children"--say 5,000,000 or
6,000,000 in all--"and he began to sorrow in his heart."  Unquestionably
it was time.  So he wrote to Shiz, asking a cessation of hostilities, and
offering to give up his kingdom to save his people.  Shiz declined,
except upon condition that Coriantumr would come and let him cut his head
off first--a thing which Coriantumr would not do.  Then there was more
fighting for a season; then four years were devoted to gathering the
forces for a final struggle--after which ensued a battle, which, I take
it, is the most remarkable set forth in history,--except, perhaps, that
of the Kilkenny cats, which it resembles in some respects.  This is the
account of the gathering and the battle:

      7.  And it came to pass that they did gather together all the
      people, upon all the face of the land, who had not been slain, save
      it was Ether.  And it came to pass that Ether did behold all the
      doings of the people; and he beheld that the people who were for
      Coriantumr, were gathered together to the army of Coriantumr; and
      the people who were for Shiz, were gathered together to the army of
      Shiz; wherefore they were for the space of four years gathering
      together the people, that they might get all who were upon the face
      of the land, and that they might receive all the strength which it
      was possible that they could receive.  And it came to pass that when
      they were all gathered together, every one to the army which he
      would, with their wives and their children; both men, women, and
      children being armed with weapons of war, having shields, and
      breast-plates, and head-plates, and being clothed after the manner
      of war, they did march forth one against another, to battle; and
      they fought all that day, and conquered not.  And it came to pass
      that when it was night they were weary, and retired to their camps;
      and after they had retired to their camps, they took up a howling
      and a lamentation for the loss of the slain of their people; and so
      great were their cries, their howlings and lamentations, that it did
      rend the air exceedingly.  And it came to pass that on the morrow
      they did go again to battle, and great and terrible was that day;
      nevertheless they conquered not, and when the night came again, they
      did rend the air with their cries, and their howlings, and their
      mournings, for the loss of the slain of their people.

      8.  And it came to pass that Coriantumr wrote again an epistle unto
      Shiz, desiring that he would not come again to battle, but that he
      would take the kingdom, and spare the lives of the people.  But
      behold, the Spirit of the Lord had ceased striving with them, and
      Satan had full power over the hearts of the people, for they were
      given up unto the hardness of their hearts, and the blindness of
      their minds that they might be destroyed; wherefore they went again
      to battle.  And it came to pass that they fought all that day, and
      when the night came they slept upon their swords; and on the morrow
      they fought even until the night came; and when the night came they
      were drunken with anger, even as a man who is drunken with wine; and
      they slept again upon their swords; and on the morrow they fought
      again; and when the night came they had all fallen by the sword save
      it were fifty and two of the people of Coriantumr, and sixty and
      nine of the people of Shiz.  And it came to pass that they slept
      upon their swords that night, and on the morrow they fought again,
      and they contended in their mights with their swords, and with their
      shields, all that day; and when the night came there were thirty and
      two of the people of Shiz, and twenty and seven of the people of
      Coriantumr.

      9.  And it came to pass that they ate and slept, and prepared for
      death on the morrow.  And they were large and mighty men, as to the
      strength of men.  And it came to pass that they fought for the space
      of three hours, and they fainted with the loss of blood.  And it
      came to pass that when the men of Coriantumr had received sufficient
      strength, that they could walk, they were about to flee for their
      lives, but behold, Shiz arose, and also his men, and he swore in his
      wrath that he would slay Coriantumr, or he would perish by the
      sword: wherefore he did pursue them, and on the morrow he did
      overtake them; and they fought again with the sword.  And it came to
      pass that when they had all fallen by the sword, save it were
      Coriantumr and Shiz, behold Shiz had fainted with loss of blood.
      And it came to pass that when Coriantumr had leaned upon his sword,
      that he rested a little, he smote off the head of Shiz.  And it came
      to pass that after he had smote off the head of Shiz, that Shiz
      raised upon his hands and fell; and after that he had struggled for
      breath, he died.  And it came to pass that Coriantumr fell to the
      earth, and became as if he had no life.  And the Lord spake unto
      Ether, and said unto him, go forth.  And he went forth, and beheld
      that the words of the Lord had all been fulfilled; and he finished
      his record; and the hundredth part I have not written.

It seems a pity he did not finish, for after all his dreary former
chapters of commonplace, he stopped just as he was in danger of becoming
interesting.

The Mormon Bible is rather stupid and tiresome to read, but there is
nothing vicious in its teachings.  Its code of morals is unobjectionable
--it is "smouched" [Milton] from the New Testament and no credit given.




CHAPTER XVII.

At the end of our two days' sojourn, we left Great Salt Lake City hearty
and well fed and happy--physically superb but not so very much wiser, as
regards the "Mormon question," than we were when we arrived, perhaps.
We had a deal more "information" than we had before, of course, but we
did not know what portion of it was reliable and what was not--for it all
came from acquaintances of a day--strangers, strictly speaking.  We were
told, for instance, that the dreadful "Mountain Meadows Massacre" was the
work of the Indians entirely, and that the Gentiles had meanly tried to
fasten it upon the Mormons; we were told, likewise, that the Indians were
to blame, partly, and partly the Mormons; and we were told, likewise, and
just as positively, that the Mormons were almost if not wholly and
completely responsible for that most treacherous and pitiless butchery.
We got the story in all these different shapes, but it was not till
several years afterward that Mrs. Waite's book, "The Mormon Prophet,"
came out with Judge Cradlebaugh's trial of the accused parties in it and
revealed the truth that the latter version was the correct one and that
the Mormons were the assassins.  All our "information" had three sides to
it, and so I gave up the idea that I could settle the "Mormon question"
in two days.  Still I have seen newspaper correspondents do it in one.

I left Great Salt Lake a good deal confused as to what state of things
existed there--and sometimes even questioning in my own mind whether a
state of things existed there at all or not.  But presently I remembered
with a lightening sense of relief that we had learned two or three
trivial things there which we could be certain of; and so the two days
were not wholly lost.  For instance, we had learned that we were at last
in a pioneer land, in absolute and tangible reality.

The high prices charged for trifles were eloquent of high freights and
bewildering distances of freightage.  In the east, in those days, the
smallest moneyed denomination was a penny and it represented the smallest
purchasable quantity of any commodity.  West of Cincinnati the smallest
coin in use was the silver five-cent piece and no smaller quantity of an
article could be bought than "five cents' worth."  In Overland City the
lowest coin appeared to be the ten-cent piece; but in Salt Lake there did
not seem to be any money in circulation smaller than a quarter, or any
smaller quantity purchasable of any commodity than twenty-five cents'
worth.  We had always been used to half dimes and "five cents' worth" as
the minimum of financial negotiations; but in Salt Lake if one wanted a
cigar, it was a quarter; if he wanted a chalk pipe, it was a quarter; if
he wanted a peach, or a candle, or a newspaper, or a shave, or a little
Gentile whiskey to rub on his corns to arrest indigestion and keep him
from having the toothache, twenty-five cents was the price, every time.
When we looked at the shot-bag of silver, now and then, we seemed to be
wasting our substance in riotous living, but if we referred to the
expense account we could see that we had not been doing anything of the
kind.

But people easily get reconciled to big money and big prices, and fond
and vain of both--it is a descent to little coins and cheap prices that
is hardest to bear and slowest to take hold upon one's toleration.  After
a month's acquaintance with the twenty-five cent minimum, the average
human being is ready to blush every time he thinks of his despicable
five-cent days.  How sunburnt with blushes I used to get in gaudy Nevada,
every time I thought of my first financial experience in Salt Lake.
It was on this wise (which is a favorite expression of great authors, and
a very neat one, too, but I never hear anybody say on this wise when they
are talking).  A young half-breed with a complexion like a yellow-jacket
asked me if I would have my boots blacked.  It was at the Salt Lake House
the morning after we arrived.  I said yes, and he blacked them.  Then I
handed him a silver five-cent piece, with the benevolent air of a person
who is conferring wealth and blessedness upon poverty and suffering.  The
yellow-jacket took it with what I judged to be suppressed emotion, and
laid it reverently down in the middle of his broad hand.  Then he began
to contemplate it, much as a philosopher contemplates a gnat's ear in the
ample field of his microscope.  Several mountaineers, teamsters,
stage-drivers, etc., drew near and dropped into the tableau and fell to
surveying the money with that attractive indifference to formality which
is noticeable in the hardy pioneer.  Presently the yellow-jacket handed
the half dime back to me and told me I ought to keep my money in my
pocket-book instead of in my soul, and then I wouldn't get it cramped and
shriveled up so!

What a roar of vulgar laughter there was!  I destroyed the mongrel
reptile on the spot, but I smiled and smiled all the time I was detaching
his scalp, for the remark he made was good for an "Injun."

Yes, we had learned in Salt Lake to be charged great prices without
letting the inward shudder appear on the surface--for even already we had
overheard and noted the tenor of conversations among drivers, conductors,
and hostlers, and finally among citizens of Salt Lake, until we were well
aware that these superior beings despised "emigrants."  We permitted no
tell-tale shudders and winces in our countenances, for we wanted to seem
pioneers, or Mormons, half-breeds, teamsters, stage-drivers, Mountain
Meadow assassins--anything in the world that the plains and Utah
respected and admired--but we were wretchedly ashamed of being
"emigrants," and sorry enough that we had white shirts and could not
swear in the presence of ladies without looking the other way.

And many a time in Nevada, afterwards, we had occasion to remember with
humiliation that we were "emigrants," and consequently a low and inferior
sort of creatures.  Perhaps the reader has visited Utah, Nevada, or
California, even in these latter days, and while communing with himself
upon the sorrowful banishment of these countries from what he considers
"the world," has had his wings clipped by finding that he is the one to
be pitied, and that there are entire populations around him ready and
willing to do it for him--yea, who are complacently doing it for him
already, wherever he steps his foot.

Poor thing, they are making fun of his hat; and the cut of his New York
coat; and his conscientiousness about his grammar; and his feeble
profanity; and his consumingly ludicrous ignorance of ores, shafts,
tunnels, and other things which he never saw before, and never felt
enough interest in to read about.  And all the time that he is thinking
what a sad fate it is to be exiled to that far country, that lonely land,
the citizens around him are looking down on him with a blighting
compassion because he is an "emigrant" instead of that proudest and
blessedest creature that exists on all the earth, a "FORTY-NINER."

The accustomed coach life began again, now, and by midnight it almost
seemed as if we never had been out of our snuggery among the mail sacks
at all.  We had made one alteration, however.  We had provided enough
bread, boiled ham and hard boiled eggs to last double the six hundred
miles of staging we had still to do.

And it was comfort in those succeeding days to sit up and contemplate the
majestic panorama of mountains and valleys spread out below us and eat
ham and hard boiled eggs while our spiritual natures revelled alternately
in rainbows, thunderstorms, and peerless sunsets.  Nothing helps scenery
like ham and eggs.  Ham and eggs, and after these a pipe--an old, rank,
delicious pipe--ham and eggs and scenery, a "down grade," a flying coach,
a fragrant pipe and a contented heart--these make happiness.  It is what
all the ages have struggled for.




CHAPTER XVIII.

At eight in the morning we reached the remnant and ruin of what had been
the important military station of "Camp Floyd," some forty-five or fifty
miles from Salt Lake City.  At four P.M.  we had doubled our distance and
were ninety or a hundred miles from Salt Lake.  And now we entered upon
one of that species of deserts whose concentrated hideousness shames the
diffused and diluted horrors of Sahara--an "alkali" desert.  For
sixty-eight miles there was but one break in it.  I do not remember that
this was really a break; indeed it seems to me that it was nothing but a
watering depot in the midst of the stretch of sixty-eight miles.  If my
memory serves me, there was no well or spring at this place, but the
water was hauled there by mule and ox teams from the further side of the
desert.  There was a stage station there.  It was forty-five miles from
the beginning of the desert, and twenty-three from the end of it.

We plowed and dragged and groped along, the whole live-long night,
and at the end of this uncomfortable twelve hours we finished the
forty-five-mile part of the desert and got to the stage station where the
imported water was.  The sun was just rising.  It was easy enough to
cross a desert in the night while we were asleep; and it was pleasant to
reflect, in the morning, that we in actual person had encountered an
absolute desert and could always speak knowingly of deserts in presence
of the ignorant thenceforward.  And it was pleasant also to reflect that
this was not an obscure, back country desert, but a very celebrated one,
the metropolis itself, as you may say.  All this was very well and very
comfortable and satisfactory--but now we were to cross a desert in
daylight.  This was fine--novel--romantic--dramatically adventurous
--this, indeed, was worth living for, worth traveling for!  We would
write home all about it.

This enthusiasm, this stern thirst for adventure, wilted under the sultry
August sun and did not last above one hour.  One poor little hour--and
then we were ashamed that we had "gushed" so.  The poetry was all in the
anticipation--there is none in the reality.  Imagine a vast, waveless
ocean stricken dead and turned to ashes; imagine this solemn waste tufted
with ash-dusted sage-bushes; imagine the lifeless silence and solitude
that belong to such a place; imagine a coach, creeping like a bug through
the midst of this shoreless level, and sending up tumbled volumes of dust
as if it were a bug that went by steam; imagine this aching monotony of
toiling and plowing kept up hour after hour, and the shore still as far
away as ever, apparently; imagine team, driver, coach and passengers so
deeply coated with ashes that they are all one colorless color; imagine
ash-drifts roosting above moustaches and eyebrows like snow accumulations
on boughs and bushes.  This is the reality of it.

The sun beats down with dead, blistering, relentless malignity; the
perspiration is welling from every pore in man and beast, but scarcely a
sign of it finds its way to the surface--it is absorbed before it gets
there; there is not the faintest breath of air stirring; there is not a
merciful shred of cloud in all the brilliant firmament; there is not a
living creature visible in any direction whither one searches the blank
level that stretches its monotonous miles on every hand; there is not a
sound--not a sigh--not a whisper--not a buzz, or a whir of wings, or
distant pipe of bird--not even a sob from the lost souls that doubtless
people that dead air.  And so the occasional sneezing of the resting
mules, and the champing of the bits, grate harshly on the grim stillness,
not dissipating the spell but accenting it and making one feel more
lonesome and forsaken than before.

The mules, under violent swearing, coaxing and whip-cracking, would make
at stated intervals a "spurt," and drag the coach a hundred or may be two
hundred yards, stirring up a billowy cloud of dust that rolled back,
enveloping the vehicle to the wheel-tops or higher, and making it seem
afloat in a fog.  Then a rest followed, with the usual sneezing and
bit-champing.  Then another "spurt" of a hundred yards and another rest at
the end of it.  All day long we kept this up, without water for the mules
and without ever changing the team.  At least we kept it up ten hours,
which, I take it, is a day, and a pretty honest one, in an alkali desert.
It was from four in the morning till two in the afternoon.  And it was so
hot! and so close! and our water canteens went dry in the middle of the
day and we got so thirsty!  It was so stupid and tiresome and dull! and
the tedious hours did lag and drag and limp along with such a cruel
deliberation!  It was so trying to give one's watch a good long
undisturbed spell and then take it out and find that it had been fooling
away the time and not trying to get ahead any!  The alkali dust cut
through our lips, it persecuted our eyes, it ate through the delicate
membranes and made our noses bleed and kept them bleeding--and truly and
seriously the romance all faded far away and disappeared, and left the
desert trip nothing but a harsh reality--a thirsty, sweltering, longing,
hateful reality!

Two miles and a quarter an hour for ten hours--that was what we
accomplished.  It was hard to bring the comprehension away down to such a
snail-pace as that, when we had been used to making eight and ten miles
an hour.  When we reached the station on the farther verge of the desert,
we were glad, for the first time, that the dictionary was along, because
we never could have found language to tell how glad we were, in any sort
of dictionary but an unabridged one with pictures in it.  But there could
not have been found in a whole library of dictionaries language
sufficient to tell how tired those mules were after their twenty-three
mile pull.  To try to give the reader an idea of how thirsty they were,
would be to "gild refined gold or paint the lily."

Somehow, now that it is there, the quotation does not seem to fit--but no
matter, let it stay, anyhow.  I think it is a graceful and attractive
thing, and therefore have tried time and time again to work it in where
it would fit, but could not succeed.  These efforts have kept my mind
distracted and ill at ease, and made my narrative seem broken and
disjointed, in places.  Under these circumstances it seems to me best to
leave it in, as above, since this will afford at least a temporary
respite from the wear and tear of trying to "lead up" to this really apt
and beautiful quotation.




CHAPTER XIX.

On the morning of the sixteenth day out from St. Joseph we arrived at the
entrance of Rocky Canyon, two hundred and fifty miles from Salt Lake.
It was along in this wild country somewhere, and far from any habitation
of white men, except the stage stations, that we came across the
wretchedest type of mankind I have ever seen, up to this writing.  I
refer to the Goshoot Indians.  From what we could see and all we could
learn, they are very considerably inferior to even the despised Digger
Indians of California; inferior to all races of savages on our continent;
inferior to even the Terra del Fuegans; inferior to the Hottentots, and
actually inferior in some respects to the Kytches of Africa.  Indeed, I
have been obliged to look the bulky volumes of Wood's "Uncivilized Races
of Men" clear through in order to find a savage tribe degraded enough to
take rank with the Goshoots.  I find but one people fairly open to that
shameful verdict.  It is the Bosjesmans (Bushmen) of South Africa.  Such
of the Goshoots as we saw, along the road and hanging about the stations,
were small, lean, "scrawny" creatures; in complexion a dull black like
the ordinary American negro; their faces and hands bearing dirt which
they had been hoarding and accumulating for months, years, and even
generations, according to the age of the proprietor; a silent, sneaking,
treacherous looking race; taking note of everything, covertly, like all
the other "Noble Red Men" that we (do not) read about, and betraying no
sign in their countenances; indolent, everlastingly patient and tireless,
like all other Indians; prideless beggars--for if the beggar instinct
were left out of an Indian he would not "go," any more than a clock
without a pendulum; hungry, always hungry, and yet never refusing
anything that a hog would eat, though often eating what a hog would
decline; hunters, but having no higher ambition than to kill and eat
jack-ass rabbits,  crickets and grasshoppers, and embezzle carrion from
the buzzards and cayotes; savages who, when asked if they have the common
Indian belief in a Great Spirit show a something which almost amounts to
emotion, thinking whiskey is referred to; a thin, scattering race of
almost naked black children, these Goshoots are, who produce nothing at
all, and have no villages, and no gatherings together into strictly
defined tribal communities--a people whose only shelter is a rag cast on
a bush to keep off a portion of the snow, and yet who inhabit one of the
most rocky, wintry, repulsive wastes that our country or any other can
exhibit.

The Bushmen and our Goshoots are manifestly descended from the self-same
gorilla, or kangaroo, or Norway rat, which-ever animal--Adam the
Darwinians trace them to.

One would as soon expect the rabbits to fight as the Goshoots, and yet
they used to live off the offal and refuse of the stations a few months
and then come some dark night when no mischief was expected, and burn
down the buildings and kill the men from ambush as they rushed out.
And once, in the night, they attacked the stage-coach when a District
Judge, of Nevada Territory, was the only passenger, and with their first
volley of arrows (and a bullet or two) they riddled the stage curtains,
wounded a horse or two and mortally wounded the driver.  The latter was
full of pluck, and so was his passenger.  At the driver's call Judge Mott
swung himself out, clambered to the box and seized the reins of the team,
and away they plunged, through the racing mob of skeletons and under a
hurtling storm of missiles.  The stricken driver had sunk down on the
boot as soon as he was wounded, but had held on to the reins and said he
would manage to keep hold of them until relieved.

And after they were taken from his relaxing grasp, he lay with his head
between Judge Mott's feet, and tranquilly gave directions about the road;
he said he believed he could live till the miscreants were outrun and
left behind, and that if he managed that, the main difficulty would be at
an end, and then if the Judge drove so and so (giving directions about
bad places in the road, and general course) he would reach the next
station without trouble.  The Judge distanced the enemy and at last
rattled up to the station and knew that the night's perils were done; but
there was no comrade-in-arms for him to rejoice with, for the soldierly
driver was dead.

Let us forget that we have been saying harsh things about the Overland
drivers, now.  The disgust which the Goshoots gave me, a disciple of
Cooper and a worshipper of the Red Man--even of the scholarly savages in
the "Last of the Mohicans" who are fittingly associated with backwoodsmen
who divide each sentence into two equal parts: one part critically
grammatical, refined and choice of language, and the other part just such
an attempt to talk like a hunter or a mountaineer, as a Broadway clerk
might make after eating an edition of Emerson Bennett's works and
studying frontier life at the Bowery Theatre a couple of weeks--I say
that the nausea which the Goshoots gave me, an Indian worshipper, set me
to examining authorities, to see if perchance I had been over-estimating
the Red Man while viewing him through the mellow moonshine of romance.
The revelations that came were disenchanting.  It was curious to see how
quickly the paint and tinsel fell away from him and left him treacherous,
filthy and repulsive--and how quickly the evidences accumulated that
wherever one finds an Indian tribe he has only found Goshoots more or
less modified by circumstances and surroundings--but Goshoots, after all.
They deserve pity, poor creatures; and they can have mine--at this
distance.  Nearer by, they never get anybody's.

There is an impression abroad that the Baltimore and Washington Railroad
Company and many of its employees are Goshoots; but it is an error.
There is only a plausible resemblance, which, while it is apt enough to
mislead the ignorant, cannot deceive parties who have contemplated both
tribes.  But seriously, it was not only poor wit, but very wrong to start
the report referred to above; for however innocent the motive may have
been, the necessary effect was to injure the reputation of a class who
have a hard enough time of it in the pitiless deserts of the Rocky
Mountains, Heaven knows!  If we cannot find it in our hearts to give
those poor naked creatures our Christian sympathy and compassion, in
God's name let us at least not throw mud at them.




CHAPTER XX.

On the seventeenth day we passed the highest mountain peaks we had yet
seen, and although the day was very warm the night that followed upon its
heels was wintry cold and blankets were next to useless.

On the eighteenth day we encountered the eastward-bound
telegraph-constructors at Reese River station and sent a message to his
Excellency Gov. Nye at Carson City (distant one hundred and fifty-six
miles).

On the nineteenth day we crossed the Great American Desert--forty
memorable miles of bottomless sand, into which the coach wheels sunk from
six inches to a foot.  We worked our passage most of the way across.
That is to say, we got out and walked.  It was a dreary pull and a long
and thirsty one, for we had no water.  From one extremity of this desert
to the other, the road was white with the bones of oxen and horses.
It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that we could have walked the
forty miles and set our feet on a bone at every step!  The desert was one
prodigious graveyard.  And the log-chains, wagon tyres, and rotting
wrecks of vehicles were almost as thick as the bones.  I think we saw
log-chains enough rusting there in the desert, to reach across any State
in the Union.  Do not these relics suggest something of an idea of the
fearful suffering and privation the early emigrants to California
endured?

At the border of the Desert lies Carson Lake, or The "Sink" of the
Carson, a shallow, melancholy sheet of water some eighty or a hundred
miles in circumference.  Carson River empties into it and is lost--sinks
mysteriously into the earth and never appears in the light of the sun
again--for the lake has no outlet whatever.

There are several rivers in Nevada, and they all have this mysterious
fate.  They end in various lakes or "sinks," and that is the last of
them.  Carson Lake, Humboldt Lake, Walker Lake, Mono Lake, are all great
sheets of water without any visible outlet.  Water is always flowing into
them; none is ever seen to flow out of them, and yet they remain always
level full, neither receding nor overflowing.  What they do with their
surplus is only known to the Creator.

On the western verge of the Desert we halted a moment at Ragtown.  It
consisted of one log house and is not set down on the map.

This reminds me of a circumstance.  Just after we left Julesburg, on the
Platte, I was sitting with the driver, and he said:

"I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if you would like to
listen to it.  Horace Greeley went over this road once.  When he was
leaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an
engagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through
quick.  Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace.
The coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the
buttons all off of Horace's coat, and finally shot his head clean through
the roof of the stage, and then he yelled at Hank Monk and begged him to
go easier--said he warn't in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago.
But Hank Monk said, 'Keep your seat, Horace, and I'll get you there on
time'--and you bet you he did, too, what was left of him!"

A day or two after that we picked up a Denver man at the cross roads, and
he told us a good deal about the country and the Gregory Diggings.
He seemed a very entertaining person and a man well posted in the affairs
of Colorado.  By and by he remarked:

"I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if you would like to
listen to it.  Horace Greeley went over this road once.  When he was
leaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an
engagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through
quick.  Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace.  The
coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the
buttons all off of Horace's coat, and finally shot his head clean through
the roof of the stage, and then he yelled at Hank Monk and begged him to
go easier--said he warn't in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago.
But Hank Monk said, 'Keep your seat, Horace, and I'll get you there on
time!'--and you bet you he did, too, what was left of him!"

At Fort Bridger, some days after this, we took on board a cavalry
sergeant, a very proper and soldierly person indeed.  From no other man
during the whole journey, did we gather such a store of concise and
well-arranged military information.  It was surprising to find in the
desolate wilds of our country a man so thoroughly acquainted with
everything useful to know in his line of life, and yet of such inferior
rank and unpretentious bearing.  For as much as three hours we listened
to him with unabated interest.  Finally he got upon the subject of
trans-continental travel, and presently said:

"I can tell you a very laughable thing indeed, if you would like to
listen to it.  Horace Greeley went over this road once.  When he was
leaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an
engagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through
quick.  Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace.  The
coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the
buttons all off of Horace's coat, and finally shot his head clean through
the roof of the stage, and then he yelled at Hank Monk and begged him to
go easier--said he warn't in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago.
But Hank Monk said, 'Keep your seat, Horace, and I'll get you there on
time!'--and you bet you he did, too, what was left of him!"

When we were eight hours out from Salt Lake City a Mormon preacher got in
with us at a way station--a gentle, soft-spoken, kindly man, and one whom
any stranger would warm to at first sight.  I can never forget the pathos
that was in his voice as he told, in simple language, the story of his
people's wanderings and unpitied sufferings.  No pulpit eloquence was
ever so moving and so beautiful as this outcast's picture of the first
Mormon pilgrimage across the plains, struggling sorrowfully onward to the
land of its banishment and marking its desolate way with graves and
watering it with tears.  His words so wrought upon us that it was a
relief to us all when the conversation drifted into a more cheerful
channel and the natural features of the curious country we were in came
under treatment.  One matter after another was pleasantly discussed, and
at length the stranger said:

"I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if you would like to
listen to it.  Horace Greeley went over this road once.  When he was
leaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an
engagement to lecture in Placerville, and was very anxious to go through
quick.  Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace.  The
coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the
buttons all off of Horace's coat, and finally shot his head clean through
the roof of the stage, and then he yelled at Hank Monk and begged him to
go easier--said he warn't in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago.
But Hank Monk said, 'Keep your seat, Horace, and I'll get you there on
time!'--and you bet you bet you he did, too, what was left of him!"

Ten miles out of Ragtown we found a poor wanderer who had lain down to
die.  He had walked as long as he could, but his limbs had failed him at
last.  Hunger and fatigue had conquered him.  It would have been inhuman
to leave him there.  We paid his fare to Carson and lifted him into the
coach.  It was some little time before he showed any very decided signs
of life; but by dint of chafing him and pouring brandy between his lips
we finally brought him to a languid consciousness.  Then we fed him a
little, and by and by he seemed to comprehend the situation and a
grateful light softened his eye.  We made his mail-sack bed as
comfortable as possible, and constructed a pillow for him with our coats.
He seemed very thankful.  Then he looked up in our faces, and said in a
feeble voice that had a tremble of honest emotion in it:

"Gentlemen, I know not who you are, but you have saved my life; and
although I can never be able to repay you for it, I feel that I can at
least make one hour of your long journey lighter.  I take it you are
strangers to this great thorough fare, but I am entirely familiar with
it.  In this connection I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if
you would like to listen to it.  Horace Greeley----"

I said, impressively:

"Suffering stranger, proceed at your peril.  You see in me the melancholy
wreck of a once stalwart and magnificent manhood.  What has brought me to
this?  That thing which you are about to tell.  Gradually but surely,
that tiresome old anecdote has sapped my strength, undermined my
constitution, withered my life.  Pity my helplessness.  Spare me only
just this once, and tell me about young George Washington and his little
hatchet for a change."

We were saved.  But not so the invalid.  In trying to retain the anecdote
in his system he strained himself and died in our arms.

I am aware, now, that I ought not to have asked of the sturdiest citizen
of all that region, what I asked of that mere shadow of a man; for, after
seven years' residence on the Pacific coast, I know that no passenger or
driver on the Overland ever corked that anecdote in, when a stranger was
by, and survived.  Within a period of six years I crossed and recrossed
the Sierras between Nevada and California thirteen times by stage and
listened to that deathless incident four hundred and eighty-one or
eighty-two times.  I have the list somewhere.  Drivers always told it,
conductors told it, landlords told it, chance passengers told it, the
very Chinamen and vagrant Indians recounted it.  I have had the same
driver tell it to me two or three times in the same afternoon.  It has
come to me in all the multitude of tongues that Babel bequeathed to
earth, and flavored with whiskey, brandy, beer, cologne, sozodont,
tobacco, garlic, onions, grasshoppers--everything that has a fragrance to
it through all the long list of things that are gorged or guzzled by the
sons of men.  I never have smelt any anecdote as often as I have smelt
that one; never have smelt any anecdote that smelt so variegated as that
one.  And you never could learn to know it by its smell, because every
time you thought you had learned the smell of it, it would turn up with a
different smell.  Bayard Taylor has written about this hoary anecdote,
Richardson has published it; so have Jones, Smith, Johnson, Ross Browne,
and every other correspondence-inditing being that ever set his foot upon
the great overland road anywhere between Julesburg and San Francisco; and
I have heard that it is in the Talmud.  I have seen it in print in nine
different foreign languages; I have been told that it is employed in the
inquisition in Rome; and I now learn with regret that it is going to be
set to music.  I do not think that such things are right.

Stage-coaching on the Overland is no more, and stage drivers are a race
defunct.  I wonder if they bequeathed that bald-headed anecdote to their
successors, the railroad brakemen and conductors, and if these latter
still persecute the helpless passenger with it until he concludes, as did
many a tourist of other days, that the real grandeurs of the Pacific
coast are not Yo Semite and the Big Trees, but Hank Monk and his
adventure with Horace Greeley.  [And what makes that worn anecdote the
more aggravating, is, that the adventure it celebrates never occurred.
If it were a good anecdote, that seeming demerit would be its chiefest
virtue, for creative power belongs to greatness; but what ought to be
done to a man who would wantonly contrive so flat a one as this?  If I
were to suggest what ought to be done to him, I should be called
extravagant--but what does the sixteenth chapter of Daniel say?  Aha!]

KUOLONSINETTI


[Tämä kertomus puhuu siitä liikuttavasta kohtauksesta, josta
mainitaan Carlyles'n teoksessa "Letters and Speeches of Oliver
Cromwell." -- M.T.]


I.

Se tapahtui Oliver Cromwellin aikana. Eversti Mayfair oli nuorin
arvoisistaan upseereista tasavallan armeijassa, sillä hän oli
ainoastaan 30-vuotias. Mutta niin nuori kuin olikin, oli hän
vanha taisteluissa ahavoittunut ja tummentunut sotilas, sillä hän
oli alkanut sotilaselämänsä seitsemäntoista vuoden vanhana; oli
taistellut monissa tappeluissa ja niin askel askeleelta sotilaallisen
urhoollisuutensa vuoksi voittanut korkean virka-asemansa ja saanut
osakseen ihmisten arvonannon. Mutta nyt oli hän hyvin alakuloinen;
muuan varjo oli pimentänyt hänen valoisan uransa.

Oli talvi-ilta, ulkona myrskysi ja oli pimeä, sisällä vallitsi
alakuloinen äänettömyys, sillä eversti ja hänen nuori vaimonsa
olivat keskustelleet surustaan, lukeneet iltalukunsa ja rukoilleet
iltarukouksensa, eikä ollut enää mitään muuta tekemistä kuin istua
käsikkäin ja tuijottaa leimuavaan tuleen ja ajatella ja -- odottaa.
Heidän ei tarvitsisi odottaa kauan, sen he tiesivät, ja vaimoa
pöyristytti se ajatus.

Heillä oli pikku tyttö -- Abby, seitsenvuotias, heidän epäjumalansa.
Hän tulisi pian hakemaan hyväyö-suuteloaan, ja eversti sanoi:

-- Kuivaa kyyneleesi ja näyttäkäämme iloisilta hänen tähtensä. Meidän
täytyy silmänräpäykseksi unohtaa se mitä tulee tapahtumaan.

-- Kyllä, sen kyllä teen. Suljen kyyneleet sydämeeni, joka on
pakahtumaisillaan.

-- Ja meidän on alistuttava siihen kohtaloon, joka on osaksemme
tullut, ja kestettävä se kärsivällisesti, hyvin tietäen, että
mitä Hän tekee, sen tekee Hän oikeudenmukaisesti ja hyvässä
tarkoituksessa...

-- Ja me sanomme: tapahtukoon Sinun tahtosi. Niin, minä voin sen
sanoa koko ymmärrykselläni, koko sielullani -- toivon voivani sanoa
sen myöskin sydämelläni. Voi, jos sen voisin. Jos tämä armas käsi,
jota nyt puserran ja suutelen viimeistä kertaa...

-- Hiljaa, rakkaani! Hän tulee!

Yöpukuun puettu kiharainen pikku olento tuli ovesta ja juoksi isänsä
luo ja painautui hänen rintaansa vasten, ja isä suuteli häntä
tulisesti kerran, kaksi, kolme. -- Ei, isä, noin et saa suudella
minua; sinä satutat hiuksiani.

-- Voi, minä olen niin pahoillani, kovin pahoillani, annatko minulle
anteeksi rakkaani?

-- Kyllä, luonnollisesti, isä. Mutta _oletko_ pahoillasi? Etkö ole
olevinasi, vai oletko tosiaankin oikein kovin pahoillasi?

-- Kyllä, sen voit nähdä itsekin, Abby, -- ja hän peitti kasvonsa
käsillään ja oli nyyhkyttävinään. Lapsi sai ankarat omantunnon tuskat
huomatessaan, minkä surullisen tilan hän oli saanut aikaan, ja hän
alkoi itse itkeä ja puristella hänen käsiään ja puhella:

-- Isä, ole nyt kiltti ja älä itke; ei Abby sitä tarkottanut, Abby ei
enää milloinkaan tee niin. Kiltti pappa! -- Koettaessaan irroittaa
hänen sormiaan huomasi Abby isänsä silmät sormien takaa ja huudahti:

-- Ahaa, sinä ilkeä isä, sinähän et itkekään! Sinä vaan teeskentelet!
Nyt menee Abby äidin luo; sinä et tee oikein Abbya kohtaan.

Hän aikoi solua pois sylistä, mutta isänsä kiersi kätensä hänen
ympärilleen ja sanoi:

-- Ei, jää minun luokseni, rakkaani; isä oli ilkeä ja tunnustaa sen
ja on pahoillaan -- kas niin, anna hänen suudella pois kyyneleet --
ja hän pyytää Abbyltä anteeksi ja tekee kaiken, mitä Abby tahtoo
häntä rangaistuksekseen tekemään; nyt on kyyneleet suudeltu kuiviin
eikä kiharaakaan ole epäkunnossa -- ja mitä tahansa Abby vaan
käskeekin...

Niin solmittiin rauha, ja tuossa tuokiossa pääsi taas päivä näkyviin
ja säteili kirkkaana lapsen kasvoilla, ja Abby taputteli isänsä
poskia ja sanoi rangaistuksen:

-- Kertomus! Kertomus!

Hiljaa!

Vanhemmat pidättivät hengitystään ja kuuntelivat. Askeleita! Ne
kuuluivat epäselvästi tuulenhuminan seasta. Ne tulivat lähemmäs,
lähemmäs -- kuuluivat kovemmin, kovemmin -- menivät sitte ohi ja
vaikenivat. Vanhemmat huokasivat helpotuksesta, ja isä sanoi:

-- Vai niin, vai kertomus? Hauskako?

-- Ei, isä; synkkä.

Isä tahtoi vaihtaa sen johonkin hauskempaan, mutta lapsi piti
kiinni oikeuksistaan -- olihan näet sovittu, että hän saisi kaikki
mitä käskisi. Isä oli rehellinen puritaanisotilas ja oli antanut
lupauksensa -- hän tahtoi sen myöskin pitää. Abby sanoi:

-- Isä, älkäämme aina halutko hauskoja kertomuksia. Imettäjäni sanoo,
ettei ihmisillä aina ole hauskaa. Onko se totta, isä? Hän sanoo niin.

Äiti huokasi, ja hänen ajatuksensa liitelivät vaan surun maailmassa.
Isä sanoi lempeästi:

-- Se on totta, rakkaani. Murheiden täytyy tulla; se on surullista,
mutta totta.

-- Oi, kerro sitte tarina niistä, isä -- kolkko, niin että meitä
pöyristyttää ja että meistä tuntuisi siltä kuin koskisi se juuri
_meitä_. Äiti, tule lähemmäksi ja pidä kiinni Abbyn käsistä, niin
että jos tarina on hyvin kamala, on meidän helpompi sitä kuulla, kun
olemme lähekkäin. Nyt voit alkaa, isä.

-- Niin, oli kerran kolme everstiä...

-- Älä, ajatteleppas! Everstejä olen nähnyt! Olethan sinäkin eversti,
minä tunnen univormun. Jatka, isä.

Ja eräässä tappelussa olivat he rikkoneet käskyjä vastaan.

Nuo suuret sanat soivat hauskoilta lapsen korvissa ja hän katsoi
isäänsä hämmästyneenä ja uteliaana ja sanoi:

-- Onko se jotain hyvää, isä?

Vanhemmat miltei hymyilivät ja isä vastasi:

-- Ei, se on jotain aivan toista, rakkaani. He olivat rikkoneet
saamansa määräykset.

-- Onko _se_ jotain?...

-- Se on aivan samaa. Heidän oli käsketty tehdä valehyökkäys muuatta
vahvaa varustusta vastaan eräässä tappelussa, joka näytti jo
menetetyltä, houkutellakseen viholliset syrjään ja tehdäkseen siten
tasavallan joukoille tilaisuuden peräytymiseen, mutta innostuksissaan
rikkoivat he käskyn, sillä valehyökkäyksen sijasta tekivät he
tosihyökkäyksen, valloittivat varustuksen väkirynnäköllä ja voittivat
tappelun, niin että päivästä tulikin voitonpäivä. Ylikenraali
pahastui tuosta tottelemattomuudesta, moitti heitä kovin ja käski
heidän saapua Lontooseen vastaamaan hengenrikoksesta.

-- Onko se suuri kenraali Cromwell, isä?

-- Kyllä.

-- Oi, _hänet_ minä olen nähnyt, isä! Kun hän ratsastaa soturiensa
kanssa suurella ratsullaan meidän talomme ohi, näyttää hän niin
-- niin -- en tiedä miltä, mutta hän näyttää siltä kuin olisi
tyytymätön, ja minä näen, että ihmiset pelkäävät häntä, mutta _minä_
en pelkää häntä, sillä niin hän ei ole katsellut minua.

-- Ai sinua, pikku lörpöttelijä! No, everstit saapuivat vankeina
Lontooseen ja pääsivät kunniasanaansa vastaan vapaiksi ja saivat
tilaisuuden tervehtiä perheitään viimeisen kerran...

Kuulkaa!

He kuuntelivat -- taaskin askeleita; mutta taas menivät ne ohi. Äiti
painoi päänsä miehensä olkaan salatakseen kalpeutensa.

-- Ne tulivat tänä aamuna.

Lapsi terästi katseensa.

-- Oi, isä, onko tuo _tosi_ kertomus?

-- On, rakkaani.

-- Oi, niin hauska! Voi, ne ovat aina vaan hauskempia. Jatka, isä. --
Ei, äiti, rakas äiti... itketkö sinä?

-- Älä välitä siitä, rakkaani; minä ajattelin... niitä perheraukkoja.

-- Voi, älä itke. äiti; se loppuu kyllä hyvin, sen saat nähdä...
kertomukset loppuvat aina hyvin. Jatka, isä, aina siihen asti, että
he elivät yhdessä onnellisina vielä monta vuotta; sitte ei hän itke
enää. Saat nähdä, äiti. Jatka isä.

-- Ensin veivät ne heidät Toweriin ennenkuin päästivät heidät kotiin.

-- Towerin olen _minä_ nähnyt! Me voimme nähdä sen täältä. Kiiruhda,
isä!

-- Minä jatkan niin pian kuin voin nykyisissä olosuhteissa. Towerissa
tutki heitä sotaoikeus tunnin ajan ja katsoi heidät syyllisiksi ja
tuomitsi ammuttaviksi.

-- _Surmattaviksiko?_

-- Niin.

-- Hyi, miten häijysti! Rakas äiti, nyt itket taas. Älä tee sitä,
äiti; pian saa kertomus onnellisen käänteen, sen saat nähdä.
Kiiruhda, isä, äidin tähden; sinä kerrot liian hitaasti.

-- Tiedän kyllä, että teen niin, mutta se tapahtuu senvuoksi, että
minun täytyy niin usein keskeyttää _ajatellakseni_.

-- Mutta sitä et _saa_ tehdä, isä; sinun on vaan jouduttava.

-- No niin... ne kolme everstiä...

-- Tunnetko heidät, isä?

-- Tunnen, lemmittyni.

-- Voi, jos minäkin tuntisin? Minä pidän eversteistä. Luuletko, että
saisin heitä suudella?

Eversti vastasi hiukan epävarmalla äänellä:

-- Kyllä, _yhtä_ heistä, rakkaani! No -- suutele minua hänen
sijastaan.

-- Noin, pappa -- ja nämä ovat niiden toisten puolesta. Minä luulen,
että saisin suudella heitä, kun sanoisin: minun isäni on myöskin
eversti ja hän olisi tehnyt niinkuin te teitte, niin että se ei _voi_
olla väärin, mitä tahansa sitte ihmiset sanovatkin, ja että teidän ei
tarvitse ollenkaan hävetä. Silloin he kyllä antaisivat minun suudella
-- eikö totta, isä?

-- Kyllä, Jumala sen tietää, lapseni!

-- Äiti! -- Sinä et saa, äiti! Pian tulee hän siihen kohtaan, missä
käy hyvin. Jatka, isä.

-- Silloin olivat kaikki suruissaan -- niin, kaikki he olivat; minä
tarkoitan sotaoikeuden herroja. Ja he menivät ylikenraalin luo ja
sanoivat täyttäneensä velvollisuutensa -- sillä se _oli_ heidän
velvollisuutensa, ymmärräthän -- ja nyt he pyysivät, että kaksi
everstiä armahdettaisiin ja ainoastaan yksi ammuttaisiin. Heistä
riitti kyllä yksikin esimerkiksi armeijalle. Mutta ylikenraali
oli hyvin ankara ja moitti heitä siitä, että he, täytettyään
_oman_ velvollisuutensa ja kevennettyään omantuntonsa, koettivat
taivuttaa häntä laiminlyömään velvollisuutensa ja siten tahraamaan
sotilaskunniansa. Mutta he vastasivat, etteivät pyytäneet häneltä
muuta kuin mitä itsekin tekisivät, jos olisivat hänen korkeassa
asemassaan ja jos heillä olisi jalo armahtamisoikeus käsissään. Se
vaikutti häneen: hän vaikeni, seisoi ja mietti, ja ankaruus väheni
hänen kasvoiltaan. Hän pyysi heitä odottamaan ja meni pieneen
yksityiseen kamariinsa pyytämään rukoilemalla neuvoa Jumalalta; ja
tultuaan takaisin hän sanoi: Vetäkööt arpaa. Se ratkaiskoon asian, ja
kaksi heistä jää eloon.

-- No, tekivätkö he sen, isä, tekivätkö he sen? Ja kenen tulee
kuolla? Voi miesparkaa!

-- Eivät. He kieltäytyivät.

-- Eivätkö he tahtoneet sitä tehdä.

-- Eivät.

-- Minkävuoksi?

-- He sanoivat että se, joka vetäisi onnettoman arvan, tuomitsisi
itsensä kuolemaan vapaaehtoisesti, eikä se olisi muuta kuin
itsemurha, miksi tahansa sitä kutsuttaisiinkin. He sanoivat olevansa
kristittyjä ja raamattu kielsi itsemurhan. Sen tervehdyksen he
lähettivät ja sanoivat, että tuomio voitaisiin panna täytäntöön
milloin tahansa.

-- Mitä se merkitsee, isä?

-- Sitä että... heidät ammuttaisiin joka ainoa.

-- Kuulkaa!

Puhallustako? Ei. Tram--tram--trum--tram--trum--.

-- Avatkaa! Ylikenraalin nimessä!

-- Oi, isä, ne ovat sotilaita! Minä pidän sotilaista! Salli minun
laskea heidät sisälle, isä, salli _minun!_

Hän hyppäsi alas sylistä, juoksi ovelle ja avasi sen ja huusi
iloisesti: Tulkaa sisään! Tulkaa sisään! Täällä he ovat, isä!
Tarkk'ampujat! Minä tunnen tarkk'ampujat!

Sotilaat marssivat sisälle, asettuivat riviin ja laskivat kiväärinsä;
heidän upseerinsa teki kunniaa, tuomittu eversti oli noussut ylös ja
vastannut tervehdykseen, vaimonsa seisoi hänen vieressään kalpeana ja
kasvonsa tuskan jäykistäminä, mutta muuten ilmaisematta suruaan, ja
lapsi katseli sotilaallista näytelmää loistavin silmäyksin...

Ensin pitkä isän, äidin ja lapsen syleily, sitte käsky: Eteenpäin --
Toweriin! Sitte läksi eversti kodistaan, säilyttäen sotilaallisen
käyntinsä ja ryhtinsä; sotilaat seurasivat perässä ja ovi suljettiin.

-- Oi, äiti, eikö se loppunut hyvin? Minähän _sanoin_, että niin
kävisi; nyt menevät he Toweriin ja siellä saa hän tavata heitä. Hän...

-- Voi, anna kun syleilen sinua, pikkuraukkani!


II.

Seuraavana aamuna ei murtunut äiti voinut jättää sänkyään; lääkärit
ja sairaanhoitajattaret häärivät hänen ympärillään ja kuiskailivat
keskenään silloin tällöin. Abby ei saanut tulla huoneeseen, vaan
käskettiin hänet menemään ulos leikkimään -- äiti oli kovin sairas.
Talvipukimiinsa puettuna meni Abby ulos ja leikki kadulla hetkisen;
mutta sitte tuntui hänestä hyvin kummalliselta ja epäoikeutetulta,
että hänen isänsä saisi olla Towerissa sellaisessa tilaisuudessa,
kuitenkaan mitään tietämättä. Sen täytyi muuttua; hän ottaisi itse
asian huolekseen.

Tunti senjälkeen menivät sotaoikeuden jäsenet ylikenraalin luo. Hän
seisoi tuimana ja selkä suorana, nojaten rystyillään pöytään, ja
antoi merkin, että oli valmis heitä kuulemaan. Puhemies sanoi:

-- Me olemme kehottaneet heitä ajattelemaan, olemme kerjänneet ja
rukoilleet heitä, mutta he pysyvät päätöksessään. He eivät tahdo
vetää arpaa. He haluavat kuolla, mutta eivät tehdä syntiä uskontoa
vastaan.

Ylikenraalin kasvot synkistyivät, mutta hän ei sanonut mitään. Hän
seisoi hetkisen miettiväisenä, sitte hän lausui:

-- Kaikki eivät saa kuolla; heidän puolestaan on vedettävä arpaa.

Sotaoikeuden jäsenten kasvoilla kuvastui kiitollisuus.

-- Lähettäkää noutamaan heitä. Viekää ne tuohon huoneeseen. Asettakaa
heidät vierekkäin kasvot seinää vasten ja kädet ristiin selän taa.
Ilmoittakaa minulle, kun he ovat saapuneet.

Jäätyään yksin hän istuutui ja antoi käskyn ajutantilleen:

-- Menkää kadulle ja noutakaa sieltä tänne ensimäinen pieni lapsi,
joka kulkee ohitse.

Mies oli juuri mennyt ulos ovesta, mutta palasi samassa takaisin
saattaen Abbya, jonka vaatteet olivat aivan lumiset. Hän meni heti
valtion päämiehen luo, tuon pelätyn miehen, jonka pelkän nimen
kuullessaan maailman ruhtinaat ja mahtavat vapisivat. Abby kiipesi
hänen polvelleen ja sanoi:

-- Minä tunnen teidät, herrani; te olette ylikenraali; olen nähnyt
teidät, kun olette ratsastanut talomme ohi. Kaikki olivat peloissaan,
mutta _minä_ en pelännyt, sillä te ette katsonut minuun tuimasti...
muistatteko sen? Minulla oli ylläni punanen puku... siniset nauhat
etupietimissä. Ettekö muista sitä? Hymyily hälvensi ankaruutta
protektorin kasvoilta, ja hän alkoi miettiä valtioviisasta vastausta:

-- Niin, anna kun katson... minä...

-- Minä seisoin aivan talon luona... _oman_ taloni luona, huomatkaa.

-- Kyllä, rakas pikkuystäväni, minun pitäisi hävetä, mutta tiedätkö...

Lapsi keskeytti hänet moittien:

-- Ei, te ette _muista_ sitä. Enhän minä ole unohtanut _teitä_.

-- Niin, minua hävettää tosiaankin, mutta nyt en sinua enää koskaan
unohda, pikku ystäväni, siihen annan sinulle kunniasanani pantiksi.
Tahdotko nyt antaa minulle anteeksi ja olla kanssani hyvä ystävä, nyt
ja aina?

-- Kyllä, sen minä tahdon, vaikka en voikaan käsittää, miten te
voitte sen unohtaa; teidän täytyy olla hyvin huonomuistinen; mutta
samaa minäkin olen väliin. Minun ei ole lainkaan vaikea antaa
anteeksi, koska uskon, että te _tahdotte_ olla hyvä ja tehdä oikein,
ja minä luulen, että te olette myöskin kiltti -- mutta teidän tulee
puristaa minua lähemmäksi itseänne, niinkuin isäkin tekee -- on niin
kylmä.

-- Minä puristan sinua niin paljon kuin haluat, uusi ystäväni, joka
tästälähin tulet aina olemaan _vanha_ ystäväni, eikö totta? Sinä
muistutat minun pikku tyttöäni -- niin, hän on nyt sinua hiukan
lyhempi -- mutta hän oli rakastettava ja herttainen ja solakka
varreltaan niinkuin sinäkin. Ja hänellä oli sinun viehätyskykysi,
pikku noita -- sinun vastustamattoman rakastettava, luottamuksellinen
käytöstapasi niin hyvin ystäviä kuin vieraita kohtaan, tapa, joka
tekee auliiksi orjiksi kaikki ne, joihin se kohdistuu. Hän lepäsi
minun sylissäni, aivan niinkuin sinä nyt; ja me olimme tovereita
ja vertaisia ja leikimme keskenämme. On tuntunut ijäisyydeltä sen
perästä kun se ihana taivas hälveni ja katosi, ja nyt olet sinä
lahjottanut sen minulle takaisin. Ota vastaan taakkojen uuvuttaman
miehen siunaus tämän johdosta, pikku olentoni, joka nyt minun
levätessäni kannat Englantia olkapäilläsi!

-- Pidittekö hänestä ihan _hirveän_ paljon?

-- Pidin, sen voit ymmärtää siitä että hän käski ja minä tottelin.

-- Te olette kerrassaan erinomainen! Haluatteko suudella minua?

-- Kiitollisena -- ja pidänpä sitä vielä päälle päätteeksi kunniana.
Kas näin -- tämä on sinulle; ja tämä -- se on hänelle. Sinä pyysit,
mutta olisit voinut käskeä, sillä sinä edustat häntä ja minun täytyy
totella, mitä sinä käsket.

Lapsi taputti käsiään ihastuneena tähän suureen ylennykseen -- sitte
osui hänen korvaansa lähenevä ääni: marssivien miesten tahdikasta
astuntaa.

-- Sotilaita, sotilaita, kenraali! Abby tahtoo niitä nähdä!

-- Sen saat, rakkaani; mutta odota silmänräpäys, minulla on
annettavana sinulle eräs tehtävä.

Muuan upseeri astui sisään, kumarsi syvään ja sanoi:

-- He ovat tulleet, teidän korkeutenne.

Hän kumarsi jälleen ja poistui.

Valtion päämies antoi Abbylle kolme vahasinettiä: kaksi valkosta ja
yhden punasen; tehtävänä oli siis vetää sen everstin kuolinarpa,
jonka tulisi kuolla.

-- Oi, miten tuo punanen on kaunis! Saanko ne?

-- Et, rakkaani, ne ovat aijotut toisille. Nosta tuon uutimen
lievettä, sen takana on avonainen ovi; mene siitä sisälle, niin
siellä saat nähdä kolme miestä seisovan rivissä selittäin sinuun,
kädet selän takana -- näin -- kullakin toinen koura avoinna kuin
malja. Pane yksi näistä sineteistä kuhunkin avonaiseen kouraan ja
tule sitte takaisin minun luokseni.

Abby katosi uutimen taa ja protektori oli yksin. Hän sanoi nöyrästi:

-- Varmaankin lähetti minulle neuvottomalle tämän hyvän ajatuksen
Hän, joka on ainoa saapuvilla oleva auttaja epäilijöille, jotka
Hänen apuaan etsivät. Hän tietää, miten vaali on ratkaistava, ja on
lähettänyt viattoman sanansaattajattarensa täyttämään Hänen tahtoaan.
Joku muu voisi erehtyä, mutta Hän ei voi erehtyä. Ihmeelliset ja
viisaat ovat Hänen tiensä -- siunattu olkoon Hänen pyhä nimensä!

Pieni keijukainen antoi uutimen pudota takanaan ja seisoi
silmänräpäyksen ajan katsellen uteliaana oikeussalin järjestelyä ja
sotilaiden ja vankien suoria vartaloita; sitte levisi ilonvälke hänen
kasvoilleen ja hän lausui itsekseen:

-- Noistahan on isä yksi! Minä tunnen hänen selkänsä. Hänen täytyy
saada kaunein!

Abby riensi iloisena heidän luokseen, pani sinetit avonaisiin käsiin,
tirkisti sitte isänsä kainalon alta, näytti nauravat kasvonsa ja
huudahti:

-- Isä, isä! Katso, mitä olet saanut! _Minä_ olen antanut sen sinulle!

Isä vilkaisi tuohon onnettomuutta tuottavaan lahjaan, laskeusi sitte
polvilleen ja painoi pienen viattoman pyövelinsä rintaansa vasten
myrskyisen rakkauden ja liikutuksen valtaamana. Sotilaat, upseerit
ja vapautetut vangit seisoivat kaikki silmänräpäyksen ajan kauhusta
kivettyneinä nähdessään tämän murhenäytelmän, sitte sattui tuo
tuskallinen kohtaus heidän sydämiinsä, silmänsä täyttyivät kyynelillä
ja he itkivät ujostumatta. Muutamia minuutteja vallitsi syvä ja
juhlallinen hiljaisuus, sitte astui kaartinupseeri vastahakoisesti
esiin, pani kätensä vangin olalle ja sanoi lempeästi:

-- Olen pahoillani, herrani, mutta velvollisuus käskee minua...

-- Mitä? sanoi lapsi.

-- Minun täytyy viedä hänet pois. Olen niin pahoillani...

-- Viedä hänet pois? Mihin?

-- Am... am... Jumala minua auttakoon!... linnoituksen toiseen osaan.

-- Sitä ette saa tehdä. Äitini on sairas ja minä vien hänet mukanani
kotiin.

Hän päästäytyi irti, kiipesi isänsä selkään ja kiersi käsivartensa
hänen kaulaansa.

-- Nyt on Abby valmis, isä -- menkää nyt.

-- Lapsiraukkani, minä en voi. Minun täytyy mennä heidän kanssaan.

Lapsi hyppäsi alas ja katseli kummastuneena ympärilleen. Sitte juoksi
hän upseerin luo, polki vihaisena pientä jalkaansa ja huudahti:

-- Minähän sanoin teille, että äitini on sairas, ettekö kuullut? Anna
hänen mennä -- sinun _täytyy!_

-- Voi, lapsiparka, jospa Jumala sallisi, että voisin sen tehdä,
mutta minun täytyy tosiaankin viedä hänet pois. Valmiiksi, sotilaat!
Rivi suoraksi! Kiväärit lepoon!...

Abby oli poissa kuin salama. Silmänräpäyksen perästä palasi hän
takaisin ja veti protektoria mukanaan. Kun tuo pelätty mies
näyttäytyi, ojentuivat kaikki läsnäolijat suoriksi, upseerit tekivät
kunniaa ja samoin sotilaat kivääreillään.

-- Estäkää heitä, kenraali! Äitini on sairas ja tahtoo isää kotiin ja
minä olen _sanonut_ niille sen, mutta ne eivät kuulleet minua ja nyt
vievät ne hänet pois.

Ylikenraali seisoi kuin kivettyneenä.

-- _Sinunko_ isäsi, lapseni? Onko hän sinun isäsi?

-- On, luonnollisesti -- sitä hän on _aina_ ollut. Olisinko minä
antanut sitä kaunista punasta jollekin muulle, kun niin paljon pidän
hänestä? Enhän toki!

Kauhun ilme levisi protektorin kasvoille ja hän sanoi:

-- Voi, Jumala minua auttakoon! Saatanan juonien kautta olen tehnyt
julmimman teon, johon ihminen koskaan voi tehdä itsensä syypääksi --
eikä ole olemassa mitään apua, ei mitään apua! Mitä voin minä tehdä?

Abby huusi levottomana ja kärsimättömänä:

-- Kyllä, te voitte sanoa, että ne päästävät hänet menemään.

Ja hän alkoi nyyhkyttää.

-- Sanokaa niille, että tekevät sen! Te pyysitte, että minä käskisin
teitä, ja kun ensi kerran pyydän teitä tekemään jotain, ette sitä tee!

Lempeä valonkajastus kuvastui vanhoilta, karkeilta kasvoilta ja
ylikenraali laski kätensä pikku tyrannin päälaelle ja lausui:

-- Jumalan kiitos, että annoin tuon pelastavan, ajattelemattoman
lupauksen! Ja kiitos, sinä kaikista lapsista rakkain, siitä että
Hänen johdattamanaan muistutit minua unohtamastani lupauksesta!
Upseerit, totelkaa hänen käskyjään -- hän puhuu minun puolestani.
Vanki on armahdettu, päästäkää hänet vapaaksi!




TAIVASKO VAI HELVETTI?


I.

-- Valehtelitko sinä?

-- Sinä sen tunnustat -- sinä tunnustat sen todellakin -- sinä
valehtelit!


II.

Perheeseen kuului neljä henkilöä: Margaret Lester, leski,
kolmekymmentäkuusi vuotta vanha; Helen Lester, hänen tyttärensä,
kuusitoista vuotias; rouva Lesterin naimattomat tädit, Hannah ja
Hester Gray, kaksoset, kuudenkymmenenseitsemän vuoden ikäisiä.
Valvoen tai nukkuen kuluttivat nuo kolme naista päivänsä ja yönsä
jumaloimalla nuorta tyttöä; tarkkaamalla hänen hennon sielunsa
väreitä hänen kasvojensa peilistä; virkistämällä omia sielujaan
hänen kukoistavaa kauneuttaan katsellessaan; kuuntelemalla hänen
äänensä sointua; kiitollisesti tunnustamalla, miten rikas ja kaunis
oli heille maailma senvuoksi että Helen oli olemassa; kauhistumalla
ajatellessaan, miten kolkoksi se tulisi, jos Helen, sen aurinko,
sammuisi.

Luonnostaan -- ja sielustaan ja sydämestään -- olivat vanhat
tantit tavattoman rakastettavia erinomaisia ja hyviä, mutta mitä
tulee moraaliin ja esiintymistapaan oli heidän kasvatuksensa ollut
niin tavattoman kaavamainen, että se oli tehnyt heidät päältäpäin
nähden tuikeiksi, ellei sanoisi ankariksi. Heidän vaikutusvaltansa
talossa oli suuri, niin suuri että äiti ja tytär mukautuivat heidän
moraalisiin ja uskonnollisiin vaatimuksiinsa iloisina, tyytyväisinä,
ihastuneina, ilman epäilystä. Oli jo tullut heidän toiseksi
luonnokseen toimia sen mukaan. Tässä rauhallisessa paratiisissa ei
niin ollen ilmennyt mitään epäsointuja, ei äreyttä, ei murinaa, ei
sydämensuruja.

Valhetta ei siellä ilmennyt. Sitä ei voitu siellä ajatellakaan.
Kaikki puhe liikkui siellä ehdottoman totuuden piirissä, raudankovan
totuuden, horjumattoman ja säälimättömän totuuden, miksi tahansa
seuraukset siitä muodostuisivatkaan. Viimein eräänä päivänä,
asianhaarain niin vaatiessa, saastutti talon lempilapsi kielensä
valheella -- ja tunnusti sen kyynelsilmin ja itseään soimaten.
Eivät mitkään sanat voisi kuvailla tanttien hämmästystä. Oli kuin
taivas olisi haljennut ja maa mennyt kappaleiksi yhdellä iskulla. He
istuivat vierekkäin kalpeina ja totisina, tuijottivat tajuttomina
rikolliseen, joka oli polvillaan heidän edessään, kasvot kätkettyinä
ensin toisen, sitte toisen polviin, tyrskyen ja nyyhkyttäen,
osanottoa ja unhotusta kerjäten, mutta mitään vastausta saamatta,
nöyrästi suudellen ensin toisen kättä, sitte toisen, mutta nähdäkseen
sen sitte vedettävän takaisin niinkuin nuo tahratut huulet olisivat
niitä häväisseet.

Kaksi kertaa, vähän väliaikaa pitäen, sanoi täti Hester jääkylmän
hämmästyneenä:

-- _Valehtelitko sinä?_

Kaksi kertaa, vähän väliaikaa pitäen, noudatti täti Hannah esimerkkiä
huudahtaen puoleksi tukehtuneella ja kauhua ilmaisevalla äänellä:

-- Sinä sen tunnustat -- sinä tunnustat sen todellakin -- sinä
valehtelit!

Siinä kaikki mitä he voivat sanoa. Tapaus oli uusi, ennenkuulumaton,
uskomaton; he eivät voineet sitä ymmärtää, eivät tienneet, miten
heidän tulisi sen suhteen menetellä, se mykistytti vähitellen heidän
kielensä.

Viimein päätettiin, että syyllinen lapsi oli vietävä äitinsä luo,
joka oli sairas ja jonka täytyi saada tietää, mitä oli tapahtunut.
Helen kerjäsi, rukoili ja vannotti heitä, että häntä säästettäisiin
tästä lisänöyryytyksestä ja että hänen äitiään säästettäisiin tästä
surusta ja tuskasta, mutta se oli mahdotonta, velvollisuus vaati
sen uhrin, ja velvollisuus on täytettävä ennen kaikkea, ei mikään
voi vapauttaa velvollisuudesta, velvollisuuden kanssa on kaikki
sovinnonhierominen mahdoton.

Helen kerjäsi ja rukoili ja sanoi, että synti oli hänen yksin, hänen
äidillään ei ollut siinä mitään osaa -- miksi pitäisi siis hänen
kärsiä sen tähden?

Mutta tantit olivat taipumattomia tunnollisuudessaan ja sanoivat,
että lakia, jonka mukaan isäin synnit kostetaan lapsille, täydellä
syyllä voitiin sovelluttaa myöskin päinvastaisessa järjestyksessä;
senvuoksi oli aivan oikeutettua, että syntisen lapsen viaton äiti
saisi kantaa oikeudenmukaisen osansa siitä surusta, tuskasta ja
häpeästä, joka oli synnin tuottama palkka.

He menivät sairaan huoneeseen kaikki kolme.

       *       *       *       *       *

Samaan aikaan lähestyi lääkäri taloa. Mutta vielä oli hän hyvän
matkan päässä siitä. Hän oli taitava lääkäri ja hyvä ihminen ja
hänellä oli hyvä sydän, mutta hänet täytyi tuntea vuoden ajan,
voidakseen olla häntä halveksimatta, kaksi vuotta oppiakseen
kunnioittamaan häntä, kolme vuotta oppiakseen pitämään hänestä
ja neljä tai viisi vuotta oppiakseen häntä rakastamaan. Se oli
pitkällinen ja kärsivällisyyttä kysyvä kasvatus, mutta se maksoi
vaivan. Hänen vartalonsa oli pitkä; päänsä oli kuin leijonan,
kasvonsa kuin leijonan, äänensä ja silmänsä tuikeat, molemmat väliin
kuin naisen, väliin kuin merirosvon, aina mielialojen mukaan. Hän ei
ollenkaan tuntenut seurustelutapoja eikä tutkinut niitä; puheensa,
esiintymistapansa, ryhtinsä ja käytöksensä oli kaiken tavallisuuden
vastakohta. Hän oli vilpitön äärimmäisyyteen asti; kaikista asioista
oli hänellä mielipiteensä; ne olivat aina valmiit esitettäviksi,
eikä hän ajatellut vähääkään sitä, josko hänen kuulijansa ne
hyväksyivät eli eivät. Mistä hän piti, siitä hän piti ja ilmaisi
sen selvästi; mistä hän ei pitänyt, sitä hän halveksi ja julisti
sen julki vaikka katoilta. Nuoruusvuosinaan oli hän ollut merimies
ja meren suolanen vesi väreili vieläkin hänen ympärillään. Hän oli
luja ja rehellinen kristitty ja luuli olevansa paras koko maassa,
ainoa, jonka kristinusko oli täysin terve, terveyttä luova, tervettä
järkeä täynnä ja jossa ei ollut ainoatakaan lahoa kohtaa. Ihmiset,
jotka tahtoivat olla hyvissä väleissä hänen kanssaan tai jostain
syystä toivoivat, että hän olisi hyvällä tuulella, kutsuivat häntä
"Kristityksi" -- sana, jonka kaunis kaiku soi kuin musiikki hänen
korvissaan ja jonka iso alkukirjain teki häneen niin viettelevän
ja eloisan vaikutuksen, että hän pimeässäkin voi _nähdä_ sen
soluvan ihmisten huulilta. Monet, jotka hänestä pitivät, polkivat
omiatuntojaan jaloillaan ja käyttivät kursailematta aina tuota
nimitystä häntä puhutellessaan, koska heistä oli hupaista tehdä
kaikki voitavansa häntä miellyttääkseen; ja innokkaan ja sydämellisen
ilkeästi oli hänen lukuisten vihamiestensä tapana kaunistella sitä
nimitystä, kukittaa sitä, laajentaa se "_Ainoaksi_ Kristityksi".
Näistä nimityksistä oli jälkimäinen levinnyt laajemmalle, siitä
pitivät kyllä huolta hänen vihamiehensä, jotka olivat suurena
enemmistönä. Mitä tahansa tohtori uskoi, sen uskoi hän kaikesta
sydämestään ja olisi taistellut sen puolesta joka tilaisuudessa, ja
jos aika näiden tilaisuuksien välillä kävi väsyttävän pitkäksi, löysi
hän kyllä keinoja sitä lyhentää. Hän oli hyvin omantunnonmukainen
sovelluttaessaan käytäntöön jotenkin itsenäisiä mielipiteitään, ja
minkä tahansa hän käsitti velvollisuudekseen, sen hän täytti, olipa
se sitte yhtäpitävä ammattisiveyssaarnaajain mielipiteiden kanssa
tahi ei. Nuorena merillä ollessaan oli hänellä ollut suuri taipumus
kiroilemiseen, mutta kääntymyksen tehtyään piti hän sääntönä, jota
aina noudatti, olla kiroilematta muulloin kuin erittäin harvinaisissa
tapauksissa, jos sitä silloin velvollisuus nimenomaan vaati. Hän
oli juonut jotenkin hurskaasti silloin kun oli merillä, mutta
käännyttyään tuli hänestä pysyväinen ja ujostelematon ehdottoman
raittiuden mies voidakseen olla esimerkkinä nuorille, ja sen ajan
perästä joi hän harvoin, niin, eipä juuri koskaan, paitsi silloin kun
se näytti hänestä velvollisuudelta -- tapaus, joita väliin voi sattua
noin pari kertaa vuodessa, mutta ei koskaan esim. viittä kertaa.

Sellainen mies on aina tavattoman herkkä vaikuttimille ja
kosketuksille ja kiivastunteinen. _Hän_ oli sitä, eikä hänellä ollut
ollenkaan kykyä salata tunteitaan, tahi jos olisi ollutkin, ei
hän olisi viitsinyt sitä käyttää. Hänen kasvonsa ilmaisivat hänen
sielussaan vallitsevan sään, ja kun hän astui johonkin huoneeseen,
nostettiin sateen- tahi päivänvarjostimet -- kuvaannollisesti
sanottuna -- aina kasvojen ilmeen mukaisesti. Kun lämmin kiilto
loisti hänen silmistään, merkitsi se hyväksymistä ja levitti
siunausta ympärilleen; kun hän tuli otsa rypyssä, aleni lämpömäärä
kymmenen astetta. Hänestä pidettiin paljon ystäviensä kodeissa, mutta
häntä myös väliin pelättiin.

Hän oli hyvin mieltynyt Lesterin perheeseen, ja perheen jäsenet
vastasivat tuohon mieltymykseen koron kanssa. He surkuttelivat hänen
kristinuskoaan, ja hän taas suorastaan pilkkasi heidän omaansa, mutta
siitä huolimatta pitivät he toisistaan niinkuin ennenkin.

Hän lähestyi taloa -- jonkun matkan päässä; tantit ja rikoksellinen
olivat menossa sairaan huoneeseen.


III.

Kolme viimeksimainittua seisoi sängyn vieressä; tantit mahtavina,
synnintekijätär hiljaa nyyhkyttäen. Äiti käänsi päätään tyynyllä;
hänen väsyneissä silmissään välähti heti myötätuntoisuus ja
intohimoinen äidinrakkaus, kun katse kohdistui lapseen, ja hän ojensi
käsivartensa syleilyyn.

-- Odota! sanoi täti Hannah ja tarttui tyttöön ja esti häntä
syleilemästä.

-- Helen, sanoi toinen täti äänenpainolla, puhu kaikki äidillesi.
Puhdista sydämesi, älä jätä mitään tunnustamatta.

Nuori tyttö seisoi onnettomana ja avuttomana tuomariensa edessä, teki
hiljaa nyyhkyttäen surullisen synnintunnustuksensa ja kun se oli
loppunut, huudahti hän kiihkeän rukoilevalla äänellä:

-- Oi, äiti, etkö voi antaa minulle anteeksi? Etkö tahdo antaa
minulle anteeksi? Minä olen niin onneton!

-- Antaakko sinulle anteeksi, rakkaani? Voi, tule syliini! Kas noin,
paina pääsi rintaani ja tyynny. Vaikka olisit sanonut tuhat valetta...

Kuului ääni, varotus -- rykäiseminen. Tantit katsahtivat ylös ja
ällistyivät, -- siinä seisoi tohtori, kasvonsa kuin ukkospilvi. Äiti
ja tytär eivät tienneet hänen läsnäoloaan, he olivat kuin juotetut
yhteen, sydän vasten sydäntä, uiden sanomattomassa onnessa, kuolleina
kaikelle muulle maailmalle. Lääkäri seisoi kotvasen ja katseli
tuimana tätä kohtausta; hän ajatteli sitä, selvitteli sitä itselleen,
tutki sen syitä; sitte nosti hän kätensä ja viittasi tanteille. Ne
tulivat vapisten hänen luokseen, seisoivat nöyrinä hänen edessään ja
odottivat. Lääkäri kumartui vähän ja kuiskasi:

-- Enkö ole sanonut teille, että sairasta on säästettävä kaikilta
mielenliikutuksilta? Mitä hittoa te olette tehneet? Laputtakaa
tiehenne!

He tottelivat. Puolen tunnin perästä tuli hän salonkiin tyynenä
ja iloisena, päivänpaisteisena, saattaen Heleneä kädet hänen
vyötäistensä ympärillä; tohtori taputteli häntä ja puheli hellästi ja
leikillisesti hänen kanssaan, ja Helen oli hänkin sama aurinkoinen ja
iloinen olento kuin ennenkin.

-- Kas niin, sanoi lääkäri, hyvästi nyt, pikku ystäväni. Mene
huoneeseesi ja pysyttele erilläsi äidistäsi ja ole kiltti tyttö.
Mutta odotappas -- näytä kieltäsi. Oikein, se on hyvä... sinä olet
terve kuin pähkinä!

Lääkäri taputti häntä poskelle ja lisäsi:

-- Mene nyt; minä haluan puhua näiden tanttien kanssa.

Helen poistui. Lääkärin kasvot tulivat taas äkkiä synkiksi ja
istuttuaan tuolille sanoi hän:

-- Te kumpikin olette tehneet koko joukon vahinkoa -- ja ehkä hiukan
hyötyäkin. Niin, hiukan hyötyä -- sen mukaan miltä nyt näyttää.
Margaretan sairaus on pilkkukuumetta! Se on tullut ilmi teidän
hulluuksienne johdosta, ja se on tavallaan teidän ansionne, siihen
nähden miltä nyt näyttää. Aikaisemmin en voinut olla varma siitä mitä
se oli.

Ikäänkuin saamansa vaikutuksen ponnahuttamina hyppäsivät vanhat
naiset ylös kauhusta vavisten.

-- Istukaa alas! Mitä aijotte tehdä?

-- Mitäkö tehdä? Meidän täytyy rientää hänen luokseen. Meidän...

-- Te ette tee mitään sentapaista, te olette jo tehneet tarpeeksi
vahinkoa yhden päivän osalle. Aijotteko tuhlata koko rikos- ja
mielettömyysvarastonne yhdellä ainoalla arvanheitolla? Istukaa alas,
sanon minä. Minä olen järjestänyt niin että hän saa nukkua, sillä
sitä hän tarvitsee; jos te häiritsette häntä saamatta minulta siihen
lupaa, niin lyön aivot päästänne -- jos teillä niitä on.

He istuivat paikoilleen huolestuneina ja loukkaantuneina, mutta
tottelivat kuitenkin hänen käskyään. Lääkäri jatkoi:

-- Niin, nyt tahdon saada selityksen tähän. _He_ tahtoivat selittää
minulle kaikki -- ikäänkuin eivät jo olisi olleet tarpeeksi
liikutuksissaan. Te tiesitte käskyni; kuinka te uskalsitte mennä
tuonne sisälle ja saada aikaan semmoisen touhun?

Hester katsoi anovaisesti Hannahiin, Hannah loi rukoilevan silmäyksen
Hesteriin -- ei kumpikaan halunnut tanssia tämän jyrisevän musiikin
tahdissa. Tohtori tuli heille avuksi. Hän sanoi:

-- Alota Hester!

Nypistellen suuren huivinsa poimuja, katseensa lattiaan luotuna,
sanoi Hester arasti:

-- Emme olisi olleet tottelemattomia mistään jokapäiväisestä syystä,
mutta tämä oli mitä painavinta laatua. Se oli velvollisuus. Ja kun
velvollisuus on kysymyksessä, silloin ei ole valitsemisen varaa;
silloin täytyy jättää syrjään kaikki vähemmän tärkeät seikat ja
täyttää se. Meidän täytyi jättää Helen äitinsä tuomittavaksi. Hän oli
näet valehdellut.

Tohtori tutki häntä tarkasti muutaman silmänräpäyksen ajan ja näytti
etsivän johtolankaa jostain aivan käsittämättömästä; sitte huudahti
hän rajusti:

-- Vai lausui hän valheen? _Tekikö_ hän sen todellakin? Jumala
minua armahtakoon, mutta minä valehtelen miljoonia kertoja
päivässä, ja sen tekevät kaikki lääkärit. Ja sen tekevät muuten
kaikki ihmiset -- myöskin te. Ja _se_ siis oli se tärkeä seikka,
joka antoi teille oikeuden rikkoa minun määräyksiäni vastaan ja
saattaa Margaretan henki vaaranalaiseksi! Kuulkaa, Hester Gray,
se on sulaa mielettömyyttä; tuo tyttö ei voinut valehdella toisen
vahingoittamisen tarkotuksessa. Se on mahdotonta -- kerrassaan
mahdotonta. Sen tiedätte itsekin, te kumpikin, tiedätte vallan hyvin.

Hannah ryhtyi auttamaan sisartaan.

Hester ei tarkottanut, että se olisi ollut sellainen valhe, eikä se
sitä ollutkaan. Mutta valhe se oli kuitenkin joka tapauksessa.

-- Nooo, en koskaan, kunniani kautta, ole kuullut tuollaisia
tyhmyyksiä! Eikö teillä ole niin paljon järkeä päässänne, että voitte
erottaa valheen valheesta? Ettekö tunne erotusta sellaisen valheen
välillä, joka hyödyttää, ja sellaisen, joka vahingoittaa?

-- _Kaikki_ valheet ovat synnillisiä, sanoi Hannah ja puri huuliaan;
_kaikki_ valheet ovat kiellettyjä.

"Ainoa Kristitty" vääntelihe kärsimättömänä tuolissaan. Hän tahtoi
hyökätä tuota väitettä vastaan, mutta ei oikein tiennyt mistä
alottaisi. Viimein teki hän yrityksen:

-- Hester, ettekö lausuisi valhetta suojellaksenne jotain ihmistä
ansaitsematonta vääryyttä tahi häpeää vastaan?

-- En.

-- Ette edes ystäväänne?

-- En.

-- Ette edes rakkainta ystäväänne?

-- En. Sitä en tekisi.

Tohtori taisteli hetkisen ääneti tämän pulman kanssa, sitte kysyi hän:

-- Ettekö edes pelastaaksenne hänet katkerasta tuskasta, surusta ja
kurjuudesta?

-- En. En edes pelastaakseni hänen henkeänsä.

Taaskin vaitiolo. Sitte:

-- Tahi hänen sieluansa?

Taaskin tuli hiljaisuus -- hiljaisuus, joka kesti jotenkin kauvan --,
sitte toisti Hester matalalla, päättäväisellä äänellä:

-- Tahi hänen sieluansa.

Ei kukaan virkkanut mitään pieneen aikaan; sitte kysyi tohtori:

-- Niinkö tekin ajattelette, Hannah?

-- Niin, vastasi hän.

-- Minä kysyn teiltä molemmilta: minkävuoksi?

-- Senvuoksi, että on synti lausua sellaista valhetta ja _mitään_
valhetta, ja se voisi maksaa omien sielujemme autuuden -- niin, se
_tekisi_ sen, jos kuolisimme ehtimättä katua.

-- Kummallista... kummallista... se on vallan uskomatonta.

Sitte kysyi hän kopeasti:

-- _Kannattaako_ sellaista sielua pelastaa?

Hän nousi ylös, mutisi ja purisi ja harppaili pitkin askelin ovelle.
Kynnyksellä pyörähti ympäri ja huusi tuikealla äänellä:

-- Parantakaa itsenne! Jättäkää pikkumaiset ja jonninjoutavat
ja itsekkäät puuhanne kurjien pikkusielujenne pelastamiseksi ja
hankkikaa itsellenne jotain tekemistä, mikä on edes jonkin arvoista!
_Uhratkaa_ sielunne! Uhratkaa ne hyvän asian puolesta, ja mitä se
teille tekee, jos te ne kadotatte? Parantakaa itsenne!

Nuo vanhat kunnon naiset istuivat herpautuneina, murtuneina,
loukkaantuneina ja hautoivat harmiaan ja katkeruuttaan noiden
solvauksien johdosta. He olivat saaneet haavan sydämeensä, nuo vanhat
naisraukat, ja sanoivat, etteivät voi koskaan antaa noita loukkauksia
anteeksi.

-- Parantakaa itsenne!

He toistivat kerta kerran perästä noita sanoja vastenmielisesti.

-- Parantaa itsemme ja opetella valehtelemaan!

Aika hiipi eteenpäin ja jonkun ajan kuluessa tapahtui heidän
mielialassaan muutos. He olivat täyttäneet ihmisen ensimäisen
velvollisuuden -- ajatella omaa itseään, siksi kunnes se
ajattelemisen aihe oli loppuun kulunut; sitte kykenee ihminen
antautumaan pienempiin tehtäviin ja ajattelemaan muita ihmisiä. Se
antaa aina -- usein terveellisen -- uuden suunnan mielialoille.
Kummankin vanhan tantin ajatukset kääntyivät takaisin heidän
rakkaaseen sisarentyttäreensä ja siihen kauheaan tautiin, joka oli
hänet vallannut; he unohtivat tuossa tuokiossa ne kolahdukset,
joita heidän itserakkautensa oli saanut, ja heidän sydämissään
heräsi harras halu mennä auttamaan kärsivää ja vahvistamaan häntä
rakkaudellaan ja hoitamaan häntä ja työskentelemään heikoilla
käsillään parhaansa mukaan hänen puolestaan ja iloisina ja hempeinä
kuluttamaan vanhat ruumisraukkansa noissa mieluisissa kärsimyksissä,
jos vaan voisivat saada siihen luvan.

-- Ja sen me saamme! sanoi Hester kyynelten virratessa
pitkin poskipäitä. -- Ei ole olemassa meidän veroisiamme
sairaanhoitajattaria, sillä ei löydy ketään, joka voisi kestää tämän
sängyn vieressä, siksi kunnes hän menehtyisi ja kuolisi, ja sen me
tekisimme, sen Jumala tietää.

-- Amen, sanoi Hannah ja hymyili myöntävästi. Tohtori tuntee meidät
ja tietää, että emme enää ole tottelemattomia, eikä hän tule
kutsumaan ketään muita hoitajattaria. Sitä ei hän uskalla!

-- Eikö uskalla? sanoi Hester äreästi ja kuivasi kyyneleet
silmistään. -- Hän uskaltaa vaikka mitä tuo kristitty saatana! Mutta
minä en haluaisi neuvoa häntä osottamaan uskallustaan tällä kertaa.
No niin... kun kaikki käy ympäri, on hän kuin onkin lahjakas ja
viisas ja kiltti, eikä hänelle koskaan voisi, juolahtaa sellainen
ajatus päähän. Jommankumman meistä on varmaankin tähän aikaan
päivästä mentävä sairaan huoneeseen. Missä mahtaa lääkäri olla?
Miks'ei hän tule ja sano meille?

He kuulivat hänen lähestyväin askeltensa äänen. Hän tuli sisään,
istahti ja alkoi puhua.

-- Margaret on sairas, sanoi hän. Hän nukkuu vielä, mutta herää pian:
silloin täytyy toisen teistä mennä hänen luokseen.

Hän ensin huononee ennenkuin tulee paremmaksi. Meidän täytyy pian
järjestää yö- ja päivävartioiminen. Miten paljon voitte te ottaa
siitä osaksenne?

-- Kaikki tyyni! huudahtivat molemmat naiset yhtähaavaa.

Tohtorin silmissä välähti ja hän sanoi painavasti:

-- Te _olette_ todellakin juuri niitä oikeita, te vanhat
pyhäinjäännökset! Ja te _saatte_ tehdä niin paljon kuin voitte, sillä
ei löydy ketään tässä kaupungissa teidän vertaisianne sellaisissa
taivaallisissa laupeudentöissä, mutta te ette voi tehdä kaikkea ja
olisi rikos antaa teidän sitä tehdäkään.

Ne olivat suuria arvolauseita, kultaisia arvolauseita, kun ne tulivat
sellaisesta lähteestä, ja se tuullutti pois melkein kaiken harmin
noiden vanhojen kaksosten sydämistä.

-- Teidän Tillynne ja minun vanha Nancyni saavat huolehtia lopusta
-- ne ovat hyviä sairaanhoitajattaria molemmat, valkoisia sieluja
mustien naamarien takana, valppaita, rakastavaisia, helliä --
juuri sellaisia kuin sairaanhoitajattaren tulee olla! -- ja täysin
kokeneita valehtelijoita jo pikku lapsesta saakka. -- Kuulkaa
nyt, pitäkää tarkoin silmällä Heleneä; hän on sairas ja tulee yhä
sairaammaksi.

Tantit näyttivät hämmästyneiltä ja epäluuloisilta ja Hester sanoi:

-- Mitä se merkitsee? Tuskin on kulunut tuntia siitä kun te sanoitte,
että hän on terve kuin pähkinä:

Tohtori vastasi tyyneesti:

-- Minä valehtelin.

Naiset kääntyivät suuttuneina häneen päin ja Hannah sanoi:

-- Miten voitte tehdä noin inhottavan tunnustuksen niin
välinpitämättömällä äänellä, kun kerran tiedätte, mikä mielipide
meillä on kaikellaisista...

-- Vaiti! Te olette tyhmiä kuin kissat, te kumpikin, ettekä te tiedä
mitä puhutte. Te olette niinkuin kaikki muutkin siveydensokot:
te valehtelette aamusta iltaan, mutta syystä että te ette tee
sitä suullanne, vaan ainoastaan valheellisilla silmillänne,
valheellisella äänellänne, petollisesti väritetyllä äänenpainollanne
ja harhaanjohtavilla eleillänne, kulette te kopeina nokka pystyssä
ja pöyhkeilette Jumalan ja ihmisten edessä olevanne hurskaita,
tahrattomia totuudenpuhujia, joiden sielujen jääkellarissa valhe
paleltuisi kuoliaaksi, jos se sinne tulisi! Miksi petätte itsenne
tuolla tyhmällä väitteellänne, ettei ole olemassa muuta valhetta kuin
se mikä lausutaan? Mitä erotusta on siinä, jos valehdellaan silmillä
tahi suulla? Ei mitään; jos tahdotte ajatella silmänräpäyksen, niin
näette, että niin on asianlaita. Ei löydy ainoatakaan ihmisolentoa,
joka ei laskettelisi koko joukon valheita jok'ainoa päivä elämänsä
aikana; ja te -- niin, te sanotte niitä kolmekymmentä tuhatta;
ja kuitenkin joudutte te kalmankalpean, tekopyhän kauhun valtaan
senjohdosta, että minä sanon hyvää tarkottavan, vaarattoman valheen
lapselle suojellakseni häntä hänen mielikuvitukseltaan, joka voisi
kiihottaa hänen verensä kuumeeseen tunnin kuluessa, jos vaan olisin
niin välinpitämätön velvollisuudestani, että sallisin sen tapahtuvan.
Ja sen minä luultavasti tekisinkin, jos vaan ajattelisin oman sieluni
pelastamista niin epäkunniallisella keinolla.

Kas niin, puhelkaamme vaan. Menkäämme yksityisseikkoihin. Kun te
olitte tuolla sairaan huoneessa ja teitte sen tyhmyyden, niin mitä te
olisitte tehneet, jos olisitte tietäneet, että minä olin tulossa?

-- No?

-- Te olisitte luikkineet sieltä tiehenne ja vieneet Helenen
mukananne -- eikö niin?

Tantit olivat vaiti.

-- Miksi olisitte silloin hyörineet ja pyörineet?

-- No?

-- Estääksenne minua huomaamasta varomattomuuttanne, saattaaksenne
minut uskomaan, että Margaretan kiihottunut tila oli johtunut jostain
teille tuntemattomasta syystä. Suoraan sanoen: sanoaksenne minulle
valheen -- äänettömän valheen. Kenties vielä sellaisen, joka voisi
olla vahingollinen.

Kaksoset punastuivat, mutta eivät virkkaneet mitään.

-- Te ette sano ainoastaan lukemattomia äänettömiä valheita, vaan te
lausutte valheita suullannekin -- te kumpikin.

-- _Se_ ei ole totta!

-- Se on totta. Mutta ainoastaan vaarattomia valheita. Te ette
ajattelekaan lausua vahingollisia valheita. Tiedättekö, että se on jo
myönnytys -- ja tunnustus?

-- Mitä tarkotatte?

-- Se on tietämättään myöntämistä, että vaarattomat valheet eivät
ole rikoksellisia; se on tunnustamista, että te aina _teette_ tuon
erotuksen. Esimerkiksi viime viikolla hylkäsitte te vanhan rouva
Fosterin tarjouksen tulla syömään päivällistä tuon sietämättömän
Higbiesin kanssa -- kohteliaalla kortilla, jossa te lausuitte
valittavanne ja sanoitte olevanne hyvin pahoillanne sen vuoksi, että
ette voineet saapua. Se oli valhe. Ei koskaan ole sen selvempää
valhetta lausuttu. Kieltäkää sekin, Hester, niin lausutte uuden
valheen.

Hester vastasi pudistamalla päätänsä.

-- Se ei riitä. Vastatkaa! Oliko se valhe vai ei?

Puna levisi kummankin naisen kasvoille ja lyhyen sisällisen taistelun
jälkeen saivat he vaivoin tehdyksi synnintunnustuksensa:

-- Se oli valhe.

-- Hyvä, parannus alkaa; vielä voi teistä toivoa jotakin; te ette
tahdo valehdella pelastaaksenne rakkaimman ystävänne sielun, mutta te
laskette kursailemattoman valheen säästääksenne itseänne sanomasta
epämieluista totuutta.

Hän nousi ylös. Hester sanoi molempien puolesta kylmästi:

-- Me olemme valehdelleet, sen me näemme; mutta se ei saa enää
koskaan tapahtua.

Valehteleminen on synti. Me emme enää koskaan lausu minkäänlaista
valhetta, emme edes kohteliaita tahi hyvää tarkoittavia valheita
kenenkään surujen vuoksi, joita Jumala on hänen osakseen antanut.

-- Oi, miten pian te tulettekaan lankeamaan, sillä se mitä nyt juuri
sanoitte on valhe. Hyvästi! Parantakaa itsenne! Nyt on toisen teistä
mentävä sairaan huoneeseen.


IV.

Kaksitoista päivää perästäpäin.

Kauhea tauti piti vielä äitiä ja tytärtä kahleissaan. Kovin vähän
oli kummastakaan toivoa. Vanhat sisarukset näyttivät kalpeilta ja
kuluneilta, mutta eivät tahtoneet jättää paikkaansa. Heidän sydämensä
oli pakahtumaisillaan, noiden raukkojen olentojen, mutta he olivat
kestäviä ja voittamattomia. Kunakin näinä kahtenatoista päivänä oli
äiti kaivannut lastaan ja lapsi äitiään, mutta kumpikin tiesi, että
heidän kaihoisat rukouksensa eivät auttaneet. Kun äidille sanottiin
-- ensimäisenä päivänä -- että hänen tautinsa oli pilkkukuumetta,
säikähti hän ja kysyi, tarvitsiko pelätä sitä, että Helen olisi
saanut tartunnan edellisenä päivänä ollessaan sairaan huoneessa
tunnustamassa. Hester sanoi hänelle, että tohtori oli moiselle
ajatukselle ylenkatseellisesti murahtanut. Hester hämmentyi sen
sanottuaan, vaikka se olikin totta, sillä hän ei uskonut lääkäriä;
mutta kun hän näki äidin ihastuvan vastauksesta, väheni hänen
omantunnonvaivansa -- seikka, mikä saattoi hänet häpeämään tuota
epäsuoraa petosta, johon hän oli tehnyt itsensä syypääksi, mutta
ei hävennyt niin paljon, että olisi katunut. Tästä hetkestä alkaen
tajusi sairas, että hänen täytyi olla tyttärestään erillään, ja
sanoi tahtovansa tyytyä tuohon eroon niin hyvin kuin voi, sillä hän
tahtoi mieluummin kuolla, kuin saattaa lapsensa terveyden vaaroille
alttiiksi. Saman päivän iltana sairastui Helen ja täytyi alistua
vuoteenomaksi. Hänen tilansa tuli pahemmaksi yöllä. Aamulla kysyi
äiti hänestä:

-- Onko hän vilkas?

Hester oli kylmä kuin jää; hän avasi suunsa, mutta ei saanut
sanotuksi sanaakaan. Äiti virui vuoteellaan ja katseli häntä
miettien, uinaillen, odottaen; yhtäkkiä kalpeni hän ja huohotti:

-- Oi, Jumalani, mitä se on? Onko hän sairas?

Tanttiparan sydänraiska kivettyi ja hän sanoi:

-- Ei, ole huoletta; hän on terve.

Sairas nainen huudahti kiitollisena koko sydämestään:

-- Kiitos, Jumala, noista kallisarvoisista sanoista! Suutele minua.
Minä pyydän senvuoksi että sanoit nuo sanat!

Hester kertoi tämän tapauksen Hannahille, joka kuunteli sitä
tuikeasti katsellen ja sanoi kylmästi:

-- Sisko, se oli valhe.

Hesterin huulet venähtelivät; hän sanoi nyyhkyttäen:

-- Oi, Hannah, se oli synti, mutta minä en voinut toisin tehdä; minä
en voinut nähdä kauhun ja onnettomuuden ilmettä hänen kasvoillaan.

-- Se on samantekevä. Se oli valhe. Jumala on rankaiseva sinua siitä.

-- Kyllä, sen minä tiedän, huudahti Hester ja väänteli käsiään,
-- mutta jos taaskin olisin samassa asemassa, en voisi menetellä
toisin... tiedän, että valehtelisin uudestaan.

-- Ole minun sijastani Helenen luona aamupäivällä. Minä sanon itse
hänen äidilleen, miten asiat oikeastaan ovat.

Hester syleili sisartaan, pyysi ja rukoili:

-- Älä tee sitä, Hannah, oi älä tee sitä -- sinä surmaat hänet.

-- Minä puhun kumminkin totta.

Tieto, joka hänen oli annettava äidille aamupäivällä, oli julma,
ja hän rohkaisi itseään tähän kokeeseen. Kun hän palasi takaisin,
odotteli Hester eteisessä kalpeana ja vavisten. Hän kuiskasi:

-- Oi kuule, miten otti toivoton äitiparka vastaan sen sanoman?

Hannah purskahti itkuun. Hän sanoi:

-- Jumala antakoon minulle anteeksi, minä sanoin hänelle, että tyttö
on terve!

Hester sulki hänet syliinsä huudahtaen kiitollisena: Jumala
siunatkoon sinua, Hannah! ja purki tunteensa lukemattomiin
ylistyssanoihin.

Nyt tunsivat he molemmat voimainsa rajan ja alistuivat kohtaloonsa.
He luopuivat nöyrästi taistelusta ja mukautuivat hetken vaatimuksiin.
He lausuivat joka päivä aamuvalheensa ja tunnustivat syntinsä
rukoillen; he eivät anoneet anteeksi, sillä he eivät olleet sen
arvoisia, mutta he tahtoivat vaan osottaa tuntevansa huonoutensa
eivätkä tahtoneet sitä puolustella tahi salata.

Joka päivä, sill'aikaa kun talon kaunis, nuori epäjumala vaipui yhä
syvemmälle ja syvemmälle, kuvailivat murheelliset vanhat tantit
Helenen hehkuvaa kukoistusta ja hänen nuorekasta kauneuttaan
kalpealle äidille ja kärsivät niistä tuskista, joita äidin hurmaava
ilo ja kiitollisuus heille tuotti.

Ensi päivinä, jolloin tyttönen vielä jaksoi pitää kynää kädessään,
kirjotteli hän äidilleen pieniä, helliä rakkaudenkirjeitä, mutta ei
maininnut niissä sairaudestaan, ja äiti luki ne kerta kerran perästä,
onnelliset silmänsä kiitollisia kyyneleitä tulvillaan. Hän suuteli
niitä ja kätki ne tyynynsä alle kuin kalliit aarteet.

Tuli kuitenkin kerran päivä, jolloin kädestä oli kadonnut voima,
jolloin aivot eivät tehneet tehtäväänsä ja jolloin kieli sammalsi
käsittämättömiä sanoja. Se oli vaikea pulma tanttiraukoille. Ei
ollut enää äidille vietäviä rakkaudenkirjeitä. He eivät tienneet
mitä tekisivät. Hester alotti hyvin harkitun ja uskottavan
selityksensä, mutta unohti jotain ja hämmentyi; äidin kasvoilla alkoi
ensin leijailla epäluulo, sitte levottomuus. Hester huomasi sen,
tajusi uhkaavan vaaran, alistui välttämättömyyden pakkoon, kokosi
päättävästi kaikki voimansa ja tempasi voiton tappion avonaisesta
kidasta. Hän sanoi tyynesti ja vakuuttavasti:

-- Luulin sinun tulevan pahoillesi kuullessasi sen, mutta Helen on
ollut yötä Sloanen herraskartanossa. Siellä oli kutsut ja vaikkei
hän halunnutkaan sinne mennä ja vaikka sinä olit sairas, kehotimme
me häntä; onhan hän niin nuori ja tarvitsee viatonta huvia, ja me
luulimme, että sinäkin sen hyväksyisit. Hän kirjottaa tietysti niin
pian kuin tulee takaisin.

-- Te olette niin kilttejä, niin rakastettavia meitä kohtaan ja
huolehditte meistä niin hyvin! Ettäkö hyväksyisin? Voi, minä kiitän
sinua kaikesta sydämestäni. Rakas pikku vankirukkani! Sano hänelle,
että minä tahdon hänen huvittelevan niin paljon kuin hän tahtoo --
en tahtoisi kieltää häneltä vähintäkään siitä. Hänen tulee vaan olla
terve, siinä kaikki mitä pyydän. Hänellä ei saa olla mitään vaivoja,
sitä en minä jaksaisi kestää. Voi miten kiitollinen minä olen että
hän säilyi tartunnalta -- ja vaarahan oli niin uhkaava, täti Hester!
Ajatteles niitä rakastettavia kasvoja raukeina ja kuumeen polttamina!
En voi sietää sellaista ajatustakaan. Suojelkaa hänen terveyttään!
Suojelkaa hänen kukkeuttaan! Minusta tuntuu kuin näkisin hänet nyt,
sen hennon olentoni, ja hänen suuret, siniset, vakavat silmänsä...
niin herttaiset, oi, niin herttaiset ja lempeät ja ihastuttavat! Onko
hän yhtä kaunis kuin ennenkin, rakas täti Hester?

-- Oi, kauniimpi ja säteilevämpi ja ihastuttavampi kuin koskaan
ennen, jos sitä voi ajatella -- ja Hester kääntyi poispäin ja
puuhaili lääkepullojen kanssa salatakseen häpeäänsä ja tuskaansa.


V.

Hetken perästä puuhailivat tantit mitä vaikeimmassa ja
merkillisimmässä tehtävässä Helenen kamarissa. Kärsivällisesti ja
vakavasti koettivat he kankeilla sormillaan väärentää vaadittua
korttia. Heidän yrityksensä meni myttyyn kerta toisensa perästä,
mutta joka kerta sujui työ kuitenkin vähän paremmin kuin edellisellä.
Ei kukaan nähnyt, miten sydäntä-vihlovan, miten tuskallisen
humorillista koko tuo homma oli, itse eivät he sitä ymmärtäneet.
Usein tipahteli heidän kyyneleitään kirjeelle ja ne turmelivat
sen; väliin teki yksi ainoa väärin muovaeltu sana kirjeen liian
uskalletuksi, vaikka sitä jossain muussa tapauksessa olisi voinutkin
koettaa; mutta viimein sai Hannah valmiiksi yhden, jonka käsiala
oli niin Helenen käsialan näköistä, ettei ennakkoluuloton silmä
väärennystä huomaisi, ja se oli hyvin höystetty niillä lempilauseilla
ja hyväilynimityksillä, joita lapsi aina tavallisesti oli käyttänyt.
Hannah vei sen äidille, joka otti sen vastaan innostuneena, suuteli
ja hyväili sitä ja luki sen moneen kertaan ja viipyi tyytyväisenä
varsinkin viime sanoissa:

"Rakas mammaseni, jospa vaan voisin saada sinua nähdä ja suudella
sinun silmiäsi ja tuntea käsivartesi ympärilläni! Olen kovin iloinen
siitä ettei soittoharjoitukseni sinua häiritse. Tule pian terveeksi!
Kaikki ovat kilttejä minua kohtaan, mutta minä tunnen olevani kovin
yksin ilman sinua, rakas äiti."

-- Lapsirukka, minä tiedän ihan tarkalleen miltä hänestä tuntuu. Hän
ei voi viihtyä oikein hyvin ilman minua, ja minä -- oi, minä elän
hänen silmiensä loistossa! Sano hänelle että hän saa soittaa pianoa
niin paljon kuin haluaa, ja -- täti Hannah, sano hänelle, etten minä
voi kuulla pianonsoittoa niin kaukaa, en edes hänen armasta ääntään,
kun hän laulaa; jospa Jumala soisi, että voisin. Ei kukaan tiedä,
miten suloinen se ääni on minusta, ja ajattele, että senkin täytyy
kerran vaieta! Mitä sinä itket?

-- Senvuoksi vaan, että -- senvuoksi että se oli vaan muuan muisto.
Kun juuri läksin hänen luotaan, lauloi hän parast'aikaa "Loch
Lomond'ia." Se on niin surullinen. Minua aina niin kovin liikuttaa,
kun hän sitä laulaa.

-- Niin minuakin. On niin liikuttavan kaunista, kun jokin lapsellinen
suru liikkuu hänen rinnassaan ja hän laulaa sen laulun. -- Täti
Hannah.

-- No, rakas Margaret?

-- Minä olen hyvin sairas. Väliin tuntuu minusta siltä, etten enää
koskaan saisi kuulla sitä armasta ääntä.

-- Voi, älä sano niin, Margaret! Minä en voi sitä kestää!

Margaret oli liikutettu ja levoton ja sanoi lempeästi:

-- Vai niin -- vai niin -- anna panen käteni kaulaasi. Älä itke! Kas
niin -- paina poskesi minun poskeeni. Ole levollinen. Minä tahdon
elää. Minä tahdon elää, jos voin. Oi, mitä tekisikään hän ilman
minua! Puhuuko hän usein minusta? Mutta minähän tiedän, että hän
tekee niin.

-- Voi, koko ajan -- koko ajan!

-- Suloinen lapseni! Kirjottiko hän kirjeen heti kun oli tullut
kotiin?

-- Kirjotti -- ihan ensi silmänräpäyksessä. Hänellä ei ollut aikaa
riisua edes päällysvaatteita yltään.

-- Sen tiesin kyllä. Hän on niin kiihkeä ja raju hellyydessään.
Minä tiesin sen jo ennenkuin kysyin, mutta tahdoin kuulla sen sinun
suustasi. Hemmoteltu vaimo tietää kyllä, että häntä rakastetaan,
mutta hän tahtoo, että miehensä sanoo sen hänelle joka päivä, sillä
hänelle on hupaista sitä kuulla. Tällä kertaa on hän kirjoittanut
musteella; se mitä hän kirjoittaa lyijykynällä voisi kulua pois ja
minulle tulisi paha mieli. Ehdotitko sinä, että hän kirjottaisi
musteella?

-- E... een... hän... se oli hänen oma keksintönsä!

Äiti näytti erinomaisen onnelliselta ja sanoi:

-- Minä toivoin, että sinä sanoisitkin noin. Ei ole olemassa
rakastettavampaa ja armaampaa lasta. -- Täti Hannah?

-- No?

-- Mene sanomaan hänelle, että minä häntä alinomaa ajattelen ja
ihailen. Kas niin, nyt itket taaskin. Älä ole niin levoton minun
vuokseni, rakas täti; en luule olevan vielä mitään vaaraa.

Epätoivoinen sanansaattajatar poistui hyvästinsä lausuen ja vei
tervehdyksen perille, mutta niiden saaja ei sitä tajunnut. Tyttö
puheli yhä edelleenkin houreissaan; hän katseli tanttia kummastunein,
kuumeesta hehkuvin silmin, joita tuskin enää olisi tuntenut hänen
omikseen...

-- Onko se... ei, ei se olekaan äiti. Tahdon, että hän tulee tänne?
Hän oli täällä juuri ihan äsken -- en huomannut, milloin hän meni
pois. Tuleeko hän takaisin? Tuleeko hän pian? Tuleeko hän juuri nyt?
On niin monta taloa... ja ne tukeuttavat minut... ja kaikki hyörii ja
pyörii ihan ympäri... Voi päätäni, päätäni!

Ja niin houraili hän yhä edelleen tuskissaan, joutui yhä
tuskallisemmasta mielikuvasta toiseen ja huitoi käsillään väsyttävän
levottomuuden valtaamana.

Vanha Hannahparka kostutti hänen kuivia huuliaan ja hiveli varovasti
hänen poltteista otsaansa, mutisi helliä ja sääliviä sanoja ja kiitti
kaikkien Isää siitä, että äiti oli onnellinen eikä tiennyt mitään.


VI.

Päivä päivältä vaipui lapsi yhä lähemmäs hautaa ja joka päivä veivät
surevat vanhat hoitajattaret kultaisia kuulumisia hänen säteilevästä
terveydestään ja rakastettavuudestaan onnelliselle äidille, jonka
elämä lähestyi myöskin loppuaan. Ja joka päivä väärensivät he
rakkautta uhkuvia ja iloisia kirjeitä, lapsen käsialan näköisiä,
ja heitä kalvoivat heidän omattuntonsa ja sydämensä vuosivat verta
ja he itkivät nähdessään kiitollisen äidin ahmimalla lukevan noita
kirjeitä, niitä ihailevan ja kätkevän ne kuin parhaimmat aarteet,
pyhimmät kalleudet, sillä lapsensa käsi oli niitä koskettanut.

Viimeinkin tuli se avulias ystävä, joka antaa levon ja rauhan.
Kynttilät olivat sammumaisillaan. Juhlallisen hiljaisuuden vallitessa
vähä ennen päivänsarastusta hiipi himmeitä olentoja äänettöminä
salin halki, saapui Helenen huoneeseen ja ryhmittyi hänen sänkynsä
ympärille, sillä tuomio oli langennut ja he tiesivät... Kuoleva
tyttö makasi silmät ummessa ja tajuttomana; peite nousi ja laski
verkkaan hänen rintansa päällä, aivan kuin hänen henkensä olisi
häipymäisillään. Silloin tällöin katkesi hiljaisuuden huokaus tai
vieno nyyhkytys. Kaikki ajattelivat samaa: miten surullista olikaan,
että hänen oli kuoltava noin, astuttava äärettömään pimeyteen ilman
että äitinsä oli auttamassa, vahvistamassa, siunaustaan antamassa.

Helen liikahti; hänen kätensä hapuilivat ikäänkuin jotain etsiäkseen
-- moneen tuntiin ei hän ollut enää mitään nähnyt. Loppu oli tullut;
kaikki sen tiesivät. Rajusti nyyhkyttäen painoi Hester hänet
rintaansa vasten ja huudahti:

-- Voi lapseni rakkaani!

Ylenluonnollinen kajastus levisi kuolevan lapsen kasvoille, sillä
hän otaksui tuon syleilyn tulevan toiselta taholta, ja hän rauhottui
kuiskaten:

-- Oi, äiti, minä olen niin onnellinen... kaipasin sinua niin
kauvan... nyt voin kuolla.

-- --

Kahden tunnin perästä vei Hester tervehdyksensä. Äiti kysyi: -- Miten
voi tyttöni?

-- Hän voi hyvin.


VII.

Valkosesta silkistä laitettu rusetti ja suruharsoja kiinnitettiin
talon portille, missä tuuli niitä heilutteli ja mistä ne veivät
viestejä sattuneesta surusta. Päivällisaikaan loppuivat valmistukset
ja arkussaan makasi hempeä nuori olento. Hänen kasvoilleen oli
levinnyt hiljainen rauha. Kaksi surevaista seisoi arkun vieressä
suruun ja hartaudenharjotuksiin vaipuneina -- ne olivat Hannah ja
musta Tilly. Hester tuli ja värisi, sillä hän oli ankaran liikutuksen
vallassa. Hän sanoi:

-- Margaret haluaa kirjettä.

Hannah kalpeni. Hän ei ollut sitä ajatellut; hän oli luullut, että
se kamala työ olisi jo lopussa. Mutta nyt hän ymmärsi, ettei niin
voinutkaan olla. Hetkisen seisoivat naiset ja katselivat toisiaan;
sitte sanoi Hannah:

-- Sitä ei voi auttaa... hänen täytyy se saada; muuten hän epäilee.

-- Ja muuten hän arvaisi.

-- Kyllä. Hänen sydämensä pakahtuisi.

Hän katseli kuolleen kasvoja ja silmänsä vettyivät.

-- Minä kirjotan sen, sanoi hän.

Hester vei sen perille. Loppusanat kuuluivat:

"Rakas mammaseni, kallis armas äitini, me saamme taas pian olla
yhdessä. Eikö se ole hauska uutinen? Ja se on tosi; kaikki sanovat,
että se on tosi."

Äiti sanoi surumielisesti:

-- Lapsiparka, miten kestää hän sen saatuaan tietää totuuden? Minä
en enää koskaan saa nähdä häntä tässä elämässä. Se tuntuu niin
raskaalta. Ei kai hän sitä epäile? Te kai pidätte huolen siitä ettei
hän saa sitä tietää?

-- Helen luulee, että sinä tulet pian terveeksi.

-- Voi miten sinä olet hyvä ja älykäs, rakas täti Hester! Ei suinkaan
kukaan, joka voisi tuoda tartunnan, tule hänen lähistölleen?

-- Sehän olisi rikos.

-- Mutta tehän _näette_ hänet?

-- Kyllä -- matkan päästä.

-- Se on hyvä. Toisiin en voisi luottaa, mutta te kaksi
suojelusenkeliä... te olette luotettavia kuin kulta. Toiset voisivat
olla epärehellisiä ja monet voisivat salata minulta jotain ja
valehdella.

Hester loi katseensa alas ja hänen vanhat huulensa vapisivat.

-- Salli että suutelen sinua hänen sijastaan, täti Hester; ja
sittekun minä olen poissa ja vaara on ohi, voit painaa sen suutelon
hänen rakkaille huulilleen ja sanoa, että se on hänen äidiltään ja
että se on hänen äitinsä koko murtunut sydän.

Tunnin kuluttua täytti Hester tuon pyynnön ja hänen kyyneleensä
valuivat virtanaan kuolleen kasvoille.


VIII.

Uusi päivä sarasti ja valkeni ja levitti säteitään yli maan. Täti
Hannah toi rauhottavia tietoja menehtyneelle äidille ja hauskan
kortin, jossa taaskin oli: "Tarvitsemme vaan vähän aikaa odottaa,
rakas äiti, sitte saamme taas olla yhdessä."

Tuuli toi mukanaan syviä, valittavia kirkonkellon ääniä.

-- Ne soittavat kelloja, täti Hannah. Jokin sieluparka on päässyt
rauhaan. Aivan niinkuin minäkin pian pääsen. Ette suinkaan salli että
Helen milloinkaan minut unohtaa?

-- Emme, Jumala tietää, ettei hän koskaan sitä tee!

-- Etkö kuule kummallista melua, täti Hannah? Tuntuu siltä kuin
kuuluisi monien askelten ääniä.

-- Me toivoimme, ettet sinä sitä kuulisi, rakas Margaret. Olemme
kutsuneet tänne muutamia vieraita... Helenen vuoksi, sen pikku
vankiraukan. Saamme pian musiikkiakin -- ja siitä pitää hän
sanomattoman paljon. Me arvelimme, ettei sinulla olisi ollut mitään
sitä vastaan.

-- Minullako vastaan --? Oi, ei, ei... sallikaa hänelle kaikki mitä
sydämensä haluaa. Te olette kovin kilttejä häntä kohtaan ja myöskin
minua kohtaan. Jumala siunatkoon teitä molempia aina!

Hetkisen perästä, vähän kuunneltuaan, lausui hän:

-- Niin kaunista! Se on hänen harmoonionsa. Luuletteko, että hän
soittaa itse?

Heikkoina, mutta rikkaina ja ylentävinä tulivat akordit hänen
korviinsa hiljaisen ilman halki.

-- Oi, se on rakkaani soittoa, minä tunnen sen. Ne laulavat.
Oi -- sehän on virttä! Ja kaikkein hurskainta, liikuttavinta,
lohduttavinta... Tuntuu kuin paratiisin portit avautuisivat
minulle... Jospa voisin kuolla juuri nyt...

Heikkoina ja kaukaisina kuuluivat virren sanat hiljaisuudesta:

    Lähemmäksi, Jumalani,
    Lähemmäksi sua,
    Vaikka ois se ristinpuu,
    Joka nostais mua...

Kun virsi oli loppunut, pääsi vielä yksi sielu lepoon, ja he, jotka
eläessään olivat erillään, yhtyivät kuollessaan. Sisarukset sanoivat
surren ja iloiten:

-- Oli suuri siunaus, ettei hän milloinkaan saanut sitä tietää.


IX.

Keskiyön aikaan istuivat he yhdessä surren ja Herran enkeli ilmestyi
heille yliluonnollisen hehkuvassa heijastuksessa ja puhui:

-- Valehtelijoille on varattu paikka. Ne palavat helvetin tulessa
ijankaikkisesta ijankaikkiseen. Parantakaa itsenne!

Surevaiset lankesivat polvilleen hänen eteensä ja vääntelivät käsiään
ja kumarsivat alas harmaat päänsä kunnioittaakseen häntä. Mutta
heidän kielensä oli tarttunut kiinni heidän kitalakeensa ja he olivat
mykkiä.

-- Puhukaa! Että voisin viedä sananne taivaan tuomioistuimen eteen ja
tuoda sitte kuultavaksenne tuomion, jota ei voida peruuttaa.

Silloin painoivat he alas päänsä ja toinen heistä sanoi:

-- Meidän syntimme on suuri ja me näännymme häpeästä, mutta
ainoastaan täydellinen ja rajaton katumus voi meidät puhdistaa. Me
olemme ihmisraukkoja, jotka olemme oppineet tuntemaan inhimillisen
heikkoutemme, ja me tiedämme, että jos vielä kerran joutuisimme
tuohon vaikeaan asemaan niin sydämemme taaskin pettäisi ja me
tekisimme syntiä niinkuin ennenkin. Vahvat voisivat kyllä voittaa ja
tulla pelastetuiksi, mutta me olemme hukassa.

He nostivat rukoillen päänsä. Enkeli oli poissa. Heidän
ihmetellessään ja itkiessään tuli hän takaisin, kumartui vähän ja
kuiskasi tuomion heidän korvaansa.


X.

Oliko se taivas? Vaiko helvetti?




KULLANKAIVAJA KERTOO


Kolmekymmentäviisi vuotta sitte olin etsimässä kultaa Stanislaus
piirikunnassa. Kiertelin ylt'ympäri kuokka ja huuhdinastia kädessäni,
huuhdoin siellä ja täällä vähän malmirautaa ja odotin alati löytäväni
kelpo aarteen, mutta en koskaan onnistunut. Se oli kaunista seutua,
tuoksuavaa, metsäistä, ihanaa, ja oli aikoinaan ollut tiheästi
asuttuakin, mutta nyt olivat ihmiset kadonneet ja tuo ihana paratiisi
oli erämaana. Ne olivat menneet matkoihinsa, kun malmikerrokset
olivat pinnalta loppuneet. Muutamassa paikassa, jossa ennen oli
ollut pieni, vilkas kaupunki pankkeineen ja sanomalehtineen,
palovakuutusyhtiöineen ja pormestareilleen ja raatimiehineen,
oli nyt ainoastaan laaja, smaragdinvihreä ruohokenttä, jossa ei
näkynyt pienintäkään merkkiä siitä, että siellä koskaan olisi ollut
ihmiselämää. Se oli Tulltetowiin päin. Ympäristöllä, tomuisten teiden
varsilla näkyi siellä täällä mitä sievimpiä pikku huviloita, komeita
ja kodikkaita ja niin köynnöskasvien ja valkoruusujen peitossa,
ettei ovia eikä akkunoita voinut ollenkaan erottaa -- siitä huomasi
niiden olevan hylättyjä koteja, jotka jo vuosia sitte oli jätetty
oman onnensa nojaan. Sen olivat tehneet perheet, joilla oli ollut
ainoastaan vastoinkäymisiä ja pettymyksiä ja jotka eivät voineet
niitä myydä tahi edes lahjottaakaan. Siellä täällä, noin puolen
tunnin matkan päässä toisistaan, tapasi yksinäisiä puuhökkeleitä
kullanetsinnän ensimäisiltä ajoilta. Ne olivat kullankaivajain,
huvila-asukasten edeltäjäin, rakentamia. Hyvin harvoin tapasi noissa
hökkeleissä asukkaita, ja jos niin sattui, niin voi olla aivan
varma siitä, että hökkelin omisti sama kullankaivaja, joka oli sen
aikoinaan rakentanut; ja varma sai olla eräästä toisestakin asiasta
-- nimittäin siitä, että hän kerran oli ollut rikas ja tilaisuudessa
matkustamaan synnyinseuduilleen, mutta ei ollut sitä tehnyt;
myöhemmin oli hän hävittänyt omaisuutensa ja silloin harmissaan
päättänyt katkasta kaiken yhteyden omaistensa ja ystäväinsä kanssa
ja olla siitälähin heille niinkuin kuollut. Yli koko Kalifornian oli
siihen aikaan tuollaisia "eläviä kuolleita" koko liuta siroteltu --
vanhoja raukkoja, harmaahapsisia, jo nelikymmenvuotiaita, joiden
ajatuksena oli pelkkä katumus ja kaipuu -- katumus hukkaan menneestä
elämästä ja kaipaus päästä taistelusta rauhaan ja saada kaikesta
surkeudesta loppu.

Se oli autio maa! Ei ääntäkään noilla ruoho- ja metsätasangoilla,
ainoastaan hyönteisten nukuttavaa surinaa; ei ihmisen eikä eläimen
varjoakaan; ei mitään, joka voisi vilkastuttaa ja tehdä elämän
iloiseksi. Kun senvuoksi lopultakin eräänä iltapäivänä sain nähdä
ihmisolennon, tunsin melkein kiitollisuutta rinnassani. Hän oli
noin neljänkymmenenviiden ikäinen mies ja hän seisoskeli tuollaisen
pienen, hauskan, ruusujen kaunistaman maalaistalon ympärillä, joista
juuri olen puhunut. Mutta tämä talo ei näyttänyt hylätyltä; se näytti
olevan asuttu ja hyvin hoidettu, samoinkuin talon edustalla oleva
kenttäkin, joka oli laitettu puutarhaksi täynnänsä reheviä, hauskoja,
lemuavia kukkia. Minua tietysti pyydettiin käymään sisään ja olemaan
kuin kotonani -- se oli sen seudun tapa.

Oli hupaista saapua sellaiseen paikkaan viruttuaan yöt päivät
kullankaivajain hökkeleissä -- likaisella lattialla, ilman sänkyjä,
lautasia, tinapikareita, läskiä ja papuja ja mustaa kahvia ja ilman
mitään muita koristeita kuin mitä sanomalehdistä leikatut, seinille
naulatut itämaiden sotakuvat tarjosivat. Siellä oli kaikki jäykkää,
ilotonta, onnettoman autiota, mutta tämä oli paikka, jossa näytti
voivan lepuuttaa väsynyttä silmää ja virkistyttää sitä edes luonnon
näkemisellä. Kun pitkän paastoamisen jälkeen tulee taideteoksen
eteen, vaikkapa halvan ja vaatimattomankin, niin huomaa, että silmä
on nähnyt nälkää ja nyt on saanut ravintonsa. En koskaan olisi
voinut luulla, että rasumatto tuntui minusta niin ylelliseltä tahi
että olisin tuntenut sellaista sielunrauhaa katsellessani tapetteja
ja kehyksisiä kivipiirroksia ja lamppumattoja ja windsorintuoleja
ja vernissoituja hyllyjä kirjoineen, vaaseineen ja näkinkenkineen,
noita lukemattomia naiskäden järjestelyn jälkiä, joita katselee
tietämättään, mutta joita heti kaipaisi, ellei niitä olisi. Se
ihastus, jota sydämessäni tunsin, näkyi myös kasvoillani, mies
huomasi sen ja oli tyytyväinen, hän näki sen niin selvästi, että
vastasi ikäänkuin tehtyyn kysymykseen:

-- Kaikki on hänen työtään, sanoi hän. mielihyvällä, hän järjesteli
kaikki itse, jok'ainoan esineen.

Mies katseli ihastuksella ympäri huonetta. Muuan sellainen
pehmeä, japanilainen vaate, jolla naiset huolellisesti koristavat
taulunkehysten yläosan, oli joutunut epäkuntoon. Hän huomasi sen ja
korjasi varovasti ja astui sitte pari askelta takaperin katsellakseen
ennenkuin uskoi sen olevan paikallaan. Lopuksi taputti hän sitä pari
kertaa kädellään ja sanoi:

-- Hän tekee aina näin. Ei voi ihan tarkalleen sanoa, mutta jotain
puuttuu siksi kunnes se on tehty -- sen voi nähdä sitte itse, kun se
on laitettu, mutta se onkin kaikki mitä siitä tietää; siinä ei ole
mitään varsinaista sääntöä. Se muistuttaa vähän niitä kahta pientä
suuteloa, joita äiti painaa lapsensa hiuksille, sitte kun on ne
kammannut ja puhdistanut. Minä olen niin monta kertaa nähnyt hänen
järjestelevän näitä esineitä, että voin sen tehdä aivan niinkuin
hänkin, vaikken tiedäkään siihen mitään sääntöä. Mutta hän tietää
säännöt. Hän tietää minkätähden ja millä tavalla, mutta minä en tiedä
minkätähden, tiedän ainoastaan millä tavalla.

Hän vei minut sänkykamariin saadakseni pestä käteni, sellaiseen
sänkykamariin, jollaista en ollut nähnyt vuosikausiin: valkoset
peitteet, valkoset tyynyt, matot lattialla, tapetit seinillä,
tauluja, toalettipöytä peileineen ja neulatyynyineen, nurkassa
pesuastia vateineen ja kiinalaisine posliinikannuineen, saippuata
posliinikupissa ja naulassa yli tusinan pyyhinliinoja -- liian
puhtaita ja valkosia sille, joka ei ollut tottunut niitä käyttämään
tuntematta loukkaavansa jotain. Minun katseeni puhui taas ja hän
vastasi tyytyväisenä:

-- Kaikki hänen käsialaansa, hän on tehnyt kaikki itse -- joka
esineen. Täällä ei ole mitään, jota hän ei olisi koskettanut
kädellään. Te kenties luulette -- mutta minä en sano niin paljon.

Minä kuivailin nyt käsiäni ja katselin kaikkia huoneessa olevia
esineitä, niinkuin aina tavallisesti tehdään sellaiseen paikkaan
saavuttua, missä kaikki hivelee silmää ja mieltä; ja minä tiesin --
kuinka, enkö voisi sitä sanoa -- että siellä oli jotain, jota mies
halusi minun itseni huomaavan. Minä tiesin sen hyvin ja tiesin myös,
että hän koetti salaisilla viittauksilla ja silmäyksillä auttaa
minua pääsemään jälille, niin että minä oikein ponnistelin osuakseni
oikeaan, sillä minä halusin tehdä hänen mielikseen. Minä epäonnistuin
useamman kerran, sen huomasin hänen kierosta katseestaan, vaikkei
kukaan minulle sitä sanonut, mutta lopulta tiesin katselevani oikeata
esinettä -- tiesin sen siitä ihastuksesta, minkä tuo katselemiseni
häneen vaikutti. Hän purskahti sydämelliseen nauruun, hieroi käsiään
ja huudahti:

-- Aivan oikein! Te löysitte sen. Minä tiesin, että te sen
löytäisitte. Se on hänen kuvansa.

Minä menin pienen saksanpähkinäisen konsoolin luo, joka oli
takaseinällä, ja silloin löysin jotain, jota en tähän saakka
ollut huomannut -- kehyksisen valokuvan. Ne olivat suloisimmat ja
luullakseni kauneimmat tytönkasvot, joita koskaan olin nähnyt. Mies
nautti minun ihastuneesta katseestani ja oli täysin tyytyväinen.

-- Yhdeksäntoistavuotias viimeisenä syntymäpäivänään, sanoi hän
pannen kuvan paikoilleen, -- ja juuri sinä päivänä menimme me
naimisiin. Kun saatte hänet nähdä -- oi, odottakaahan, kun saatte
hänet nähdä.

-- Missä hän on? Koska hän tulee sisälle?

-- Oi, hän on poissa nyt. Hän on matkustanut tervehtimään omaisiaan.
He asuvat noin neljän- tai viidenkymmenen peninkulman päässä täältä.
Tänään on kulunut neljätoista päivää siitä kun hän läksi.

-- Milloin odotatte häntä takaisin?

Tänään on keskiviikko. Hän tulee takaisin lauvantai-iltana --
yhdeksän aikaan, luulen minä.

Minä tunsin katkeraa pettymystä.

-- Sepä oli ikävää, sillä silloin olen minä poissa.

-- Poissako? Eihän toki -- miksikä lähtisitte? Älkää tehkö sitä.
Silloin tulisi hän pahoilleen.

Hän tulisi pahoilleen, tuo kaunis olento! Vaikka hän itse olisi
lausunut minulle nuo sanat, eivät ne olisi tehneet minuun syvempää
vaikutusta. Minä tunsin syvää, voimakasta kaipausta saada nähdä
hänet, niin itsepäisen rukoilevaa kaipausta, että minua pelotti. Minä
sanoin itselleni:

-- Minun täytyy heti lähteä tästä paikasta sieluni rauhan tähden.

-- Nähkääs, hän pitää paljon siitä, että ihmisiä saapuu tänne ja jää
meidän luoksemme -- henkilöitä, jotka tuntevat maailmaa ja voivat
puhua -- sellaisia henkilöitä kuin te. Hän on siihen ihastunut, sillä
hän tietää -- oi, hän tietää melkein kaikki itse ja voi puhua -- ei,
niinkuin lintu visertää -- ja entä ne kirjat, joita hän lukee -- te
hämmästyisitte. Älkää menkö; tässähän on jälellä vaan pari päivää ja
hän olisi pahoillaan.

Minä kuulin sanat, mutta sain niistä tuskin selvää, sillä niin olin
vaipunut ajatuksiini ja mietiskelyyn. Hän poistui luotani, mutta
minä en sitä huomannut. Hän tuli kuitenkin pian takaisin valokuva
kädessään, asetti sen minun eteeni ja sanoi:

-- Kas niin, sanokaa nyt hänelle vasten naamaa, että te olisitte
voinut jäädä tänne ja tavata häntä, mutta te ette tahtonut.

Tuon toisen katse teki tyhjäksi viisaan aikeeni. Minun tuli jäädä
ja alistua vaaralle alttiiksi. Sinä iltana polttelimme me piippua
kaikessa rauhassa ja puhelimme kauvan kaikemmoisista asioista,
mutta enimmän hänen vaimostaan; ja minulla ei tosiaankaan ollut
ollut niin hauskaa ja virkistävää hetkeä moniin aikoihin. Niin tuli
torstai ja kului hyvin pian. Hämärän tullen saapui taloon muuan
pitkä kullankaivaja, joka asui kolmen peninkulman päässä sieltä --
hän oli yksi niitä harmahtavia ja väsähtäneitä --, ja tervehti meitä
sydämellisesti vakavin ja valituin sanoin. Sitte hän virkkoi:

-- Minä tulin vaan kysymään pikku rouvaa, milloin hän tulee kotia.
Onko hän lähettänyt mitään tietoa?

-- Onpa niinkin, kirjeen. Haluttaako teidän kuulla sitä, Tom?

-- Kyllä, sitä toivon kyllä... ellei vaan teillä, Henry, ole mitään
sitä vastaan.

Henry otti kirjeen esille laukustaan ja sanoi, että hän jättäisi
lukematta muutamat yksityiset sivuseikat, jollemme siitä pahastuisi;
sitte luki hän kirjeen pääasiallisen sisällön -- se oli rakkautta
uhkuva, maltillinen ja kauttaaltaan herttainen ja mukaansa tempaava
kirje varustettuna jälkikirjotuksella, joka oli täynnä ystävällisiä
tervehdyksiä Tomille ja Joelle ja Charleylle ja muille rakkaille
ystäville ja naapureille.

Kun hän oli lukenut loppuun, katsahti hän Tomiin ja huudahti:

-- Ohoo, vai jo taaskin! Ottakaapas pois kätenne ja sallikaa minun
katsoa silmiinne. Noin te teette aina, kun minä luen häneltä saamaani
kirjettä. Siitä minä kirjotan hänelle.

-- Älkää, sitä ette saa tehdä, Henry. Minä alan tulla vanhaksi,
nähkääs, ja pieninkin pettymys saattaa minut itkemään. Minä luulin,
että hän olisi jo itsekin täällä, ja te olettekin saanut vaan kirjeen.

-- No, kuka teille on sitä valehdellut? Minä luulin kaikkien
tietävän, että hän ei tule ennenkuin lauvantaina.

-- Lauvantaina! Aivan oikein, senhän minä tiesinkin, kun tarkemmin
asiaa ajattelen. En tiedä, mikä minuun lie tullut viime aikoina.
Luonnollisesti minä sen tiesin! Mehän odotamme häntä kaikki. Ei,
mutta nyt täytyy minun mennä. Mutta kyllä minä sitte näytän itseni,
kun hän tulee.

Jotenkin myöhään perjantaina iltapäivällä tuli muuan toinen harmaapää
veteraani noin peninkulman päässä olevasta hökkelistään ja sanoi,
että pojat tahtoivat pitää vähän hauskaa lauvantai-iltana, jos Henry
luulisi, ettei rouva olisi matkasta väsynyt.

-- Väsynytkö? Hänkö väsynyt! Ei, kuulkaapas kummempaa! Te tiedätte
kyllä, Joe, että hän voisi valvoa illat vaikka kuuden viikon ajan
voidakseen saattaa jollekin teistä iloa.

Kun Joe kuuli, että oli saapunut kirje, pyysi hän sitä luettavaksi,
ja saamansa sydämelliset tervehdykset veivät hänet ihan pois
suunniltaan; että jotain _sellaista_ voi tapahtua hänelle, että rouva
mainitsi hänen nimensäkin!

-- Herra Jumala, me kaipaamme häntä niin kovin paljon! sanoi hän.

Lauvantaina iltapäivällä huomasin katsovani kelloani jotenkin usein.
Henry älysi sen ja sanoi kummastuneena:

-- Ette suinkaan ajattele, että hän olisi täällä niin pian?

Minä tunsin ujostuvani, mutta nauroin ja sanoin, että se oli
minun tapani, kun jotain odottelin. Mutta hän ei näyttänyt oikein
tyytyväiseltä ja siitä lähtien alkoi hän tulla levottomaksi. Neljä
kertaa vei hän minut mukanaan erääseen paikkaan tiellä, josta oli
laaja näköala, ja siellä seisoi hän katsellen. Useamman kerran hän
virkkoi:

-- Minä alan tulla levottomaksi, alan tulla oikein levottomaksi.
Tiedän kyllä, ettei hän voi saapua ennen kello yhdeksää, mutta
kuitenkin tuntuu siltä kuin jokin koettaisi huomauttaa minulle, että
jotain on tapahtunut. Luuletteko, että mitään on tapahtunut?

Minä aloin tulla vallan hämilleni hänen lapsellisuutensa johdosta ja
viimein, kun hän vielä kerran toisti rukoilevan kysymyksensä, kadotin
minä kärsivällisyyteni ja tiuskasin hänelle aikalailla. Se saattoi
hänet aivan onnettomaksi ja sitte näytti hän niin murtuneelta ja
nöyrältä, että minua harmitti osottamani tarpeeton julmuus. Tulin
senvuoksi iloiseksi, kun Charley, eräs toinen veteraani, saapui
taloon illemmällä ja katsahti Henryn huoneeseen kuullakseen kirjeestä
ja puhuakseen vastaanottovalmistuksista. Charley piti pitkän puheen
toisensa perästä ja koetti parastaan karkottaakseen ystävänsä
aavistuksia ja pelkoa.

-- Ettäkö jotain olisi hänelle _tapahtunut?_ Ne ovat tyhjiä houreita,
Henry. Hänelle ei tule mitään tapahtumaan, siihen nähden voitte olla
aivan tyyni. Mitä oli kirjeessä? Eikö siinä ollut, että hän voi
hyvin? Ja eikö siinä ollut sitäkin, että hän olisi täällä yhdeksän
aikana? Oletteko koskaan nähneet, ettei hän olisi pitänyt sanaansa?
Ette, sen tiedätte vallan hyvin. Älkää siis olko levoton, hän
_tulee_, se on aivan varmaa, yhtä varmaa kuin että te elätte. Kas
niin, tulkaa nyt alottamaan koristelemista; meillä ei ole enää kauvan
aikaa.

Pian saapuivat Tom ja Joe ja kaikki ryhtyivät koristelemaan taloa
kukilla. Lähempänä yhdeksää sanoivat kullankaivajat, että koska
heillä oli soittokoneensa mukanaan voisivat he kernaasti soittaa
juuri nyt, sillä pian tulisi tyttöjä ja poikia kaipaamaan vanhaa
kunniallista pyörintäänsä. Viulu, klarinetti ja vielä joku muu
olivat soittokoneina. Kolmikko istuutui vierekkäin ja alkoi soittaa
rämisevää tanssikappaletta, polkien tahtia karkeilla saappaillaan.

Kello oli jo lähes yhdeksän. Henry seisoi ovella katsellen pitkin
tietä ja koko hänen ruumiinsa huojui tuskasta. Toiset olivat
pakottaneet hänet juomaan useamman kerran rouvan maljaa ja nyt huusi
Tom:

-- Tulkaa tänne, joka mies! Vielä yksi lasi, niin hän on kotona!

Joe toi laseja tarjottimella ja tarjosi seurueelle. Minä ojensin
käteni tarttuakseni erääseen pikariin, mutta Joe murahti puoliääneen:

-- Antakaa sen olla! Ottakaa tuo toinen.

Ja minä tein niin. Henrylle tarjottiin viimeksi. Hän sai juuri
tyhjennetyksi lasinsa, kun kello alkoi lyödä. Hän kuunteli loppuun
sen lyönnit. Kasvonsa olivat käyneet yhä kalpeammiksi; sitte sanoi
hän:

-- Pojat, minä olen sairas levottomuuden vuoksi. Auttakaa minua --
minä tahdon mennä levähtämään.

Kullankaivajat saattoivat hänet sohvalle. Hän kyyristyi kokoon jo
puolinukuksissa ja sanoi kuin unissaan:

-- Kuulinko kavionkopsetta? Ovatko lie tulleet?

Yksi veteraaneista sanoi aivan hänen korvaansa:

Jimmy Parrish saapui sanomaan, että juhla on lykätty, mutta että he
ovat vähän matkan päässä tulossa. Rouvan hevonen ontuu, mutta hän on
perillä puolen tunnin kuluttua.

-- Oi, minä olen niin iloinen siitä ettei mitään ole tapahtunut...

Hän nukkui saatuaan tuskin nuo sanat sanotuksi. Muutamassa
silmänräpäyksessä riisuivat nuo reippaat miehet hänen vaatteensa ja
kantoivat hänet sänkyyn siihen samaan makuuhuoneeseen, jossa minä
olin pessyt käsiäni. He sulkivat oven ja tulivat takaisin. Sitte
näyttivät he tekevän poislähtöä, mutta minä sanoin:

-- Olkaa hyviä ja älkää menkö, hyvät herrat. Rouva ei tunne minua,
minä olen vieras.

-- Rouvako? Ihmisparka, hän on ollut kuollut jo yhdeksäntoista vuotta.

-- Kuollutko?

-- Niin, tahi jotain pahempaa vielä. Hän meni tervehtimään
sukulaisiaan puoli vuotta sen jälkeen kun olivat menneet naimisiin
ja kotimatkalla eräänä lauvantai-iltana ottivat intiaanit hänet
vangiksi viiden peninkulman päässä täältä, eikä hänestä sen perästä
ole kuulunut mitään.

-- Ja sitte tuli kai isäntä mielipuoleksi?

-- Hän ei ole koskaan sen jälkeen ollut viisas. Mutta mielipuolisuus
yltyy, kun se aika vuodesta lähenee. Silloin me alamme katsella
tännepäin, kolme päivää ennen kuin rouvan muka pitäisi tulla,
saadaksemme hänet käsiimme ja kuullaksemme, onko hän saanut
mitään viestiä rouvaltaan, ja lauvantaina saavumme tänne kaikki
koristelemaan taloa kukilla ja valmistamaan tanssia. Niin olemme
tehneet joka vuosi yhdeksäntoista vuoden ajan. Ensimäisenä
lauvantaina oli meitä kaksikymmentäseitsemän henkeä ja tyttöjä
lisäksi; nyt on meitä ainoastaan kolme ja kaikki tytöt ovat poissa.
Me annamme nukutusjuomaa, muuten tulisi hän raivoksi; sitte on hän
taas rauhallinen vuoden eteenpäin ja luulee vaimonsa olevan luonaan
aina kolmeen tai neljään viime päivään asti; silloin alkaa hän etsiä
häntä ja kaivaa esiin vanhan kirjeraukkansa ja me tulemme ja pyydämme
hänen lukemaan sen. Herra Jumala, olihan rouva sellainen herttainen
olento!




KIVETTYNYT MIES


Kansa Nevadassa Kaliforniassa oli kuusikymmenluvulla aivan hurjana
merkillisten kivettymäin ja muiden luonnonihmeiden etsinnässä.
Tuskin ilmestyi sitä sanomalehteä, jossa ei olisi ollut selontekoa
yhdestä tai useammasta tuontapaisesta löydöstä. Tämä into alkoi
jo tulla vähän naurettavaksi. Minä olin ihan uusi paikallislehden
toimittaja Virginia Cityssä ja tunsin velvollisuudekseni perinpohjin
karsia pois tuon yhä karttuvan paheen; meillähän on kaikilla silloin
tällöin isällisen huolenpidon puuskia. Minä päätin musertaa tuon
kivettymäintoilun hienolla, oikein hienolla pilalla. Mutta kenties se
oli liiankin hieno, sillä ei kukaan koskaan käsittänyt siinä piilevää
satiiria. Minun suunnitelmani perustui siihen, että olisi tehtävä
merkillinen löytö, nimittäin -- kivettynyt mies.

Minulla oli ollut satunnainen riita herra Servallin, Humboldtin uuden
rauhantuomarin ja ruumiintarkastusmiehen kanssa, ja minä ajattelin,
että samalla kertaa voisin antaa hänelle pienen näpäyksen ja tehdä
hänet vähän naurettavaksi ja siten yhdistää hyödyllisen huvittavaan.
Minä tein senvuoksi laajasti ja uskottavimpia yksityisseikkoja myöten
selkoa kivettyneen ihmisen löydöstä Graveley Fordissa (täsmälleen
sadankahdenkymmenen peninkulman päässä -- ja tie niskoille
vaarallinen vuoristotie -- siitä paikasta, missä Servall asui);
miten seudun kaikki tiedemiehet olivat olleet löytöä tutkimassa (oli
tunnettu asia, ettei siellä löytynyt elävää olentoa viidenkymmenen
peninkulman alueella, lukuunottamatta muutamia nälistyneitä
intiaaneja, muutamia raajarikkoisia heinäsirkkoja ja neljää viittä
hiirihaukkaa, jotka olivat ilman ravintoa ja voimattomia pääsemään
sieltä pois); miten kaikki nämä tiedemiehet selittivät, että tuo
kivettynyt mies oli ollut täydellisessä kivettymisen tilassa enemmän
kuin kymmenen miespolven ajan; senjälkeen kerroin varmuudella,
jonka olisi pitänyt levittää häpeän puna poskilleni, että heti kun
herra Serval oli kuullut uutisen, kutsui hän kokoon juryn, nousi
aasinsa selkään ja läksi, virkavelvollisuudelleen uskollisena,
tuolle vaivaloiselle viiden päivän matkalle alkaliraunioista,
koiruohopensastoista, hengenvaaroista ja uhkaavasta nälkäkuolemasta
välittämättä pitämään _ruumiintarkastuksen_ miehestä, joka oli
ollut kuolleena ja kivettyneenä enemmän kuin kolme sataa vuotta! Ja
kun kerran olin päässyt vauhtiin, esitin samalla horjumattomalla
varmuudella, että vainaja oli juryn lausunnon mukaan kuollut
ilmanlaadun pitkällisestä vaikutuksesta. Tuo kiihotti vaan
mielikuvituksen yhä vinhempaan lentoon ja minä kerroin, että jury
kullankaivajille ominaisella ihmisrakkaudella kaivoi haudan ja
aikoi antaa kivettyneelle miehelle kristillisen hautauksen, kun he
huomasivat, että kalkkikivisakkaa oli miespolvien ajan tippunut
sen kivilouhen päälle, jolla hän istui, ja että tuo sakka oli
valunut hänen alleen ja muurannut hänet vuoreen kiinni; että jyry
(kaikki sen jäsenet olivat työmiehiä eräässä hopeakaivoksessa)
hetkisen keskustelivat tuosta vaikeudesta ja sitte ottivat esille
poran ja sytytyslangan ja ryhtyivät kaivamaan reikää hänen alleen,
_räjäyttääkseen_ hänet irti kalliosta, kun herra Serval sillä
hienotunteisuudella, joka on niin hänen luonteensa mukaista, kielsi
heitä sitä tekemästä, huomauttaen, että sellainen teko olisi
pyhyydenloukkausta.

Alusta loppuun oli kirjotus "kivettyneestä miehestä" sarja pelkkiä
mahdottomuuksia, vaikka tarina kerrottiinkin kovalla, teeskennellyllä
uskottavuudella, joka vaikutti itseenikin, vaikutti siinä määrässä,
että olin melkein uskoa omaa petostani. Mutta minulla ei tosiaankaan
ollut halua pettää ketään enkä edes luullut, että siitä seuraisi
sellainen tulos. Minä luotin siihen, että kivettyneen miehen
_istumistapa_ olisi saattanut yleisön ymmärtämään, että koko juttu
oli paljasta pilaa. Minä sotkin siihen kuitenkin innolla muita
asioita, toivoen saada sen hämärämmäksi -- ja siksi se todella
tulikin. Minä kuvailin hänen toisen jalkansa asentoa ja sanoin
sitte, että hänen oikea peukalonsa oli painunut nenää vasten;
sitte puhuin minä hänen toisesta jalastaan, pyörähdin takaisin ja
sanoin, että oikean käden sormet olivat hajallaan; sitte puhuin minä
hänen takaraivostaan ja kerroin senjälkeen, että vasen peukalo ja
oikea pikkusormi olivat koukussa; senperästä tein sivuharppauksen
tarinoidakseni jostain muusta, mutta palasin taas vähitellen
takaisin ja huomautin, että vasemman käden sormet olivat hajallaan
samoinkuin oikean kädenkin. Mutta minä olin ollut liiaksi ovela.
Minä sotkin sitä liian paljon ja koko kuvaus hänen asennostaan,
joka olisi paljastanut kirjotuksen ilveellisen luonteen kokonaan,
teki aivan päinvastaisen tuloksen kuin mitä sillä oli tarkotettu,
sillä ei kukaan muu kuin minä koskaan huomannut eikä älynnyt, minkä
johtopäätöksen voi tehdä tuon kivettyneen miehen käsien asennosta.

[Laittakaapa, lukijat, kätenne edellä kuvailtuun asentoon, niin
löydätte arvotuksen avaimen! Suoment. huomautus.]

Satiirina kivettymä-intoilijoita vastaan -- tai miksi heitä sitte
kutsuin -- oli minun "Kivettynyt mieheni" täydellinen fiasko; sillä
kaikki pitivät juttua totena ja minä huomasin hämmästyksekseni, miten
mielikuvitukseni luoma olento, sen sijaan että se oli hävittänyt
pois ja tehnyt naurunalaiseksi koko ihme-esineiden touhun, ihan
häikäilemättä sai ensimäisen sijan niiden todellisten ihmeiden
joukossa, joita Nevadastamme oli tavattu. Minä olin niin pettynyt
suunnitelmani kummallisesta myttyynmenemisestä, että aluksi suutuin
enkä mielelläni ajatellut koko asiaa, mutta vähitellen, kun alkoi
saapua toisia lehtiä, joissa kivettynyttä miestä kuvailtiin ja
mitään epäilemättä ylisteltiin, aloin tuntea salaista, lohduttavaa
tyydytystä; ja kun huhu tuosta miehestä levisi yhä laajempiin
piireihin ja minä sanomalehdistä näin, että se yhtämittaa ja
vastustamattomalla voimalla riensi mantereelta mantereelle
valtakunnasta valtakuntaan, maasta maahan, kunnes se oli kiertänyt
maapallon ympäri ja pysähtynyt ylevänä ja kieltämättömänä totuutena
ylen vakavaan lontoolaiseen _Lancet_ nimiseen aikakauskirjaan,
oli minun maljani täysi ja minä olin iloinen siitä että olin
saanut sen aikaan. Noin yhdentoistakuukauden ajan, ellen väärin
muista, oli herra Servallin postilaukussa joka päivä puolen
puutaa kaiken mailman sanomalehtiä, jotka sisälsivät viirulla
merkittyjä kirjotuksia kivettyneestä miehestä. Minä lähettelin
niitä hänelle. Tein sen ilkeydestä, en pilan vuoksi. Hän heitti ne
takapihalle ja kiroili ja joka päivä näiden kuukausien kuluessa tuli
kaivostyömiehiä, hänen valitsijoitaan (sillä kullankaivajat eivät
jätä koskaan kujeilemistaan jonkun henkilön kanssa alkuun päästyään)
hänen luokseen kysymään häneltä, mistä he saisivat käsiinsä
sanomalehden, jossa olisi jotain kivettyneestä miehestä. Hän olisi
voinut varustaa koko maanosan sellaisilla lehdillä. Minä vihasin
Servallia siihen aikaan ja kaikki tuo oli kuin palsamia ja nautintoa
minulle. En olisi koskaan voinut saada hänestä todellisemmin iloita
kuin ehkä ottamalla hänet hengiltä.




MITÄ ON OLLA SANOMALEHTIMIEHENÄ TENNESSEESSÄ


Eräs lääkäri sanoi minulle, että eteläinen ilmanala vaikuttaisi
edullisesti minun terveyteeni, ja minä matkustin senvuoksi
Tennesseehen ja sain aputoimittajan paikan _Johnson Covnty'n_
omistamassa _Sotahuudossa_. Kun tulin toimitukseen ryhtyäkseni uuteen
virkaani, lekotteli päätoimittaja kolmijalkaisessa tuolissa jalat
edessään olevalla kuusisella pöydällä. Huoneessa oli toinenkin pöytä
ja särkynyt tuoli ja ne kumpikin olivat puolittain hautautuneet
sanomalehtien ja lehtileikkausten ja käsikirjotuspinkkojen alle.
Siellä oli vielä sannoitettu puulaatikko täynnä sikarinpätkiä ja
sylettyjä tupakkimällejä; olipa huoneessa uunikin, jonka luukku
riippui vaan yhdestä ylimäisestä saranastaan. Päätoimittajalla oli
yllään pitkä musta takki ja jalassaan valkoset palttinahousut.
Saappaansa olivat sirot ja hyvin kiillotetut. Hänellä oli kurttuinen
paita päällään, iso sinettisormus sormessaan, kaulassaan pystykaulus
vanhentunutta kuosia ja rintataskussaan ruudukas nenäliina, jonka
päät riippua lerpottivat ulkona. Puku oli ollut muodissa vuonna 1848.
Hän poltteli sikaria ja mietti jotain sanasutkausta ja kynsiessään
päätään oli hän sotkenut hiuksensa pörröisiksi. Hänen silmänsä
mulkoilivat ihan pelottavasti ja minä tein sen johtopäätöksen, että
hän parastaikaa keitti kokoon tavallista tuimempaa pääkirjotusta! Hän
pyysi minun silmäilemään toisia lehtiä ja kirjottamaan "Tähkäpäitä
Tennesseen lehdistä" ja siihen artikkeliin sovittamaan kaiken sen
mikä niissä oli ottamisen arvoista.

Minä kirjoitin seuraavasti:

"_Tähkäpäitä Tennesseen lehdistä_.

"Kaksi kertaa viikossa ilmestyvän _Maanjäristyksen_ toimitus on
nähtävästi saanut väärinkäsityksen mitä tulee Ballyhack-rautatiehen.
Yhtiön tarkotus ei ole mennä Buzzardvillen nenän ohitse, se
päinvastoin pitää tuota paikkaa mitä tärkeimpänä radalla eikä sillä
niinollen ole aikomus sitä syrjäyttää. _Maanjäristyksen_ toimitus
luonnollisesti mielihyvällä ottaa vastaan tämän oikaisun.

"John V. Blosson, Higginsvillen äänenkannattajan _Vapauden ukonnuolen_
ansiokas toimittaja saapui kaupunkiimme eilen. Hän asuu Van Burenin
hotellissa.

"Olemme huomanneet, että arvoisa aikalaisemme, Springin _Aamunparku_,
on sattunut erehtymään otaksuessaan, ettei Van Vertenin vaali vielä
ole täydellinen tosiasia, mutta hän on jo varmaankin huomannut
erehdyksensä ennekuin tämä saapuu hänen käsiinsä. Hän on nähtävästi
johtunut harhaan epätäydellisen vaalireferaatin vuoksi.

"Meitä ilahuttaa kuulla, että Blathersvillen kaupunki koettaa hieroa
sopimusta erään newyorkilaisen herran kanssa sen miltei ilman
liikettä olevien katujen laskemisesta Nicholsonin betonilla. Mutta
sellaista toivoa on vaikea saada toteutetuksi sen perästä kun Memphis
narrasi muutamain newyorkilaisten tekemään samallaisen työn eikä
sitte tahtonut maksaa. _Eläköönhuuto_ puuhailee kuitenkin taitavasti
sen toimenpiteen puolesta ja näyttää lopuksi toivovan menestystä.

"Ikävällä kuulemme, että eversti Bascom, _Vapauden kuolinhuokauksen_
päätoimittaja, kaatui kadulla joku ilta sitten ja taittoi jalkansa.
Hän on viime aikoina ollut heikko ylenmääräisistä ponnistuksista ja
levottomuudesta perheessään sattuneen sairauden takia, ja otaksutaan
hänen pyörtyneen syystä että rasitti itseään kävelemällä liian paljon
auringonpaisteessa".

Minä jätin käsikirjotuksen päätoimittajalle, hänen joko
hyväksyttäväkseen, korjattavakseen tahi revittäväkseen. Hän vilkasi
siihen ja kasvonsa synkistyivät. Hän silmäili sen läpi ja kasvonsa
tulivat uhkaaviksi. Saattoi helposti huomata, että jotain oli
hullusti. Nyt hyökkäsi hän ylös ja sanoi:

-- Tuli ja leimaus! Luuletteko, että minä aijon puhua noista
eläimistä tähän äänilajiin. Arveletteko että minun tilaajani pitävät
tuollaisesta maitovellistä? Antakaa minulle kynä!

En koskaan ole nähnyt kynän niin säälimättömästi karsivan ja
korjailevan toisen verbejä ja adjektiiveja. Hänen päästessään
vauhtiin ampui häntä joku avonaisesta akkunasta ja himmensi
sopusointuisuutta hänen korvissaan.

-- Ahaa, sanoi hän, se on Smithin lurjus _Viisaudentulivuoresta_ --
häntä minä odotin jo eilen.

Ja hän tempasi revolverin vyöstään ja ampui. Smith kaatui; kuula oli
sattunut pohkeeseen. Laukaus johti väärään Smithin oman tähtäyksen,
sillä hän aikoi juuri laukaista toisen kerran, ja hän haavotti
tuntematonta. Se olin minä. Minulta ammuttiin ainoastaan yksi sormi.

Sitte jatkoi päätoimittaja pyyhkimistään ja lisäilemistään. Juuri kun
hän oli lopettanut korjailemisen, tuli käsipommi alas uuninpiipusta
ja räjäytti tuhansiksi palasiksi koko uunin. Se ei kuitenkaan saanut
aikaan mitään muuta vahinkoa kuin että muuan uuninsirpale katkasi
minulta pari hammasta.

-- Tuo uuni on nyt vallan kelvoton, sanoi päätoimittaja.

Minä sanoin, että hän oli oikeassa.

-- No, se on samantekevä -- sitä ei tarvita tällaisella ilmalla. Minä
tunnen miehen, joka sen teon teki ja kuittaan sen kyllä hänelle. Kas
niin, _näin_ on kirjotettava sellaisesta aineesta...

Minä otin käsikirjotuksen. Se oli niin tuhrittu, pyyhitty ja
korjailtu, ettei sen äiti olisi tuntenut sitä omaksi lapsekseen, jos
sillä äitiä olisi ollut. Nyt kuului se näin:

"_Tähkäpäitä Tennesseen lehdistä_."

Kaksi kertaa viikossa ilmestyvän _Maanjäristyksen_ piiskatut
valehtelijat koettavat selvästi vieläkin syöttää jalolle ja
ritarilliselle kansalle halpamaisia ja kurjia valheitaan
yhdeksännentoista vuosisadan kunniakkaimpaan yritykseen,
Ballyhack-rautatiehen nähden. Keksintö, että se aikoisi mennä
Buzzardvillen nenän ohi, on syntynyt heidän omissa siivottomissa
aivoissaan -- tai paremmin sanoen siinä ravassa, jota _he_ pitävät
aivoinaan. He menettelevät viisaammin nielemällä tämän valheen, jos
tahtovat pelastaa haisevat matelijarunkonsa hyvin ansaitusta kylvystä.

Se aasi Blossom _Vapauden ukonnuolesta_ on taaskin täällä ja oleksii
kuokkavieraana Van Burenin hotellissa.

Olemme kuulleet, että Mud Springin _Aamunparun_ patajuoppo rantajätkä
tavallisuuden mukaan valehdellen on levittänyt huhun, ettei Van
Werter olisi valittu. Sanomalehdistön jumalallinen tehtävä on
levittää totuutta ja karsia hairahduksia, kasvattaa sievistää
ja kohottaa julkisen moraalin ja säädyllisyyden ääntä ja tehdä
kaikki ihmiset ystävällisemmiksi, siveämmiksi, armeliaisemmiksi
ja kaikin puolin paremmiksi ja hurskaammiksi ja onnellisemmiksi;
mutta kuitenkin halventaa tämä kurja, tämä musta sielu, edelleenkin
korkeata kutsumustaan valehtelemalla, panettelemalla kunniaa
loukkaamalla ja menettelemällä alentavan yksinkertaisesti.

Blathersville katuaa Nicholsonin betonia -- se tahtoo saada
yhden vankilan ja vaivaistalon entisten lisäksi. Ajatellappa
betonikatuja kaupungissa, joissa on ainoastaan yksi hevonen, kaksi
puuvillanpuhdistuslaitosta ja yksi paja... entä sitte sellainen
sinappilaastari sanomalehdeksi kuin on _Eläköönhuuto_; Silloin on
parempi lainata betonia Memphistä, joka niin halvalla on saanut sitä
tavaraa. Ryömivä itikka Buchner, joka julkaisee _Eläköönhuutoa_,
määkii siitä asiasta tavalliseen tyhmyrintapaansa ja luulee puhuvansa
kuin viisas ihminen.

       *       *       *       *       *

-- Niin, _tuolla tavalla_ on kirjotettava -- pistettävä joukkoon
pippuria ja käytävä suoraan asiaan. Minä saan pahoinvoinnin
maitovellikirjotuksista.

Samassa lensi tiilikivi akkunasta sisään kamalalla ryskeellä ja minä
sain kunnon täräyksen selkääni. Minä vetäysin syrjään -- se alkoi
tuntua minusta viisaammalta.

Päätoimittaja sanoi:

-- Se oli nähtävästi eversti. Olen odottanut häntä kaksi päivää. Nyt
tulee hän varmaankin pian.

Hän oli oikeassa. Eversti näyttäytyi samassa ovella revolveri
kädessään.

Hän sanoi:

-- Hyvä herra, onko minulla kunnia puhua sen pelkurin kanssa, joka
julkaisee tätä roskalehteä?

-- Kyllä, herrani. Olkaa hyvä ja istukaa, mutta varokaa tuolia, sillä
siitä on yksi jalka poikki. Minulla kai on kunnia puhua sen mylvivän
lurjuksen, eversti Blatherskite Tecumsehin kanssa?

-- Kyllä minä olen se. Minulla on pieni asia selvittämättä kanssanne.
Jos teillä on siihen tilaisuus, niin voimme alkaa.

-- Minun täytyy lopettaa artikkeli "ilahduttavasta edistyksestä
Amerikan moraalisessa ja tiedollisessa kehityksessä", mutta siellä ei
ole niin kiire. Alottakaa.

Molemmat pistoolit pamahtivat yht'aikaa. Päätoimittajalta hipasi
everstin kuula hiukan hiuksia ja upposi sitte minun reisilihaksiini.
Toimittajan kuula nipisti vähän everstin vasenta olkaa. He ampuivat
uudestaan. Tällä kertaa ampuivat he kumpikin harhaan, mutta minä sain
kuitenkin osani, nimittäin kuulan käsivarteeni. Kolmannella kerralla
haavottuivat kumpikin lievästi ja toinen kuula tasotteli minun
rystyitäni. Sitte sanoin minä, että katsoin parhaaksi mennä hieman
kävelemään, koska tämä oli yksityinen keskustelu ja minusta tuntui
tunkeilevalta viipyä kauvemmin läsnä. Mutta herrat pyysivät minun
istumaan tuolillani ja vakuuttivat, etten minä ollenkaan ollut heidän
tiellään. Minulla oli ollut toinen käsitys tähän asti...

Senjälkeen puhelivat he hetkisen vaaleista ja vuodentulontoiveista ja
minä aloin sitoa haavojani. Mutta nyt he alkoivat ampua yhtäpainoa,
ja jok'ainoa kuula sattui -- mutta saanen kenties huomauttaa, että
kuudesta kuulasta tuli viisi minun osalleni. Seitsemäs haavotti
everstiä hengenvaarallisesti ja hän huomautti leikillisesti,
että hänen täytyi nyt sanoa hyvästit, sillä hänellä oli asioita
toimitettavana kaupungilla. Sitte kysyi hän, missä hautausurakoitsija
asui, ja meni tiehensä.

Päätoimittaja kääntyi minun puoleeni ja sanoi:

-- Odotan vieraita päivälliselle ja minun täytyy laittautua kuntoon.
Tahdotte olla ystävällinen ja lukea korehtuurin ja ottaa vastaan ne
henkilöt, jotka tänne mahdollisesti saapuvat.

Minua vähän pöyristytti ajatellessani vieraiden vastaanottamista,
mutta pääni oli vielä niin sekasin pamauksista, jotka yhä soivat
korvissani, etten voinut mitään vastata.

Hän jatkoi:

-- Jones tulee kello kolme -- antakaa hänelle selkään. Gillespie
tulee ehkä ennemmin -- heittäkää hänet ulos akkunasta. Ferguson
saapuu neljän seudussa -- tappakaa hänet. Siinä kaikki, mitä meille
on tänäpäivänä tekemistä. Jos teillä on aikaa, niin kirjottakaa
sointuva artikkeli poliiseista -- ja antakaa ylikomisariukselle hänen
lämmin annoksensa. Nahkapiiska on pöydällä, aseita on laatikossa --
ampumatarpeita tuolla nurkassa -- liinannukkia ja siteitä noissa
laatikoissa. Jos jotain ikävyyksiä sattuu, menkää välskäri Lancet'in
luo, joka asuu rappua alempana. Hän ilmoittaa lehdessämme -- hän
korvaa ilmotusmaksut työllään.

Hän meni. Minä värisin. Kolmen tunnin kuluttua olin kulkenut
niin kauheitten vaarojen halki, että olin kadottanut kaiken
mielentyyneyteni ja iloni. Gillespie oli tullut ja heittänyt _minut_
ulos akkunasta. Jones saapui täsmälleen, ja kun minä tartuin
piiskaan antaakseni hänelle selkään, olikin se hän, joka antoi
selkäsaunan, enkä minä. Keskustellessani muutaman tuntemattoman
herran kanssa, jota ei oltu merkitty päiväjärjestykseeni, olin
menettänyt päänahkani. Muuan toinen vieras, nimeltään Thompson, ei
jättänyt minusta muuta jälelle kuin kasan sotkettuja ryysyjä. Ja
lopuksi pakenin minä erääseen nurkkaan hurjan joukkueen ahdistamana,
jossa oli toimittajia, ammattipelaajia, politikoitsijoita ja
hurjistelijoita ja jotka kirkuivat ja kiroilivat ja heiluttivat
aseitaan minun pääni päällä, kunnes teräs jo salamoi silmissäni.
Silloin juuri aijoin sanoa itseni irti sanomalehdestä, kun
päätoimittaja saapui samassa, mukanaan joukko hurmaantuneita ja
innokkaita ystäviä. Nyt alkoi niin hurja mellakka, semmoinen
verilöyly, ettei mikään inhimillinen kynä voi sitä kuvailla, ei
teräksenkään. Ihmisiä ammuttiin, hakattiin säpäleiksi, silvottiin,
räjäytettiin ilmaan, heitettiin ulos akkunasta. Seurasi synkkä
kiroustulva, joka muistutti sekavaa ja hurjaa sotatanssia, sitte
istuimme verentahraama toimittaja ja minä kahdenkesken ja katselimme
verisiä jätteitä, joita virui siellä täällä ympäri lattiaa.

Hän sanoi:

-- Te tulette pitämään tästä toimesta, kun totutte siihen.

Minä sanoin:

-- Te kai suonette minulle vikani anteeksi, kenties tulen jonkun
aikaa kirjoittamaan teidän makunne mukaan; kunhan vaan opin vähän
kieltä ja saan hieman kokemusta, niin luulen varmasti, että voin sen
tehdä. Mutta sanoakseni totuuden on tuollaisella suorasukaisella
kielellä myöskin haittansa ja rahvas tahtoo niin mielellään päästä
erilleen yhdestä. Sen näette itsekin. Voimakas kirjoitustapa on
kyllä omiansa innostamaan yleisöä, mutta minä en halua tulla niin
huomatuksi, kuin mikä siitä on seurauksena. Minä en voi kirjottaa
levollisena, jos minua häiritään niin paljon kuin tänään. Minä
pidän jotenkin paljon tästä toimesta, mutta minä en pidä siitä että
toimekseni jätetään vieraiden vastaanottaminen. Mitä täällä olen
nähnyt ja kokenut, on jotain aivan uutta, ja minun täytyy myöntää,
että se on tavallaan huvittavaakin, mutta se ei ole tullut jaetuksi
oikeudenmukaisesti meidän kesken. Eräs herra ampuu teitä akkunasta ja
haavoittaa _minua_; pommi tulee alas uuninpiipusta teitä tapaamaan
ja lennättää uuninluukun _minun_ kasvoilleni; muuan ystävä katsahtaa
sisälle vaihtaakseen kohteliaisuuksia teidän kanssanne ja ampuu
minut täyteen kuulia, niin ettei nahkani ole enää sopusoinnussa
periaatteitteni kanssa; te menette syömään päivällistä ja Jones
tulee nahkapiiskoineen; Gillespie heittää minut ulos akkunasta,
Thompson repii siekaleiksi kaikki vaatteeni ja muuan aivan tuntematon
ihminen kiskoo minua tukasta aivan kursailematta, niinkuin olisimme
vanhoja tuttuja; ja ennenkuin viisi minuuttia on ehtinyt kulua
saapuvat seudun kaikki rosvot täysissä sotatamineissa ja säikäyttävät
tomahavkoillaan senkin lopun mitä minusta enää oli jälellä. Kun
kaikki nämä lasketaan yhteen, niin enpä totisesti ole koskaan vielä
elänyt niin vilkasta päivää kuin tänään. En, mutta minä pidän
teistä ja minä pidän teidän tyynestä, kursailemattomasta tavastanne
selitellä asioita ja tapahtumia vieraillenne, mutta niinkuin näette,
en minä ole siihen tottunut. Etelämaalaisten sydämet ovat syttyviä,
etelämaalaisten vierasvaraisuus on liian hurja outoja kohtaan. Ne
rivit, jotka minä tänään kirjoitin ja joiden kylmään sisältöön
mestarinkäsi valoi Tennesseen sanomalehdistön tulista henkeä,
synnyttävät kyllä vielä uuden ampiaispesän. Koko tuo toimittajaliuta
on tuleva tänne -- ja ne tulevat päälle päätteeksi nälkäisinä ja
tahtovat jonkin aamiaisekseen. Minun täytyy sanoa teille jäähyväiset.
Minä kieltäydyn olemasta mukana niissä kesteissä. Minä matkustin
tänne etelään terveyteni takia, nyt matkustan takaisin samasta syystä
ja aivan heti. Olla sanomalehtimiehenä Tennesseessä on minusta liian
hermostuttavaa.

Jonkajälkeen me erosimme, tuntien kaipausta molemmin puolin, ja minä
kirjotutin itseni muutamaan sairashuoneeseen.




IHMISSYÖJÄ


Minä matkustin äskettäin eräänä päivänä St. Louis'iin, ja matkalla
länteenpäin, muutettuani junaa Terr--e Hautessa, Indianassa, astui
muuan neli- tahi viisikymmenvuotias, lempeä ja hyväntahtoisen
näköinen herra eräällä väliasemalla vaunuun ja istuutui minun
viereeni. Kenties tunnin ajan juttelimme me sangen hauskasti
keskenämme kaikellaisista aineista, ja minusta tuntui siltä
että hän oli tavattoman lahjakas ja huvittava. Saatuaan tietää
että olin Washingtonista, alkoi hän kysellä minulta erityisistä
julkisista henkilöistä ja kongressin kuulumisista, ja minä huomasin
heti puhuvani miehen kanssa, joka tunsi tarkalleen pääkaupungin
valtiollisen elämän sekä samaten senaattorien ja kamarinjäsenten --
siis maan lakiasäätäväin piirien -- kesken vallitsevat tavat. Nyt
pysähtyi meidän viereemme kaksi miestä hetkiseksi ja toinen sanoi
toiselle:

-- Harris, jos teet minulle sen palveluksen, niin en sitä milloinkaan
unohda, poikaseni.

Matkatoverini silmissä välähti. Sanat olivat herättäneet hänessä
jonkin mieluisan muiston, ajattelin minä. Sitte näyttivät hänen
kasvonsa ajattelevilta, miltei synkiltä. Hän kääntyi puoleeni ja
sanoi:

-- Tahdonpa kertoa teille tarinan, salaisen kappaleen elämästäni --
kappaleen, josta en ole koskaan maininnut kenellekään senperästä kun
ne tapahtumat tulivat tunnetuiksi. Kuulkaa minua kärsivällisesti ja
luvatkaa, että ette minua keskeytä.

Minä sanoin sen tekeväni, ja hän kertoi seuraavan omituisen
seikkailun: väliin puhui hän innokkaasti, väliin surumielisesti,
mutta aina tunteellisesti ja vakuuttavasti:

_Tuntemattoman kertomus_.

Joulukuun 9 päivänä 1853 matkustin minä iltajunalla St. Louisista
Chicagoon. Meitä oli kaikkiaan ainoastaan kaksikymmentäneljä
matkustajaa. Ei ollut ollenkaan naisia eikä lapsia. Olimme mitä
parhaimmalla tuulella, ja pian tehtiin miellyttäviä tuttavuuksia.
Matka tuntui tulevan erittäin hupaiseksi, enkä luule, että
kenelläkään seuraan kuuluvalla oli pienintäkään aavistusta niistä
kauhuista, joita oli meillä vastassa.

Kello yksitoista illalla alkoi sataa lunta rajusti. Heti kun olimme
jättäneet taaksemme Weldenin pikku kylän tulimme kauhean autiolle
tasangolle, joka penikulmittain asumattomana erämaana laajenee
Jubilee Settlemetsiin päin. Tuuli, jota eivät puut eikä mäet eikä
edes yksinäiset kalliontörmänteet olleet estämässä, ulvoi hirveästi
aukeassa erämaassa ja juoksutti satavaa lunta edellään niinkuin
vaahtoa myrskyisen meren aaltojen harjalle. Pian oli lunta paksulti
ja junan vähenevästä vauhdista voimme me älytä, että veturin oli yhä
vaikeampi puskea nietosten läpi. Väliin täytyi sen melkein pysähtyä
keskelle suuria kinoksia, joita suurten hautakumpujen kaltaisina
muodostui radalle. Keskustelu alkoi pysähtyä. Hilpeyden sijaan
tuli vakava huoli. Mahdollisuus tulla haudatuksi lumeen tuolla
kolkolla tasangolla, viidenkymmenen penikulman päässä lähimmästä
ihmisasunnosta, oli kaikille selvillä ja se teki mielet raskaiksi.

Kello kaksi aamulla heräsin minä levottomasta unenhorroksesta siihen
että kaikki liike ympärilläni taukosi. Heti pisti päähäni kauhea
totuus -- me olimme vankeina lumikinoksessa!

-- Joka mies auttamaan!

Kaikki riensivät noudattamaan kehotusta. Ulos raivoavaan yöhön,
pikimustaan pimeyteen, lumituiskuun ja ulvovaan myrskyyn kiiruhti
jokainen hyvin tietäen, että hukkaanmennyt silmänräpäys voisi nyt
syöstä meidät kaikki turmioon. Lapioita, lautoja -- kaikki, mitä
voitiin käyttää lumen luomisessa, haalittiin heti kokoon. Siinä oli
harvinainen näky: pieni joukko epätoivoisia miehiä taistelemassa
lumivallien kanssa, puoli ruumista mitä synkimmän pimeyden peitossa,
toinen puoli mitä voimakkaimmassa valaistuksessa, mikä tuli veturin
valonheittäjistä.

Jo tunnin kuluttua havaitsimme, että ponnistuksemme olivat aivan
turhat. Myrsky ajoi tusinan kinoksia radalle sill'aikaa kun me saimme
lapioiduksi yhden. Ja kaikkein pahinta: huomattiin että viimeisessä
hyökkäyksessä nietoksia vastaan oli veturin akseli katkennut!
Vaikkakin rata olisi ollut vapaa, olisimme kuitenkin olleet
avuttomia. Me nousimme vaunuihin väsyneinä työstä ja sangen allapäin.
Keräännyimme lämmityslaitosten ympärille ja keskustelimme vakavasti
asemasta. Meillä ei ollut ollenkaan ruokaa -- se oli suurin vaikeus.
Palella meidän ei tarvinnut, sillä poltinaineita oli riittävästi
etuvaunussa. Se oli ainoa etumme. Neuvottelun päätökseksi yhdyttiin
yleisesti veturinkuljettajan väitteeseen, että se olisi samaa kuin
kuolla, jos koetettaisin kävellä jalkaisin viisikymmentä penikulmaa
sellaisessa lumituiskussa. Emme voineet lähettää ketään noutamaan
apua, ja vaikka olisimme voineetkin, ei sitä olisi tullut. Meidän
täytyi alistua ja niin kärsivällisesti kuin voimme odottaa apua tahi
nälkäkuolemaa! Minä luulen, että rohkeintakin sydäntä pöyristytti
noita sanoja lausuttaessa.

Tunnin kuluttua hiljeni keskustelu vienoksi supatukseksi vaunussa,
jota tuuli tuontuostakin heilutteli; lamput valaisivat heikosti
ja useimmat onnettomat heittäytyivät pitkäkseen ajatellakseen --
unohtaakseen nykyhetken, jos voisivat -- nukkuakseen, jos saisivat
unta silmiinsä.

Iankaikkinen yö -- meistä tuntui se tosiaankin iankaikkiselta -- oli
viimeinkin ohitse hitaasti kuluneine tunteineen, ja kylmä, harmaa
aamu kajasti idässä. Kun alkoi tulla yhä valoisammaksi, alkoivat
matkustajat liikutella jäseniään yksi toisensa perästä ja kukin
kohotti otsalle painunutta hattuaan, oikoi kankeita jäseniään ja
katseli akkunasta kolkkoa ympäristöä. Se oli tosiaankin kolkkoa:
Ei missään näkynyt ainoatakaan elävää olentoa, ei ihmisasuntoa,
ei mitään muuta kuin tavattoman suuri valkonen erämaa; lumipilviä
kierteli sinne tänne tuulen mukana; lentelevät lumihiutaleet
peittivät koko taivaan.

Koko päivän me istuimme vaunuissa ja torkuimme, puhelimme vähä ja
ajattelimme paljo. Vielä pitkä, ikävä yö -- ja nälkä.

Uusi aamu sarasti -- uusi äänettömyyden, synkkyyden, purevan nälän
päivä, jolloin toivottomina odotettiin apua, jota ei voinut tulla.
Yö levottomassa uinailussa, jolloin nähtiin unta herkullisista
aterioista -- herättyämme katkera mieli kalvavan nälän vuoksi.

Neljäs päivä tuli ja meni -- ja viides! Viiden päivän kauhea vankeus!
Raivoisa nälkä väreili kaikkien silmistä. Katseessa kuvastui jotain
kauheata -- se oli merkki siitä mitä kaikkien sydämmissä liikkui --
jotain, jota ei kenenkään kieli vielä rohjennut lausua.

Kuudes päivä oli kulunut -- seitsemäs sarasti kuihtuneille,
kalmankalpeille ja toivottomille miehille, jotka eivät ennen olleet
katsoneet kuolemaa silmiin. Nyt oli se sanottava! Se sana, jota
kaikki olivat ajatelleet, oli nyt viimeinkin valmis tulemaan esiin
jokaisen huulilta. Oli ponnisteltu viimeiseen asti luonnonlakeja
vastaan -- nyt oli taivuttava. _Rickhard H. Gaston_ Minnesotasta
nousi ylös pitkänä, kummituksen näköisenä ja kalpeana. Kaikki
tiesivät, mitä tuleman piti. Kaikki valmistautuivat -- ei tehty
mitään liikettä, ei osotettu mitään mielenilmausta -- tyyni,
punnitseva vakavuus näkyi nyt kaikkien silmissä, joiden ilme juuri
äsken oli ollut niin raivokas.

-- Hyvät herrat -- sitä ei enää voida lykätä tuonnemmaksi! Aika on
tullut! Meidän täytyy päättää, kenen meistä on kuoleminen toisten
ravinnoksi!

Herra _John J. Williams_ Illinoisista nousi ja sanoi:

-- Hyvät herrat -- minä ehdotan pastori James Sawyeriä Tennesseestä.

Herra Wm _R. Adams_ Indianasta sanoi:

-- Minä ehdotan herra Daniel Slotea Newyorkista.

Herra _Charles J. Langdon_:

-- Minä ehdotan herra Samuel A. Bowenia St. Louisista.

Herra _Slote_:

-- Minä pyydän saada kieltäytyä herra John A. Van Nastrand nuoremman,
New Jerseystä, eduksi.

Herra _Gaston_:

-- Ellei kellään ole vastaan, voitaneen tämän herran ehdotus katsoa
hyväksytyksi.

Herra _Van Nastrand_ pani vastalauseen, ja herra Sloten
kieltäytymistä ei hyväksytty. Herrain Sawyerin ja Bowenin
kieltäytymiset hylättiin samoilla perusteilla.

Herra _A. L. Bascom_ Ohiosta:

-- Minä ehdotan, että me tyydymme niihin ehdokkaihin, joita meillä
nyt on, ja että kamari ryhtyy äänestykseen suletuilla lipuilla.

Herra _Sawyer_:

-- Hyvät herrat, minä panen vakavan vastalauseen tätä menettelytapaa
vastaan. Se on kaikin puolin muodoton ja sopimaton. Minä pyydän
saada ehdottaa, että tapa heti hylätään ja että me valitsemme
puheenjohtajan asianmukaisine valiokuntineen ja sitte käsittelemme
esilläolevaa kysymystä asianmukaisessa järjestyksessä.

Herra _Belknap_ Iowasta:

-- Hyvät herrat, minä panen vastalauseeni. Meillä ei ole nyt
tilaisuutta pitää kiinni muodoista ja turhanpäiväisistä säännöistä.
Yli seitsemän päivää olemme me olleet ilman ruokaa. Jokainen
silmänräpäys, jonka me hukkaamme turhaan lörpötykseen, pahentaa
yhä meidän hädänalaista asemaamme. Minä tyydyn niihin ehdokkaihin,
joita jo on esitetty -- ja heihin varmaankin tyydymme kaikki -- enkä
ymmärrä, miks'emme heti voisi valita heistä yhtä tahi useampia. Minä
ehdotan, että me teemme välipäätöksen...

Herra _Gaston_:

-- Se aiheuttaisi vastalauseen ja tulisi pannuksi pöydälle huomiseen
asti ja siis saisi aikaan juuri sen lykkäyksen, jota te haluatte
välttää. New Jerseystä oleva herra:

Herra _Van Nastrand_:

-- Hyvät herrat, minä olen vieras teidän joukossanne, minä en ole
halunnut sitä huomaavaisuutta, mikä on tullut minun osakseni, ja
minun hienotunteisuuteni...

Herra _Morgan_ Alabamasta (keskeyttäen):

-- Minä ehdotan, ettei tätä kysymystä oteta ratkaistavaksi.

Tähän ehdotukseen suostuttiin ja sen kautta keskeytyivät
luonnollisesti enemmät keskustelut. Ehdotus virkailijain
valitsemisesta hyväksyttiin, herra Gaston valittiin puheenjohtajaksi,
herra Blake sihteeriksi, herrat Holcomb. Dyer ja Balewin
valiokunnanjäseniksi sekä hra R. M. Howtand neuvottelevaksi jäseneksi.

Sitte otettiin puolen tunnin loma, joka käytettiin valmistelevaan
keskusteluun. Kun puheenjohtajannuija antoi merkin, avattiin taas
kokous, ja valiokunta ilmotti ehdokkaikseen herrat George Fergusonin
Kentuckystä, Lucien Hermannin Louisinasta ja Messickin Goloradosta.

Herra _Rogers_ Missourista:

-- Herra puheenjohtaja! Kun nyt ehdokaslista on asianmukaisesti
kamarille esitetty, pyydän saada ehdottaa siihen sen muutoksen,
että herra Hermannin nimi vaihdetaan herra Lucius Harris'iin St.
Louisista, jonka me kaikki hyvin tunnemme. Minä en tahdo ehdotustani
siten käsiteltävän, että olisin halunnut heittää pienintäkään
varjoa louisianalaisherran ylevään luonteeseen ja arvoon -- kaukana
siitä. Minä kunnioitan ja pidän häntä arvossa yhtä paljon kuin
muutkin läsnäolijat, mutta ei kukaan meistä voi olla huomaamatta
sitä asianhaaraa, että hän on tämän viikon kuluessa kadottanut
painostaan enemmän kuin kukaan muu teistä, -- ei kukaan meistä voi
olla huomaamatta, että valiokunta on laiminlyönyt velvollisuutensa,
olkoompa sitte huomaamattomuudesta tahi painavimmista syistä,
ehdottaessaan äänestettäväksi henkilöstä, jolla -- miten puhtaita
hänen omat motiivinsa lienevätkin -- tosiaankin on vähemmän
ravintoainetta tarjottavana...

_Puheenjohtaja_:

-- Missourin edustaja suvaitsee olla hyvä ja istua alas. Valiokunnan
rehellisyyttä vastaan ei sallita tehtävän mitään viittauksia;
sellaisesta täytyy tapahtua sääntöjenmukainen ilmotus ja tutkimus.
Mitä sanoo kokous nyt tehdystä ehdotuksesta?

Herra _Halliday_ Virginiasta:

-- Minä pyydän vieläkin ehdottaa sellaista muutosta ehdokaslistaan,
että herra Messickin sijalle asetetaan herra Harvey Davis Oregonista.
Voidaan ehkä väittää, että ulkoilman rasitukset ja kieltäymykset
ovat tehneet herra Davisin sitkeäksi, mutta, hyvät herrat, onko nyt
aika tehdä rikkiviisaita huomautuksia ja osottautua turhantarkaksi
pikku asioissa? Onko nyt aika keskustella noin vähän merkitsevistä
seikoista? Ei, hyvät herrat, laajuutta me haluamme -- kokoa, painoa,
tilavuutta -- siinä ovat tärkeimmät ehdot -- emme kykyä, emme
nerokkuutta, emme sivistystä. Minä pysyn ehdotuksessani.

Herra _Morgan_ (kiivaasti): -- Herra puheenjohtaja! Minä panen jyrkän
vastalauseen tätä muodosehdotusta vastaan. Oregonin edustaja on vanha
ja sitäpaitsi painava ainoastaan luihinsa nähden, ei lihaan. Minä
tahdon kysyä Virginian edustajalta, onko se soppaa vai särvintä,
jota me haluamme? Tahtooko hän pilkata meitä varjokuvilla! Tahtooko
hän lahjoa meidän kärsimyksemme Oregonin kummituksella? Minä kysyn
häneltä, voiko hän nähdä tuskan ahdistamia kasvoja ympärillään, voiko
hän katsoa meidän synkkiin silmiimme, voiko hän kuunnella meidän
odottavien sydäntemme lyöntiä ja kuitenkin harjottaa tätä petosta
meidän nälkäämme vastaan? Minä kysyn häneltä, voiko hän ajatella
meidän surullista tilaamme, meidän kestettyjä kärsimyksiämme,
synkkää tulevaisuuttamme, ja kuitenkin armotta tyrkyttää meille
tuota hylkyrähjää, tuota ränsistynyttä, kaatumaisillaan olevaa
raukkaa, tuota luisevaa, turmeltunutta, mehutonta kulkuria Oregonin
vihamielisiltä rannoilta? Ei koskaan! (Kättentaputusta.)

Muutosehdotus tuli äänestyksen alaiseksi kiivaan keskustelun perästä,
ja se hylättiin. Herra Harris tuli ensimmäisen muutosehdotuksen
mukaisesti otetuksi ehdokaslistalle. Sitte ryhdyttiin valitsemaan.
Viisi ensimäistä äänestystä meni myttyyn. Kuudennen kerran
äänestettäessä tuli Harris valituksi, koska kaikki äänestivät
häntä paitsi hän itse. Nyt esitettiin vaalin vahvistamisia
huutoäänestyksellä, mutta siitä ei tullut mitään senvuoksi että
Harris äänesti taas itseään vastaan.

Herra _Radway_ ehdotti, että kamari nyt siirtyisi toisiin
ehdokkaisiin ja toimittaisi vaalin aamiaista varten. Ehdotus
hyväksyttiin. Ensimäisessä äänestyksessä oli yhtä monta ääntä
kummallakin puolen syystä että toinen puoli puolusti erästä ehdokasta
hänen nuoruutensa vuoksi ja toinen puoli äänesti erästä toista
senvuoksi kun hän oli suurempi. Tämä päätös herätti paheksumista
niiden kesken, jotka puolustivat herra Fergusonia, ehdokasta, joka
sai vähemmistön, ja aijottiin juuri pyytää uutta äänestystä, kun
kesken kaiken hyväksyttiinkin lykkäysehdotus ja kokous hajotettiin.

Illallisvalmistukset kiinnittivät kauvan aikaa Fergusonin puolueen
huomiota ja kun he taas aikovat ottaa kysymyksen esille, hämmentyi se
siihen iloiseen sanomaan, että Harris oli valmis.

Me järjestimme tilapäisen pöydän kääntämällä tuoleja ylösalasin
ja ryhdyimme kiitollisin mielin nauttimaan ihaninta ateriaa,
mitä koskaan näinä seitsemänä piinapäivänä olimme mielissämme
kuvitelleet. Miten olimmekaan toisellaisia kuin muutama tunti
sitten! Silloin toivottomuutta, synkkää kurjuutta, nälkää, kuumeista
tuskaa, epätoivoa -- nyt kiitollisuutta, autuaallista rauhaa, iloa
suurempaa kuin mitä sanoin voi selittää. Se oli onnellisin hetki
koko minun vaiherikkaassa elämässäni. Tuuli ulvoi ja lumi tuiskusi
rajusti vankilamme ympärillä, mutta nyt ei mikään saattanut meitä
levottomiksi. Minä pidin Harrisista. Hän olisi ehkä voinut olla
hiukan paremmaksi paistettu, mutta minä voin sanoa, ettei ainoakaan
ihminen ole ollut niin minun makuni mukainen kuin Harris tahi
saattanut minua niin jakamattoman tyytyväiseksi. Messick oli sangen
hyvä, vaikka vähän ulonmakuinen, mutta todelliseen ravintoarvoon ja
maukkuuteen nähden oli Harris numero yksi. Messickillä oli hänelläkin
hyvät puolensa -- sitä minä en tahdo enkä voikaan kieltää -- mutta
hän oli yhtä vähän sopiva aamiaiseksi kuin muumio -- vai niin.
Laihako? Kyllä, se minun täytyy myöntää!

-- Entä sitkeä?

-- Oi, hän oli niin kauhean sitkeä! En voi koskaan teille kuvitella,
miten sitkeä hän oli!

-- Ette kai tahtone väittää, että se tosiaankin...

-- Suvaitkaa olla keskeyttämättä minua. Aamiaisen jälkeen valitsimme
me päivälliseksi erään Warker nimisen miehen Detroitista. Hän oli
sangen hyvä. Minä kirjoitin siitä sittemmin hänen vaimolleen. Hän
oli mitä suurimman kiitoksen arvoinen. Minä tulen aina muistamaan
Warkeria. Hän oli vähän raaka mutta kovin hyvä. Ja seuraavana
aamuna oli meillä aamiaiseksi Morgan Alabamasta. Hän oli hienompia
miehiä, joiden kanssa koskaan olen ollut tekemisissä -- kaunis,
sivistynyt, siloutunut, puhui sujuvasti useita kieliä -- täydellinen
gentlemanni -- niin, hän oli täydellinen gentlemanni ja tavattoman
mehevä. Päivälliseksi oli meillä se Oregonin patriarkka, ja hän _oli_
tosiaankin kaiken arvostelun ulkopuolella -- vanha luiseva, sitkeä,
oi, te ette voi ajatella toista senkaltaista! Lopuksi sanoin minä:

-- Hyvät herrat, voitte tehdä niinkuin haluatte, _mutta_ minä odotan
ensi vaalia.

Ja Grimes, Illinoisista sanoi:

-- Hyvät herrat, _minä_ odotan myös. Kun valitsette miehen, jolla on
_jotakin_ edellytyksiä meitä tyydyttääksemme, niin olen minä jälleen
mukana.

Pian ilmeni, että oltiin tyytymättömiä Oregonin Davidiin, ja sen
vilpoisan mielialan ylläpitämiseksi, joka oli vallinnut sen jälkeen
kun meillä oli ollut Harris, toimitettiin uusi vaali, ja tulos oli
se että Barker Georgiasta tuli valituksi. Hän oli ihana! Niin...
niin... sitte oli meillä Doolitle ja Hawkis ja Mc Elroy (sitä vähän
valitettiin, että Mc Elroy oli tavattoman pieni ja hintelä) ja
Benrad ja kaksi Smithiä ja Bailey (Baileyllä oli puujalat ja se
oli vahinko, mutta muuten oli hän hyvä) ja muuan intialainen poika
ja muuan posetiivinsoittaja ja eräs Buckminster niminen herra --
irtolaisraukka, joka ei ollut erittäin kehuttava aamiaiseksi eikä
juuri seuralaiseksikaan. Olimme iloisia siitä että hänet oli ehditty
valita ennenkuin apu saapui.

-- Vai niin, _tuliko_ siis apua tosiaankin lopuksi?

-- Tuli, apu tuli eräänä kauniina, aurinkoisena aamuna juuri vaalin
jälkeen. John Murphy tuli valituksi, eikä arvokkaampaa olisi
koskaan voitu valita, sen vakuutan, mutta John Murphy tuli kotiinsa
meidän mukanamme junalla, joka tuli meitä auttamaan. Sitte meni hän
naimisiin rouva Harrisin kanssa...

-- Leskenkö...

-- Ensiksi valitun lesken. Hän meni naimisiin lesken kanssa ja elää
vielä tänäkin päivänä onnellisena ja arvossa pidettynä ja voiden
erittäin hyvin. Niin, se on oikea romaani, herra, -- oikea romaani.
Tässä on minun asemani, herra, nyt täytyy minun sanoa teille
hyvästi. Jos teillä on tilaisuus tulla tervehtimään minua päiväksi
tahi pariksi, niin olette sydämmellisesti tervetullut. Minä pidän
teistä, herra; minä tunnen oikein mieltymystä teihin. Luulen voivani
pitää teistä yhtä paljon kuin pidin Harrisista. Hyvästi, herrani!
Onnellista matkaa!

Hän oli poissa. En koskaan elämässäni ollut tuntenut itseäni niin
hämmästyneeksi, niin pelästyneeksi, niin puusta pudonneeksi, Mutta
muuten olin iloissani siitä että hän oli mennyt tiehensä. Miten hieno
olikaan ollut hänen käytöstapansa ja miten herttainen hänen äänensä.
Minua värisytti, kun hän iski nälkäiset silmänsä minuun; ja kun
kuulin saavuttaneeni hänen isällisen mieltymyksensä ja olevani hänen
silmissään melkein yhtä suuressa kunniassa kuin Harris, niin oli
sydämeni lakata sykkimästä!

Minä olin hämilläni niin ettei sitä voi kuvailla. Minä en epäillyt
hänen sanojaan; minä en voinut epäillä kertomuksen ainoatakaan
yksityiskohtaa, joilla oli mitä juhlallisimman totuuden leima, mutta
tarinan kauhistuttavat puolet saattoivat minut ihan pois suunniltaan.
Minä huomasin, että konduktööri katsoi minuun: Minä kysyin:

-- Kuka tuo mies oli?

-- Hän oli kongressin jäsen entisaikaan ja kaikkein huomatuimpia.
Mutta sitte sattui kerran hänen junansa tarttumaan kiinni
lumikinoksiin ja hän oli kuolla nälkään. Hän oli melkein kokonaan
paleltunut ja nälän näännyttämä ja hän oli sairaana ja mielipuolena
pari kolme kuukautta sen perästä. Nyt hän on taas terve, mutta
hänellä on omat päähänpistonsa, ja kun hän pääsee puhumaan siitä
tapahtumasta, ei hän hellitä ennenkuin on syönyt suuhunsa kaikki ne
matkustajat, joista hän puhuu. Hänellä on heidän nimensä muistissaan
yhtä selvänä kuin se että kaksi kertaa kaksi on neljä. Kun hän on
saanut syöneeksi kaikki muut paitsi itseään, sanoo hän aina:

-- Sitte tuli tavallinen aamiaisvaalin toimittamisen aika, ja koska
mitään vastalauseita ei tehty, tulin minä asianmukaisesti valituksi,
ja siinä loppu.

Tuntui tavattoman helpottavalta tietää, että olin kuullut ainoastaan
höperön viattomia mielikuvituksia sen sijaan että ne olisivat olleet
verenjanoisen ihmissyöjän todellisia kokemuksia.




VILUSTUMISTA VASTAAN


On ehkä hyvä kirjottaa yleisön huviksikin, mutta paljon ylevämpää
ja jalompaa on kirjottaa sen valistamiseksi, sen hyödyksi. Tällä
kirjotuksella on ainoastaan viimeksi mainittu tarkotus. Jos se voi
parantaa jonkin kärsivän yksilön terveyden kanssaihmisteni seassa,
sytyttää toivon ja iloisuuden tulen hänen sammuviin silmiinsä ja
jälleen henkiin herättää menneitten päiväin reippaat, jalot tunnelmat
hänen kuolleessa sydämessään, niin tulevat vaivani kyllin palkituiksi
ja minun sieluni täyttää se onnellinen autuus, jota kristitty tuntee
tehtyään hyvän ja omaa etua pyytämättömän työn.

Koska minä olen elänyt puhdasta ja tahratonta elämää, on minulla
oikeus uskoa, ettei kukaan, joka minut tuntee, tule hylkäämään niitä
neuvoja, joita nyt aijon antaa, pelosta että minä muka koettaisin
pettää häntä. Lukekoon yleisö seuraavassa esittämäni kokemukset
vilustumisen parantamisessa ja seuratkoon sitte minun esimerkkiäni.

Eräässä Virginiassa sattuneessa tulipalossa kadotin minä kotini,
onneni, terveyteni ja kapsäkkini. Kahdesta ensinmainitusta
vahingosta ei nyt maksa puhua, sillä kodin ilman äitiä tahi sisarta
tahi jotain kaukaista naissukulaista, joka korjaamalla talteen
likaiset liinavaatteet tahi edes noutamalla saappaat uuninkomerosta
muistuttaisi siitä että on edes joku, joka ajattelee ja rakastaa --
sellaisen kodinhan voi helposti hankkia sijaan. Enkä minä paljon
piitannut onneni kadottamisestakaan, sillä koska kerran en ollut
mikään runoilija, ei alakuloisuus olisi kauvan mieltäni painanut.

Mutta hyvän terveyden ja paremmanpuoleisen kapsäkin menettäminen oli
tuntuvampi kolaus.

Sinä päivänä, jolloin tulipalo sattui, vilustuin minä ankarasti
ylenmäärin ponnisteltuani pelastaakseni jotakin. Päälle päätteeksi ei
minulla ollut mitään hyötyä suunnitelmastani tulen sammuttamiseksi,
sillä se suunnitelma oli niin monimutkainen, etten saanut edes sitä
valmiiksi ennenkuin puoli viikkoa perästäpäin.

Kun ensi kerran aloin ryhtyä varokeinoihin vilustumista vastaan,
kehotti minua muuan ystäväni pesemään jalkani lämpimällä vedellä ja
sitte menemään maata. Minä tein sen. Kohta sen perästä neuvoi minulle
eräs toinen ystävä kylmää suihkua. Minä otin senkin. Tunnin perästä
sanoi minulle muuan toinen sääntönä olevan, että vilustuessa on
syötävä ja kuumeessa sulatettava. Minulla oli kumpaakin. Minä katsoin
senvuoksi parhaaksi ahmia vatsani täyteen vilustumisen vuoksi ja olla
siitä mitään mainitsematta kuumeelle ja antaa sen sitte sulaa jonkin
aikaa.

Sellaisessa tapauksessa kuin tämä en minä tee tavallisesti
mitään puolinaista; minä söin oikein vahvasti, tein tuttavuutta
erään tuntemattoman herran kanssa, joka juuri samana aamuna
oli avannut uuden ravintolansa; hän seisoi hiukan loitompana
ja odotti kunnioittavan äänettömänä, kunnes olin lopettanut
vilustumissyömiseni, ja kysyi sitte, tokko ihmiset täällä Virginiassa
olivat paljon vilustumisen vaarassa? Minä vastasin, että niin luulin
olevan.

Hän meni ulos ja irrotti sylttinsä seinältä sulkeakseen koko
ravintolaliikkeensä.

Minä läksin konttoriini ja tapasin tiellä muutaman tuttuni, joka
selitti, että _jos_ yleensä tahdottiin parantaa vilustumista, niin
oli juotava neljänneskannua lämmintä suolavettä. Minä luulin, että
sisälleni tuskin enää olisi sopinut, mutta koetin kumminkin. Tulos
oli hämmästyttävä. Luulin melkein, että kuolematoin sieluni purkautuu
ulos.

Kun minä nyt kerron kokemuksiani ainoastaan niiden hyödyksi,
jotka potevat nyt mainitsemaani tautia, niin toivon minä, että
he ymmärtävät varotukseni käyttämästä sellaisia parannuskeinoja,
jotka minusta tuntuivat tehottomilta, ja sitä näkökohtaa silmällä
pitäen varotan minä heitä juomasta lämmintä suolavettä. Se on
kenties hyvinkin hyvä lääke, mutta minusta se on ehdottomasti
liian voimakasta. Jos kaulani vielä kerran vilustuisi ja minulla
olisi valittavana joko maanjäristys tahi neljänneskannua lämmintä
suolavettä, niin koettaisin ensiksimainittua.

Sitte kun vatsassani raivonnut myrsky oli asettunut eikä enää ketään
laupeita samarialaisia ollut teillä eikä kujilla, lainailin minä
edelleenkin nenäliinoja niistääkseni ne rikki pieniksi palasiksi,
niinkuin olin tehnyt vilustumisen ensi kautena. Silloin tapasin
minä erään naisen, joka juuri oli tullut sisämaasta ja joka sanoi
asuneensa sellaisella seudulla, missä lääkäreitä oli harvassa.
Välttämättömyyden pakottamana oli hän tottunut parantelemaan
yksinkertaisia pikkutauteja. Minä arvelin, että hänellä oli
äärettömän suuri kokemus alallaan, sillä hän näytti ainakin
sadanviidenkymmenen vuoden vanhalta.

Hän valmisti sekotuksen siirapista, sievedestä, tärpätistä ja
muutamista muista aineksista ja kehotti minua juomaan lääkettä
viinilasin verran joka viidestoista minuutti. Minä otin sitä vaan
yhden annoksen, se riitti; se poisti minulta kaikki moraaliset
käsitteet ja sai hereille luontoni huonoimmat taipumukset. Sen
huonosta vaikutuksesta hiipi aivoihini kaikenmoisia alentavia
ajatuksia, mutta käteni olivat liian heikot voidakseni ryhtyä niitä
toteuttamaan; elleivät minun voimani olisi uupuneet vilustumisen
vuoksi käyttämistäni luotettavista parannuskeinoista, olen varma
siitä että samalla hetkellä olisin voinut ryöstää vaikka kirkkomaan.

Niinkuin useimmilla muillakin ihmisillä, on minullakin usein ollut
alhaisia vaikuttimia, mutta en koskaan ennenkun nautin nuo lääkkeet
ollut tuntenut nahkassani sellaista yliluonnollista roistomaisuutta
ja ollut vielä ylpeä siitä. Parin päivän kuluttua olin taas valmis
alottamaan laastaroimisen itseni kanssa. Otin muutamia vaarattomampia
lääkkeitä ja onnistuin viimein ajamaan vilustuksen päästä
keuhkoihin.

Aloin yskiä lakkaamatta ja ääneni laski nolla-asteen alapuolelle;
minä puhuin ukkosen kaltaisella bassoäänellä, kahta oktaavia
alemmassa äänilajissa kuin tavallisesti. Unta sain ainoastaan
rykimällä itseni lopen väsyksiin, mutta heti kun aloin puhella
unissani, heräsin rämisevään ääneeni.

Minun tilani kävi vakavammaksi päivä päivältä. Minulle annettiin
puhdasta paloviinaa, join sitä. Sitte paloviinaa ja siirappia;
sitä nautin myöskin. Sitte paloviinaa ja valkosipulia; minä panin
siirappia joukkoon ja nautin kaikkia kolmea sekasin. En huomannut
mitään erityistä tulosta.

Minä katsoin parhaaksi matkustaa terveyteni hoitamista varten.
Matkustin Tahoe-järvelle sanomalehtimiestoverini Wilsonin kanssa. On
ihan hupaista muistella, miten komeasti me matkustimme. Me ajoimme
samoissa kyytivaunuissa kullankaivajain kanssa, ja ystävälläni oli
kaikki matkakapineet mukanaan, nimittäin kaksi hienoa, silkkistä
nenäliinaa ja äidinäitinsä valokuva. Me purjehdimme ja metsästimme
ja kalastimme ja tanssimme kaiket päivät ja minä lääkitsin yskääni
kaiket yöt. Mutta sairauteni tuli yhä pahemmaksi ja pahemmaksi.

Minulle suositettiin kylmiä kääreitä. En ollut vielä
koskaan vastustanut mitään parantamiskeinoa ja minusta tuntui
epäjohdonmukaiselta vastustaa nytkään; päätin senvuoksi koettaa
kylmiä kääreitä, vaikkei minulla ollut aavistustakaan siitä
minkälaista se mahtoi olla.

Niitä annettiin minulle keskiyön aikaan ja ulkona oli hyvin
kylmä. Rinta ja selkä riisuttiin paljaaksi ja jääkylmässä vedessä
liotettu lakana (se näytti tuhat metriä pitkältä) käärittiin minun
ympärilleni, kunnes minä olin sellaisen rasuluudan näköinen, jolla
tykkejä puhdistetaan.

Se on julma keino. Kun kylmä lakana sattuu lämpimään ihoon,
silloin hypähtää rajusti ylös ja pidättää henkeään, aivan kuin
kuolinkamppailussa. Ytimet säärissäni jäätyivät ja sydämeni lakkasi
sykkimästä. Luulin viimeisen hetkeni tulleen.

Älkää koskaan suvaitko kylmiä kääreitä, -- älkää koskaan. Lähinnä
sitä seikkaa, että tapaat tutun naisen, joka -- syistä, jotka hän
itse parhaiten tietää -- ei näe sinua, vaikka katsoo sinuun, eikä
tunne sinua vaikka näkee sinun, on tämä kaikkein kauheinta maailmassa.

Mutta kun kylmät kääreet eivät voineet parantaa minun yskääni,
kehotti muuan ystävätär panemaan sinappilaastarin rinnan päälle.
Minä luulen, että se tosiaankin olisi minut parantanut, jos nuorta
Wilsonia ei olisi ollut. Sänkyyn mennessäni asetin sinappilaastarin
-- joka oli tavattoman suuri, kahdeksantoista neliötuumaa -- viereeni
tuolille, niin että voisin sen ottaa silloin kuin haluaisin. Mutta
nuorelle Wilsonille tuli yöllä nälkä ja...

Oltuani viikon verran Tahoe-järven rannalla matkustin
Steamboat-Springsiin, ja paitsi höyrykylpyjä nautin inhottavinta
lääkettä mitä milloinkaan on valmistettu. Se olisi kyllä parantanut
minut, mutta minun täytyi palata Virginiaan, jossa minun, huolimatta
päivittäin nauttimistani monista lääkkeistä, onnistui lisätä
sairauttani senkautta että en ollenkaan pelännyt ja kävin liian
ohuesti puettuna.

Lopuksi päätin matkustaa San Franciskoon ja ensi päivänä siellä
ollessani neuvoi eräs nainen minua juomaan tuopin whiskyä
vuorokaudessa ja muuan ystäväni neuvoi sitä samaa. Jok'ainoa kehotti
minua juomaan tuopin; siitä tuli yhteensä kannu. Minä join sen, mutta
vieläkin elän.

Mitä ystävällisimmässä tarkotuksessa olen nyt kertonut kaikille
sairaille ja kärsiville niistä monista parannuskeinoista, joita minä
viime aikoina olen käyttänyt. Koetelkoot hekin niitä; ellei niistä
ole heille apua, niin eihän se muuta haittaa kuin ottaa heistä
korkeintaan hengen.




SIIVOOJATTARET


Kaikkiin siivoojattariin, olkootpa minkä ikäisiä tahi minkä maalaisia
tahansa, kohdistan minä kaikkien poikamiesten kirouksen! Senvuoksi
että:

He asettavat aina päänaluksen väärään päähän, niin että kun tupakoi
ja lukee ennen nukkumistaan (mikä on poikamiesten vanha, kunniallinen
tapa), täytyy pitää kirjaa ylhäällä epämukavassa asennossa, niin
ettei kaasuvalo loista suoraan silmiin.

Kun he aamulla näkevät, että päänalus on muutettu sängyn toiseen
päähän, eivät he huomaa sitä pieneksi, ystävälliseksi viittaukseksi,
vaan ylpeillen rajattomasta vallastaan ja tuntematta vähääkään
sääliväisyyttä meitä kohtaan laittavat he vuoteen aivan samalla
tavalla kuin ennenkin ja salaa nauttivat siitä kiusasta, jota heidän
tyranniutensa meille tuottaa.

Vaikka he taaskin näkevät, että tyyny on muutettu, tekevät he vanhan
tapansa mukaan ja koettavat siten katkeroittaa sitä elämää, jonka
herramme on meille antanut.

Elleivät he voi muulla tavalla saada valoa epäedulliseen asemaan,
niin muuttavat he sängyn.

Jos sinä vedät matka-arkkusi hiukan ulommas seinästä, niin että arkun
kansi voi pysyä auki: niin työntävät he aina arkkusi seinään kiinni.
Sitä tekevät he vallan innolla.

Jos tahdot saada sylkilaatikon johonkin määrättyyn paikkaan, panevat
he sen aina aivan toisaalle.

He panevat aina tohvelisi sopimattomiin paikkoihin. Etenkin on heille
nautintoa työntää ne niin kauvas sängyn alle kuin seinä sallii. He
tekevät sen siitä syystä että sinä olisit pakotettu kumartumaan
vähemmän miellyttävään asentoon ja onkimaan niitä pimeässä
saappaillasi ja kiroilemaan.

He asettavat aina tulitikkulaatikon väärään paikkaan. He miettivät
sille jokaista päivää varten uuden paikan ja panevat pullon tahi
jonkun muun helposti särkyvän lasiastian siihen missä tikkulaatikko
ennen oli ollut. He tahtovat siten narrata sinua särkemään
lasiesineen pimeässä kuleksiessasi ja tuottaa senkautta sinulle
harmia.

He muuttelevat alituiseen huonekaluja. Kun tulet yöllä huoneeseesi,
voit olla varma siitä että löydät kirjotuspöydän siitä missä
vaatekaappi oli aamulla. Ja jos aamulla ulosmennessäsi näet
likaämpärin ovella ja keinutuolin akkunan luona, niin tullessasi
kotiin keskiyön seudussa kompastut yli keinutuolin ja akkunan luo
tultuasi istuudut likaämpäriin. Sinä suutut. Heistä se on hauskaa.

Panetpa mihin tahansa jonkin esineen, eivät he anna sen olla
siinä. He muuttavat sen toiseen paikkaan heti kun tulevat. Se on
jo mennyt heidän veriinsä. Heitä huvittaa ilkeyden tekeminen ja
niskotteleminen. He kuolisivat, jos eivät saisi olla häijyjä.

He keräilevät aina kaikki vanhat sanomalehtipalaset, jotka sinä olet
heittänyt lattialle, ja järjestävät ne huolellisesti pöydällesi,
mutta sytyttävät tulen takkaan arvokkailla käsikirjoituksillasi.
Jos sinulla on jokin vanha arvoton paperilappu, josta välttämättä
tahdot päästä erillesi, niin heitäppä se mihin nurkkaan tahansa, ovat
kuitenkin kaikki ponnistuksesi turhia, sillä he aina nuuskivat sen
lapun käsiinsä ja panevat sen joka päivä pöydällesi samaan paikkaan.
Se tekee hyvää heidän sieluilleen.

Ja he käyttävät hiusöljyä enemmän kuin kuusi miestä. Jos heitä
syytetään siitä että he ovat sitä varastaneet, valehtelevat he
itsensä vapaiksi. Ajattelevatko he jotain toista elämää tämän elämän
jälkeen? Eivät pennin edestä.

Jos sinä jätät avaimen ovelle mukavuuden vuoksi, vievät he sen
konttoriin ja antavat portinvartijalle. Syynä siihen on heillä muka
olevinaan se että tahtovat suojella omaisuuttasi varkailta; mutta
itse asiassa tekevät he sen pakottaakseen sinun juoksemaan rappuja
edestakaisin, tultuasi väsyksissä kotiin, tahi lähettävät palvelijan
sitä tuomaan, ja tuo palvelija tietysti odottaa, että sinä antaisit
hänelle juomarahoja. Ja minä otaksun, että tässä tapauksessa jakavat
nuo syvälle vajonneet lurjukset rahat keskenään.

He haluavat laittaa sänkysi kuntoon ennenkuin olet noussut ylös,
häiritäkseen siten sinun untasi ja saattaakseen sinut raivostumaan;
mutta kun olet noussut ylös, palaavat he vasta seuraavana päivänä.

He tekevät kaikkia konnantöitä mitä voi ajatella, ja sen he tekevät
ainoastaan ilkeydestä.

Siivoojattaret ovat kylmiä kaikille inhimillisille tunteille.

Jos saisin valtiopäivillä hyväksytyksi sellaisen ehdotuksen, joka
tarkottaisi siivoojattarien hävittämistä, niin ehdottomasti sen
tekisin.




PARTURIT


Kaikki muu voi muuttua, mutta ei parturit, ei heidän käytöstapansa
eikä heidän ympäristönsä. Ne eivät muutu koskaan. Mitä kokee
käydessään ensimäistä kertaa parturituvassa, sitä samaa kokee aina
kaikissa parturituvissa elämänsä viimeiseen päivään asti. Minä
ajatin partani tänäkin aamuna tavallisuuden mukaan. Eräs herra
lähestyi parturin ovea Jones Streetiltä juuri samaan aikaan kuin minä
lähestyin sitä Main Streetiltä -- sehän on niin tavallista. Minä
koetin kiiruhtaa, mutta se ei auttanut; hän pujahti ovesta sisälle
muutamaa askelta ennen minua, minä seurasin hänen kintereillään
ja näin hänen istuvan sille ainoalle vapaalle tuolille, joka oli
parhaan parturin hoidossa. Niinhän se aina käy. Minä istahdin toivoen
saavani sen tuolin, jota hoiti etevämpi niistä toisista partureista,
sillä hän oli jo alkanut kammata kerittävänsä tukkaa, kun hänen
toverinsa ei vielä ollut ehtinyt edes öljytä oman miehensä hiuksia.
Minä odottelin jännityksellä. Kun näin, että numero 2 alkoi voittaa
numero 1:htä, muuttui jännitykseni levottomuudeksi. Kun n:o 1
keskeytti hetkeksi työnsä ottaakseen eräältä äsken tulleelta maksua
päänpuhdistuspiletistä ja päästi siten toverinsa menemään edelle,
muuttui levottomuuteni tuskaksi. Kun n:o 1 ryhtyi jälleen työhönsä
ja kun he molemmat yht'aikaa ottivat pois liinan ja puhdistivat
pois liian puuderin ajelluilta poskilta, niin riippui hiuskarvasta,
kumpiko ehtisi ennemmin sanoa: "Olkaa niin hyvä!" ja sydämeni ihan
sytkytti jännityksestä. Mutta kun n:o 1 viimeisessä silmänräpäyksessä
pysähtyi suoriakseen pari kertaa kundinsa kulmakarvoja, näin minä,
että hän oli hävinnyt, ja minä nousin ylös harmistuneena ja läksin
ulos pelastuakseni joutumasta n:o 2:den käsiin, sillä minulla ei ole
niin suurta luonnonlujuutta, että tyynesti voisin katsella odottavaa
parturia silmiin ja sanoa hänelle odottavansa niin kauvan kuin hänen
toverinsa tuoli joutuu vapaaksi.

Olin neljännestunnin ulkona ja tulin sitte takaisin toivoen
onnistuvani paremmin. Nyt olivat tietysti kaikki tuolit ylösotetut
ja lisäksi istui neljä miestä vuoroaan odottamassa äänettöminä,
miettiväisinä, tuskastuneina, ilman seuraa, niinkuin tavallisesti
aina odotellessaan vuoroaan parturituvassa. Minä istahdin
muutamalle vanhalle rautaselkäiselle sohvalle ja kulutin aikaani
tutkimalla seinille kiinnitettyjä ilmotuksia kaikemmoisista
hiustenvärjäysvoiteista. Sitte luin rasvaiset nimet yksityisten
henkilöiden hiuskonjakkipulloista; luin yksityisten parranajokuppien
nimet ja numerot; tutkin seinillä olevia, kärpästen tahrimia
ja rikkinäisiä painokuvia, jotka esittivät tappeluita, entisiä
presidenttejä, huolettomasti loikoilevia sultaanin vaimoja ja tuota
ijankaiken inhottavaa nuorta tyttöä, joka panee nenälleen isoisänsä
silmälasit; vannoin sydämessäni kirousta ja kuolemaa isoisälle
kanarialinnulle ja inhottavan äreälle papukaijalle, joita on melkein
kaikissa parturituvissa. Viimein sain käsiini erään eheämmän
viimevuotisen kuvalehden, joka oli muutamalla likaisella pöydällä
keskellä huonetta, ja katselin sen vääristettyjä esityksiä vanhoista,
jo unohtuneista tapahtumista.

Lopuksi tuli minun vuoroni. Muuan ääni lausui: "olkaa niin hyvä!" ja
minä istahdin tuolille -- tietysti numero 2. Sanoin kohteliaasti,
että minulla oli kiire, ja se teki häneen niin syvän vaikutuksen
kuin olisi hän kuullut ensi kerran elämässään. Hän tuuppasi pääni
syrjään ja kiersi liinan kaulaani. Hän kopeloi hiuksiani kynsillään
ja selitti, että ne olisivat leikattavat. Minä sanoin, etten sitä
halunnut. Hän pöyhötteli uudelleen ja sanoi, että ne olivat liian
pitkät nykyisen muodin mukaisiksi -- sopisi niitä hiukan lyhentää,
varsinkin takapuolelta. Minä sanoin, että olin ne leikkuuttanut vasta
viikko sitten. Hän seisoi hetkisen vaiti ja katseli luultavasti
tukkaani ja kysyi sitte ylenkatseellisella äänellä, kuka ne oli
leikannut. Minä riensin vastaamaan:

-- Te itse!

Olin saanut hänet kiinni. Hän alkoi nyt sotkea saippuakuohustaan ja
katsella peiliin, silloin tällöin kokonaan pysähtyen ja asettuen ihan
peilin eteen tarkasti tutkimaan leukaansa tahi pusertamaan poskestaan
jotain näppylää. Sitte saippuoi hän toisen puolen kasvojani
perinpohjin ja aikoi juuri ryhtyä saippuoimaan toista puolta, kun
kadulla tappelevat koirat kiinnittivät hänen huomiotaan, ja hän
juoksi akkunan luo ja seisoi siinä ja katseli niin kauvan kun tappelu
oli loppunut ja hän menettänyt tappelun tuloksesta lyömässään vedossa
kaksi shillinkiä tovereilleen -- seikka, joka minua suuresti huvitti.
Hän lopetti saippuoimisen eikä pistänyt saippuaharjaa suuhuni kuin
kaksi kertaa. Sitte alkoi hän hieroa saippuoitua leukaani kädellään
ja puhellessaan samalla toisten parturien kanssa koirain tappelusta
ajoi tietysti suuhuni koko joukon saippuakuohusta tietämättään, mutta
minä sen tiesin.

Nyt alkoi hän hangata partaveistään vanhaan remmiin ja viivähti
kotvasen keskustellessaan eräistä naamiohuveista, joissa hän
edellisenä iltana oli ollut punaseen kaapuun ja kärpännahkalta
näyttävään viittaan puettuna -- esittäen jonkillaista kuningasta.
Hän ihastui siitä että toverinsa laskivat leikkiä hänestä ja eräästä
neitosesta, jota hän oli mielistellyt. Hän halusi kaikin keinoin
jatkaa keskustelua teeskennellen suuttuvansa toisten pilasta.
Tuosta tarinasta sai hän aiheen katsella uudestaan peiliin: hän
pani pois partaveitsen ja suki hiuksiaan sangen huolellisesti, veti
pienen kiehkuran otsalle ja suori sivuilta tukkansa korvilleen
turhantarkasti. Sillävälin kuivui kuohus kasvoilleni ja imeytyi
nähtävästi hikihuokosiin.

Nyt alkoi hän parranajamisen, iski sormensa minun kasvoihini, piteli
nenästäni kuin ovenrivasta, tyrkki ja tuuppi päätäni sinne tänne,
aina sen mukaan kuin mukavuutensa sitä vaati, ja koko ajan ryki ja
syleksi sydämensä pohjasta. Niin kauvan kun hän ajeli kasvojeni
karkeampia osia, en tuntenut mitään, mutta kun hän alkoi nypistellä
ja raappia kaulanahkaani, tuli minulle kyyneleet silmiin. Minä en
välittänyt siitä että hän tuli minua kovin lähelle, en välittänyt
hänen valkosipulinhajustaankaan, sillä luulen kaikkien parturien
syövän valkosipulia, mutta eräs muu seikka saattoi minut luulemaan,
että hän oli ruvennut happanemaan sisäpuolelta jo elossa ollessaan,
ja se teki minut ylen levottomaksi. Nyt työnsi hän sormensa minun
suuhuni, saadakseen ylähuulen paremmin ajelluksi ja silloin tein
minä sen havainnon, että hänen toimenaan parturituvassa oli
fotogeenilamppujen täyttäminen. Olen usein ajatellut, mahtoiko se
olla parturien tehtävä vaiko siivoojattaren.

Nyt koetin minä huvikseni arvailla, mistä paikasta hän mahtaisi
sillä kertaa leikata, mutta hän ehtikin raapaista leukaani ennenkuin
arveluni oli johtanut mihinkään tulokseen. Heti terotti hän
partaveistään -- sen olisi voinut tehdä jo ennemmin. Minä en halua
tulla ajelluksi liian sileäksi ja sanoin senvuoksi, ettei tarvitse
ajella toistamiseen. Koetin saada hänen panemaan pois veitsensä,
sillä pelkäsin, että hän iskee sen kaulaani juuri siihen missä on
kaikkein arin kohta ja jota partaveitsi ei voi kahta kertaa sivellä
saamatta aikaan onnettomuutta. Mutta hän selitti silittävänsä vaan
pienen epätasaisen jäljen, ja samassa hipasi partaveitsi kiellettyä
paikkaa ja verenvuoto oli itsestään selvä. Hän kastoi pyyhinliinansa
kulman rohdosliuokseen ja hosui sillä kasvojani ylen kummallisesti,
niin ettei kukaan muu ihminen tee samalla tavalla pestessään toisen
kasvoja. Sitte kuivasi hän kaulani ja kasvoni hosuen pyyhinliinan
kuivalla osalla, ikäänkuin sillä tavalla ei koskaan kuivattaisi;
mutta parturi ei juuri koskaan kohtele kundiaan niinkuin kristittyä
ihmistä. Sitte pani hän pyyheliinallaan haavaan rohdosliuosta,
senperästä jotain pulveria, sitte taaskin liuosta ja olisi kai
jatkanut sitä peliä iankaikkisesti ellen minä olisi pyytänyt hänen
lopettamaan... Nyt puuteroi hän koko kasvoni ja alkoi miettiväisenä
sukia minun tukkaani ja tutkia sormiaan. Sitte sanoi hän, että
hiukseni olisivat välttämättä pestävät. Minä huomautin, että olin
pessyt ne perinpohjin kylpiessäni eilen. Olin taas saanut hänet
kiinni. Sitte suositteli hän Smithin hiusvoidetta ja tahtoi myydä
sitä minulle yhden pullon. Minä kieltäysin ostamasta. Hän ylisteli
uutta "Jonesin hajuvettä" ja pyysi minun ostamaan sitä. En siihenkään
suostunut. Hän tarjosi jotain keksimäänsä hammaspulveria, ja kun minä
en siitä huolinut, halusi hän myydä minulle partaveitsiä.

Kun nämä kaupanhieromiset olivat menneet myttyyn, ryhtyi hän
taas työhönsä, kasteli minut aivan märäksi, yksin jalkanikin,
öljysi hiukseni vasten tahtoani, hieroi ja hankasi siitä harjalla
ison tukon irti ja kampasi sen, mitä jäi jälelle, pystyyn,
pyöräytti ikimuistettavan rakkaussuortuvan otsalle, ja suoriessaan
harvoja kulmakarvojani ja tahriessaan niitä voiteilla piti hän
pitkän esitelmän kaikista niistä tempuista, joita oli opettanut
foxterrier-koirilleen; silloin kuulin minä kellon lyövän kahtatoista
ja tiesin, että junani oli lähtenyt viisi minuuttia sitte. Silloin
irrotti hän liinan, pyyhki sillä kasvojani, suori vielä kerran
kulmakarvoja ja huusi iloisena vuoroaan odottavalle vieraalle vanhan
tunnussanansa: "Olkaa niin hyvä!"

Se sama parturi kompastui ja kuoli halvaukseen pari tuntia
senjälkeen. Minä jään tänne yhdeksi päiväksi saadakseni kostaa --
aijon pitää puheen hänen hautajaisissaan.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--I.[1]

BY MARK TWAIN.


     PREFATORY NOTE.--Mr. Clemens began to write his autobiography many
     years ago, and he continues to add to it day by day. It was his
     original intention to permit no publication of his memoirs until
     after his death; but, after leaving "Pier No. 70," he concluded
     that a considerable portion might now suitably be given to the
     public. It is that portion, garnered from the quarter-million of
     words already written, which will appear in this REVIEW during the
     coming year. No part of the autobiography will be published in book
     form during the lifetime of the author.--EDITOR N. A. R.


INTRODUCTION.

I intend that this autobiography shall become a model for all future
autobiographies when it is published, after my death, and I also intend
that it shall be read and admired a good many centuries because of its
form and method--a form and method whereby the past and the present are
constantly brought face to face, resulting in contrasts which newly fire
up the interest all along, like contact of flint with steel. Moreover,
this autobiography of mine does not select from my life its showy
episodes, but deals mainly in the common experiences which go to make up
the life of the average human being, because these episodes are of a
sort which he is familiar with in his own life, and in which he sees his
own life reflected and set down in print. The usual, conventional
autobiographer seems to particularly hunt out those occasions in his
career when he came into contact with celebrated persons, whereas his
contacts with the uncelebrated were just as interesting to him, and
would be to his reader, and were vastly more numerous than his
collisions with the famous.

Howells was here yesterday afternoon, and I told him the whole scheme of
this autobiography and its apparently systemless system--only apparently
systemless, for it is not really that. It is a deliberate system, and
the law of the system is that I shall talk about the matter which for
the moment interests me, and cast it aside and talk about something else
the moment its interest for me is exhausted. It is a system which
follows no charted course and is not going to follow any such course. It
is a system which is a complete and purposed jumble--a course which
begins nowhere, follows no specified route, and can never reach an end
while I am alive, for the reason that, if I should talk to the
stenographer two hours a day for a hundred years, I should still never
be able to set down a tenth part of the things which have interested me
in my lifetime. I told Howells that this autobiography of mine would
live a couple of thousand years, without any effort, and would then take
a fresh start and live the rest of the time.

He said he believed it would, and asked me if I meant to make a library
of it.

I said that that was my design; but that, if I should live long enough,
the set of volumes could not be contained merely in a city, it would
require a State, and that there would not be any multi-billionaire
alive, perhaps, at any time during its existence who would be able to
buy a full set, except on the instalment plan.

Howells applauded, and was full of praises and endorsement, which was
wise in him and judicious. If he had manifested a different spirit, I
would have thrown him out of the window. I like criticism, but it must
be my way.


I.

Back of the Virginia Clemenses is a dim procession of ancestors
stretching back to Noah's time. According to tradition, some of them
were pirates and slavers in Elizabeth's time. But this is no discredit
to them, for so were Drake and Hawkins and the others. It was a
respectable trade, then, and monarchs were partners in it. In my time I
have had desires to be a pirate myself. The reader--if he will look deep
down in his secret heart, will find--but never mind what he will find
there; I am not writing his Autobiography, but mine. Later, according to
tradition, one of the procession was Ambassador to Spain in the time of
James I, or of Charles I, and married there and sent down a strain of
Spanish blood to warm us up. Also, according to tradition, this one or
another--Geoffrey Clement, by name--helped to sentence Charles to death.

I have not examined into these traditions myself, partly because I was
indolent, and partly because I was so busy polishing up this end of the
line and trying to make it showy; but the other Clemenses claim that
they have made the examination and that it stood the test. Therefore I
have always taken for granted that I did help Charles out of his
troubles, by ancestral proxy. My instincts have persuaded me, too.
Whenever we have a strong and persistent and ineradicable instinct, we
may be sure that it is not original with us, but inherited--inherited
from away back, and hardened and perfected by the petrifying influence
of time. Now I have been always and unchangingly bitter against Charles,
and I am quite certain that this feeling trickled down to me through the
veins of my forebears from the heart of that judge; for it is not my
disposition to be bitter against people on my own personal account I am
not bitter against Jeffreys. I ought to be, but I am not. It indicates
that my ancestors of James II's time were indifferent to him; I do not
know why; I never could make it out; but that is what it indicates. And
I have always felt friendly toward Satan. Of course that is ancestral;
it must be in the blood, for I could not have originated it.

... And so, by the testimony of instinct, backed by the assertions of
Clemenses who said they had examined the records, I have always been
obliged to believe that Geoffrey Clement the martyr-maker was an
ancestor of mine, and to regard him with favor, and in fact pride. This
has not had a good effect upon me, for it has made me vain, and that is
a fault. It has made me set myself above people who were less fortunate
in their ancestry than I, and has moved me to take them down a peg, upon
occasion, and say things to them which hurt them before company.

A case of the kind happened in Berlin several years ago. William Walter
Phelps was our Minister at the Emperor's Court, then, and one evening he
had me to dinner to meet Count S., a cabinet minister. This nobleman was
of long and illustrious descent. Of course I wanted to let out the fact
that I had some ancestors, too; but I did not want to pull them out of
their graves by the ears, and I never could seem to get the chance to
work them in in a way that would look sufficiently casual. I suppose
Phelps was in the same difficulty. In fact he looked distraught, now and
then--just as a person looks who wants to uncover an ancestor purely by
accident, and cannot think of a way that will seem accidental enough.
But at last, after dinner, he made a try. He took us about his
drawing-room, showing us the pictures, and finally stopped before a rude
and ancient engraving. It was a picture of the court that tried Charles
I. There was a pyramid of judges in Puritan slouch hats, and below them
three bare-headed secretaries seated at a table. Mr. Phelps put his
finger upon one of the three, and said with exulting indifference--

"An ancestor of mine."

I put my finger on a judge, and retorted with scathing languidness--

"Ancestor of mine. But it is a small matter. I have others."

It was not noble in me to do it. I have always regretted it since. But
it landed him. I wonder how he felt? However, it made no difference in
our friendship, which shows that he was fine and high, notwithstanding
the humbleness of his origin. And it was also creditable in me, too,
that I could overlook it. I made no change in my bearing toward him, but
always treated him as an equal.

But it was a hard night for me in one way. Mr. Phelps thought I was the
guest of honor, and so did Count S.; but I didn't, for there was nothing
in my invitation to indicate it. It was just a friendly offhand note, on
a card. By the time dinner was announced Phelps was himself in a state
of doubt. Something had to be done; and it was not a handy time for
explanations. He tried to get me to go out with him, but I held back;
then he tried S., and he also declined. There was another guest, but
there was no trouble about him. We finally went out in a pile. There was
a decorous plunge for seats, and I got the one at Mr. Phelps's left, the
Count captured the one facing Phelps, and the other guest had to take
the place of honor, since he could not help himself. We returned to the
drawing-room in the original disorder. I had new shoes on, and they were
tight. At eleven I was privately crying; I couldn't help it, the pain
was so cruel. Conversation had been dead for an hour. S. had been due at
the bedside of a dying official ever since half past nine. At last we
all rose by one blessed impulse and went down to the street door without
explanations--in a pile, and no precedence; and so, parted.

The evening had its defects; still, I got my ancestor in, and was
satisfied.

Among the Virginian Clemenses were Jere. (already mentioned), and
Sherrard. Jere. Clemens had a wide reputation as a good pistol-shot, and
once it enabled him to get on the friendly side of some drummers when
they wouldn't have paid any attention to mere smooth words and
arguments. He was out stumping the State at the time. The drummers were
grouped in front of the stand, and had been hired by the opposition to
drum while he made his speech. When he was ready to begin, he got out
his revolver and laid it before him, and said in his soft, silky way--

"I do not wish to hurt anybody, and shall try not to; but I have got
just a bullet apiece for those six drums, and if you should want to play
on them, don't stand behind them."

Sherrard Clemens was a Republican Congressman from West Virginia in the
war days, and then went out to St. Louis, where the James Clemens branch
lived, and still lives, and there he became a warm rebel. This was after
the war. At the time that he was a Republican I was a rebel; but by the
time he had become a rebel I was become (temporarily) a Republican. The
Clemenses have always done the best they could to keep the political
balances level, no matter how much it might inconvenience them. I did
not know what had become of Sherrard Clemens; but once I introduced
Senator Hawley to a Republican mass meeting in New England, and then I
got a bitter letter from Sherrard from St. Louis. He said that the
Republicans of the North--no, the "mudsills of the North"--had swept
away the old aristocracy of the South with fire and sword, and it ill
became me, an aristocrat by blood, to train with that kind of swine. Did
I forget that I was a Lambton?

That was a reference to my mother's side of the house. As I have already
said, she was a Lambton--Lambton with a p, for some of the American
Lamptons could not spell very well in early times, and so the name
suffered at their hands. She was a native of Kentucky, and married my
father in Lexington in 1823, when she was twenty years old and he
twenty-four. Neither of them had an overplus of property. She brought
him two or three negroes, but nothing else, I think. They removed to the
remote and secluded village of Jamestown, in the mountain solitudes of
east Tennessee. There their first crop of children was born, but as I
was of a later vintage I do not remember anything about it. I was
postponed--postponed to Missouri. Missouri was an unknown new State and
needed attractions.

I think that my eldest brother, Orion, my sisters Pamela and Margaret,
and my brother Benjamin were born in Jamestown. There may have been
others, but as to that I am not sure. It was a great lift for that
little village to have my parents come there. It was hoped that they
would stay, so that it would become a city. It was supposed that they
would stay. And so there was a boom; but by and by they went away, and
prices went down, and it was many years before Jamestown got another
start. I have written about Jamestown in the "Gilded Age," a book of
mine, but it was from hearsay, not from personal knowledge. My father
left a fine estate behind him in the region round about
Jamestown--75,000 acres.[2] When he died in 1847 he had owned it about
twenty years. The taxes were almost nothing (five dollars a year for the
whole), and he had always paid them regularly and kept his title
perfect. He had always said that the land would not become valuable in
his time, but that it would be a commodious provision for his children
some day. It contained coal, copper, iron and timber, and he said that
in the course of time railways would pierce to that region, and then the
property would be property in fact as well as in name. It also produced
a wild grape of a promising sort. He had sent some samples to Nicholas
Longworth, of Cincinnati, to get his judgment upon them, and Mr.
Longworth had said that they would make as good wine as his Catawbas.
The land contained all these riches; and also oil, but my father did not
know that, and of course in those early days he would have cared nothing
about it if he had known it. The oil was not discovered until about
1895. I wish I owned a couple of acres of the land now. In which case I
would not be writing Autobiographies for a living. My father's dying
charge was, "Cling to the land and wait; let nothing beguile it away
from you." My mother's favorite cousin, James Lampton, who figures in
the "Gilded Age" as "Colonel Sellers," always said of that land--and
said it with blazing enthusiasm, too,--"There's millions in
it--millions!" It is true that he always said that about everything--and
was always mistaken, too; but this time he was right; which shows that a
man who goes around with a prophecy-gun ought never to get discouraged;
if he will keep up his heart and fire at everything he sees, he is bound
to hit something by and by.

Many persons regarded "Colonel Sellers" as a fiction, an invention, an
extravagant impossibility, and did me the honor to call him a
"creation"; but they were mistaken. I merely put him on paper as he was;
he was not a person who could be exaggerated. The incidents which looked
most extravagant, both in the book and on the stage, were not inventions
of mine but were facts of his life; and I was present when they were
developed. John T. Raymond's audiences used to come near to dying with
laughter over the turnip-eating scene; but, extravagant as the scene
was, it was faithful to the facts, in all its absurd details. The thing
happened in Lampton's own house, and I was present. In fact I was myself
the guest who ate the turnips. In the hands of a great actor that
piteous scene would have dimmed any manly spectator's eyes with tears,
and racked his ribs apart with laughter at the same time. But Raymond
was great in humorous portrayal only. In that he was superb, he was
wonderful--in a word, great; in all things else he was a pigmy of the
pigmies.

The real Colonel Sellers, as I knew him in James Lampton, was a pathetic
and beautiful spirit, a manly man, a straight and honorable man, a man
with a big, foolish, unselfish heart in his bosom, a man born to be
loved; and he was loved by all his friends, and by his family
worshipped. It is the right word. To them he was but little less than a
god. The real Colonel Sellers was never on the stage. Only half of him
was there. Raymond could not play the other half of him; it was above
his level. That half was made up of qualities of which Raymond was
wholly destitute. For Raymond was not a manly man, he was not an
honorable man nor an honest one, he was empty and selfish and vulgar and
ignorant and silly, and there was a vacancy in him where his heart
should have been. There was only one man who could have played the whole
of Colonel Sellers, and that was Frank Mayo.[3]

It is a world of surprises. They fall, too, where one is least expecting
them. When I introduced Sellers into the book, Charles Dudley Warner,
who was writing the story with me, proposed a change of Seller's
Christian name. Ten years before, in a remote corner of the West, he had
come across a man named Eschol Sellers, and he thought that Eschol was
just the right and fitting name for our Sellers, since it was odd and
quaint and all that. I liked the idea, but I said that that man might
turn up and object. But Warner said it couldn't happen; that he was
doubtless dead by this time, a man with a name like that couldn't live
long; and be he dead or alive we must have the name, it was exactly the
right one and we couldn't do without it. So the change was made.
Warner's man was a farmer in a cheap and humble way. When the book had
been out a week, a college-bred gentleman of courtly manners and ducal
upholstery arrived in Hartford in a sultry state of mind and with a
libel suit in his eye, and _his_ name was Eschol Sellers! He had never
heard of the other one, and had never been within a thousand miles of
him. This damaged aristocrat's programme was quite definite and
businesslike: the American Publishing Company must suppress the edition
as far as printed, and change the name in the plates, or stand a suit
for $10,000. He carried away the Company's promise and many apologies,
and we changed the name back to Colonel Mulberry Sellers, in the plates.
Apparently there is nothing that cannot happen. Even the existence of
two unrelated men wearing the impossible name of Eschol Sellers is a
possible thing.

James Lampton floated, all his days, in a tinted mist of magnificent
dreams, and died at last without seeing one of them realized. I saw him
last in 1884, when it had been twenty-six years since I ate the basin of
raw turnips and washed them down with a bucket of water in his house. He
was become old and white-headed, but he entered to me in the same old
breezy way of his earlier life, and he was all there, yet--not a detail
wanting: the happy light in his eye, the abounding hope in his heart,
the persuasive tongue, the miracle-breeding imagination--they were all
there; and before I could turn around he was polishing up his Aladdin's
lamp and flashing the secret riches of the world before me. I said to
myself, "I did not overdraw him by a shade, I set him down as he was;
and he is the same man to-day. Cable will recognize him." I asked him to
excuse me a moment, and ran into the next room, which was Cable's; Cable
and I were stumping the Union on a reading tour. I said--

"I am going to leave your door open, so that you can listen. There is a
man in there who is interesting."

I went back and asked Lampton what he was doing now. He began to tell me
of a "small venture" he had begun in New Mexico through his son; "only a
little thing--a mere trifle--partly to amuse my leisure, partly to keep
my capital from lying idle, but mainly to develop the boy--develop the
boy; fortune's wheel is ever revolving, he may have to work for his
living some day--as strange things have happened in this world. But it's
only a little thing--a mere trifle, as I said."

And so it was--as he began it. But under his deft hands it grew, and
blossomed, and spread--oh, beyond imagination. At the end of half an
hour he finished; finished with the remark, uttered in an adorably
languid manner:

"Yes, it is but a trifle, as things go nowadays--a bagatelle--but
amusing. It passes the time. The boy thinks great things of it, but he
is young, you know, and imaginative; lacks the experience which comes of
handling large affairs, and which tempers the fancy and perfects the
judgment. I suppose there's a couple of millions in it, possibly three,
but not more, I think; still, for a boy, you know, just starting in
life, it is not bad. I should not want him to make a fortune--let that
come later. It could turn his head, at his time of life, and in many
ways be a damage to him."

Then he said something about his having left his pocketbook lying on the
table in the main drawing-room at home, and about its being after
banking hours, now, and--

I stopped him, there, and begged him to honor Cable and me by being our
guest at the lecture--with as many friends as might be willing to do us
the like honor. He accepted. And he thanked me as a prince might who
had granted us a grace. The reason I stopped his speech about the
tickets was because I saw that he was going to ask me to furnish them to
him and let him pay next day; and I knew that if he made the debt he
would pay it if he had to pawn his clothes. After a little further chat
he shook hands heartily and affectionately, and took his leave. Cable
put his head in at the door, and said--

"That was Colonel Sellers."

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--II.

BY MARK TWAIN.


II.

My experiences as an author began early in 1867. I came to New York from
San Francisco in the first month of that year and presently Charles H.
Webb, whom I had known in San Francisco as a reporter on _The Bulletin_,
and afterward editor of _The Californian_, suggested that I publish a
volume of sketches. I had but a slender reputation to publish it on, but
I was charmed and excited by the suggestion and quite willing to venture
it if some industrious person would save me the trouble of gathering the
sketches together. I was loath to do it myself, for from the beginning
of my sojourn in this world there was a persistent vacancy in me where
the industry ought to be. ("Ought to was" is better, perhaps, though
the most of the authorities differ as to this.)

Webb said I had some reputation in the Atlantic States, but I knew quite
well that it must be of a very attenuated sort. What there was of it
rested upon the story of "The Jumping Frog." When Artemus Ward passed
through California on a lecturing tour, in 1865 or '66, I told him the
"Jumping Frog" story, in San Francisco, and he asked me to write it out
and send it to his publisher, Carleton, in New York, to be used in
padding out a small book which Artemus had prepared for the press and
which needed some more stuffing to make it big enough for the price
which was to be charged for it.

It reached Carleton in time, but he didn't think much of it, and was not
willing to go to the typesetting expense of adding it to the book. He
did not put it in the waste-basket, but made Henry Clapp a present of
it, and Clapp used it to help out the funeral of his dying literary
journal, _The Saturday Press_. "The Jumping Frog" appeared in the last
number of that paper, was the most joyous feature of the obsequies, and
was at once copied in the newspapers of America and England. It
certainly had a wide celebrity, and it still had it at the time that I
am speaking of--but I was aware that it was only the frog that was
celebrated. It wasn't I. I was still an obscurity.

Webb undertook to collate the sketches. He performed this office, then
handed the result to me, and I went to Carleton's establishment with it.
I approached a clerk and he bent eagerly over the counter to inquire
into my needs; but when he found that I had come to sell a book and not
to buy one, his temperature fell sixty degrees, and the old-gold
intrenchments in the roof of my mouth contracted three-quarters of an
inch and my teeth fell out. I meekly asked the privilege of a word with
Mr. Carleton, and was coldly informed that he was in his private office.
Discouragements and difficulties followed, but after a while I got by
the frontier and entered the holy of holies. Ah, now I remember how I
managed it! Webb had made an appointment for me with Carleton; otherwise
I never should have gotten over that frontier. Carleton rose and said
brusquely and aggressively,

"Well, what can I do for you?"

I reminded him that I was there by appointment to offer him my book for
publication. He began to swell, and went on swelling and swelling and
swelling until he had reached the dimensions of a god of about the
second or third degree. Then the fountains of his great deep were broken
up, and for two or three minutes I couldn't see him for the rain. It was
words, only words, but they fell so densely that they darkened the
atmosphere. Finally he made an imposing sweep with his right hand, which
comprehended the whole room and said,

"Books--look at those shelves! Every one of them is loaded with books
that are waiting for publication. Do I want any more? Excuse me, I
don't. Good morning."

Twenty-one years elapsed before I saw Carleton again. I was then
sojourning with my family at the Schweitzerhof, in Luzerne. He called on
me, shook hands cordially, and said at once, without any preliminaries,

"I am substantially an obscure person, but I have at least one
distinction to my credit of such colossal dimensions that it entitles me
to immortality--to wit: I refused a book of yours, and for this I stand
without competitor as the prize ass of the nineteenth century."

It was a most handsome apology, and I told him so, and said it was a
long-delayed revenge but was sweeter to me than any other that could be
devised; that during the lapsed twenty-one years I had in fancy taken
his life several times every year, and always in new and increasingly
cruel and inhuman ways, but that now I was pacified, appeased, happy,
even jubilant; and that thenceforth I should hold him my true and valued
friend and never kill him again.

I reported my adventure to Webb, and he bravely said that not all the
Carletons in the universe should defeat that book; he would publish it
himself on a ten per cent. royalty. And so he did. He brought it out in
blue and gold, and made a very pretty little book of it, I think he
named it "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and Other
Sketches," price $1.25. He made the plates and printed and bound the
book through a job-printing house, and published it through the American
News Company.

In June I sailed in the _Quaker City_ Excursion. I returned in November,
and in Washington found a letter from Elisha Bliss, of the American
Publishing Company of Hartford, offering me five per cent. royalty on a
book which should recount the adventures of the Excursion. In lieu of
the royalty, I was offered the alternative of ten thousand dollars cash
upon delivery of the manuscript. I consulted A. D. Richardson and he
said "take the royalty." I followed his advice and closed with Bliss. By
my contract I was to deliver the manuscript in July of 1868. I wrote the
book in San Francisco and delivered the manuscript within contract time.
Bliss provided a multitude of illustrations for the book, and then
stopped work on it. The contract date for the issue went by, and there
was no explanation of this. Time drifted along and still there was no
explanation. I was lecturing all over the country; and about thirty
times a day, on an average, I was trying to answer this conundrum:

"When is your book coming out?"

I got tired of inventing new answers to that question, and by and by I
got horribly tired of the question itself. Whoever asked it became my
enemy at once, and I was usually almost eager to make that appear.

As soon as I was free of the lecture-field I hastened to Hartford to
make inquiries. Bliss said that the fault was not his; that he wanted to
publish the book but the directors of his Company were staid old fossils
and were afraid of it. They had examined the book, and the majority of
them were of the opinion that there were places in it of a humorous
character. Bliss said the house had never published a book that had a
suspicion like that attaching to it, and that the directors were afraid
that a departure of this kind would seriously injure the house's
reputation; that he was tied hand and foot, and was not permitted to
carry out his contract. One of the directors, a Mr. Drake--at least he
was the remains of what had once been a Mr. Drake--invited me to take a
ride with him in his buggy, and I went along. He was a pathetic old
relic, and his ways and his talk were also pathetic. He had a delicate
purpose in view and it took him some time to hearten himself
sufficiently to carry it out, but at last he accomplished it. He
explained the house's difficulty and distress, as Bliss had already
explained it. Then he frankly threw himself and the house upon my mercy
and begged me to take away "The Innocents Abroad" and release the
concern from the contract. I said I wouldn't--and so ended the interview
and the buggy excursion. Then I warned Bliss that he must get to work or
I should make trouble. He acted upon the warning, and set up the book
and I read the proofs. Then there was another long wait and no
explanation. At last toward the end of July (1869, I think), I lost
patience and telegraphed Bliss that if the book was not on sale in
twenty-four hours I should bring suit for damages.

That ended the trouble. Half a dozen copies were bound and placed on
sale within the required time. Then the canvassing began, and went
briskly forward. In nine months the book took the publishing house out
of debt, advanced its stock from twenty-five to two hundred, and left
seventy thousand dollars profit to the good. It was Bliss that told me
this--but if it was true, it was the first time that he had told the
truth in sixty-five years. He was born in 1804.


III.

... This was in 1849. I was fourteen years old, then. We were still
living in Hannibal, Missouri, on the banks of the Mississippi, in the
new "frame" house built by my father five years before. That is, some of
us lived in the new part, the rest in the old part back of it--the "L."
In the autumn my sister gave a party, and invited all the marriageable
young people of the village. I was too young for this society, and was
too bashful to mingle with young ladies, anyway, therefore I was not
invited--at least not for the whole evening. Ten minutes of it was to be
my whole share. I was to do the part of a bear in a small fairy play. I
was to be disguised all over in a close-fitting brown hairy stuff proper
for a bear. About half past ten I was told to go to my room and put on
this disguise, and be ready in half an hour. I started, but changed my
mind; for I wanted to practise a little, and that room was very small. I
crossed over to the large unoccupied house on the corner of Main and
Hill streets,[4] unaware that a dozen of the young people were also
going there to dress for their parts. I took the little black slave boy,
Sandy, with me, and we selected a roomy and empty chamber on the second
floor. We entered it talking, and this gave a couple of half-dressed
young ladies an opportunity to take refuge behind a screen undiscovered.
Their gowns and things were hanging on hooks behind the door, but I did
not see them; it was Sandy that shut the door, but all his heart was in
the theatricals, and he was as unlikely to notice them as I was myself.

That was a rickety screen, with many holes in it, but as I did not know
there were girls behind it, I was not disturbed by that detail. If I had
known, I could not have undressed in the flood of cruel moonlight that
was pouring in at the curtainless windows; I should have died of shame.
Untroubled by apprehensions, I stripped to the skin and began my
practice. I was full of ambition; I was determined to make a hit; I was
burning to establish a reputation as a bear and get further engagements;
so I threw myself into my work with an abandon that promised great
things. I capered back and forth from one end of the room to the other
on all fours, Sandy applauding with enthusiasm; I walked upright and
growled and snapped and snarled; I stood on my head, I flung
handsprings, I danced a lubberly dance with my paws bent and my
imaginary snout sniffing from side to side; I did everything a bear
could do, and many things which no bear could ever do and no bear with
any dignity would want to do, anyway; and of course I never suspected
that I was making a spectacle of myself to any one but Sandy. At last,
standing on my head, I paused in that attitude to take a minute's rest.
There was a moment's silence, then Sandy spoke up with excited interest
and said--

"Marse Sam, has you ever seen a smoked herring?"

"No. What is that?"

"It's a fish."

"Well, what of it? Anything peculiar about it?"

"Yes, suh, you bet you dey is. _Dey eats 'em guts and all!_"

There was a smothered burst of feminine snickers from behind the screen!
All the strength went out of me and I toppled forward like an undermined
tower and brought the screen down with my weight, burying the young
ladies under it. In their fright they discharged a couple of piercing
screams--and possibly others, but I did not wait to count. I snatched my
clothes and fled to the dark hall below, Sandy following. I was dressed
in half a minute, and out the back way. I swore Sandy to eternal
silence, then we went away and hid until the party was over. The
ambition was all out of me. I could not have faced that giddy company
after my adventure, for there would be two performers there who knew my
secret, and would be privately laughing at me all the time. I was
searched for but not found, and the bear had to be played by a young
gentleman in his civilized clothes. The house was still and everybody
asleep when I finally ventured home. I was very heavy-hearted, and full
of a sense of disgrace. Pinned to my pillow I found a slip of paper
which bore a line that did not lighten my heart, but only made my face
burn. It was written in a laboriously disguised hand, and these were its
mocking terms:

"You probably couldn't have played _bear_, but you played _bare_ very
well--oh, very very well!"

We think boys are rude, unsensitive animals, but it is not so in all
cases. Each boy has one or two sensitive spots, and if you can find out
where they are located you have only to touch them and you can scorch
him as with fire. I suffered miserably over that episode. I expected
that the facts would be all over the village in the morning, but it was
not so. The secret remained confined to the two girls and Sandy and me.
That was some appeasement of my pain, but it was far from
sufficient--the main trouble remained: I was under four mocking eyes,
and it might as well have been a thousand, for I suspected all girls'
eyes of being the ones I so dreaded. During several weeks I could not
look any young lady in the face; I dropped my eyes in confusion when any
one of them smiled upon me and gave me greeting; and I said to myself,
"_That is one of them_," and got quickly away. Of course I was meeting
the right girls everywhere, but if they ever let slip any betraying sign
I was not bright enough to catch it. When I left Hannibal four years
later, the secret was still a secret; I had never guessed those girls
out, and was no longer expecting to do it. Nor wanting to, either.

One of the dearest and prettiest girls in the village at the time of my
mishap was one whom I will call Mary Wilson, because that was not her
name. She was twenty years old; she was dainty and sweet, peach-bloomy
and exquisite, gracious and lovely in character, and I stood in awe of
her, for she seemed to me to be made out of angel-clay and rightfully
unapproachable by an unholy ordinary kind of a boy like me. I probably
never suspected her. But--

The scene changes. To Calcutta--forty-seven years later. It was in 1896.
I arrived there on my lecturing trip. As I entered the hotel a divine
vision passed out of it, clothed in the glory of the Indian
sunshine--the Mary Wilson of my long-vanished boyhood! It was a
startling thing. Before I could recover from the bewildering shock and
speak to her she was gone. I thought maybe I had seen an apparition, but
it was not so, she was flesh. She was the granddaughter of the other
Mary, the original Mary. That Mary, now a widow, was up-stairs, and
presently sent for me. She was old and gray-haired, but she looked young
and was very handsome. We sat down and talked. We steeped our thirsty
souls in the reviving wine of the past, the beautiful past, the dear and
lamented past; we uttered the names that had been silent upon our lips
for fifty years, and it was as if they were made of music; with reverent
hands we unburied our dead, the mates of our youth, and caressed them
with our speech; we searched the dusty chambers of our memories and
dragged forth incident after incident, episode after episode, folly
after folly, and laughed such good laughs over them, with the tears
running down; and finally Mary said suddenly, and without any leading
up--

"Tell me! What is the special peculiarity of smoked herrings?"

It seemed a strange question at such a hallowed time as this. And so
inconsequential, too. I was a little shocked. And yet I was aware of a
stir of some kind away back in the deeps of my memory somewhere. It set
me to musing--thinking--searching. Smoked herrings. Smoked herrings. The
peculiarity of smo.... I glanced up. Her face was grave, but there was a
dim and shadowy twinkle in her eye which--All of a sudden I knew! and
far away down in the hoary past I heard a remembered voice murmur, "Dey
eats 'em guts and all!"

"At--last! I've found one of you, anyway! Who was the other girl?"

But she drew the line there. She wouldn't tell me.

... But it was on a bench in Washington Square that I saw the most of
Louis Stevenson. It was an outing that lasted an hour or more, and was
very pleasant and sociable. I had come with him from his house, where I
had been paying my respects to his family. His business in the Square
was to absorb the sunshine. He was most scantily furnished with flesh,
his clothes seemed to fall into hollows as if there might be nothing
inside but the frame for a sculptor's statue. His long face and lank
hair and dark complexion and musing and melancholy expression seemed to
fit these details justly and harmoniously, and the altogether of it
seemed especially planned to gather the rays of your observation and
focalize them upon Stevenson's special distinction and commanding
feature, his splendid eyes. They burned with a smouldering rich fire
under the penthouse of his brows, and they made him beautiful.

       *       *       *       *       *

I said I thought he was right about the others, but mistaken as to Bret
Harte; in substance I said that Harte was good company and a thin but
pleasant talker; that he was always bright, but never brilliant; that in
this matter he must not be classed with Thomas Bailey Aldrich, nor must
any other man, ancient or modern; that Aldrich was always witty, always
brilliant, if there was anybody present capable of striking his flint at
the right angle; that Aldrich was as sure and prompt and unfailing as
the red-hot iron on the blacksmith's anvil--you had only to hit it
competently to make it deliver an explosion of sparks. I added--

"Aldrich has never had his peer for prompt and pithy and witty and
humorous sayings. None has equalled him, certainly none has surpassed
him, in the felicity of phrasing with which he clothed these children of
his fancy. Aldrich was always brilliant, he couldn't help it, he is a
fire-opal set round with rose diamonds; when he is not speaking, you
know that his dainty fancies are twinkling and glimmering around in him;
when he speaks the diamonds flash. Yes, he was always brilliant, he will
always be brilliant; he will be brilliant in hell--you will see."

Stevenson, smiling a chuckly smile, "I hope not."

"Well, you will, and he will dim even those ruddy fires and look like a
transfigured Adonis backed against a pink sunset."

       *       *       *       *       *

There on that bench we struck out a new phrase--one or the other of us,
I don't remember which--"submerged renown." Variations were discussed:
"submerged fame," "submerged reputation," and so on, and a choice was
made; "submerged renown" was elected, I believe. This important matter
rose out of an incident which had been happening to Stevenson in Albany.
While in a book-shop or book-stall there he had noticed a long rank of
small books, cheaply but neatly gotten up, and bearing such titles as
"Davis's Selected Speeches," "Davis's Selected Poetry," Davis's this and
Davis's that and Davis's the other thing; compilations, every one of
them, each with a brief, compact, intelligent and useful introductory
chapter by this same Davis, whose first name I have forgotten. Stevenson
had begun the matter with this question:

"Can you name the American author whose fame and acceptance stretch
widest in the States?"

I thought I could, but it did not seem to me that it would be modest to
speak out, in the circumstances. So I diffidently said nothing.
Stevenson noticed, and said--

"Save your delicacy for another time--you are not the one. For a
shilling you can't name the American author of widest note and
popularity in the States. But I can."

Then he went on and told about that Albany incident. He had inquired of
the shopman--

"Who is this Davis?"

The answer was--

"An author whose books have to have freight-trains to carry them, not
baskets. Apparently you have not heard of him?"

Stevenson said no, this was the first time. The man said--

"Nobody has heard of Davis: you may ask all around and you will see. You
never see his name mentioned in print, not even in advertisement; these
things are of no use to Davis, not any more than they are to the wind
and the sea. You never see one of Davis's books floating on top of the
United States, but put on your diving armor and get yourself lowered
away down and down and down till you strike the dense region, the
sunless region of eternal drudgery and starvation wages--there you'll
find them by the million. The man that gets that market, his fortune is
made, his bread and butter are safe, for those people will never go back
on him. An author may have a reputation which is confined to the
surface, and lose it and become pitied, then despised, then forgotten,
entirely forgotten--the frequent steps in a surface reputation. At
surface reputation, however great, is always mortal, and always killable
if you go at it right--with pins and needles, and quiet slow poison, not
with the club and tomahawk. But it is a different matter with the
submerged reputation--down in the deep water; once a favorite there,
always a favorite; once beloved, always beloved; once respected, always
respected, honored, and believed in. For, what the reviewer says never
finds its way down into those placid deeps; nor the newspaper sneers,
nor any breath of the winds of slander blowing above. Down there they
never hear of these things. Their idol may be painted clay, up then at
the surface, and fade and waste and crumble and blow away, there being
much weather there; but down below he is gold and adamant and
indestructible."

This is from this morning's paper:


                        MARK TWAIN LETTER SOLD.

            _Written to Thomas Nast, it Proposed a Joint Tour._

     A Mark Twain autograph letter brought $43 yesterday at the auction
     by the Merwin-Clayton Company of the library and correspondence of
     the late Thomas Nast, cartoonist. The letter is nine pages
     note-paper, is dated Hartford, Nov. 12, 1877, and it addressed to
     Nast. It reads in part as follows:


                                                 Hartford, _Nov. 12_.

     MY DEAR NAST: I did not think I should ever stand on a platform
     again until the time was come for me to say I die innocent. But the
     same old offers keep arriving that have arriven every year, and
     been every year declined--$500 for Louisville, $500 for St. Louis,
     $1,000 gold for two nights in Toronto, half gross proceeds for New
     York, Boston, Brooklyn, &c. I have declined them all just as usual,
     though sorely tempted as usual.

     Now, I do not decline because I mind talking to an audience, but
     because (1) travelling alone is so heart-breakingly dreary, and (2)
     shouldering the whole show is such cheer-killing responsibility.

     Therefore I now propose to you what you proposed to me in November,
     1867--ten years ago, (when I was unknown,) viz.; That you should
     stand on the platform and make pictures, and I stand by you and
     blackguard the audience. I should enormously enjoy meandering
     around (to big towns--don't want to go to little ones) with you for
     company.

     The letter includes a schedule of cities and the number of
     appearances planned for each.


This is as it should be. This is worthy of all praise. I say it myself
lest other competent persons should forget to do it. It appears that
four of my ancient letters were sold at auction, three of them at
twenty-seven dollars, twenty-eight dollars, and twenty-nine dollars
respectively, and the one above mentioned at forty-three dollars. There
is one very gratifying circumstance about this, to wit: that my
literature has more than held its own as regards money value through
this stretch of thirty-six years. I judge that the forty-three-dollar
letter must have gone at about ten cents a word, whereas if I had
written it to-day its market rate would be thirty cents--so I have
increased in value two or three hundred per cent. I note another
gratifying circumstance--that a letter of General Grant's sold at
something short of eighteen dollars. I can't rise to General Grant's
lofty place in the estimation of this nation, but it is a deep happiness
to me to know that when it comes to epistolary literature he can't sit
in the front seat along with me.

This reminds me--nine years ago, when we were living in Tedworth Square,
London, a report was cabled to the American journals that I was dying. I
was not the one. It was another Clemens, a cousin of mine,--Dr. J. Ross
Clemens, now of St. Louis--who was due to die but presently escaped, by
some chicanery or other characteristic of the tribe of Clemens. The
London representatives of the American papers began to flock in, with
American cables in their hands, to inquire into my condition. There was
nothing the matter with me, and each in his turn was astonished, and
disappointed, to find me reading and smoking in my study and worth next
to nothing as a text for transatlantic news. One of these men was a
gentle and kindly and grave and sympathetic Irishman, who hid his sorrow
the best he could, and tried to look glad, and told me that his paper,
the _Evening Sun_, had cabled him that it was reported in New York that
I was dead. What should he cable in reply? I said--

"Say the report is greatly exaggerated."

He never smiled, but went solemnly away and sent the cable in those
words. The remark hit the world pleasantly, and to this day it keeps
turning up, now and then, in the newspapers when people have occasion to
discount exaggerations.

The next man was also an Irishman. He had his New York cablegram in his
hand--from the New York _World_--and he was so evidently trying to get
around that cable with invented softnesses and palliations that my
curiosity was aroused and I wanted to see what it did really say. So
when occasion offered I slipped it out of his hand. It said,

"If Mark Twain dying send five hundred words. If dead send a thousand."

Now that old letter of mine sold yesterday for forty-three dollars. When
I am dead it will be worth eighty-six.

                                                     MARK TWAIN.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--III.

BY MARK TWAIN.


VI.

To-morrow will be the thirty-sixth anniversary of our marriage. My wife
passed from this life one year and eight months ago, in Florence, Italy,
after an unbroken illness of twenty-two months' duration.

I saw her first in the form of an ivory miniature in her brother
Charley's stateroom in the steamer "Quaker City," in the Bay of Smyrna,
in the summer of 1867, when she was in her twenty-second year. I saw her
in the flesh for the first time in New York in the following December.
She was slender and beautiful and girlish--and she was both girl and
woman. She remained both girl and woman to the last day of her life.
Under a grave and gentle exterior burned inextinguishable fires of
sympathy, energy, devotion, enthusiasm, and absolutely limitless
affection. She was _always_ frail in body, and she lived upon her
spirit, whose hopefulness and courage were indestructible. Perfect
truth, perfect honesty, perfect candor, were qualities of her character
which were born with her. Her judgments of people and things were sure
and accurate. Her intuitions almost never deceived her. In her judgments
of the characters and acts of both friends and strangers, there was
always room for charity, and this charity never failed. I have compared
and contrasted her with hundreds of persons, and my conviction remains
that hers was the most perfect character I have ever met. And I may add
that she was the most winningly dignified person I have ever known. Her
character and disposition were of the sort that not only invites
worship, but commands it. No servant ever left her service who deserved
to remain in it. And, as she could choose with a glance of her eye, the
servants she selected did in almost all cases deserve to remain, and
they _did_ remain. She was always cheerful; and she was always able to
communicate her cheerfulness to others. During the nine years that we
spent in poverty and debt, she was always able to reason me out of my
despairs, and find a bright side to the clouds, and make me see it. In
all that time, I never knew her to utter a word of regret concerning our
altered circumstances, nor did I ever know her children to do the like.
For she had taught them, and they drew their fortitude from her. The
love which she bestowed upon those whom she loved took the form of
worship, and in that form it was returned--returned by relatives,
friends and the servants of her household. It was a strange combination
which wrought into one individual, so to speak, by marriage--her
disposition and character and mine. She poured out her prodigal
affections in kisses and caresses, and in a vocabulary of endearments
whose profusion was always an astonishment to me. I was born _reserved_
as to endearments of speech and caresses, and hers broke upon me as the
summer waves break upon Gibraltar. I was reared in that atmosphere of
reserve. As I have already said, in another chapter, I never knew a
member of my father's family to kiss another member of it except once,
and that at a death-bed. And our village was not a kissing community.
The kissing and caressing ended with courtship--along with the deadly
piano-playing of that day.

She had the heart-free laugh of a girl. It came seldom, but when it
broke upon the ear it was as inspiring as music. I heard it for the last
time when she had been occupying her sickbed for more than a year, and I
made a written note of it at the time--a note not to be repeated.

To-morrow will be the thirty-sixth anniversary. We were married in her
father's house in Elmira, New York, and went next day, by special train,
to Buffalo, along with the whole Langdon family, and with the Beechers
and the Twichells, who had solemnized the marriage. We were to live in
Buffalo, where I was to be one of the editors of the Buffalo "Express,"
and a part owner of the paper. I knew nothing about Buffalo, but I had
made my household arrangements there through a friend, by letter. I had
instructed him to find a boarding-house of as respectable a character as
my light salary as editor would command. We were received at about nine
o'clock at the station in Buffalo, and were put into several sleighs and
driven all over America, as it seemed to me--for, apparently, we turned
all the corners in the town and followed all the streets there were--I
scolding freely, and characterizing that friend of mine in very
uncomplimentary words for securing a boarding-house that apparently had
no definite locality. But there was a conspiracy--and my bride knew of
it, but I was in ignorance. Her father, Jervis Langdon, had bought and
furnished a new house for us in the fashionable street, Delaware Avenue,
and had laid in a cook and housemaids, and a brisk and electric young
coachman, an Irishman, Patrick McAleer--and we were being driven all
over that city in order that one sleighful of those people could have
time to go to the house, and see that the gas was lighted all over it,
and a hot supper prepared for the crowd. We arrived at last, and when I
entered that fairy place my indignation reached high-water mark, and
without any reserve I delivered my opinion to that friend of mine for
being so stupid as to put us into a boarding-house whose terms would be
far out of my reach. Then Mr. Langdon brought forward a very pretty box
and opened it, and took from it a deed of the house. So the comedy ended
very pleasantly, and we sat down to supper.

The company departed about midnight, and left us alone in our new
quarters. Then Ellen, the cook, came in to get orders for the morning's
marketing--and neither of us knew whether beefsteak was sold by the
barrel or by the yard. We exposed our ignorance, and Ellen was fall of
Irish delight over it. Patrick McAleer, that brisk young Irishman, came
in to get his orders for next day--and that was our first glimpse of
him....

Our first child, Langdon Clemens, was born the 7th of November, 1870,
and lived twenty-two months. Susy was born the 19th of March, 1872, and
passed from life in the Hartford home, the 18th of August, 1896. With
her, when the end came, were Jean and Katy Leary, and John and Ellen
(the gardener and his wife). Clara and her mother and I arrived in
England from around the world on the 31st of July, and took a house in
Guildford. A week later, when Susy, Katy and Jean should have been
arriving from America, we got a letter instead.

It explained that Susy was slightly ill--nothing of consequence. But we
were disquieted, and began to cable for later news. This was Friday. All
day no answer--and the ship to leave Southampton next day, at noon.
Clara and her mother began packing, to be ready in case the news should
be bad. Finally came a cablegram saying, "Wait for cablegram in the
morning." This was not satisfactory--not reassuring. I cabled again,
asking that the answer be sent to Southampton, for the day was now
closing. I waited in the post-office that night till the doors were
closed, toward midnight, in the hope that good news might still come,
but there was no message. We sat silent at home till one in the morning,
waiting--waiting for we knew not what. Then we took the earliest morning
train, and when we reached Southampton the message was there. It said
the recovery would be long, but certain. This was a great relief to me,
but not to my wife. She was frightened. She and Clara went aboard the
steamer at once and sailed for America, to nurse Susy. I remained behind
to search for a larger house in Guildford.

That was the 15th of August, 1896. Three days later, when my wife and
Clara were about half-way across the ocean, I was standing in our
dining-room thinking of nothing in particular, when a cablegram was put
into my hand. It said, "Susy was peacefully released to-day."

It is one of the mysteries of our nature that a man, all unprepared, can
receive a thunder-stroke like that and live. There is but one reasonable
explanation of it. The intellect is stunned by the shock, and but
gropingly gathers the meaning of the words. The power to realize their
fall import is mercifully wanting. The mind has a dumb sense of vast
loss--that is all. It will take mind and memory months, and possibly
years, to gather together the details, and thus learn and know the whole
extent of the loss. A man's house burns down. The smoking wreckage
represents only a ruined home that was dear through years of use and
pleasant associations. By and by, as the days and weeks go on, first he
misses this, then that, then the other thing. And, when he casts about
for it, he finds that it was in that house. Always it is an
_essential_--there was but one of its kind. It cannot be replaced. It
was in that house. It is irrevocably lost. He did not realize that it
was an essential when he had it; he only discovers it now when he finds
himself balked, hampered, by its absence. It will be years before the
tale of lost essentials is complete, and not till then can he truly know
the magnitude of his disaster.

The 18th of August brought me the awful tidings. The mother and the
sister were out there in mid-Atlantic, ignorant of what was happening;
flying to meet this incredible calamity. All that could be done to
protect them from the full force of the shock was done by relatives and
good friends. They went down the Bay and met the ship at night, but did
not show themselves until morning, and then only to Clara. When she
returned to the stateroom she did not speak, and did not need to. Her
mother looked at her and said:

"Susy is dead."

At half past ten o'clock that night, Clara and her mother completed
their circuit of the globe, and drew up at Elmira by the same train and
in the same car which had borne them and me Westward from it one year,
one month, and one week before. And again Susy was there--not waving her
welcome in the glare of the lights, as she had waved her farewell to us
thirteen months before, but lying white and fair in her coffin, in the
house where she was born.

The last thirteen days of Susy's life were spent in our own house in
Hartford, the home of her childhood, and always the dearest place in the
earth to her. About her she had faithful old friends--her pastor, Mr.
Twichell, who had known her from the cradle, and who had come a long
journey to be with her; her uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Crane;
Patrick, the coachman; Katy, who had begun to serve us when Susy was a
child of eight years; John and Ellen, who had been with us many years.
Also Jean was there.

At the hour when my wife and Clara set sail for America, Susy was in no
danger. Three hours later there came a sudden change for the worse.
Meningitis set in, and it was immediately apparent that she was
death-struck. That was Saturday, the 15th of August.

"That evening she took food for the last time," (Jean's letter to me).
The next morning the brain-fever was raging. She walked the floor a
little in her pain and delirium, then succumbed to weakness and returned
to her bed. Previously she had found hanging in a closet a gown which
she had seen her mother wear. She thought it was her mother, dead, and
she kissed it, and cried. About noon she became blind (an effect of the
disease) and bewailed it to her uncle.

From Jean's letter I take this sentence, which needs no comment:

"About one in the afternoon Susy spoke for the last time."

It was only one word that she said when she spoke that last time, and it
told of her longing. She groped with her hands and found Katy, and
caressed her face, and said "Mamma."

How gracious it was that, in that forlorn hour of wreck and ruin, with
the night of death closing around her, she should have been granted that
beautiful illusion--that the latest vision which rested upon the clouded
mirror of her mind should have been the vision of her mother, and the
latest emotion she should know in life the joy and peace of that dear
imagined presence.

About two o'clock she composed herself as if for sleep, and never moved
again. She fell into unconsciousness and so remained two days and five
hours, until Tuesday evening at seven minutes past seven, when the
release came. She was twenty-four years and five months old.

On the 23d, her mother and her sisters saw her laid to rest--she that
had been our wonder and our worship.

In one of her own books I find some verses which I will copy here.
Apparently, she always put borrowed matter in quotation marks. These
verses lack those marks, and therefore I take them to be her own:


     Love came at dawn, when all the world was fair,
       When crimson glories' bloom and sun were rife;
     Love came at dawn, when hope's wings fanned the air,
       And murmured, "I am life."

     Love came at eve, and when the day was done,
       When heart and brain were tired, and slumber pressed;
     Love came at eve, shut out the sinking sun,
       And whispered, "I am rest."


The summer seasons of Susy's childhood were spent at Quarry Farm, on the
hills east of Elmira, New York; the other seasons of the year at the
home in Hartford. Like other children, she was blithe and happy, fond of
play; unlike the average of children, she was at times much given to
retiring within herself, and trying to search out the hidden meanings of
the deep things that make the puzzle and pathos of human existence, and
in all the ages have baffled the inquirer and mocked him. As a little
child aged seven, she was oppressed and perplexed by the maddening
repetition of the stock incidents of our race's fleeting sojourn here,
just as the same thing has oppressed and perplexed maturer minds from
the beginning of time. A myriad of men are born; they labor and sweat
and struggle for bread; they squabble and scold and fight; they scramble
for little mean advantages over each other; age creeps upon them;
infirmities follow; shames and humiliations bring down their prides and
their vanities; those they love are taken from them, and the joy of life
is turned to aching grief. The burden of pain, care, misery, grows
heavier year by year; at length, ambition is dead, pride is dead; vanity
is dead; longing for release is in their place. It comes at last--the
only unpoisoned gift earth ever had for them--and they vanish from a
world where they were of no consequence; where they achieved nothing;
where they were a mistake and a failure and a foolishness; there they
have left no sign that they have existed--a world which will lament them
a day and forget them forever. Then another myriad takes their place,
and copies all they did, and goes along the same profitless road, and
vanishes as they vanished--to make room for another, and another, and a
million other myriads, to follow the same arid path through the same
desert, and accomplish what the first myriad, and all the myriads that
came after it, accomplished--nothing!

"Mamma, what is it all for?" asked Susy, preliminarily stating the
above details in her own halting language, after long brooding over them
alone in the privacy of the nursery.

A year later, she was groping her way alone through another sunless bog,
but this time she reached a rest for her feet. For a week, her mother
had not been able to go to the nursery, evenings, at the child's prayer
hour. She spoke of it--was sorry for it, and said she would come
to-night, and hoped she could continue to come every night and hear Susy
pray, as before. Noticing that the child wished to respond, but was
evidently troubled as to how to word her answer, she asked what the
difficulty was. Susy explained that Miss Foote (the governess) had been
teaching her about the Indians and their religious beliefs, whereby it
appeared that they had not only a God, but several. This had set Susy to
thinking. As a result of this thinking, she had stopped praying. She
qualified this statement--that is, she modified it--saying she did not
now pray "in the same way" as she had formerly done. Her mother said:

"Tell me about it, dear."

"Well, mamma, the Indians believed they knew, but now we know they were
wrong. By and by, it can turn out that we are wrong. So now I only pray
that there may be a God and a Heaven--or something better."

I wrote down this pathetic prayer in its precise wording, at the time,
in a record which we kept of the children's sayings, and my reverence
for it has grown with the years that have passed over my head since
then. Its untaught grace and simplicity are a child's, but the wisdom
and the pathos of it are of all the ages that have come and gone since
the race of man has lived, and longed, and hoped, and feared, and
doubted.

To go back a year--Susy aged seven. Several times her mother said to
her:

"There, there, Susy, you mustn't cry over little things."

This furnished Susy a text for thought She had been breaking her heart
over what had seemed vast disasters--a broken toy; a picnic cancelled by
thunder and lightning and rain; the mouse that was growing tame and
friendly in the nursery caught and killed by the cat--and now came this
strange revelation. For some unaccountable reason, these were not vast
calamities. Why? How is the size of calamities measured? What is the
rule? There must be some way to tell the great ones from the small
ones; what is the law of these proportions? She examined the problem
earnestly and long. She gave it her best thought from time to time, for
two or three days--but it baffled her--defeated her. And at last she
gave up and went to her mother for help.

"Mamma, what is '_little_ things'?"

It seemed a simple question--at first. And yet, before the answer could
be put into words, unsuspected and unforeseen difficulties began to
appear. They increased; they multiplied; they brought about another
defeat. The effort to explain came to a standstill. Then Susy tried to
help her mother out--with an instance, an example, an illustration. The
mother was getting ready to go down-town, and one of her errands was to
buy a long-promised toy-watch for Susy.

"If you forgot the watch, mamma, would that be a little thing?"

She was not concerned about the watch, for she knew it would not be
forgotten. What she was hoping for was that the answer would unriddle
the riddle, and bring rest and peace to her perplexed little mind.

The hope was disappointed, of course--for the reason that the size of a
misfortune is not determinate by an outsider's measurement of it, but
only by the measurements applied to it by the person specially affected
by it. The king's lost crown is a vast matter to the king, but of no
consequence to the child. The lost toy is a great matter to the child,
but in the king's eyes it is not a thing to break the heart about. A
verdict was reached, but it was based upon the above model, and Susy was
granted leave to measure her disasters thereafter with her own
tape-line.

As a child, Susy had a passionate temper; and it cost her much remorse
and many tears before she learned to govern it, but after that it was a
wholesome salt, and her character was the stronger and healthier for its
presence. It enabled her to be good with dignity; it preserved her not
only from being good for vanity's sake, but from even the appearance of
it. In looking back over the long vanished years, it seems but natural
and excusable that I should dwell with longing affection and preference
upon incidents of her young life which made it beautiful to us, and that
I should let its few small offences go unsummoned and unreproached.

In the summer of 1880, when Susy was just eight years of age, the
family were at Quarry Farm, as usual at that season of the year.
Hay-cutting time was approaching, and Susy and Clara were counting the
hours, for the time was big with a great event for them; they had been
promised that they might mount the wagon and ride home from the fields
on the summit of the hay mountain. This perilous privilege, so dear to
their age and species, had never been granted them before. Their
excitement had no bounds. They could talk of nothing but this
epoch-making adventure, now. But misfortune overtook Susy on the very
morning of the important day. In a sudden outbreak of passion, she
corrected Clara--with a shovel, or stick, or something of the sort. At
any rate, the offence committed was of a gravity clearly beyond the
limit allowed in the nursery. In accordance with the rule and custom of
the house, Susy went to her mother to confess, and to help decide upon
the size and character of the punishment due. It was quite understood
that, as a punishment could have but one rational object and
function--to act as a reminder, and warn the transgressor against
transgressing in the same way again--the children would know about as
well as any how to choose a penalty which would be rememberable and
effective. Susy and her mother discussed various punishments, but none
of them seemed adequate. This fault was an unusually serious one, and
required the setting up of a danger-signal in the memory that would not
blow out nor burn out, but remain a fixture there and furnish its saving
warning indefinitely. Among the punishments mentioned was deprivation of
the hay-wagon ride. It was noticeable that this one hit Susy hard.
Finally, in the summing up, the mother named over the list and asked:

"Which one do you think it ought to be, Susy?"

Susy studied, shrank from her duty, and asked:

"Which do you think, mamma?"

"Well, Susy, I would rather leave it to you. _You_ make the choice
yourself."

It cost Susy a struggle, and much and deep thinking and weighing--but
she came out where any one who knew her could have foretold she would.

"Well, mamma, I'll make it the hay-wagon, because you know the other
things might not make me remember not to do it again, but if I don't get
to ride on the hay-wagon I can remember it easily."

In this world the real penalty, the sharp one, the lasting one, never
falls otherwise than on the wrong person. It was not _I_ that corrected
Clara, but the remembrance of poor Susy's lost hay-ride still brings
_me_ a pang--after twenty-six years.

Apparently, Susy was born with humane feelings for the animals, and
compassion for their troubles. This enabled her to see a new point in an
old story, once, when she was only six years old--a point which had been
overlooked by older, and perhaps duller, people for many ages. Her
mother told her the moving story of the sale of Joseph by his brethren,
the staining of his coat with the blood of the slaughtered kid, and the
rest of it. She dwelt upon the inhumanity of the brothers; their cruelty
toward their helpless young brother; and the unbrotherly treachery which
they practised upon him; for she hoped to teach the child a lesson in
gentle pity and mercifulness which she would remember. Apparently, her
desire was accomplished, for the tears came into Susy's eyes and she was
deeply moved. Then she said:

"Poor little kid!"

A child's frank envy of the privileges and distinctions of its elders is
often a delicately flattering attention and the reverse of unwelcome,
but sometimes the envy is not placed where the beneficiary is expecting
it to be placed. Once, when Susy was seven, she sat breathlessly
absorbed in watching a guest of ours adorn herself for a ball. The lady
was charmed by this homage; this mute and gentle admiration; and was
happy in it. And when her pretty labors were finished, and she stood at
last perfect, unimprovable, clothed like Solomon in all his glory, she
paused, confident and expectant, to receive from Susy's tongue the
tribute that was burning in her eyes. Susy drew an envious little sigh
and said:

"I wish _I_ could have crooked teeth and spectacles!"

Once, when Susy was six months along in her eighth year, she did
something one day in the presence of company, which subjected her to
criticism and reproof. Afterward, when she was alone with her mother, as
was her custom she reflected a little while over the matter. Then she
set up what I think--and what the shade of Burns would think--was a
quite good philosophical defence.

"Well, mamma, you know I didn't see myself, and so I couldn't know how
it looked."

In homes where the near friends and visitors are mainly literary
people--lawyers, judges, professors and clergymen--the children's ears
become early familiarized with wide vocabularies. It is natural for them
to pick up any words that fall in their way; it is natural for them to
pick up big and little ones indiscriminately; it is natural for them to
use without fear any word that comes to their net, no matter how
formidable it may be as to size. As a result, their talk is a curious
and funny musketry clatter of little words, interrupted at intervals by
the heavy artillery crash of a word of such imposing sound and size that
it seems to shake the ground and rattle the windows. Sometimes the child
gets a wrong idea of a word which it has picked up by chance, and
attaches to it a meaning which impairs its usefulness--but this does not
happen as often as one might expect it would. Indeed, it happens with an
infrequency which may be regarded as remarkable. As a child, Susy had
good fortune with her large words, and she employed many of them. She
made no more than her fair share of mistakes. Once when she thought
something very funny was going to happen (but it didn't), she was racked
and torn with laughter, by anticipation. But, apparently, she still felt
sure of her position, for she said, "If it had happened, I should have
been transformed [transported] with glee."

And earlier, when she was a little maid of five years, she informed a
visitor that she had been in a church only once, and that was the time
when Clara was "crucified" [christened]....

In Heidelberg, when Susy was six, she noticed that the Schloss gardens
were populous with snails creeping all about everywhere. One day she
found a new dish on her table and inquired concerning it, and learned
that it was made of snails. She was awed and impressed, and said:

"Wild ones, mamma?"

She was thoughtful and considerate of others--an acquired quality, no
doubt. No one seems to be born with it. One hot day, at home in
Hartford, when she was a little child, her mother borrowed her fan
several times (a Japanese one, value five cents), refreshed herself with
it a moment or two, then handed it back with a word of thanks. Susy knew
her mother would use the fan all the time if she could do it without
putting a deprivation upon its owner. She also knew that her mother
could not be persuaded to do that. A relief most be devised somehow;
Susy devised it. She got five cents out of her money-box and carried it
to Patrick, and asked him to take it down-town (a mile and a half) and
buy a Japanese fan and bring it home. He did it--and thus thoughtfully
and delicately was the exigency met and the mother's comfort secured. It
is to the child's credit that she did not save herself expense by
bringing down another and more costly kind of fan from up-stairs, but
was content to act upon the impression that her mother desired the
Japanese kind--content to accomplish the desire and stop with that,
without troubling about the wisdom or unwisdom of it.

Sometimes, while she was still a child, her speech fell into quaint and
strikingly expressive forms. Once--aged nine or ten--she came to her
mother's room, when her sister Jean was a baby, and said Jean was crying
in the nursery, and asked if she might ring for the nurse. Her mother
asked:

"Is she crying hard?"--meaning cross, ugly.

"Well, no, mamma. It is a weary, lonesome cry."

It is a pleasure to me to recall various incidents which reveal the
delicacies of feeling that were so considerable a part of her budding
character. Such a revelation came once in a way which, while creditable
to her heart, was defective in another direction. She was in her
eleventh year then. Her mother had been making the Christmas purchases,
and she allowed Susy to see the presents which were for Patrick's
children. Among these was a handsome sled for Jimmy, on which a stag was
painted; also, in gilt capitals, the word "Deer." Susy was excited and
joyous over everything, until she came to this sled. Then she became
sober and silent--yet the sled was the choicest of all the gifts. Her
mother was surprised, and also disappointed, and said:

"Why, Susy, doesn't it please you? Isn't it fine?"

Susy hesitated, and it was plain that she did not want to say the thing
that was in her mind. However, being urged, she brought it haltingly
out:

"Well, mamma, it _is_ fine, and of course it _did_ cost a good
deal--but--but--why should that be mentioned?"

Seeing that she was not understood, she reluctantly pointed to that word
"Deer." It was her orthography that was at fault, not her heart. She had
inherited both from her mother.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--IV.

BY MARK TWAIN.


When Susy was thirteen, and was a slender little maid with plaited tails
of copper-tinged brown hair down her back, and was perhaps the busiest
bee in the household hive, by reason of the manifold studies, health
exercises and recreations she had to attend to, she secretly, and of her
own motion, and out of love, added another task to her labors--the
writing of a biography of me. She did this work in her bedroom at night,
and kept her record hidden. After a little, the mother discovered it and
filched it, and let me see it; then told Susy what she had done, and how
pleased I was, and how proud. I remember that time with a deep
pleasure. I had had compliments before, but none that touched me like
this; none that could approach it for value in my eyes. It has kept that
place always since. I have had no compliment, no praise, no tribute from
any source, that was so precious to me as this one was and still is. As
I read it _now_, after all these many years, it is still a king's
message to me, and brings me the same dear surprise it brought me
then--with the pathos added, of the thought that the eager and hasty
hand that sketched it and scrawled it will not touch mine again--and I
feel as the humble and unexpectant must feel when their eyes fall upon
the edict that raises them to the ranks of the noble.

Yesterday while I was rummaging in a pile of ancient note-books of mine
which I had not seen for years, I came across a reference to that
biography. It is quite evident that several times, at breakfast and
dinner, in those long-past days, I was posing for the biography. In
fact, I clearly remember that I _was_ doing that--and I also remember
that Susy detected it. I remember saying a very smart thing, with a good
deal of an air, at the breakfast-table one morning, and that Susy
observed to her mother privately, a little later, that papa was doing
that for the biography.

I cannot bring myself to change any line or word in Susy's sketch of me,
but will introduce passages from it now and then just as they came in
their quaint simplicity out of her honest heart, which was the beautiful
heart of a child. What comes from that source has a charm and grace of
its own which may transgress all the recognized laws of literature, if
it choose, and yet be literature still, and worthy of hospitality. I
shall print the whole of this little biography, before I have done with
it--every word, every sentence.

The spelling is frequently desperate, but it was Susy's, and it shall
stand. I love it, and cannot profane it. To me, it is gold. To correct
it would alloy it, not refine it. It would spoil it. It would take from
it its freedom and flexibility and make it stiff and formal. Even when
it is most extravagant I am not shocked. It is Susy's spelling, and she
was doing the best she could--and nothing could better it for me....

Susy began the biography in 1885, when I was in the fiftieth year of my
age, and she just entering the fourteenth of hers. She begins in this
way:


     We are a very happy family. We consist of Papa, Mamma, Jean, Clara
     and me. It is papa I am writing about, and I shall have no trouble
     in not knowing what to say about him, as he is a _very_ striking
     character.


But wait a minute--I will return to Susy presently.

In the matter of slavish imitation, man is the monkey's superior all the
time. The average man is destitute of independence of opinion. He is not
interested in contriving an opinion of his own, by study and reflection,
but is only anxious to find out what his neighbor's opinion is and
slavishly adopt it. A generation ago, I found out that the latest review
of a book was pretty sure to be just a reflection of the _earliest_
review of it; that whatever the first reviewer found to praise or
censure in the book would be repeated in the latest reviewer's report,
with nothing fresh added. Therefore more than once I took the precaution
of sending my book, in manuscript, to Mr. Howells, when he was editor of
the "Atlantic Monthly," so that he could prepare a review of it at
leisure. I knew he would say the truth about the book--I also knew that
he would find more merit than demerit in it, because I already knew that
that was the condition of the book. I allowed no copy of it to go out to
the press until after Mr. Howells's notice of it had appeared. That book
was always safe. There wasn't a man behind a pen in all America that had
the courage to find anything in the book which Mr. Howells had not
found--there wasn't a man behind a pen in America that had spirit enough
to say a brave and original thing about the book on his own
responsibility.

I believe that the trade of critic, in literature, music, and the drama,
is the most degraded of all trades, and that it has no real
value--certainly no large value. When Charles Dudley Warner and I were
about to bring out "The Gilded Age," the editor of the "Daily Graphic"
persuaded me to let him have an advance copy, he giving me his word of
honor that no notice of it would appear in his paper until after the
"Atlantic Monthly" notice should have appeared. This reptile published a
review of the book within three days afterward. I could not really
complain, because he had only given me his word of honor as security; I
ought to have required of him something substantial. I believe his
notice did not deal mainly with the merit of the book, or the lack of
it, but with my moral attitude toward the public. It was charged that I
had used my reputation to play a swindle upon the public; that Mr.
Warner had written as much as half of the book, and that I had used my
name to float it and give it currency; a currency--so the critic
averred--which it could not have acquired without my name, and that this
conduct of mine was a grave fraud upon the people. The "Graphic" was not
an authority upon any subject whatever. It had a sort of distinction, in
that it was the first and only illustrated daily newspaper that the
world had seen; but it was without character; it was poorly and cheaply
edited; its opinion of a book or of any other work of art was of no
consequence. Everybody knew this, yet all the critics in America, one
after the other, copied the "Graphic's" criticism, merely changing the
phraseology, and left me under that charge of dishonest conduct. Even
the great Chicago "Tribune," the most important journal in the Middle
West, was not able to invent anything fresh, but adopted the view of the
humble "Daily Graphic," dishonesty-charge and all.

However, let it go. It is the will of God that we must have critics, and
missionaries, and Congressmen, and humorists, and we must bear the
burden. Meantime, I seem to have been drifting into criticism myself.
But that is nothing. At the worst, criticism is nothing more than a
crime, and I am not unused to that.

What I have been travelling toward all this time is this: the first
critic that ever had occasion to describe my personal appearance
littered his description with foolish and inexcusable errors whose
aggregate furnished the result that I was distinctly and distressingly
unhandsome. That description floated around the country in the papers,
and was in constant use and wear for a quarter of a century. It seems
strange to me that apparently no critic in the country could be found
who could look at me and have the courage to take up his pen and destroy
that lie. That lie began its course on the Pacific coast, in 1864, and
it likened me in personal appearance to Petroleum V. Nasby, who had been
out there lecturing. For twenty-five years afterward, no critic could
furnish a description of me without fetching in Nasby to help out my
portrait. I knew Nasby well, and he was a good fellow, but in my life I
have not felt malignant enough about any more than three persons to
charge those persons with resembling Nasby. It hurts me to the heart. I
was always handsome. Anybody but a critic could have seen it. And it
had long been a distress to my family--including Susy--that the critics
should go on making this wearisome mistake, year after year, when there
was no foundation for it. Even when a critic wanted to be particularly
friendly and complimentary to me, he didn't dare to go beyond my
clothes. He never ventured beyond that old safe frontier. When he had
finished with my clothes he had said all the kind things, the pleasant
things, the complimentary things he could risk. Then he dropped back on
Nasby.

Yesterday I found this clipping in the pocket of one of those ancient
memorandum-books of mine. It is of the date of thirty-nine years ago,
and both the paper and the ink are yellow with the bitterness that I
felt in that old day when I clipped it out to preserve it and brood over
it, and grieve about it. I will copy it here, to wit:


     A correspondent of the Philadelphia "Press," writing of one of
     Schuyler Colfax's receptions, says of our Washington correspondent:
     "Mark Twain, the delicate humorist, was present: quite a lion, as
     he deserves to be. Mark is a bachelor, faultless in taste, whose
     snowy vest is suggestive of endless quarrels with Washington
     washerwomen; but the heroism of Mark is settled for all time, for
     such purity and smoothness were never seen before. His lavender
     gloves might have been stolen from some Turkish harem, so delicate
     were they in size; but more likely--anything else were more likely
     than that. In form and feature he bears some resemblance to the
     immortal Nasby; but whilst Petroleum is brunette to the core, Twain
     is golden, amber-hued, melting, blonde."


Let us return to Susy's biography now, and get the opinion of one who is
unbiassed:

_From Susy's Biography._


     Papa's appearance has been described many times, but very
     incorrectly. He has beautiful gray hair, not any too thick or any
     too long, but just right; a Roman nose, which greatly improves the
     beauty of his features; kind blue eyes and a small mustache. He has
     a wonderfully shaped head and profile. He has a very good
     figure--in short, he is an extrodinarily fine looking man. All his
     features are perfect, except that he hasn't extrodinary teeth. His
     complexion is very fair, and he doesn't ware a beard. He is a very
     good man and a very funny one. He _has_ got a temper, but we all of
     us have in this family. He is the loveliest man I ever saw or ever
     hope to see--and oh, so absent-minded. He does tell perfectly
     delightful stories. Clara and I used to sit on each arm of his
     chair and listen while he told us stories about the pictures on the
     wall.


I remember the story-telling days vividly. They were a difficult and
exacting audience--those little creatures.

Along one side of the library, in the Hartford home, the bookshelves
joined the mantelpiece--in fact there were shelves on both sides of the
mantelpiece. On these shelves, and on the mantelpiece, stood various
ornaments. At one end of the procession was a framed oil-painting of a
cat's head, at the other end was a head of a beautiful young girl,
life-size--called Emmeline, because she looked just about like that--an
impressionist water-color. Between the one picture and the other there
were twelve or fifteen of the bric-à-brac things already mentioned; also
an oil-painting by Elihu Vedder, "The Young Medusa." Every now and then
the children required me to construct a romance--always impromptu--not a
moment's preparation permitted--and into that romance I had to get all
that bric-à-brac and the three pictures. I had to start always with the
cat and finish with Emmeline. I was never allowed the refreshment of a
change, end-for-end. It was not permissible to introduce a bric-à-brac
ornament into the story out of its place in the procession.

These bric-à-bracs were never allowed a peaceful day, a reposeful day, a
restful Sabbath. In their lives there was no Sabbath, in their lives
there was no peace; they knew no existence but a monotonous career of
violence and bloodshed. In the course of time, the bric-à-brac and the
pictures showed wear. It was because they had had so many and such
tumultuous adventures in their romantic careers.

As romancer to the children I had a hard time, even from the beginning.
If they brought me a picture, in a magazine, and required me to build a
story to it, they would cover the rest of the page with their pudgy
hands to keep me from stealing an idea from it. The stories had to come
hot from the bat, always. They had to be absolutely original and fresh.
Sometimes the children furnished me simply a character or two, or a
dozen, and required me to start out at once on that slim basis and
deliver those characters up to a vigorous and entertaining life of
crime. If they heard of a new trade, or an unfamiliar animal, or
anything like that, I was pretty sure to have to deal with those things
in the next romance. Once Clara required me to build a sudden tale out
of a plumber and a "bawgunstrictor," and I had to do it. She didn't
know what a boa-constrictor was, until he developed in the tale--then
she was better satisfied with it than ever.

_From Susy's Biography._


     Papa's favorite game is billiards, and when he is tired and wishes
     to rest himself he stays up all night and plays billiards, it seems
     to rest his head. He smokes a great deal almost incessantly. He has
     the mind of an author exactly, some of the simplest things he cant
     understand. Our burglar-alarm is often out of order, and papa had
     been obliged to take the mahogany-room off from the alarm
     altogether for a time, because the burglar-alarm had been in the
     habit of ringing even when the mahogany-room was closed. At length
     he thought that perhaps the burglar-alarm might be in order, and he
     decided to try and see; accordingly he put it on and then went down
     and opened the window; consequently the alarm bell rang, it would
     even if the alarm had been in order. Papa went despairingly
     upstairs and said to mamma, "Livy the mahogany-room won't go on. I
     have just opened the window to see."

     "Why, Youth," mamma replied "if you've opened the window, why of
     coarse the alarm will ring!"

     "That's what I've opened it for, why I just went down to see if it
     would ring!"

     Mamma tried to explain to papa that when he wanted to go and see
     whether the alarm would ring while the window was closed he
     _mustn't_ go and open the window--but in vain, papa couldn't
     understand, and got very impatient with mamma for trying to make
     him believe an impossible thing true.


This is a frank biographer, and an honest one; she uses no sand-paper on
me. I have, to this day, the same dull head in the matter of conundrums
and perplexities which Susy had discovered in those long-gone days.
Complexities annoy me; they irritate me; then this progressive feeling
presently warms into anger. I cannot get far in the reading of the
commonest and simplest contract--with its "parties of the first part,"
and "parties of the second part," and "parties of the third
part,"--before my temper is all gone. Ashcroft comes up here every day
and pathetically tries to make me understand the points of the lawsuit
which we are conducting against Henry Butters, Harold Wheeler, and the
rest of those Plasmon buccaneers, but daily he has to give it up. It is
pitiful to see, when he bends his earnest and appealing eyes upon me and
says, after one of his efforts, "Now you _do_ understand _that_, don't
you?"

I am always obliged to say, "I _don't_, Ashcroft. I wish I could
understand it, but I don't. Send for the cat."

In the days which Susy is talking about, a perplexity fell to my lot one
day. F. G. Whitmore was my business agent, and he brought me out from
town in his buggy. We drove by the _porte-cochère_ and toward the
stable. Now this was a _single_ road, and was like a spoon whose handle
stretched from the gate to a great round flower-bed in the neighborhood
of the stable. At the approach to the flower-bed the road divided and
circumnavigated it, making a loop, which I have likened to the bowl of
the spoon. As we neared the loop, I saw that Whitmore was laying his
course to port, (I was sitting on the starboard side--the side the house
was on), and was going to start around that spoon-bowl on that left-hand
side. I said,

"Don't do that, Whitmore; take the right-hand side. Then I shall be next
to the house when we get to the door."

He said, "_That_ will not happen in _any case_, it doesn't make any
difference which way I go around this flower-bed."

I explained to him that he was an ass, but he stuck to his proposition,
and I said,

"Go on and try it, and see."

He went on and tried it, and sure enough he fetched me up at the door on
the very side that he had said I would be. I was not able to believe it
then, and I don't believe it yet.

I said, "Whitmore, that is merely an accident. You can't do it again."

He said he could--and he drove down into the street, fetched around,
came back, and actually did it again. I was stupefied, paralyzed,
petrified, with these strange results, but they did not convince me. I
didn't believe he could do it another time, but he did. He said he could
do it all day, and fetch up the same way every time. By that time my
temper was gone, and I asked him to go home and apply to the Asylum and
I would pay the expenses; I didn't want to see him any more for a week.

I went up-stairs in a rage and started to tell Livy about it, expecting
to get her sympathy for me and to breed aversion in her for Whitmore;
but she merely burst into peal after peal of laughter, as the tale of my
adventure went on, for her head was like Susy's: riddles and
complexities had no terrors for it. Her mind and Susy's were analytical;
I have tried to make it appear that mine was different. Many and many a
time I have told that buggy experiment, hoping against hope that I would
some time or other find somebody who would be on my side, but it has
never happened. And I am never able to go glibly forward and state the
circumstances of that buggy's progress without having to halt and
consider, and call up in my mind the spoon-handle, the bowl of the
spoon, the buggy and the horse, and my position in the buggy: and the
minute I have got that far and try to turn it to the left it goes to
ruin; I can't see how it is ever going to fetch me out right when we get
to the door. Susy is right in her estimate. I can't understand things.

That burglar-alarm which Susy mentions led a gay and careless life, and
had no principles. It was generally out of order at one point or
another; and there was plenty of opportunity, because all the windows
and doors in the house, from the cellar up to the top floor, were
connected with it. However, in its seasons of being out of order it
could trouble us for only a very little while: we quickly found out that
it was fooling us, and that it was buzzing its blood-curdling alarm
merely for its own amusement. Then we would shut it off, and send to New
York for the electrician--there not being one in all Hartford in those
days. When the repairs were finished we would set the alarm again and
reestablish our confidence in it. It never did any real business except
upon one single occasion. All the rest of its expensive career was
frivolous and without purpose. Just that one time it performed its duty,
and its whole duty--gravely, seriously, admirably. It let fly about two
o'clock one black and dreary March morning, and I turned out promptly,
because I knew that it was not fooling, this time. The bath-room door
was on my side of the bed. I stepped in there, turned up the gas, looked
at the annunciator, and turned off the alarm--so far as the door
indicated was concerned--thus stopping the racket. Then I came back to
bed. Mrs. Clemens opened the debate:

"What was it?"

"It was the cellar door."

"Was it a burglar, do you think?"

"Yes," I said, "of course it was. Did you suppose it was a Sunday-school
superintendent?"

"No. What do you suppose he wants?"

"I suppose he wants jewelry, but he is not acquainted with the house and
he thinks it is in the cellar. I don't like to disappoint a burglar whom
I am not acquainted with, and who has done me no harm, but if he had
had common sagacity enough to inquire, I could have told him we kept
nothing down there but coal and vegetables. Still it may be that he is
acquainted with the place, and that what he really wants is coal and
vegetables. On the whole, I think it is vegetables he is after."

"Are you going down to see?"

"No; I could not be of any assistance. Let him select for himself; I
don't know where the things are."

Then she said, "But suppose he comes up to the ground floor!"

"That's all right. We shall know it the minute he opens a door on that
floor. It will set off the alarm."

Just then the terrific buzzing broke out again. I said,

"He has arrived. I told you he would. I know all about burglars and
their ways. They are systematic people."

I went into the bath-room to see if I was right, and I was. I shut off
the dining-room and stopped the buzzing, and came back to bed. My wife
said,

"What do you suppose he is after now?"

I said, "I think he has got all the vegetables he wants and is coming up
for napkin-rings and odds and ends for the wife and children. They all
have families--burglars have--and they are always thoughtful of them,
always take a few necessaries of life for themselves, and fill out with
tokens of remembrance for the family. In taking them they do not forget
us: those very things represent tokens of his remembrance of us, and
also of our remembrance of him. We never get them again; the memory of
the attention remains embalmed in our hearts."

"Are you going down to see what it is he wants now?"

"No," I said, "I am no more interested than I was before. They are
experienced people,--burglars; _they_ know what they want; I should be
no help to him. I _think_ he is after ceramics and bric-à-brac and such
things. If he knows the house he knows that that is all that he can find
on the dining-room floor."

She said, with a strong interest perceptible in her tone, "Suppose he
comes up here!"

I said, "It is all right. He will give us notice."

"What shall we do then then?"

"Climb out of the window."

She said, a little restively, "Well, what is the use of a burglar-alarm
for us?"

"You have seen, dear heart, that it has been useful up to the present
moment, and I have explained to you how it will be continuously useful
after he gets up here."

That was the end of it. He didn't ring any more alarms. Presently I
said,

"He is disappointed, I think. He has gone off with the vegetables and
the bric-à-brac, and I think he is dissatisfied."

We went to sleep, and at a quarter before eight in the morning I was
out, and hurrying, for I was to take the 8.29 train for New York. I
found the gas burning brightly--full head--all over the first floor. My
new overcoat was gone; my old umbrella was gone; my new patent-leather
shoes, which I had never worn, were gone. The large window which opened
into the _ombra_ at the rear of the house was standing wide. I passed
out through it and tracked the burglar down the hill through the trees;
tracked him without difficulty, because he had blazed his progress with
imitation silver napkin-rings, and my umbrella, and various other things
which he had disapproved of; and I went back in triumph and proved to my
wife that he _was_ a disappointed burglar. I had suspected he would be,
from the start, and from his not coming up to our floor to get human
beings.

Things happened to me that day in New York. I will tell about them
another time.

_From Susy's Biography._


     Papa has a peculiar gait we like, it seems just to sute him, but
     most people do not; he always walks up and down the room while
     thinking and between each coarse at meals.


A lady distantly related to us came to visit us once in those days. She
came to stay a week, but all our efforts to make her happy failed, we
could not imagine why, and she got up her anchor and sailed the next
morning. We did much guessing, but could not solve the mystery. Later we
found out what the trouble was. It was my tramping up and down between
the courses. She conceived the idea that I could not stand her society.

That word "Youth," as the reader has perhaps already guessed, was my
wife's pet name for me. It was gently satirical, but also affectionate.
I had certain mental and material peculiarities and customs proper to a
much younger person than I was.

_From Susy's Biography._


     Papa is very fond of animals particularly of cats, we had a dear
     little gray kitten once that he named "Lazy" (papa always wears
     gray to match his hair and eyes) and he would carry him around on
     his shoulder, it was a mighty pretty sight! the gray cat sound
     asleep against papa's gray coat and hair. The names that he has
     given our different cats, are realy remarkably funny, they are
     namely Stray Kit, Abner, Motley, Fraeulein, Lazy, Bufalo Bill,
     Cleveland, Sour Mash, and Pestilence and Famine.


At one time when the children were small, we had a very black mother-cat
named Satan, and Satan had a small black offspring named Sin. Pronouns
were a difficulty for the children. Little Clara came in one day, her
black eyes snapping with indignation, and said,

"Papa, Satan ought to be punished. She is out there at the greenhouse
and there she stays and stays, and his kitten is down-stairs crying."

_From Susy's Biography._


     Papa uses very strong language, but I have an idea not nearly so
     strong as when he first maried mamma. A lady acquaintance of his is
     rather apt to interupt what one is saying, and papa told mamma that
     he thought he should say to the lady's husband "I am glad your wife
     wasn't present when the Deity said 'Let there be light.'"


It is as I have said before. This is a frank historian. She doesn't
cover up one's deficiencies, but gives them an equal showing with one's
handsomer qualities. Of course I made the remark which she has
quoted--and even at this distant day I am still as much as half
persuaded that if that lady had been present when the Creator said, "Let
there be light," she would have interrupted Him and we shouldn't ever
have got it.

_From Susy's Biography._


     Papa said the other day, "I am a mugwump and a mugwump is pure from
     the marrow out." (Papa knows that I am writing this biography of
     him, and he said this for it.) He doesn't like to go to church at
     all, why I never understood, until just now, he told us the other
     day that he couldn't bear to hear any one talk but himself, but
     that he could listen to himself talk for hours without getting
     tired, of course he said this in joke, but I've no dought it was
     founded on truth.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--V.

BY MARK TWAIN.


Susy's remark about my strong language troubles me, and I must go back
to it. All through the first ten years of my married life I kept a
constant and discreet watch upon my tongue while in the house, and went
outside and to a distance when circumstances were too much for me and I
was obliged to seek relief. I prized my wife's respect and approval
above all the rest of the human race's respect and approval. I dreaded
the day when she should discover that I was but a whited sepulchre
partly freighted with suppressed language. I was so careful, during ten
years, that I had not a doubt that my suppressions had been successful.
Therefore I was quite as happy in my guilt as I could have been if I had
been innocent.

But at last an accident exposed me. I went into the bath-room one
morning to make my toilet, and carelessly left the door two or three
inches ajar. It was the first time that I had ever failed to take the
precaution of closing it tightly. I knew the necessity of being
particular about this, because shaving was always a trying ordeal for
me, and I could seldom carry it through to a finish without verbal
helps. Now this time I was unprotected, but did not suspect it. I had no
extraordinary trouble with my razor on this occasion, and was able to
worry through with mere mutterings and growlings of an improper sort,
but with nothing noisy or emphatic about them--no snapping and barking.
Then I put on a shirt. My shirts are an invention of my own. They open
in the back, and are buttoned there--when there are buttons. This time
the button was missing. My temper jumped up several degrees in a moment,
and my remarks rose accordingly, both in loudness and vigor of
expression. But I was not troubled, for the bath-room door was a solid
one and I supposed it was firmly closed. I flung up the window and threw
the shirt out. It fell upon the shrubbery where the people on their way
to church could admire it if they wanted to; there was merely fifty feet
of grass between the shirt and the passer-by. Still rumbling and
thundering distantly, I put on another shirt. Again the button was
absent. I augmented my language to meet the emergency, and threw that
shirt out of the window. I was too angry--too insane--to examine the
third shirt, but put it furiously on. Again the button was absent, and
that shirt followed its comrades out of the window. Then I straightened
up, gathered my reserves, and let myself go like a cavalry charge. In
the midst of that great assault, my eye fell upon that gaping door, and
I was paralyzed.

It took me a good while to finish my toilet. I extended the time
unnecessarily in trying to make up my mind as to what I would best do in
the circumstances. I tried to hope that Mrs. Clemens was asleep, but I
knew better. I could not escape by the window. It was narrow, and suited
only to shirts. At last I made up my mind to boldly loaf through the
bedroom with the air of a person who had not been doing anything. I made
half the journey successfully. I did not turn my eyes in her direction,
because that would not be safe. It is very difficult to look as if you
have not been doing anything when the facts are the other way, and my
confidence in my performance oozed steadily out of me as I went along. I
was aiming for the left-hand door because it was furthest from my wife.
It had never been opened from the day that the house was built, but it
seemed a blessed refuge for me now. The bed was this one, wherein I am
lying now, and dictating these histories morning after morning with so
much serenity. It was this same old elaborately carved black Venetian
bedstead--the most comfortable bedstead that ever was, with space enough
in it for a family, and carved angels enough surmounting its twisted
columns and its headboard and footboard to bring peace to the sleepers,
and pleasant dreams. I had to stop in the middle of the room. I hadn't
the strength to go on. I believed that I was under accusing eyes--that
even the carved angels were inspecting me with an unfriendly gaze. You
know how it is when you are convinced that somebody behind you is
looking steadily at you. You _have_ to turn your face--you can't help
it. I turned mine. The bed was placed as it is now, with the foot where
the head ought to be. If it had been placed as it should have been, the
high headboard would have sheltered me. But the footboard was no
sufficient protection, for I could be seen over it. I was exposed. I was
wholly without protection. I turned, because I couldn't help it--and my
memory of what I saw is still vivid, after all these years.

Against the white pillows I saw the black head--I saw that young and
beautiful face; and I saw the gracious eyes with a something in them
which I had never seen there before. They were snapping and flashing
with indignation. I felt myself crumbling; I felt myself shrinking away
to nothing under that accusing gaze. I stood silent under that
desolating fire for as much as a minute, I should say--it seemed a very,
very long time. Then my wife's lips parted, and from them issued--_my
latest bath-room remark_. The language perfect, but the expression
velvety, unpractical, apprenticelike, ignorant, inexperienced, comically
inadequate, absurdly weak and unsuited to the great language. In my
lifetime I had never heard anything so out of tune, so inharmonious, so
incongruous, so ill-suited to each other as were those mighty words set
to that feeble music. I tried to keep from laughing, for I was a guilty
person in deep need of charity and mercy. I tried to keep from
bursting, and I succeeded--until she gravely said, "There, now you know
how it sounds."

Then I exploded; the air was filled with my fragments, and you could
hear them whiz. I said, "Oh Livy, if it sounds like _that_ I will never
do it again!"

Then she had to laugh herself. Both of us broke into convulsions, and
went on laughing until we were physically exhausted and spiritually
reconciled.

The children were present at breakfast--Clara aged six and Susy
eight--and the mother made a guarded remark about strong language;
guarded because she did not wish the children to suspect anything--a
guarded remark which censured strong language. Both children broke out
in one voice with this comment, "Why, mamma, papa uses it!"

I was astonished. I had supposed that that secret was safe in my own
breast, and that its presence had never been suspected. I asked,

"How did you know, you little rascals?"

"Oh," they said, "we often listen over the balusters when you are in the
hall explaining things to George."

_From Susy's Biography._


     One of papa's latest books is "The Prince and the Pauper" and it is
     unquestionably the best book he has ever written, some people want
     him to keep to his old style, some gentleman wrote him, "I enjoyed
     Huckleberry Finn immensely and am glad to see that you have
     returned to your old style." That enoyed me that enoyed me greatly,
     because it trobles me [Susy was troubled by that word, and
     uncertain; she wrote a u above it in the proper place, but
     reconsidered the matter and struck it out] to have so few people
     know papa, I mean realy know him, they think of Mark Twain as a
     humorist joking at everything; "And with a mop of reddish brown
     hair which sorely needs the barbars brush a roman nose, short
     stubby mustache, a sad care-worn face, with maney crow's feet" etc.
     That is the way people picture papa, I have wanted papa to write a
     book that would reveal something of his kind sympathetic nature,
     and "The Prince and the Pauper" partly does it. The book is full of
     lovely charming ideas, and oh the language! It is _perfect_. I
     think that one of the most touching scenes in it, is where the
     pauper is riding on horseback with his nobles in the "recognition
     procession" and he sees his mother oh and then what followed! How
     she runs to his side, when she sees him throw up his hand palm
     outward, and is rudely pushed off by one of the King's officers,
     and then how the little pauper's consceince troubles him when he
     remembers the shameful words that were falling from his lips, when
     she was turned from his side "I know you not woman" and how his
     grandeurs were stricken valueless, and his pride consumed to ashes.
     It is a wonderfully beautiful and touching little scene, and papa
     has described it so wonderfully. I never saw a man with so much
     variety of feeling as papa has; now the "Prince and the Pauper" is
     full of touching places; but there is most always a streak of humor
     in them somewhere. Now in the coronation--in the stirring
     coronation, just after the little king has got his crown back again
     papa brings that in about the Seal, where the pauper says he used
     the Seal "to crack nuts with." Oh it is so funny and nice! Papa
     very seldom writes a passage without some humor in it somewhere,
     and I dont think he ever will.


The children always helped their mother to edit my books in manuscript.
She would sit on the porch at the farm and read aloud, with her pencil
in her hand, and the children would keep an alert and suspicious eye
upon her right along, for the belief was well grounded in them that
whenever she came across a particularly satisfactory passage she would
strike it out. Their suspicions were well founded. The passages which
were so satisfactory to them always had an element of strength in them
which sorely needed modification or expurgation, and were always sure to
get it at their mother's hand. For my own entertainment, and to enjoy
the protests of the children, I often abused my editor's innocent
confidence. I often interlarded remarks of a studied and felicitously
atrocious character purposely to achieve the children's brief delight,
and then see the remorseless pencil do its fatal work. I often joined my
supplications to the children's for mercy, and strung the argument out
and pretended to be in earnest. They were deceived, and so was their
mother. It was three against one, and most unfair. But it was very
delightful, and I could not resist the temptation. Now and then we
gained the victory and there was much rejoicing. Then I privately struck
the passage out myself. It had served its purpose. It had furnished
three of us with good entertainment, and in being removed from the book
by me it was only suffering the fate originally intended for it.

_From Susy's Biography._


     Papa was born in Missouri. His mother is Grandma Clemens (Jane
     Lampton Clemens) of Kentucky. Grandpa Clemens was of the F.F.V's of
     Virginia.


Without doubt it was I that gave Susy that impression. I cannot imagine
why, because I was never in my life much impressed by grandeurs which
proceed from the accident of birth. I did not get this indifference from
my mother. She was always strongly interested in the ancestry of the
house. She traced her own line back to the Lambtons of Durham,
England--a family which had been occupying broad lands there since Saxon
times. I am not sure, but I think that those Lambtons got along without
titles of nobility for eight or nine hundred years, then produced a
great man, three-quarters of a century ago, and broke into the peerage.
My mother knew all about the Clemenses of Virginia, and loved to
aggrandize them to me, but she has long been dead. There has been no one
to keep those details fresh in my memory, and they have grown dim.

There was a Jere. Clemens who was a United States Senator, and in his
day enjoyed the usual Senatorial fame--a fame which perishes whether it
spring from four years' service or forty. After Jere. Clemens's fame as
a Senator passed away, he was still remembered for many years on account
of another service which he performed. He shot old John Brown's Governor
Wise in the hind leg in a duel. However, I am not very clear about this.
It may be that Governor Wise shot _him_ in the hind leg. However, I
don't think it is important. I think that the only thing that is really
important is that one of them got shot in the hind leg. It would have
been better and nobler and more historical and satisfactory if both of
them had got shot in the hind leg--but it is of no use for me to try to
recollect history. I never had a historical mind. Let it go. Whichever
way it happened I am glad of it, and that is as much enthusiasm as I can
get up for a person bearing my name. But I am forgetting the first
Clemens--the one that stands furthest back toward the really original
_first_ Clemens, which was Adam.

_From Susy's Biography._


     Clara and I are sure that papa played the trick on Grandma, about
     the whipping, that is related in "The Adventures of Tom Sayer":
     "Hand me that switch." The switch hovered in the air, the peril was
     desperate--"My, look behind you Aunt!" The old lady whirled around
     and snatched her skirts out of danger. The lad fled on the instant,
     scrambling up the high board fence and dissapeared over it.


Susy and Clara were quite right about that.

Then Susy says:


     And we know papa played "Hookey" all the time. And how readily
     would papa pretend to be dying so as not to have to go to school!


These revelations and exposures are searching, but they are just If I am
as transparent to other people as I was to Susy, I have wasted much
effort in this life.


     Grandma couldn't make papa go to school, no she let him go into a
     printing-office to learn the trade. He did so, and gradually picked
     up enough education to enable him to do about as well as those who
     were more studious in early life.


It is noticeable that Susy does not get overheated when she is
complimenting me, but maintains a proper judicial and biographical calm.
It is noticeable, also, and it is to her credit as a biographer, that
she distributes compliment and criticism with a fair and even hand.

My mother had a good deal of trouble with me, but I think she enjoyed
it. She had none at all with my brother Henry, who was two years younger
than I, and I think that the unbroken monotony of his goodness and
truthfulness and obedience would have been a burden to her but for the
relief and variety which I furnished in the other direction. I was a
tonic. I was valuable to her. I never thought of it before, but now I
see it. I never knew Henry to do a vicious thing toward me, or toward
any one else--but he frequently did righteous ones that cost me as
heavily. It was his duty to report me, when I needed reporting and
neglected to do it myself, and he was very faithful in discharging that
duty. He is "Sid" in "Tom Sawyer." But Sid was not Henry. Henry was a
very much finer and better boy than ever Sid was.

It was Henry who called my mother's attention to the fact that the
thread with which she had sewed my collar together to keep me from going
in swimming, had changed color. My mother would not have discovered it
but for that, and she was manifestly piqued when she recognized that
that prominent bit of circumstantial evidence had escaped her sharp eye.
That detail probably added a detail to my punishment. It is human. We
generally visit our shortcomings on somebody else when there is a
possible excuse for it--but no matter, I took it out of Henry. There is
always compensation for such as are unjustly used. I often took it out
of him--sometimes as an advance payment for something which I hadn't yet
done. These were occasions when the opportunity was too strong a
temptation, and I had to draw on the future. I did not need to copy this
idea from my mother, and probably didn't. Still she wrought upon that
principle upon occasion.

If the incident of the broken sugar-bowl is in "Tom Sawyer"--I don't
remember whether it is or not--that is an example of it. Henry never
stole sugar. He took it openly from the bowl. His mother knew he
wouldn't take sugar when she wasn't looking, but she had her doubts
about me. Not exactly doubts, either. She knew very well I _would._ One
day when she was not present, Henry took sugar from her prized and
precious old English sugar-bowl, which was an heirloom in the
family--and he managed to break the bowl. It was the first time I had
ever had a chance to tell anything on him, and I was inexpressibly glad.
I told him I was going to tell on him, but he was not disturbed. When my
mother came in and saw the bowl lying on the floor in fragments, she was
speechless for a minute. I allowed that silence to work; I judged it
would increase the effect. I was waiting for her to ask "Who did
that?"--so that I could fetch out my news. But it was an error of
calculation. When she got through with her silence she didn't ask
anything about it--she merely gave me a crack on the skull with her
thimble that I felt all the way down to my heels. Then I broke out with
my injured innocence, expecting to make her very sorry that she had
punished the wrong one. I expected her to do something remorseful and
pathetic. I told her that I was not the one--it was Henry. But there was
no upheaval. She said, without emotion, "It's all right. It isn't any
matter. You deserve it for something you've done that I didn't know
about; and if you haven't done it, why then you deserve it for something
that you are going to do, that I sha'n't hear about."

There was a stairway outside the house, which led up to the rear part of
the second story. One day Henry was sent on an errand, and he took a tin
bucket along. I knew he would have to ascend those stairs, so I went up
and locked the door on the inside, and came down into the garden, which
had been newly ploughed and was rich in choice firm clods of black mold.
I gathered a generous equipment of these, and ambushed him. I waited
till he had climbed the stairs and was near the landing and couldn't
escape. Then I bombarded him with clods, which he warded off with his
tin bucket the best he could, but without much success, for I was a good
marksman. The clods smashing against the weather-boarding fetched my
mother out to see what was the matter, and I tried to explain that I was
amusing Henry. Both of them were after me in a minute, but I knew the
way over that high board fence and escaped for that time. After an hour
or two, when I ventured back, there was no one around and I thought the
incident was closed. But it was not. Henry was ambushing me. With an
unusually competent aim for him, he landed a stone on the side of my
head which raised a bump there that felt like the Matterhorn. I carried
it to my mother straightway for sympathy, but she was not strongly
moved. It seemed to be her idea that incidents like this would
eventually reform me if I harvested enough of them. So the matter was
only educational. I had had a sterner view of it than that, before.

It was not right to give the cat the "Pain-Killer"; I realize it now. I
would not repeat it in these days. But in those "Tom Sawyer" days it was
a great and sincere satisfaction to me to see Peter perform under its
influence--and if actions _do_ speak as loud as words, he took as much
interest in it as I did. It was a most detestable medicine, Perry
Davis's Pain-Killer. Mr. Pavey's negro man, who was a person of good
judgment and considerable curiosity, wanted to sample it, and I let him.
It was his opinion that it was made of hell-fire.

Those were the cholera days of '49. The people along the Mississippi
were paralyzed with fright. Those who could run away, did it. And many
died of fright in the flight. Fright killed three persons where the
cholera killed one. Those who couldn't flee kept themselves drenched
with cholera preventives, and my mother chose Perry Davis's Pain-Killer
for me. She was not distressed about herself. She avoided that kind of
preventive. But she made me promise to take a teaspoonful of Pain-Killer
every day. Originally it was my intention to keep the promise, but at
that time I didn't know as much about Pain-Killer as I knew after my
first experiment with it. She didn't watch Henry's bottle--she could
trust Henry. But she marked my bottle with a pencil, on the label, every
day, and examined it to see if the teaspoonful had been removed. The
floor was not carpeted. It had cracks in it, and I fed the Pain-Killer
to the cracks with very good results--no cholera occurred down below.

It was upon one of these occasions that that friendly cat came waving
his tail and supplicating for Pain-Killer--which he got--and then went
into those hysterics which ended with his colliding with all the
furniture in the room and finally going out of the open window and
carrying the flower-pots with him, just in time for my mother to arrive
and look over her glasses in petrified astonishment and say, "What in
the world is the matter with Peter?"

I don't remember what my explanation was, but if it is recorded in that
book it may not be the right one.

Whenever my conduct was of such exaggerated impropriety that my mother's
extemporary punishments were inadequate, she saved the matter up for
Sunday, and made me go to church Sunday night--which was a penalty
sometimes bearable, perhaps, but as a rule it was not, and I avoided it
for the sake of my constitution. She would never believe that I had been
to church until she had applied her test: she made me tell her what the
text was. That was a simple matter, and caused me no trouble. I didn't
have to go to church to get a text. I selected one for myself. This
worked very well until one time when my text and the one furnished by a
neighbor, who had been to church, didn't tally. After that my mother
took other methods. I don't know what they were now.

In those days men and boys wore rather long cloaks in the winter-time.
They were black, and were lined with very bright and showy Scotch
plaids. One winter's night when I was starting to church to square a
crime of some kind committed during the week, I hid my cloak near the
gate and went off and played with the other boys until church was over.
Then I returned home. But in the dark I put the cloak on wrong side out,
entered the room, threw the cloak aside, and then stood the usual
examination. I got along very well until the temperature of the church
was mentioned. My mother said,

"It must have been impossible to keep warm there on such a night."

I didn't see the art of that remark, and was foolish enough to explain
that I wore my cloak all the time that I was in church. She asked if I
kept it on from church home, too. I didn't see the bearing of that
remark. I said that that was what I had done. She said,

"You wore it in church with that red Scotch plaid outside and glaring?
Didn't that attract any attention?"

Of course to continue such a dialogue would have been tedious and
unprofitable, and I let it go, and took the consequences.

That was about 1849. Tom Nash was a boy of my own age--the postmaster's
son. The Mississippi was frozen across, and he and I went skating one
night, probably without permission. I cannot see why we should go
skating in the night unless without permission, for there could be no
considerable amusement to be gotten out of skating at night if nobody
was going to object to it. About midnight, when we were more than half a
mile out toward the Illinois shore, we heard some ominous rumbling and
grinding and crashing going on between us and the home side of the
river, and we knew what it meant--the ice was breaking up. We started
for home, pretty badly scared. We flew along at full speed whenever the
moonlight sifting down between the clouds enabled us to tell which was
ice and which was water. In the pauses we waited; started again whenever
there was a good bridge of ice; paused again when we came to naked water
and waited in distress until a floating vast cake should bridge that
place. It took us an hour to make the trip--a trip which we made in a
misery of apprehension all the time. But at last we arrived within a
very brief distance of the shore. We waited again; there was another
place that needed bridging. All about us the ice was plunging and
grinding along and piling itself up in mountains on the shore, and the
dangers were increasing, not diminishing. We grew very impatient to get
to solid ground, so we started too early and went springing from cake to
cake. Tom made a miscalculation, and fell short. He got a bitter bath,
but he was so close to shore that he only had to swim a stroke or
two--then his feet struck hard bottom and he crawled out. I arrived a
little later, without accident. We had been in a drenching perspiration,
and Tom's bath was a disaster for him. He took to his bed sick, and had
a procession of diseases. The closing one was scarlet-fever, and he came
out of it stone deaf. Within a year or two speech departed, of course.
But some years later he was taught to talk, after a fashion--one
couldn't always make out what it was he was trying to say. Of course he
could not modulate his voice, since he couldn't hear himself talk. When
he supposed he was talking low and confidentially, you could hear him in
Illinois.

Four years ago (1902) I was invited by the University of Missouri to
come out there and receive the honorary degree of LL.D. I took that
opportunity to spend a week in Hannibal--a city now, a village in my
day. It had been fifty-three years since Tom Nash and I had had that
adventure. When I was at the railway station ready to leave Hannibal,
there was a crowd of citizens there. I saw Tom Nash approaching me
across a vacant space, and I walked toward him, for I recognized him at
once. He was old and white-headed, but the boy of fifteen was still
visible in him. He came up to me, made a trumpet of his hands at my ear,
nodded his head toward the citizens and said confidentially--in a yell
like a fog-horn--

"Same damned fools, Sam!"

_From Susy's Biography._


     Papa was about twenty years old when he went on the Mississippi as
     a pilot. Just before he started on his tripp Grandma Clemens asked
     him to promise her on the Bible not to touch intoxicating liquors
     or swear, and he said "Yes, mother, I will," and he kept that
     promise seven years when Grandma released him from it.


Under the inspiring influence of that remark, what a garden of forgotten
reforms rises upon my sight!

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--VI.

BY MARK TWAIN.


_From Susy's Biography_.


     Papa made arrangements to read at Vassar College the 1st of May,
     and I went with him. We went by way of New York City. Mamma went
     with us to New York and stayed two days to do some shopping. We
     started Tuesday, at 1/2 past two o'clock in the afternoon, and
     reached New York about 1/4 past six. Papa went right up to General
     Grants from the station and mamma and I went to the Everett House.
     Aunt Clara came to supper with us up in our room....

     We and Aunt Clara were going were going to the theatre right after
     supper, and we expected papa to take us there and to come home as
     early as he could. But we got through dinner and he didn't come,
     and didn't come, and mamma got more perplexed and worried, but at
     last we thought we would have to go without him. So we put on our
     things and started down stairs but before we'd goten half down we
     met papa coming up with a great bunch of roses in his hand. He
     explained that the reason he was so late was that his watch stopped
     and he didn't notice and kept thinking it an hour earlier than it
     really was. The roses he carried were some Col. Fred Grant sent to
     mamma. We went to the theatre and enjoyed "Adonis" [word illegible]
     acted very much. We reached home about 1/2 past eleven o'clock and
     went right to bed. Wednesday morning we got up rather late and had
     breakfast about 1/2 past nine o'clock. After breakfast mamma went
     out shopping and papa and I went to see papa's agent about some
     business matters. After papa had gotten through talking to Cousin
     Charlie, [Webster] papa's agent, we went to get a friend of papa's,
     Major Pond, to go and see a Dog Show with us. Then we went to see
     the dogs with Major Pond and we had a delightful time seeing so
     many dogs together; when we got through seeing the dogs papa
     thought he would go and see General Grant and I went with him--this
     was April 29, 1885. Papa went up into General Grant's room and he
     took me with him, I felt greatly honored and delighted when papa
     took me into General Grant's room and let me see the General and
     Col. Grant, for General Grant is a man I shall be glad all my life
     that I have seen. Papa and General Grant had a long talk together
     and papa has written an account of his talk and visit with General
     Grant for me to put into this biography.


Susy has inserted in this place that account of mine--as follows:


                                                    April 29, 1885.

     I called on General Grant and took Susy with me. The General was
     looking and feeling far better than he had looked or felt for some
     months. He had ventured to work again on his book that morning--the
     first time he had done any work for perhaps a month. This morning's
     work was his first attempt at dictating, and it was a thorough
     success, to his great delight. He had always said that it would be
     impossible for him to dictate anything, but I had said that he was
     noted for clearness of statement, and as a narrative was simply a
     statement of consecutive facts, he was consequently peculiarly
     qualified and equipped for dictation. This turned out to be true.
     For he had dictated two hours that morning to a shorthand writer,
     had never hesitated for words, had not repeated himself, and the
     manuscript when finished needed no revision. The two hours' work
     was an account of Appomattox--and this was such an extremely
     important feature that his book would necessarily have been
     severely lame without it. Therefore I had taken a shorthand writer
     there before, to see if I could not get him to write at least a few
     lines about Appomattox.[5] But he was at that time not well enough
     to undertake it. I was aware that of all the hundred versions of
     Appomattox, not one was really correct. Therefore I was extremely
     anxious that he should leave behind him the truth. His throat was
     not distressing him, and his voice was much better and stronger
     than usual. He was so delighted to have gotten Appomattox
     accomplished once more in his life--to have gotten the matter off
     his mind--that he was as talkative as his old self. He received
     Susy very pleasantly, and then fell to talking about certain
     matters which he hoped to be able to dictate next day; and he said
     in substance that, among other things, he wanted to settle once for
     all a question that had been bandied about from mouth to mouth and
     from newspaper to newspaper. That question was, "With whom
     originated the idea of the march to the sea? Was it Grant's, or was
     it Sherman's idea?" Whether I, or some one else (being anxious to
     get the important fact settled) asked him with whom the idea
     originated, I don't remember. But I remember his answer. I shall
     always remember his answer. General Grant said:

     "Neither of us originated the idea of Sherman's march to the sea.
     The enemy did it."

     He went on to say that the enemy, however, necessarily originated a
     great many of the plans that the general on the opposite side gets
     the credit for; at the same time that the enemy is doing that, he
     is laying open other moves which the opposing general sees and
     takes advantage of. In this case, Sherman had a plan all thought
     out, of course. He meant to destroy the two remaining railroads in
     that part of the country, and that would finish up that region. But
     General Hood did not play the military part that he was expected to
     play. On the contrary, General Hood made a dive at Chattanooga.
     This left the march to the sea open to Sherman, and so after
     sending part of his army to defend and hold what he had acquired in
     the Chattanooga region, he was perfectly free to proceed, with the
     rest of it, through Georgia. He saw the opportunity, and he would
     not have been fit for his place if he had not seized it.

     "He wrote me" (the General is speaking) "what his plan was, and I
     sent him word to go ahead. My staff were opposed to the movement."
     (I think the General said they tried to persuade him to stop
     Sherman. The chief of his staff, the General said, even went so far
     as to go to Washington without the General's knowledge and get the
     ear of the authorities, and he succeeded in arousing their fears to
     such an extent that they telegraphed General Grant to stop
     Sherman.)

     Then General Grant said, "Out of deference to the Government, I
     telegraphed Sherman and stopped him twenty-four hours; and then
     considering that that was deference enough to the Government, I
     telegraphed him to go ahead again."

     I have not tried to give the General's language, but only the
     general idea of what he said. The thing that mainly struck me was
     his terse remark that the enemy originated the idea of the march to
     the sea. It struck me because it was so suggestive of the General's
     epigrammatic fashion--saying a great deal in a single crisp
     sentence. (This is my account, and signed "Mark Twain.")


_Susy Resumes._


     After papa and General Grant had had their talk, we went back to
     the hotel where mamma was, and papa told mamma all about his
     interview with General Grant. Mamma and I had a nice quiet
     afternoon together.


That pair of devoted comrades were always shutting themselves up
together when there was opportunity to have what Susy called "a cozy
time." From Susy's nursery days to the end of her life, she and her
mother were close friends; intimate friends, passionate adorers of each
other. Susy's was a beautiful mind, and it made her an interesting
comrade. And with the fine mind she had a heart like her mother's. Susy
never had an interest or an occupation which she was not glad to put
aside for that something which was in all cases more precious to her--a
visit with her mother. Susy died at the right time, the fortunate time
of life; the happy age--twenty-four years. At twenty-four, such a girl
has seen the best of life--life as a happy dream. After that age the
risks begin; responsibility comes, and with it the cares, the sorrows,
and the inevitable tragedy. For her mother's sake I would have brought
her back from the grave if I could, but I would not have done it for my
own.

_From Susy's Biography_.


     Then papa went to read in public; there were a great many authors
     that read, that Thursday afternoon, beside papa; I would have liked
     to have gone and heard papa read, but papa said he was going to
     read in Vassar just what he was planning to read in New York, so I
     stayed at home with mamma.

     The next day mamma planned to take the four o'clock car back to
     Hartford. We rose quite early that morning and went to the Vienna
     Bakery and took breakfast there. From there we went to a German
     bookstore and bought some German books for Clara's birthday.


Dear me, the power of association to snatch mouldy dead memories out of
their graves and make them walk! That remark about buying foreign books
throws a sudden white glare upon the distant past; and I see the long
stretch of a New York street with an unearthly vividness, and John Hay
walking down it, grave and remorseful. I was walking down it too, that
morning, and I overtook Hay and asked him what the trouble was. He
turned a lustreless eye upon me and said:

"My case is beyond cure. In the most innocent way in the world I have
committed a crime which will never be forgiven by the sufferers, for
they will never believe--oh, well, no, I was going to say they would
never believe that I did the thing innocently. The truth is they will
know that I acted innocently, because they are rational people; but what
of that? I never can look them in the face again--nor they me, perhaps."

Hay was a young bachelor, and at that time was on the "Tribune" staff.
He explained his trouble in these words, substantially:

"When I was passing along here yesterday morning on my way down-town to
the office, I stepped into a bookstore where I am acquainted, and asked
if they had anything new from the other side. They handed me a French
novel, in the usual yellow paper cover, and I carried it away. I didn't
even look at the title of it. It was for recreation reading, and I was
on my way to my work. I went mooning and dreaming along, and I think I
hadn't gone more than fifty yards when I heard my name called. I
stopped, and a private carriage drew up at the sidewalk and I shook
hands with the inmates--mother and young daughter, excellent people.
They were on their way to the steamer to sail for Paris. The mother
said,

"'I saw that book in your hand and I judged by the look of it that it
was a French novel. Is it?'

"I said it was.

"She said, 'Do let me have it, so that my daughter can practise her
French on it on the way over.'

"Of course I handed her the book, and we parted. Ten minutes ago I was
passing that bookstore again, and I stepped in and fetched away another
copy of that book. Here it is. Read the first page of it. That is
enough. You will know what the rest is like. I think it must be the
foulest book in the French language--one of the foulest, anyway. I would
be ashamed to offer it to a harlot--but, oh dear, I gave it to that
sweet young girl without shame. Take my advice; don't give away a book
until you have examined it."

_From Susy's Biography._


     Then mamma and I went to do some shopping and papa went to see
     General Grant. After we had finnished doing our shopping we went
     home to the hotel together. When we entered our rooms in the hotel
     we saw on the table a vase full of exquisett red roses. Mamma who
     is very fond of flowers exclaimed "Oh I wonder who could have sent
     them." We both looked at the card in the midst of the roses and saw
     that it was written on in papa's handwriting, it was written in
     German. 'Liebes Geshchenk on die mamma.' [I am sure I didn't say
     "on"--that is Susy's spelling, not mine; also I am sure I didn't
     spell Geschenk so liberally as all that.--S. L. C.] Mamma was
     delighted. Papa came home and gave mamma her ticket; and after
     visiting a while with her went to see Major Pond and mamma and I
     sat down to our lunch. After lunch most of our time was taken up
     with packing, and at about three o'clock we went to escort mamma to
     the train. We got on board the train with her and stayed with her
     about five minutes and then we said good-bye to her and the train
     started for Hartford. It was the first time I had ever beene away
     from home without mamma in my life, although I was 13 yrs. old.
     Papa and I drove back to the hotel and got Major Pond and then went
     to see the Brooklyn Bridge we went across it to Brooklyn on the
     cars and then walked back across it from Brooklyn to New York. We
     enjoyed looking at the beautiful scenery and we could see the
     bridge moove under the intense heat of the sun. We had a perfectly
     delightful time, but weer pretty tired when we got back to the
     hotel.

     The next morning we rose early, took our breakfast and took an
     early train to Poughkeepsie. We had a very pleasant journey to
     Poughkeepsie. The Hudson was magnificent--shrouded with beautiful
     mist. When we arived at Poughkeepsie it was raining quite hard;
     which fact greatly dissapointed me because I very much wanted to
     see the outside of the buildings of Vassar College and as it rained
     that would be impossible. It was quite a long drive from the
     station to Vasser College and papa and I had a nice long time to
     discuss and laugh over German profanity. One of the German phrases
     papa particularly enjoys is "O heilige maria Mutter Jesus!" Jean
     has a German nurse, and this was one of her phrases, there was a
     time when Jean exclaimed "Ach Gott!" to every trifle, but when
     mamma found it out she was shocked and instantly put a stop to it.


It brings that pretty little German girl vividly before me--a sweet and
innocent and plump little creature with peachy cheeks; a clear-souled
little maiden and without offence, notwithstanding her profanities, and
she was loaded to the eyebrows with them. She was a mere child. She was
not fifteen yet. She was just from Germany, and knew no English. She was
always scattering her profanities around, and they were such a
satisfaction to me that I never dreamed of such a thing as modifying
her. For my own sake, I had no disposition to tell on her. Indeed I took
pains to keep her from being found out. I told her to confine her
religious exercises to the children's quarters, and urged her to
remember that Mrs. Clemens was prejudiced against pieties on week-days.
To the children, the little maid's profanities sounded natural and
proper and right, because they had been used to that kind of talk in
Germany, and they attached no evil importance to it. It grieves me that
I have forgotten those vigorous remarks. I long hoarded them in my
memory as a treasure. But I remember one of them still, because I heard
it so many times. The trial of that little creature's life was the
children's hair. She would tug and strain with her comb, accompanying
her work with her misplaced pieties. And when finally she was through
with her triple job she always fired up and exploded her thanks toward
the sky, where they belonged, in this form: "_Gott sei Dank ich bin
fertig mit'm Gott verdammtes Haar!_" (I believe I am not quite brave
enough to translate it.)

_From Susy's Biography_.


     We at length reached Vassar College and she looked very finely, her
     buildings and her grounds being very beautiful. We went to the
     front doore and range the bell. The young girl who came to the
     doore wished to know who we wanted to see. Evidently we were not
     expected. Papa told her who we wanted to see and she showed us to
     the parlor. We waited, no one came; and waited, no one came, still
     no one came. It was beginning to seem pretty awkward, "Oh well this
     is a pretty piece of business," papa exclaimed. At length we heard
     footsteps coming down the long corridor and Miss C, (the lady who
     had invited papa) came into the room. She greeted papa very
     pleasantly and they had a nice little chatt together. Soon the lady
     principal also entered and she was very pleasant and agreable. She
     showed us to our rooms and said she would send for us when dinner
     was ready. We went into our rooms, but we had nothing to do for
     half an hour exept to watch the rain drops as they fell upon the
     window panes. At last we were called to dinner, and I went down
     without papa as he never eats anything in the middle of the day. I
     sat at the table with the lady principal and enjoyed very much
     seeing all the young girls trooping into the dining-room. After
     dinner I went around the College with the young ladies and papa
     stayed in his room and smoked. When it was supper time papa went
     down and ate supper with us and we had a very delightful supper.
     After supper the young ladies went to their rooms to dress for the
     evening. Papa went to his room and I went with the lady principal.
     At length the guests began to arive, but papa still remained in his
     room until called for. Papa read in the chapell. It was the first
     time I had ever heard him read in my life--that is in public. When
     he came out on to the stage I remember the people behind me
     exclaimed "Oh how queer he is! Isn't he funny!" I thought papa was
     very funny, although I did not think him queer. He read "A Trying
     Situation" and "The Golden Arm," a ghost story that he heard down
     South when he was a little boy. "The Golden Arm" papa had told me
     before, but he had startled me so that I did not much wish to hear
     it again. But I had resolved this time to be prepared and not to
     let myself be startled, but still papa did, and very very much; he
     startled the whole roomful of people and they jumped as one man.
     The other story was also very funny and interesting and I enjoyed
     the evening inexpressibly much. After papa had finished reading we
     all went down to the collation in the dining-room and after that
     there was dancing and singing. Then the guests went away and papa
     and I went to bed. The next morning we rose early, took an early
     train for Hartford and reached Hartford at 1/2 past 2 o'clock. We
     were very glad to get back.


How charitably she treats that ghastly experience! It is a dear and
lovely disposition, and a most valuable one, that can brush away
indignities and discourtesies and seek and find the pleasanter features
of an experience. Susy had that disposition, and it was one of the
jewels of her character that had come to her straight from her mother.
It is a feature that was left out of me at birth. And, at seventy, I
have not yet acquired it. I did not go to Vassar College professionally,
but as a guest--as a guest, and gratis. Aunt Clara (now Mrs. John B.
Stanchfield) was a graduate of Vassar and it was to please her that I
inflicted that journey upon Susy and myself. The invitation had come to
me from both the lady mentioned by Susy and the President of the
College--a sour old saint who has probably been gathered to his fathers
long ago; and I hope they enjoy him; I hope they value his society. I
think I can get along without it, in either end of the next world.

We arrived at the College in that soaking rain, and Susy has described,
with just a suggestion of dissatisfaction, the sort of reception we got.
Susy had to sit in her damp clothes half an hour while we waited in the
parlor; then she was taken to a fireless room and left to wait there
again, as she has stated. I do not remember that President's name, and I
am sorry. He did not put in an appearance until it was time for me to
step upon the platform in front of that great garden of young and lovely
blossoms. He caught up with me and advanced upon the platform with me
and was going to introduce me. I said in substance:

"You have allowed me to get along without your help thus far, and if you
will retire from the platform I will try to do the rest without it."

I did not see him any more, but I detest his memory. Of course my
resentment did not extend to the students, and so I had an unforgettable
good time talking to them. And I think they had a good time too, for
they responded "as one man," to use Susy's unimprovable phrase.

Girls are charming creatures. I shall have to be twice seventy years old
before I change my mind as to that. I am to talk to a crowd of them this
afternoon, students of Barnard College (the sex's annex to Columbia
University), and I think I shall have as pleasant a time with those
lasses as I had with the Vassar girls twenty-one years ago.

_From Susy's Biography._


     I stopped in the middle of mamma's early history to tell about our
     tripp to Vassar because I was afraid I would forget about it, now I
     will go on where I left off. Some time after Miss Emma Nigh died
     papa took mamma and little Langdon to Elmira for the summer. When
     in Elmira Langdon began to fail but I think mamma did not know just
     what was the matter with him.


I was the cause of the child's illness. His mother trusted him to my
care and I took him a long drive in an open barouche for an airing. It
was a raw, cold morning, but he was well wrapped about with furs and, in
the hands of a careful person, no harm would have come to him. But I
soon dropped into a reverie and forgot all about my charge. The furs
fell away and exposed his bare legs. By and by the coachman noticed
this, and I arranged the wraps again, but it was too late. The child was
almost frozen. I hurried home with him. I was aghast at what I had done,
and I feared the consequences. I have always felt shame for that
treacherous morning's work and have not allowed myself to think of it
when I could help it. I doubt if I had the courage to make confession at
that time. I think it most likely that I have never confessed until now.

_From Susy's Biography._


     At last it was time for papa to return to Hartford, and Langdon was
     real sick at that time, but still mamma decided to go with him,
     thinking the journey might do him good. But after they reached
     Hartford he became very sick, and his trouble prooved to be
     diptheeria. He died about a week after mamma and papa reached
     Hartford. He was burried by the side of grandpa at Elmira, New
     York. [Susy rests there with them.--S. L. C.] After that, mamma
     became very very ill, so ill that there seemed great danger of
     death, but with a great deal of good care she recovered. Some
     months afterward mamma and papa [and Susy, who was perhaps fourteen
     or fifteen months old at the time.--S. L. C.] went to Europe and
     stayed for a time in Scotland and England. In Scotland mamma and
     papa became very well equanted with Dr. John Brown, the author of
     "Rab and His Friends," and he mett, but was not so well equanted
     with, Mr. Charles Kingsley, Mr. Henry M. Stanley, Sir Thomas Hardy
     grandson of the Captain Hardy to whom Nellson said "Kiss me Hardy,"
     when dying on shipboard, Mr. Henry Irving, Robert Browning, Sir
     Charles Dilke, Mr. Charles Reade, Mr. William Black, Lord Houghton,
     Frank Buckland, Mr. Tom Hughes, Anthony Trollope, Tom Hood, son of
     the poet--and mamma and papa were quite well equanted with Dr.
     Macdonald and family, and papa met Harrison Ainsworth.


I remember all these men very well indeed, except the last one. I do not
recall Ainsworth. By my count, Susy mentions fourteen men. They are all
dead except Sir Charles Dilke.

We met a great many other interesting people, among them Lewis Carroll,
author of the immortal "Alice"--but he was only interesting to look at,
for he was the stillest and shyest full-grown man I have ever met except
"Uncle Remus." Dr. Macdonald and several other lively talkers were
present, and the talk went briskly on for a couple of hours, but Carroll
sat still all the while except that now and then he answered a question.
His answers were brief. I do not remember that he elaborated any of
them.

At a dinner at Smalley's we met Herbert Spencer. At a large luncheon
party at Lord Houghton's we met Sir Arthur Helps, who was a celebrity of
world-wide fame at the time, but is quite forgotten now. Lord Elcho, a
large vigorous man, sat at some distance down the table. He was talking
earnestly about Godalming. It was a deep and flowing and unarticulated
rumble, but I got the Godalming pretty clearly every time it broke free
of the rumble, and as all the strength was on the first end of the word
it startled me every time, because it sounded so like swearing. In the
middle of the luncheon Lady Houghton rose, remarked to the guests on her
right and on her left in a matter-of-fact way, "Excuse me, I have an
engagement," and without further ceremony she went off to meet it. This
would have been doubtful etiquette in America. Lord Houghton told a
number of delightful stories. He told them in French, and I lost nothing
of them but the nubs.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--VII.

BY MARK TWAIN.


I was always heedless. I was born heedless; and therefore I was
constantly, and quite unconsciously, committing breaches of the minor
proprieties, which brought upon me humiliations which ought to have
humiliated me but didn't, because I didn't know anything had happened.
But Livy knew; and so the humiliations fell to her share, poor child,
who had not earned them and did not deserve them. She always said I was
the most difficult child she had. She was very sensitive about me. It
distressed her to see me do heedless things which could bring me under
criticism, and so she was always watchful and alert to protect me from
the kind of transgressions which I have been speaking of.

When I was leaving Hartford for Washington, upon the occasion referred
to, she said: "I have written a small warning and put it in a pocket of
your dress-vest. When you are dressing to go to the Authors' Reception
at the White House you will naturally put your fingers in your vest
pockets, according to your custom, and you will find that little note
there. Read it carefully, and do as it tells you. I cannot be with you,
and so I delegate my sentry duties to this little note. If I should give
you the warning by word of mouth, now, it would pass from your head and
be forgotten in a few minutes."

It was President Cleveland's first term. I had never seen his wife--the
young, the beautiful, the good-hearted, the sympathetic, the
fascinating. Sure enough, just as I had finished dressing to go to the
White House I found that little note, which I had long ago forgotten. It
was a grave little note, a serious little note, like its writer, but it
made me laugh. Livy's gentle gravities often produced that effect upon
me, where the expert humorist's best joke would have failed, for I do
not laugh easily.

When we reached the White House and I was shaking hands with the
President, he started to say something, but I interrupted him and said:

"If your Excellency will excuse me, I will come back in a moment; but
now I have a very important matter to attend to, and it must be attended
to at once."

I turned to Mrs. Cleveland, the young, the beautiful, the fascinating,
and gave her my card, on the back of which I had written "_He
didn't_"--and I asked her to sign her name below those words.

She said: "He didn't? He didn't what?"

"Oh," I said, "never mind. We cannot stop to discuss that now. This is
urgent. Won't you please sign your name?" (I handed her a fountain-pen.)

"Why," she said, "I cannot commit myself in that way. Who is it that
didn't?--and what is it that he didn't?"

"Oh," I said, "time is flying, flying, flying. Won't you take me out of
my distress and sign your name to it? It's all right. I give you my word
it's all right."

She looked nonplussed; but hesitatingly and mechanically she took the
pen and said:

"I will sign it. I will take the risk. But you must tell me all about
it, right afterward, so that you can be arrested before you get out of
the house in case there should be anything criminal about this."

Then she signed; and I handed her Mrs. Clements's note, which was very
brief, very simple, and to the point. It said: "_Don't wear your arctics
in the White House._" It made her shout; and at my request she summoned
a messenger and we sent that card at once to the mail on its way to Mrs.
Clemens in Hartford.

When the little Ruth was about a year or a year and a half old, Mason,
an old and valued friend of mine, was consul-general at
Frankfort-on-the-Main. I had known him well in 1867, '68 and '69, in
America, and I and mine had spent a good deal of time with him and his
family in Frankfort in '78. He was a thoroughly competent, diligent, and
conscientious official. Indeed he possessed these qualities in so large
a degree that among American consuls he might fairly be said to be
monumental, for at that time our consular service was largely--and I
think I may say mainly--in the hands of ignorant, vulgar, and incapable
men who had been political heelers in America, and had been taken care
of by transference to consulates where they could be supported at the
Government's expense instead of being transferred to the poor house,
which would have been cheaper and more patriotic. Mason, in '78, had
been consul-general in Frankfort several years--four, I think. He had
come from Marseilles with a great record. He had been consul there
during thirteen years, and one part of his record was heroic. There had
been a desolating cholera epidemic, and Mason was the only
representative of any foreign country who stayed at his post and saw it
through. And during that time he not only represented his own country,
but he represented all the other countries in Christendom and did their
work, and did it well and was praised for it by them in words of no
uncertain sound. This great record of Mason's had saved him from
official decapitation straight along while Republican Presidents
occupied the chair, but now it was occupied by a Democrat. Mr. Cleveland
was not seated in it--he was not yet inaugurated--before he was deluged
with applications from Democratic politicians desiring the appointment
of a thousand or so politically useful Democrats to Mason's place. A
year or two later Mason wrote me and asked me if I couldn't do something
to save him from destruction.

I was very anxious to keep him in his place, but at first I could not
think of any way to help him, for I was a mugwump. We, the mugwumps, a
little company made up of the unenslaved of both parties, the very best
men to be found in the two great parties--that was our idea of it--voted
sixty thousand strong for Mr. Cleveland in New York and elected him. Our
principles were high, and very definite. We were not a party; we had no
candidates; we had no axes to grind. Our vote laid upon the man we cast
it for no obligation of any kind. By our rule we could not ask for
office; we could not accept office. When voting, it was our duty to vote
for the best man, regardless of his party name. We had no other creed.
Vote for the best man--that was creed enough.

Such being my situation, I was puzzled to know how to try to help Mason,
and, at the same time, save my mugwump purity undefiled. It was a
delicate place. But presently, out of the ruck of confusions in my mind,
rose a sane thought, clear and bright--to wit: since it was a mugwump's
duty to do his best to put the beet man in office, necessarily it must
be a mugwump's duty to try to _keep_ the best man in when he was already
there. My course was easy now. It might not be quite delicate for a
mugwump to approach the President directly, but I could approach him
indirectly, with all delicacy, since in that case not even courtesy
would require him to take notice of an application which no one could
prove had ever reached him.

Yes, it was easy and simple sailing now. I could lay the matter before
Ruth, in her cradle, and wait for results. I wrote the little child, and
said to her all that I have just been saying about mugwump principles
and the limitations which they put upon me. I explained that it would
not be proper for me to apply to her father in Mr. Mason's behalf, but I
detailed to her Mr. Mason's high and honorable record and suggested that
she take the matter in her own hands and do a patriotic work which I
felt some delicacy about venturing upon myself. I asked her to forget
that her father was only President of the United States, and her subject
and servant; I asked her not to put her application in the form of a
command, but to modify it, and give it the fictitious and pleasanter
form of a mere request--that it would be no harm to let him gratify
himself with the superstition that he was independent and could do as he
pleased in the matter. I begged her to put stress, and plenty of it,
upon the proposition that to keep Mason in his place would be a
benefaction to the nation; to enlarge upon that, and keep still about
all other considerations.

In due time I received a letter from the President, written with his own
hand, signed by his own hand, acknowledging Ruth's intervention and
thanking me for enabling him to save to the country the services of so
good and well-tried a servant as Mason, and thanking me, also, for the
detailed fulness of Mason's record, which could leave no doubt in any
one's mind that Mason was in his right place and ought to be kept there.
Mason has remained in the service ever since, and is now consul-general
at Paris.

During the time that we were living in Buffalo in '70-'71, Mr. Cleveland
was sheriff, but I never happened to make his acquaintance, or even see
him. In fact, I suppose I was not even aware of his existence. Fourteen
years later, he was become the greatest man in the State. I was not
living in the State at the time. He was Governor, and was about to step
into the post of President of the United States. At that time I was on
the public highway in company with another bandit, George W. Cable. We
were robbing the public with readings from our works during four
months--and in the course of time we went to Albany to levy tribute, and
I said, "We ought to go and pay our respects to the Governor."

So Cable and I went to that majestic Capitol building and stated our
errand. We were shown into the Governor's private office, and I saw Mr.
Cleveland for the first time. We three stood chatting together. I was
born lazy, and I comforted myself by turning the corner of a table into
a sort of seat. Presently the Governor said:

"Mr. Clemens, I was a fellow citizen of yours in Buffalo a good many
months, a good while ago, and during those months you burst suddenly
into a mighty fame, out of a previous long-continued and no doubt proper
obscurity--but I was a nobody, and you wouldn't notice me nor have
anything to do with me. But now that I have become somebody, you have
changed your style, and you come here to shake hands with me and be
sociable. How do you explain this kind of conduct?"

"Oh," I said, "it is very simple, your Excellency. In Buffalo you were
nothing but a sheriff. I was in society. I couldn't afford to associate
with sheriffs. But you are a Governor now, and you are on your way to
the Presidency. It is a great difference, and it makes you worth while."

There appeared to be about sixteen doors to that spacious room. From
each door a young man now emerged, and the sixteen lined up and moved
forward and stood in front of the Governor with an aspect of respectful
expectancy in their attitude. No one spoke for a moment. Then the
Governor said:

"You are dismissed, gentlemen. Your services are not required. Mr.
Clemens is sitting on the bells."

There was a cluster of sixteen bell buttons on the corner of the table;
my proportions at that end of me were just right to enable me to cover
the whole of that nest, and that is how I came to hatch out those
sixteen clerks.

In accordance with the suggestion made in Gilder's letter recently
received I have written the following note to ex-President Cleveland
upon his sixty-ninth birthday:


     HONORED SIR:--

     Your patriotic virtues have won for you the homage of half the
     nation and the enmity of the other half. This places your character
     as a citizen upon a summit as high as Washington's. The verdict is
     unanimous and unassailable. The votes of both sides are necessary
     in cases like these, and the votes of the one side are quite as
     valuable as are the votes of the other. Where the votes are all in
     a man's favor the verdict is against him. It is sand, and history
     will wash it away. But the verdict for you is rock, and will stand.

                                                       S. L. CLEMENS.

        As of date March 18, 1906....


In a diary which Mrs. Clemens kept for a little while, a great many
years ago, I find various mentions of Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, who
was a near neighbor of ours in Hartford, with no fences between. And in
those days she made as much use of our grounds as of her own, in
pleasant weather. Her mind had decayed, and she was a pathetic figure.
She wandered about all the day long in the care of a muscular
Irishwoman. Among the colonists of our neighborhood the doors always
stood open in pleasant weather. Mrs. Stowe entered them at her own free
will, and as she was always softly slippered and generally full of
animal spirits, she was able to deal in surprises, and she liked to do
it. She would slip up behind a person who was deep in dreams and
musings and fetch a war-whoop that would jump that person out of his
clothes. And she had other moods. Sometimes we would hear gentle music
in the drawing-room and would find her there at the piano singing
ancient and melancholy songs with infinitely touching effect.

Her husband, old Professor Stowe, was a picturesque figure. He wore a
broad slouch hat. He was a large man, and solemn. His beard was white
and thick and hung far down on his breast. The first time our little
Susy ever saw him she encountered him on the street near our house and
came flying wide-eyed to her mother and said, "Santa Claus has got
loose!"

Which reminds me of Rev. Charley Stowe's little boy--a little boy of
seven years. I met Rev. Charley crossing his mother's grounds one
morning and he told me this little tale. He had been out to Chicago to
attend a Convention of Congregational clergymen, and had taken his
little boy with him. During the trip he reminded the little chap, every
now and then, that he must be on his very best behavior there in
Chicago. He said: "We shall be the guests of a clergyman, there will be
other guests--clergymen and their wives--and you must be careful to let
those people see by your walk and conversation that you are of a godly
household. Be very careful about this." The admonition bore fruit. At
the first breakfast which they ate in the Chicago clergyman's house he
heard his little son say in the meekest and most reverent way to the
lady opposite him,

"Please, won't you, for Christ's sake, pass the butter?"

                                                     MARK TWAIN.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--VIII.

BY MARK TWAIN.


[Sidenote: (1864.)]

[_Dictated in 1906._] In those early days duelling suddenly became a
fashion in the new Territory of Nevada, and by 1864 everybody was
anxious to have a chance in the new sport, mainly for the reason that he
was not able to thoroughly respect himself so long as he had not killed
or crippled somebody in a duel or been killed or crippled in one
himself.

At that time I had been serving as city editor on Mr. Goodman's Virginia
City "Enterprise" for a matter of two years. I was twenty-nine years
old. I was ambitious in several ways, but I had entirely escaped the
seductions of that particular craze. I had had no desire to fight a
duel; I had no intention of provoking one. I did not feel respectable,
but I got a certain amount of satisfaction out of feeling safe. I was
ashamed of myself; the rest of the staff were ashamed of me--but I got
along well enough. I had always been accustomed to feeling ashamed of
myself, for one thing or another, so there was no novelty for me in the
situation. I bore it very well. Plunkett was on the staff; R. M. Daggett
was on the staff. These had tried to get into duels, but for the present
had failed, and were waiting. Goodman was the only one of us who had
done anything to shed credit upon the paper. The rival paper was the
Virginia "Union." Its editor for a little while was Tom Fitch, called
the "silver-tongued orator of Wisconsin"--that was where he came from.
He tuned up his oratory in the editorial columns of the "Union," and Mr.
Goodman invited him out and modified him with a bullet. I remember the
joy of the staff when Goodman's challenge was accepted by Fitch. We ran
late that night, and made much of Joe Goodman. He was only twenty-four
years old; he lacked the wisdom which a person has at twenty-nine, and
he was as glad of being _it_ as I was that I wasn't. He chose Major
Graves for his second (that name is not right, but it's close enough; I
don't remember the Major's name). Graves came over to instruct Joe in
the duelling art. He had been a Major under Walker, the "gray-eyed man
of destiny," and had fought all through that remarkable man's
filibustering campaign in Central America. That fact gauges the Major.
To say that a man was a Major under Walker, and came out of that
struggle ennobled by Walker's praise, is to say that the Major was not
merely a brave man but that he was brave to the very utmost limit of
that word. All of Walker's men were like that. I knew the Gillis family
intimately. The father made the campaign under Walker, and with him one
son. They were in the memorable Plaza fight, and stood it out to the
last against overwhelming odds, as did also all of the Walker men. The
son was killed at the father's side. The father received a bullet
through the eye. The old man--for he was an old man at the time--wore
spectacles, and the bullet and one of the glasses went into his skull
and remained there. There were some other sons: Steve, George, and Jim,
very young chaps--the merest lads--who wanted to be in the Walker
expedition, for they had their father's dauntless spirit. But Walker
wouldn't have them; he said it was a serious expedition, and no place
for children.

The Major was a majestic creature, with a most stately and dignified and
impressive military bearing, and he was by nature and training
courteous, polite, graceful, winning; and he had that quality which I
think I have encountered in only one other man--Bob Howland--a
mysterious quality which resides in the eye; and when that eye is turned
upon an individual or a squad, in warning, that is enough. The man that
has that eye doesn't need to go armed; he can move upon an armed
desperado and quell him and take him prisoner without saying a single
word. I saw Bob Howland do that, once--a slender, good-natured, amiable,
gentle, kindly little skeleton of a man, with a sweet blue eye that
would win your heart when it smiled upon you, or turn cold and freeze
it, according to the nature of the occasion.

The Major stood Joe up straight; stood Steve Gillis up fifteen paces
away; made Joe turn right side towards Steve, cock his navy
six-shooter--that prodigious weapon--and hold it straight down against
his leg; told him that _that_ was the correct position for the gun--that
the position ordinarily in use at Virginia City (that is to say, the gun
straight up in the air, then brought slowly down to your man) was all
wrong. At the word "_One_," you must raise the gun slowly and steadily
to the place on the other man's body that you desire to convince. Then,
after a pause, "_two, three--fire--Stop!_" At the word "stop," you may
fire--but not earlier. You may give yourself as much time as you please
_after_ that word. Then, when you fire, you may advance and go on firing
at your leisure and pleasure, if you can get any pleasure out of it.
And, in the meantime, the other man, if he has been properly instructed
and is alive to his privileges, is advancing on _you_, and firing--and
it is always likely that more or less trouble will result.

Naturally, when Joe's revolver had risen to a level it was pointing at
Steve's breast, but the Major said "No, that is not wise. Take all the
risks of getting murdered yourself, but don't run any risk of murdering
the other man. If you survive a duel you want to survive it in such a
way that the memory of it will not linger along with you through the
rest of your life and interfere with your sleep. Aim at your man's leg;
not at the knee, not above the knee; for those are dangerous spots. Aim
below the knee; cripple him, but leave the rest of him to his mother."

By grace of these truly wise and excellent instructions, Joe tumbled
Fitch down next morning with a bullet through his lower leg, which
furnished him a permanent limp. And Joe lost nothing but a lock of hair,
which he could spare better then than he could now. For when I saw him
here in New York a year ago, his crop was gone: he had nothing much left
but a fringe, with a dome rising above.

[Sidenote: (1864.)]

About a year later I got _my_ chance. But I was not hunting for it.
Goodman went off to San Francisco for a week's holiday, and left me to
be chief editor. I had supposed that that was an easy berth, there being
nothing to do but write one editorial per day; but I was disappointed in
that superstition. I couldn't find anything to write an article about,
the first day. Then it occurred to me that inasmuch as it was the 22nd
of April, 1864, the next morning would be the three-hundredth
anniversary of Shakespeare's birthday--and what better theme could I
want than that? I got the Cyclopædia and examined it, and found out who
Shakespeare was and what he had done, and I borrowed all that and laid
it before a community that couldn't have been better prepared for
instruction about Shakespeare than if they had been prepared by art.
There wasn't enough of what Shakespeare had done to make an editorial of
the necessary length, but I filled it out with what he hadn't
done--which in many respects was more important and striking and
readable than the handsomest things he had really accomplished. But next
day I was in trouble again. There were no more Shakespeares to work up.
There was nothing in past history, or in the world's future
possibilities, to make an editorial out of, suitable to that community;
so there was but one theme left. That theme was Mr. Laird, proprietor of
the Virginia "Union." _His_ editor had gone off to San Francisco too,
and Laird was trying his hand at editing. I woke up Mr. Laird with some
courtesies of the kind that were fashionable among newspaper editors in
that region, and he came back at me the next day in a most vitriolic
way. He was hurt by something I had said about him--some little thing--I
don't remember what it was now--probably called him a horse-thief, or
one of those little phrases customarily used to describe another
editor. They were no doubt just, and accurate, but Laird was a very
sensitive creature, and he didn't like it. So we expected a challenge
from Mr. Laird, because according to the rules--according to the
etiquette of duelling as reconstructed and reorganized and improved by
the duellists of that region--whenever you said a thing about another
person that he didn't like, it wasn't sufficient for him to talk back in
the same offensive spirit: etiquette required him to send a challenge;
so we waited for a challenge--waited all day. It didn't come. And as the
day wore along, hour after hour, and no challenge came, the boys grew
depressed. They lost heart. But I was cheerful; I felt better and better
all the time. They couldn't understand it, but _I_ could understand it.
It was my _make_ that enabled me to be cheerful when other people were
despondent. So then it became necessary for us to waive etiquette and
challenge Mr. Laird. When we reached that decision, they began to cheer
up, but I began to lose some of my animation. However, in enterprises of
this kind you are in the hands of your friends; there is nothing for you
to do but to abide by what they consider to be the best course. Daggett
wrote a challenge for me, for Daggett had the language--the right
language--the convincing language--and I lacked it. Daggett poured out a
stream of unsavory epithets upon Mr. Laird, charged with a vigor and
venom of a strength calculated to persuade him; and Steve Gillis, my
second, carried the challenge and came back to wait for the return. It
didn't come. The boys were exasperated, but I kept my temper. Steve
carried another challenge, hotter than the other, and we waited again.
Nothing came of it. I began to feel quite comfortable. I began to take
an interest in the challenges myself. I had not felt any before; but it
seemed to me that I was accumulating a great and valuable reputation at
no expense, and my delight in this grew and grew, as challenge after
challenge was declined, until by midnight I was beginning to think that
there was nothing in the world so much to be desired as a chance to
fight a duel. So I hurried Daggett up; made him keep on sending
challenge after challenge. Oh, well, I overdid it; Laird accepted. I
might have known that that would happen--Laird was a man you couldn't
depend on.

The boys were jubilant beyond expression. They helped me make my will,
which was another discomfort--and I already had enough. Then they took
me home. I didn't sleep any--didn't want to sleep. I had plenty of
things to think about, and less than four hours to do it in,--because
five o'clock was the hour appointed for the tragedy, and I should have
to use up one hour--beginning at four--in practising with the revolver
and finding out which end of it to level at the adversary. At four we
went down into a little gorge, about a mile from town, and borrowed a
barn door for a mark--borrowed it of a man who was over in California on
a visit--and we set the barn door up and stood a fence-rail up against
the middle of it, to represent Mr. Laird. But the rail was no proper
representative of him, for he was longer than a rail and thinner.
Nothing would ever fetch him but a line shot, and then as like as not he
would split the bullet--the worst material for duelling purposes that
could be imagined. I began on the rail. I couldn't hit the rail; then I
tried the barn door; but I couldn't hit the barn door. There was nobody
in danger except stragglers around on the flanks of that mark. I was
thoroughly discouraged, and I didn't cheer up any when we presently
heard pistol-shots over in the next little ravine. I knew what that
was--that was Laird's gang out practising him. They would hear my shots,
and of course they would come up over the ridge to see what kind of a
record I was making--see what their chances were against me. Well, I
hadn't any record; and I knew that if Laird came over that ridge and saw
my barn door without a scratch on it, he would be as anxious to fight as
I was--or as I had been at midnight, before that disastrous acceptance
came.

Now just at this moment, a little bird, no bigger than a sparrow, flew
along by and lit on a sage-bush about thirty yards away. Steve whipped
out his revolver and shot its head off. Oh, he was a marksman--much
better than I was. We ran down there to pick up the bird, and just then,
sure enough, Mr. Laird and his people came over the ridge, and they
joined us. And when Laird's second saw that bird, with its head shot
off, he lost color, he faded, and you could see that he was interested.
He said:

"Who did that?"

Before I could answer, Steve spoke up and said quite calmly, and in a
matter-of-fact way,

"Clemens did it."

The second said, "Why, that is wonderful. How far off was that bird?"

Steve said, "Oh, not far--about thirty yards."

The second said, "Well, that is astonishing shooting. How often can he
do that?"

Steve said languidly, "Oh, about four times out of five."

I knew the little rascal was lying, but I didn't say anything. The
second said, "Why, that is _amazing_ shooting; I supposed he couldn't
hit a church."

He was supposing very sagaciously, but I didn't say anything. Well, they
said good morning. The second took Mr. Laird home, a little tottery on
his legs, and Laird sent back a note in his own hand declining to fight
a duel with me on any terms whatever.

Well, my life was saved--saved by that accident. I don't know what the
bird thought about that interposition of Providence, but I felt very,
very comfortable over it--satisfied and content. Now, we found out,
later, that Laird had _hit_ his mark four times out of six, right along.
If the duel had come off, he would have so filled my skin with
bullet-holes that it wouldn't have held my principles.

By breakfast-time the news was all over town that I had sent a challenge
and Steve Gillis had carried it. Now that would entitle us to two years
apiece in the penitentiary, according to the brand-new law. Judge North
sent us no message as coming from himself, but a message _came_ from a
close friend of his. He said it would be a good idea for us to leave the
territory by the first stage-coach. This would sail next morning, at
four o'clock--and in the meantime we would be searched for, but not with
avidity; and if we were in the Territory after that stage-coach left, we
would be the first victims of the new law. Judge North was anxious to
have some object-lessons for that law, and he would absolutely keep us
in the prison the full two years.

Well, it seemed to me that our society was no longer desirable in
Nevada; so we stayed in our quarters and observed proper caution all
day--except that once Steve went over to the hotel to attend to another
customer of mine. That was a Mr. Cutler. You see Laird was not the only
person whom I had tried to reform during my occupancy of the editorial
chair. I had looked around and selected several other people, and
delivered a new zest of life into them through warm criticism and
disapproval--so that when I laid down my editorial pen I had four
horse-whippings and two duels owing to me. We didn't care for the
horse-whippings; there was no glory in them; they were not worth the
trouble of collecting. But honor required that some notice should be
taken of that other duel. Mr. Cutler had come up from Carson City, and
had sent a man over with a challenge from the hotel. Steve went over to
pacify him. Steve weighed only ninety-five pounds, but it was well known
throughout the territory that with his fists he could whip anybody that
walked on two legs, let his weight and science be what they might. Steve
was a Gillis, and when a Gillis confronted a man and had a proposition
to make, the proposition always contained business. When Cutler found
that Steve was my second he cooled down; he became calm and rational,
and was ready to listen. Steve gave him fifteen minutes to get out of
the hotel, and half an hour to get out of town or there would be
results. So _that_ duel went off successfully, because Mr. Cutler
immediately left for Carson a convinced and reformed man.

I have never had anything to do with duels since. I thoroughly
disapprove of duels. I consider them unwise, and I know they are
dangerous. Also, sinful. If a man should challenge me now, I would go to
that man and take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him to
a quiet retired spot, and _kill_ him.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--IX.

BY MARK TWAIN.


[_Dictated December 13, 1906._] As regards the coming American monarchy.
It was before the Secretary of State had been heard from that the
chairman of the banquet said:

"In this time of unrest it is of great satisfaction that such a man as
you, Mr. Root, is chief adviser of the President."

Mr. Root then got up and in the most quiet and orderly manner touched
off the successor to the San Francisco earthquake. As a result, the
several State governments were well shaken up and considerably weakened.
Mr. Root was prophesying. He was prophesying, and it seems to me that no
shrewder and surer forecasting has been done in this country for a good
many years.

He did not say, in so many words, that we are proceeding, in a steady
march, toward eventual and unavoidable replacement of the republic by
monarchy; but I suppose he was aware that that is the case. He notes the
several steps, the customary steps, which in all the ages have led to
the consolidation of loose and scattered governmental forces into
formidable centralizations of authority; but he stops there, and doesn't
add up the sum. He is not unaware that heretofore the sum has been
ultimate monarchy, and that the same figures can fairly be depended upon
to furnish the same sum whenever and wherever they can be produced, so
long as human nature shall remain as it is; but it was not needful that
he do the adding, since any one can do it; neither would it have been
gracious in him to do it.

In observing the changed conditions which in the course of time have
made certain and sure the eventual seizure by the Washington government
of a number of State duties and prerogatives which have been betrayed
and neglected by the several States, he does not attribute those changes
and the vast results which are to flow from them to any thought-out
policy of any party or of any body of dreamers or schemers, but properly
and rightly attributes them to that stupendous power--_Circumstance_--
which moves by laws of its own, regardless of parties and policies, and
whose decrees are final, and must be obeyed by all--and will be. The
railway is a Circumstance, the steamship is a Circumstance, the
telegraph is a Circumstance. They were mere happenings; and to the whole
world, the wise and the foolish alike, they were entirely trivial,
wholly inconsequential; indeed silly, comical, grotesque. No man, and no
party, and no thought-out policy said, "Behold, we will build railways
and steamships and telegraphs, and presently you will see the condition
and way of life of every man and woman and child in the nation totally
changed; unimaginable changes of law and custom will follow, in spite of
anything that anybody can do to prevent it."

The changed conditions have come, and Circumstance knows what is
following, and will follow. So does Mr. Root. His language is not
unclear, it is crystal:


     "Our whole life has swung away from the old State centres, and is
     crystallizing about national centres."

     " ... The old barriers which kept the States as separate
     communities are completely lost from sight."

     " ... That [State] power of regulation and control is gradually
     passing into the hands of the national government."

     "Sometimes by an assertion of the inter-State commerce power,
     sometimes by an assertion of the taxing power, the national
     government is taking up the performance of duties which under the
     changed conditions the separate States are no longer capable of
     adequately performing."

     "We are urging forward in a development of business and social life
     which tends more and more to the obliteration of State lines and
     the decrease of State power as compared with national power."

     "It is useless for the advocates of State rights to inveigh against
     ... the extension of national authority in the fields of necessary
     control where the States themselves fail in the performance of
     their duty."


He is not announcing a policy; he is not forecasting what a party of
planners will bring about; he is merely telling what the people will
require and compel. And he could have added--which would be perfectly
true--that the people will not be moved to it by speculation and
cogitation and planning, but by _Circumstance_--that power which
arbitrarily compels all their actions, and over which they have not the
slightest control.

_"The end is not yet."_

It is a true word. We are on the march, but at present we are only just
getting started.

If the States continue to fail to do their duty as required by the
people--

" ... _constructions of the Constitution will be found_ to vest the
power where it will be exercised--in the national government."

I do not know whether that has a sinister meaning or not, and so I will
not enlarge upon it lest I should chance to be in the wrong. It sounds
like ship-money come again, but it may not be so intended.


Human nature being what it is, I suppose we must expect to drift into
monarchy by and by. It is a saddening thought, but we cannot change our
nature: we are all alike, we human beings; and in our blood and bone,
and ineradicable, we carry the seeds out of which monarchies and
aristocracies are grown: worship of gauds, titles, distinctions, power.
We have to worship these things and their possessors, we are all born
so, and we cannot help it. We have to be despised by somebody whom we
regard as above us, or we are not happy; we have to have somebody to
worship and envy, or we cannot be content. In America we manifest this
in all the ancient and customary ways. In public we scoff at titles and
hereditary privilege, but privately we hanker after them, and when we
get a chance we buy them for cash and a daughter. Sometimes we get a
good man and worth the price, but we are ready to take him anyway,
whether he be ripe or rotten, whether he be clean and decent, or merely
a basket of noble and sacred and long-descended offal. And when we get
him the whole nation publicly chaffs and scoffs--and privately envies;
and also is proud of the honor which has been conferred upon us. We run
over our list of titled purchases every now and then, in the newspapers,
and discuss them and caress them, and are thankful and happy.

Like all the other nations, we worship money and the possessors of
it--they being our aristocracy, and we have to have one. We like to read
about rich people in the papers; the papers know it, and they do their
best to keep this appetite liberally fed. They even leave out a football
bull-fight now and then to get room for all the particulars of
how--according to the display heading--"Rich Woman Fell Down Cellar--Not
Hurt." The falling down the cellar is of no interest to us when the
woman is not rich, but no rich woman can fall down cellar and we not
yearn to know all about it and wish it was us.

In a monarchy the people willingly and rejoicingly revere and take pride
in their nobilities, and are not humiliated by the reflection that this
humble and hearty homage gets no return but contempt. Contempt does not
shame them, they are used to it, and they recognize that it is their
proper due. We are all made like that. In Europe we easily and quickly
learn to take that attitude toward the sovereigns and the aristocracies;
moreover, it has been observed that when we get the attitude we go on
and exaggerate it, presently becoming more servile than the natives, and
vainer of it. The next step is to rail and scoff at republics and
democracies. All of which is natural, for we have not ceased to be human
beings by becoming Americans, and the human race was always intended to
be governed by kingship, not by popular vote.

I suppose we must expect that unavoidable and irresistible Circumstances
will gradually take away the powers of the States and concentrate them
in the central government, and that the republic will then repeat the
history of all time and become a monarchy; but I believe that if we
obstruct these encroachments and steadily resist them the monarchy can
be postponed for a good while yet.

[Sidenote: (1849-'51.)]

[_Dictated December 1, 1906._] An exciting event in our village
(Hannibal) was the arrival of the mesmerizer. I think the year was 1850.
As to that I am not sure, but I know the month--it was May; that detail
has survived the wear of fifty-five years. A pair of connected little
incidents of that month have served to keep the memory of it green for
me all this time; incidents of no consequence, and not worth embalming,
yet my memory has preserved them carefully and flung away things of real
value to give them space and make them comfortable. The truth is, a
person's memory has no more sense than his conscience, and no
appreciation whatever of values and proportions. However, never mind
those trifling incidents; my subject is the mesmerizer, now.

He advertised his show, and promised marvels. Admission as usual: 25
cents, children and negroes half price. The village had heard of
mesmerism, in a general way, but had not encountered it yet. Not many
people attended, the first night, but next day they had so many wonders
to tell that everybody's curiosity was fired, and after that for a
fortnight the magician had prosperous times. I was fourteen or fifteen
years old--the age at which a boy is willing to endure all things,
suffer all things, short of death by fire, if thereby he may be
conspicuous and show off before the public; and so, when I saw the
"subjects" perform their foolish antics on the platform and make the
people laugh and shout and admire, I had a burning desire to be a
subject myself. Every night, for three nights, I sat in the row of
candidates on the platform, and held the magic disk in the palm of my
hand, and gazed at it and tried to get sleepy, but it was a failure; I
remained wide awake, and had to retire defeated, like the majority.
Also, I had to sit there and be gnawed with envy of Hicks, our
journeyman; I had to sit there and see him scamper and jump when Simmons
the enchanter exclaimed, "See the snake! see the snake!" and hear him
say, "My, how beautiful!" in response to the suggestion that he was
observing a splendid sunset; and so on--the whole insane business. I
couldn't laugh, I couldn't applaud; it filled me with bitterness to have
others do it, and to have people make a hero of Hicks, and crowd around
him when the show was over, and ask him for more and more particulars of
the wonders he had seen in his visions, and manifest in many ways that
they were proud to be acquainted with him. Hicks--the idea! I couldn't
stand it; I was getting boiled to death in my own bile.

On the fourth night temptation came, and I was not strong enough to
resist. When I had gazed at the disk awhile I pretended to be sleepy,
and began to nod. Straightway came the professor and made passes over my
head and down my body and legs and arms, finishing each pass with a snap
of his fingers in the air, to discharge the surplus electricity; then he
began to "draw" me with the disk, holding it in his fingers and telling
me I could not take my eyes off it, try as I might; so I rose slowly,
bent and gazing, and followed that disk all over the place, just as I
had seen the others do. Then I was put through the other paces. Upon
suggestion I fled from snakes; passed buckets at a fire; became excited
over hot steamboat-races; made love to imaginary girls and kissed them;
fished from the platform and landed mud-cats that outweighed me--and so
on, all the customary marvels. But not in the customary way. I was
cautious at first, and watchful, being afraid the professor would
discover that I was an impostor and drive me from the platform in
disgrace; but as soon as I realized that I was not in danger, I set
myself the task of terminating Hicks's usefulness as a subject, and of
usurping his place.

It was a sufficiently easy task. Hicks was born honest; I, without that
incumbrance--so some people said. Hicks saw what he saw, and reported
accordingly; I saw more than was visible, and added to it such details
as could help. Hicks had no imagination, I had a double supply. He was
born calm, I was born excited. No vision could start a rapture in him,
and he was constipated as to language, anyway; but if I saw a vision I
emptied the dictionary onto it and lost the remnant of my mind into the
bargain.

At the end of my first half-hour Hicks was a thing of the past, a fallen
hero, a broken idol, and I knew it and was glad, and said in my heart,
Success to crime! Hicks could never have been mesmerized to the point
where he could kiss an imaginary girl in public, or a real one either,
but I was competent. Whatever Hicks had failed in, I made it a point to
succeed in, let the cost be what it might, physically or morally. He
had shown several bad defects, and I had made a note of them. For
instance, if the magician asked, "What do you see?" and left him to
invent a vision for himself, Hicks was dumb and blind, he couldn't see a
thing nor say a word, whereas the magician soon found that when it came
to seeing visions of a stunning and marketable sort I could get along
better without his help than with it. Then there was another thing:
Hicks wasn't worth a tallow dip on mute mental suggestion. Whenever
Simmons stood behind him and gazed at the back of his skull and tried to
drive a mental suggestion into it, Hicks sat with vacant face, and never
suspected. If he had been noticing, he could have seen by the rapt faces
of the audience that something was going on behind his back that
required a response. Inasmuch as I was an impostor I dreaded to have
this test put upon me, for I knew the professor would be "willing" me to
do something, and as I couldn't know what it was, I should be exposed
and denounced. However, when my time came, I took my chance. I perceived
by the tense and expectant faces of the people that Simmons was behind
me willing me with all his might. I tried my best to imagine what he
wanted, but nothing suggested itself. I felt ashamed and miserable,
then. I believed that the hour of my disgrace was come, and that in
another moment I should go out of that place disgraced. I ought to be
ashamed to confess it, but my next thought was, not how I could win the
compassion of kindly hearts by going out humbly and in sorrow for my
misdoings, but how I could go out most sensationally and spectacularly.

There was a rusty and empty old revolver lying on the table, among the
"properties" employed in the performances. On May-day, two or three
weeks before, there had been a celebration by the schools, and I had had
a quarrel with a big boy who was the school-bully, and I had not come
out of it with credit. That boy was now seated in the middle of the
house, half-way down the main aisle. I crept stealthily and impressively
toward the table, with a dark and murderous scowl on my face, copied
from a popular romance, seized the revolver suddenly, flourished it,
shouted the bully's name, jumped off the platform, and made a rush for
him and chased him out of the house before the paralyzed people could
interfere to save him. There was a storm of applause, and the magician,
addressing the house, said, most impressively--

"That you may know how really remarkable this is, and how wonderfully
developed a subject we have in this boy, I assure you that without a
single spoken word to guide him he has carried out what I mentally
commanded him to do, to the minutest detail. I could have stopped him at
a moment in his vengeful career by a mere exertion of my will, therefore
the poor fellow who has escaped was at no time in danger."

So I was not in disgrace. I returned to the platform a hero, and happier
than I have ever been in this world since. As regards mental suggestion,
my fears of it were gone. I judged that in case I failed to guess what
the professor might be willing me to do, I could count on putting up
something that would answer just as well. I was right, and exhibitions
of unspoken suggestion became a favorite with the public. Whenever I
perceived that I was being willed to do something I got up and did
something--anything that occurred to me--and the magician, not being a
fool, always ratified it. When people asked me, "How _can_ you tell what
he is willing you to do?" I said, "It's just as easy," and they always
said, admiringly, "Well it beats _me_ how you can do it."

Hicks was weak in another detail. When the professor made passes over
him and said "his whole body is without sensation now--come forward and
test him, ladies and gentlemen," the ladies and gentlemen always
complied eagerly, and stuck pins into Hicks, and if they went deep Hicks
was sure to wince, then that poor professor would have to explain that
Hicks "wasn't sufficiently under the influence." But I didn't wince; I
only suffered, and shed tears on the inside. The miseries that a
conceited boy will endure to keep up his "reputation"! And so will a
conceited man; I know it in my own person, and have seen it in a hundred
thousand others. That professor ought to have protected me, and I often
hoped he would, when the tests were unusually severe, but he didn't. It
may be that he was deceived as well as the others, though I did not
believe it nor think it possible. Those were dear good people, but they
must have carried simplicity and credulity to the limit. They would
stick a pin in my arm and bear on it until they drove it a third of its
length in, and then be lost in wonder that by a mere exercise of
will-power the professor could turn my arm to iron and make it
insensible to pain. Whereas it was not insensible at all; I was
suffering agonies of pain.

After that fourth night, that proud night, that triumphant night, I was
the only subject. Simmons invited no more candidates to the platform. I
performed alone, every night, the rest of the fortnight. In the
beginning of the second week I conquered the last doubters. Up to that
time a dozen wise old heads, the intellectual aristocracy of the town,
had held out, as implacable unbelievers. I was as hurt by this as if I
were engaged in some honest occupation. There is nothing surprising
about this. Human beings feel dishonor the most, sometimes, when they
most deserve it. That handful of overwise old gentlemen kept on shaking
their heads all the first week, and saying they had seen no marvels
there that could not have been produced by collusion; and they were
pretty vain of their unbelief, too, and liked to show it and air it, and
be superior to the ignorant and the gullible. Particularly old Dr.
Peake, who was the ringleader of the irreconcilables, and very
formidable; for he was an F.F.V., he was learned, white-haired and
venerable, nobly and richly clad in the fashions of an earlier and a
courtlier day, he was large and stately, and he not only seemed wise,
but was what he seemed, in that regard. He had great influence, and his
opinion upon any matter was worth much more than that of any other
person in the community. When I conquered him, at last, I knew I was
undisputed master of the field; and now, after more than fifty years, I
acknowledge, with a few dry old tears, that I rejoiced without shame.


[Sidenote: (1847.)]

[_Dictated December 2, 1906._] In 1847 we were living in a large white
house on the corner of Hill and Main Streets--a house that still stands,
but isn't large now, although it hasn't lost a plank; I saw it a year
ago and noticed that shrinkage. My father died in it in March of the
year mentioned, but our family did not move out of it until some months
afterward. Ours was not the only family in the house, there was
another--Dr. Grant's. One day Dr. Grant and Dr. Reyburn argued a matter
on the street with sword-canes, and Grant was brought home
multifariously punctured. Old Dr. Peake calked the leaks, and came every
day for a while, to look after him. The Grants were Virginians, like
Peake, and one day when Grant was getting well enough to be on his feet
and sit around in the parlor and talk, the conversation fell upon
Virginia and old times. I was present, but the group were probably quite
unconscious of me, I being only a lad and a negligible quantity. Two of
the group--Dr. Peake and Mrs. Crawford, Mrs. Grant's mother--had been of
the audience when the Richmond theatre burned down, thirty-six years
before, and they talked over the frightful details of that memorable
tragedy. These were eye-witnesses, and with their eyes I saw it all with
an intolerable vividness: I saw the black smoke rolling and tumbling
toward the sky, I saw the flames burst through it and turn red, I heard
the shrieks of the despairing, I glimpsed their faces at the windows,
caught fitfully through the veiling smoke, I saw them jump to their
death, or to mutilation worse than death. The picture is before me yet,
and can never fade.

In due course they talked of the colonial mansion of the Peakes, with
its stately columns and its spacious grounds, and by odds and ends I
picked up a clearly defined idea of the place. I was strongly
interested, for I had not before heard of such palatial things from the
lips of people who had seen them with their own eyes. One detail,
casually dropped, hit my imagination hard. In the wall, by the great
front door, there was a round hole as big as a saucer--a British
cannon-ball had made it, in the war of the Revolution. It was
breath-taking; it made history real; history had never been real to me
before.

Very well, three or four years later, as already mentioned, I was
king-bee and sole "subject" in the mesmeric show; it was the beginning
of the second week; the performance was half over; just then the
majestic Dr. Peake, with his ruffled bosom and wristbands and his
gold-headed cane, entered, and a deferential citizen vacated his seat
beside the Grants and made the great chief take it. This happened while
I was trying to invent something fresh in the way of a vision, in
response to the professor's remark--

"Concentrate your powers. Look--look attentively. There--don't you see
something? Concentrate--concentrate. Now then--describe it."

Without suspecting it, Dr. Peake, by entering the place, had reminded me
of the talk of three years before. He had also furnished me capital and
was become my confederate, an accomplice in my frauds. I began on a
vision, a vague and dim one (that was part of the game at the beginning
of a vision; it isn't best to see it too clearly at first, it might look
as if you had come loaded with it). The vision developed, by degrees,
and gathered swing, momentum, energy. It was the Richmond fire. Dr.
Peake was cold, at first, and his fine face had a trace of polite scorn
in it; but when he began to recognize that fire, that expression
changed, and his eyes began to light up. As soon as I saw that, I threw
the valves wide open and turned on all the steam, and gave those people
a supper of fire and horrors that was calculated to last them one while!
They couldn't gasp, when I got through--they were petrified. Dr. Peake
had risen, and was standing,--and breathing hard. He said, in a great
voice--

"My doubts are ended. No collusion could produce that miracle. It was
totally impossible for him to know those details, yet he has described
them with the clarity of an eye-witness--and with what unassailable
truthfulness God knows I know!"

I saved the colonial mansion for the last night, and solidified and
perpetuated Dr. Peake's conversion with the cannon-ball hole. He
explained to the house that I could never have heard of that small
detail, which differentiated this mansion from all other Virginian
mansions and perfectly identified it, therefore the fact stood proven
that I had _seen_ it in my vision. Lawks!

It is curious. When the magician's engagement closed there was but one
person in the village who did not believe in mesmerism, and I was the
one. All the others were converted, but I was to remain an implacable
and unpersuadable disbeliever in mesmerism and hypnotism for close upon
fifty years. This was because I never would examine them, in after life.
I couldn't. The subject revolted me. Perhaps because it brought back to
me a passage in my life which for pride's sake I wished to forget;
though I thought--or persuaded myself I thought--I should never come
across a "proof" which wasn't thin and cheap, and probably had a fraud
like me behind it.

The truth is, I did not have to wait long to get tired of my triumphs.
Not thirty days, I think. The glory which is built upon a lie soon
becomes a most unpleasant incumbrance. No doubt for a while I enjoyed
having my exploits told and retold and told again in my presence and
wondered over and exclaimed about, but I quite distinctly remember that
there presently came a time when the subject was wearisome and odious to
me and I could not endure the disgusting discomfort of it. I am well
aware that the world-glorified doer of a deed of great and real splendor
has just my experience; I know that he deliciously enjoys hearing about
it for three or four weeks, and that pretty soon after that he begins to
dread the mention of it, and by and by wishes he had been with the
damned before he ever thought of doing that deed; I remember how General
Sherman used to rage and swear over "When we were Marching through
Georgia," which was played at him and sung at him everywhere he went;
still, I think I suffered a shade more than the legitimate hero does, he
being privileged to soften his misery with the reflection that his glory
was at any rate golden and reproachless in its origin, whereas I had no
such privilege, there being no possible way to make mine respectable.

How easy it is to make people believe a lie, and how hard it is to undo
that work again! Thirty-five years after those evil exploits of mine I
visited my old mother, whom I had not seen for ten years; and being
moved by what seemed to me a rather noble and perhaps heroic impulse, I
thought I would humble myself and confess my ancient fault. It cost me a
great effort to make up my mind; I dreaded the sorrow that would rise in
her face, and the shame that would look out of her eyes; but after long
and troubled reflection, the sacrifice seemed due and right, and I
gathered my resolution together and made the confession.

To my astonishment there were no sentimentalities, no dramatics, no
George Washington effects; she was not moved in the least degree; she
simply did not believe me, and said so! I was not merely disappointed, I
was nettled, to have my costly truthfulness flung out of the market in
this placid and confident way when I was expecting to get a profit out
of it. I asserted, and reasserted, with rising heat, my statement that
every single thing I had done on those long-vanished nights was a lie
and a swindle; and when she shook her head tranquilly and said she knew
better, I put up my hand and _swore_ to it--adding a triumphant "_Now_
what do you say?"

It did not affect her at all; it did not budge her the fraction of an
inch from her position. If this was hard for me to endure, it did not
begin with the blister she put upon the raw when she began to put my
sworn oath out of court with _arguments_ to prove that I was under a
delusion and did not know what I was talking about. Arguments! Arguments
to show that a person on a man's outside can know better what is on his
inside than he does himself! I had cherished some contempt for arguments
before, I have not enlarged my respect for them since. She refused to
believe that I had invented my visions myself; she said it was folly:
that I was only a child at the time and could not have done it. She
cited the Richmond fire and the colonial mansion and said they were
quite beyond my capacities. Then I saw my chance! I said she was
right--I didn't invent those, I got them from Dr. Peake. Even this great
shot did no damage. She said Dr. Peake's evidence was better than mine,
and he had said in plain words that it was impossible for me to have
heard about those things. Dear, dear, what a grotesque and unthinkable
situation: a confessed swindler convicted of honesty and condemned to
acquittal by circumstantial evidence furnished by the swindled!

I realised, with shame and with impotent vexation, that I was defeated
all along the line. I had but one card left, but it was a formidable
one. I played it--and stood from under. It seemed ignoble to demolish
her fortress, after she had defended it so valiantly; but the defeated
know not mercy. I played that matter card. It was the pin-sticking. I
said, solemnly--

"I give you my honor, a pin was never stuck into me without causing me
cruel pain."

She only said--

"It is thirty-five years. I believe you do think that, _now_, but I was
there, and I know better. You never winced."

She was so calm! and I was so far from it, so nearly frantic.

"Oh, my goodness!" I said, "let me _show_ you that I am speaking the
truth. Here is my arm; drive a pin into it--drive it to the head--I
shall not wince."

She only shook her gray head and said, with simplicity and conviction--

"You are a man, now, and could dissemble the hurt; but you were only a
child then, and could not have done it."

And so the lie which I played upon her in my youth remained with her as
an unchallengeable truth to the day of her death. Carlyle said "a lie
cannot live." It shows that he did not know how to tell them. If I had
taken out a life policy on this one the premiums would have bankrupted
me ages ago.

[_Dictated March 28, 1906._] Orion Clemens was born in Jamestown,
Fentress County, Tennessee, in 1825. He was the family's first-born, and
antedated me ten years. Between him and me came a sister, Margaret, who
died, aged ten, in 1837, in that village of Florida, Missouri, where I
was born; and Pamela, mother of Samuel E. Moffett, who was an invalid
all her life and died in the neighborhood of New York a year ago, aged
about seventy-five. Her character was without blemish, and she was of a
most kindly and gentle disposition. Also there was a brother, Benjamin,
who died in 1848 aged ten or twelve.

[Sidenote: (1843.)]

Orion's boyhood was spent in that wee little log hamlet of Jamestown up
there among the "knobs"--so called--of East Tennessee. The family
migrated to Florida, Missouri, then moved to Hannibal, Missouri, when
Orion was twelve and a half years old. When he was fifteen or sixteen he
was sent to St. Louis and there he learned the printer's trade. One of
his characteristics was eagerness. He woke with an eagerness about some
matter or other every morning; it consumed him all day; it perished in
the night and he was on fire with a fresh new interest next morning
before he could get his clothes on. He exploited in this way three
hundred and sixty-five red-hot new eagernesses every year of his life.
But I am forgetting another characteristic, a very pronounced one. That
was his deep glooms, his despondencies, his despairs; these had their
place in each and every day along with the eagernesses. Thus his day was
divided--no, not divided, mottled--from sunrise to midnight with
alternating brilliant sunshine and black cloud. Every day he was the
most joyous and hopeful man that ever was, I think, and also every day
he was the most miserable man that ever was.

While he was in his apprenticeship in St. Louis, he got well acquainted
with Edward Bates, who was afterwards in Mr. Lincoln's first cabinet.
Bates was a very fine man, an honorable and upright man, and a
distinguished lawyer. He patiently allowed Orion to bring to him each
new project; he discussed it with him and extinguished it by argument
and irresistible logic--at first. But after a few weeks he found that
this labor was not necessary; that he could leave the new project alone
and it would extinguish itself the same night. Orion thought he would
like to become a lawyer. Mr. Bates encouraged him, and he studied law
nearly a week, then of course laid it aside to try something new. He
wanted to become an orator. Mr. Bates gave him lessons. Mr. Bates walked
the floor reading from an English book aloud and rapidly turning the
English into French, and he recommended this exercise to Orion. But as
Orion knew no French, he took up that study and wrought at it like a
volcano for two or three days; then gave it up. During his
apprenticeship in St. Louis he joined a number of churches, one after
another, and taught in their Sunday-schools--changing his Sunday-school
every time he changed his religion. He was correspondingly erratic in
his politics--Whig to-day, Democrat next week, and anything fresh that
he could find in the political market the week after. I may remark here
that throughout his long life he was always trading religions and
enjoying the change of scenery. I will also remark that his sincerity
was never doubted; his truthfulness was never doubted; and in matters of
business and money his honesty was never questioned. Notwithstanding his
forever-recurring caprices and changes, his principles were high, always
high, and absolutely unshakable. He was the strangest compound that ever
got mixed in a human mould. Such a person as that is given to acting
upon impulse and without reflection; that was Orion's way. Everything he
did he did with conviction and enthusiasm and with a vainglorious pride
in the thing he was doing--and no matter what that thing was, whether
good, bad or indifferent, he repented of it every time in sackcloth and
ashes before twenty-four hours had sped. Pessimists are born, not made.
Optimists are born, not made. But I think he was the only person I have
ever known in whom pessimism and optimism were lodged in exactly equal
proportions. Except in the matter of grounded principle, he was as
unstable as water. You could dash his spirits with a single word; you
could raise them into the sky again with another one. You could break
his heart with a word of disapproval; you could make him as happy as an
angel with a word of approval. And there was no occasion to put any
sense or any vestige of mentality of any kind into these miracles;
anything you might say would answer.

He had another conspicuous characteristic, and it was the father of
those which I have just spoken of. This was an intense lust for
approval. He was so eager to be approved, so girlishly anxious to be
approved by anybody and everybody, without discrimination, that he was
commonly ready to forsake his notions, opinions and convictions at a
moment's notice in order to get the approval of any person who disagreed
with them. I wish to be understood as reserving his fundamental
principles all the time. He never forsook those to please anybody. Born
and reared among slaves and slaveholders, he was yet an abolitionist
from his boyhood to his death. He was always truthful; he was always
sincere; he was always honest and honorable. But in light
matters--matters of small consequence, like religion and politics and
such things--he never acquired a conviction that could survive a
disapproving remark from a cat.

He was always dreaming; he was a dreamer from birth, and this
characteristic got him into trouble now and then.

Once when he was twenty-three or twenty-four years old, and was become a
journeyman, he conceived the romantic idea of coming to Hannibal without
giving us notice, in order that he might furnish to the family a
pleasant surprise. If he had given notice, he would have been informed
that we had changed our residence and that that gruff old bass-voiced
sailorman, Dr. G., our family physician, was living in the house which
we had formerly occupied and that Orion's former room in that house was
now occupied by Dr. G.'s two middle-aged maiden sisters. Orion arrived
at Hannibal per steamboat in the middle of the night, and started with
his customary eagerness on his excursion, his mind all on fire with his
romantic project and building and enjoying his surprise in advance. He
was always enjoying things in advance; it was the make of him. He never
could wait for the event, but must build it out of dream-stuff and enjoy
it beforehand--consequently sometimes when the event happened he saw
that it was not as good as the one he had invented in his imagination,
and so he had lost profit by not keeping the imaginary one and letting
the reality go.

When he arrived at the house he went around to the back door and slipped
off his boots and crept up-stairs and arrived at the room of those
elderly ladies without having wakened any sleepers. He undressed in the
dark and got into bed and snuggled up against somebody. He was a little
surprised, but not much--for he thought it was our brother Ben. It was
winter, and the bed was comfortable, and the supposed Ben added to the
comfort--and so he was dropping off to sleep very well satisfied with
his progress so far and full of happy dreams of what was going to happen
in the morning. But something else was going to happen sooner than that,
and it happened now. The maid that was being crowded fumed and fretted
and struggled and presently came to a half-waking condition and
protested against the crowding. That voice paralyzed Orion. He couldn't
move a limb; he couldn't get his breath; and the crowded one discovered
his new whiskers and began to scream. This removed the paralysis, and
Orion was out of bed and clawing round in the dark for his clothes in a
fraction of a second. Both maids began to scream then, so Orion did not
wait to get his whole wardrobe. He started with such parts of it as he
could grab. He flew to the head of the stairs and started down, and was
paralyzed again at that point, because he saw the faint yellow flame of
a candle soaring up the stairs from below and he judged that Dr. G. was
behind it, and he was. He had no clothes on to speak of, but no matter,
he was well enough fixed for an occasion like this, because he had a
butcher-knife in his hand. Orion shouted to him, and this saved his
life, for the Doctor recognized his voice. Then in those deep-sea-going
bass tones of his that I used to admire so much when I was a little boy,
he explained to Orion the change that had been made, told him where to
find the Clemens family, and closed with some quite unnecessary advice
about posting himself before he undertook another adventure like
that--advice which Orion probably never needed again as long as he
lived.

One bitter December night, Orion sat up reading until three o'clock in
the morning and then, without looking at a clock, sallied forth to call
on a young lady. He hammered and hammered at the door; couldn't get any
response; didn't understand it. Anybody else would have regarded that as
an indication of some kind or other and would have drawn inferences and
gone home. But Orion didn't draw inferences, he merely hammered and
hammered, and finally the father of the girl appeared at the door in a
dressing-gown. He had a candle in his hand and the dressing-gown was all
the clothing he had on--except an expression of unwelcome which was so
thick and so large that it extended all down his front to his instep and
nearly obliterated the dressing-gown. But Orion didn't notice that this
was an unpleasant expression. He merely walked in. The old gentleman
took him into the parlor, set the candle on a table, and stood. Orion
made the usual remarks about the weather, and sat down--sat down and
talked and talked and went on talking--that old man looking at him
vindictively and waiting for his chance--waiting treacherously and
malignantly for his chance. Orion had not asked for the young lady. It
was not customary. It was understood that a young fellow came to see the
girl of the house, not the founder of it. At last Orion got up and made
some remark to the effect that probably the young lady was busy and he
would go now and call again. That was the old man's chance, and he said
with fervency "Why good land, aren't you going to stop to breakfast?"


Orion did not come to Hannibal until two or three years after my
father's death. Meantime he remained in St Louis. He was a journeyman
printer and earning wages. Out of his wage he supported my mother and my
brother Henry, who was two years younger than I. My sister Pamela helped
in this support by taking piano pupils. Thus we got along, but it was
pretty hard sledding. I was not one of the burdens, because I was taken
from school at once, upon my father's death, and placed in the office of
the Hannibal "Courier," as printer's apprentice, and Mr. S., the editor
and proprietor of the paper, allowed me the usual emolument of the
office of apprentice--that is to say board and clothes, but no money.
The clothes consisted of two suits a year, but one of the suits always
failed to materialize and the other suit was not purchased so long as
Mr. S.'s old clothes held out. I was only about half as big as Mr. S.,
consequently his shirts gave me the uncomfortable sense of living in a
circus tent, and I had to turn up his pants to my ears to make them
short enough.

There were two other apprentices. One was Steve Wilkins, seventeen or
eighteen years old and a giant. When he was in Mr. S.'s clothes they
fitted him as the candle-mould fits the candle--thus he was generally in
a suffocated condition, particularly in the summer-time. He was a
reckless, hilarious, admirable creature; he had no principles, and was
delightful company. At first we three apprentices had to feed in the
kitchen with the old slave cook and her very handsome and bright and
well-behaved young mulatto daughter. For his own amusement--for he was
not generally laboring for other people's amusement--Steve was
constantly and persistently and loudly and elaborately making love to
that mulatto girl and distressing the life out of her and worrying the
old mother to death. She would say, "Now, Marse Steve, Marse Steve,
can't you behave yourself?" With encouragement like that, Steve would
naturally renew his attentions and emphasize them. It was killingly
funny to Ralph and me. And, to speak truly, the old mother's distress
about it was merely a pretence. She quite well understood that by the
customs of slaveholding communities it was Steve's right to make love to
that girl if he wanted to. But the girl's distress was very real. She
had a refined nature, and she took all Steve's extravagant love-making
in resentful earnest.

We got but little variety in the way of food at that kitchen table, and
there wasn't enough of it anyway. So we apprentices used to keep alive
by arts of our own--that is to say, we crept into the cellar nearly
every night, by a private entrance which we had discovered, and we
robbed the cellar of potatoes and onions and such things, and carried
them down-town to the printing-office, where we slept on pallets on the
floor, and cooked them at the stove and had very good times.

As I have indicated, Mr. S.'s economies were of a pretty close and rigid
kind. By and by, when we apprentices were promoted from the basement to
the ground floor and allowed to sit at the family table, along with the
one journeyman, Harry H., the economies continued. Mrs. S. was a bride.
She had attained to that distinction very recently, after waiting a good
part of a lifetime for it, and she was the right woman in the right
place, according to the economics of the place, for she did not trust
the sugar-bowl to us, but sweetened our coffee herself. That is, she
went through the motions. She didn't really sweeten it. She seemed to
put one heaping teaspoonful of brown sugar into each cup, but, according
to Steve, that was a deceit. He said she dipped the spoon in the coffee
first to make the sugar stick, and then scooped the sugar out of the
bowl with the spoon upside down, so that the effect to the eye was a
heaped-up spoon, whereas the sugar on it was nothing but a layer. This
all seems perfectly true to me, and yet that thing would be so difficult
to perform that I suppose it really didn't happen, but was one of
Steve's lies.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XI.

BY MARK TWAIN.


[Sidenote: (1850.)]

[_Dictated March 28th, 1906._] About 1849 or 1850 Orion severed his
connection with the printing-house in St. Louis and came up to Hannibal,
and bought a weekly paper called the Hannibal "Journal," together with
its plant and its good-will, for the sum of five hundred dollars cash.
He borrowed the cash at ten per cent. interest, from an old farmer named
Johnson who lived five miles out of town. Then he reduced the
subscription price of the paper from two dollars to one dollar. He
reduced the rates for advertising in about the same proportion, and
thus he created one absolute and unassailable certainty--to wit: that
the business would never pay him a single cent of profit. He took me out
of the "Courier" office and engaged my services in his own at three
dollars and a half a week, which was an extravagant wage, but Orion was
always generous, always liberal with everybody except himself. It cost
him nothing in my case, for he never was able to pay me a penny as long
as I was with him. By the end of the first year he found he must make
some economies. The office rent was cheap, but it was not cheap enough.
He could not afford to pay rent of any kind, so he moved the whole plant
into the house we lived in, and it cramped the dwelling-place cruelly.
He kept that paper alive during four years, but I have at this time no
idea how he accomplished it. Toward the end of each year he had to turn
out and scrape and scratch for the fifty dollars of interest due Mr.
Johnson, and that fifty dollars was about the only cash he ever received
or paid out, I suppose, while he was proprietor of that newspaper,
except for ink and printing-paper. The paper was a dead failure. It had
to be that from the start. Finally he handed it over to Mr. Johnson, and
went up to Muscatine, Iowa, and acquired a small interest in a weekly
newspaper there. It was not a sort of property to marry on--but no
matter. He came across a winning and pretty girl who lived in Quincy,
Illinois, a few miles below Keokuk, and they became engaged. He was
always falling in love with girls, but by some accident or other he had
never gone so far as engagement before. And now he achieved nothing but
misfortune by it, because he straightway fell in love with a Keokuk
girl. He married the Keokuk girl and they began a struggle for life
which turned out to be a difficult enterprise, and very unpromising.

To gain a living in Muscatine was plainly impossible, so Orion and his
new wife went to Keokuk to live, for she wanted to be near her
relatives. He bought a little bit of a job-printing plant--on credit, of
course--and at once put prices down to where not even the apprentices
could get a living out of it, and this sort of thing went on.

[Sidenote: (1853.)]

I had not joined the Muscatine migration. Just before that happened
(which I think was in 1853) I disappeared one night and fled to St.
Louis. There I worked in the composing-room of the "Evening News" for a
time, and then started on my travels to see the world. The world was New
York City, and there was a little World's Fair there. It had just been
opened where the great reservoir afterward was, and where the sumptuous
public library is now being built--Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street.
I arrived in New York with two or three dollars in pocket change and a
ten-dollar bank-bill concealed in the lining of my coat. I got work at
villainous wages in the establishment of John A. Gray and Green in Cliff
Street, and I found board in a sufficiently villainous mechanics'
boarding-house in Duane Street. The firm paid my wages in wildcat money
at its face value, and my week's wage merely sufficed to pay board and
lodging. By and by I went to Philadelphia and worked there some months
as a "sub" on the "Inquirer" and the "Public Ledger." Finally I made a
flying trip to Washington to see the sights there, and in 1854 I went
back to the Mississippi Valley, sitting upright in the smoking-car two
or three days and nights. When I reached St. Louis I was exhausted. I
went to bed on board a steamboat that was bound for Muscatine. I fell
asleep at once, with my clothes on, and didn't wake again for thirty-six
hours.

[Sidenote: (1854.)]

... I worked in that little job-office in Keokuk as much as two years, I
should say, without ever collecting a cent of wages, for Orion was never
able to pay anything--but Dick Higham and I had good times. I don't know
what Dick got, but it was probably only uncashable promises.

[Sidenote: (1856.)]

One day in the midwinter of 1856 or 1857--I think it was 1856--I was
coming along the main street of Keokuk in the middle of the forenoon. It
was bitter weather--so bitter that that street was deserted, almost. A
light dry snow was blowing here and there on the ground and on the
pavement, swirling this way and that way and making all sorts of
beautiful figures, but very chilly to look at. The wind blew a piece of
paper past me and it lodged against a wall of a house. Something about
the look of it attracted my attention and I gathered it in. It was a
fifty-dollar bill, the only one I had ever seen, and the largest
assemblage of money I had ever encountered in one spot. I advertised it
in the papers and suffered more than a thousand dollars' worth of
solicitude and fear and distress during the next few days lest the owner
should see the advertisement and come and take my fortune away. As many
as four days went by without an applicant; then I could endure this kind
of misery no longer. I felt sure that another four could not go by in
this safe and secure way. I felt that I must take that money out of
danger. So I bought a ticket for Cincinnati and went to that city. I
worked there several months in the printing-office of Wrightson and
Company. I had been reading Lieutenant Herndon's account of his
explorations of the Amazon and had been mightily attracted by what he
said of coca. I made up my mind that I would go to the head waters of
the Amazon and collect coca and trade in it and make a fortune. I left
for New Orleans in the steamer "Paul Jones" with this great idea filling
my mind. One of the pilots of that boat was Horace Bixby. Little by
little I got acquainted with him, and pretty soon I was doing a lot of
steering for him in his daylight watches. When I got to New Orleans I
inquired about ships leaving for Pará and discovered that there weren't
any, and learned that there probably wouldn't be any during that
century. It had not occurred to me to inquire about those particulars
before leaving Cincinnati, so there I was. I couldn't get to the Amazon.
I had no friends in New Orleans and no money to speak of. I went to
Horace Bixby and asked him to make a pilot out of me. He said he would
do it for a hundred dollars cash in advance. So I steered for him up to
St. Louis, borrowed the money from my brother-in-law and closed the
bargain. I had acquired this brother-in-law several years before. This
was Mr. William A. Moffett, a merchant, a Virginian--a fine man in every
way. He had married my sister Pamela, and the Samuel E. Moffett of whom
I have been speaking was their son. Within eighteen months I became a
competent pilot, and I served that office until the Mississippi River
traffic was brought to a standstill by the breaking out of the civil
war.

... Meantime Orion had gone down the river and established his little
job-printing-office in Keokuk. On account of charging next to nothing
for the work done in his job-office, he had almost nothing to do there.
He was never able to comprehend that work done on a profitless basis
deteriorates and is presently not worth anything, and that customers are
then obliged to go where they can get better work, even if they must pay
better prices for it. He had plenty of time, and he took up Blackstone
again. He also put up a sign which offered his services to the public
as a lawyer. He never got a case, in those days, nor even an applicant,
although he was quite willing to transact law business for nothing and
furnish the stationery himself. He was always liberal that way.

[Sidenote: (1861.)]

Presently he moved to a wee little hamlet called Alexandria, two or
three miles down the river, and he put up that sign there. He got no
custom. He was by this time very hard aground. But by this time I was
beginning to earn a wage of two hundred and fifty dollars a month as
pilot, and so I supported him thenceforth until 1861, when his ancient
friend, Edward Bates, then a member of Mr. Lincoln's first cabinet, got
him the place of Secretary of the new Territory of Nevada, and Orion and
I cleared for that country in the overland stage-coach, I paying the
fares, which were pretty heavy, and carrying with me what money I had
been able to save--this was eight hundred dollars, I should say--and it
was all in silver coin and a good deal of a nuisance because of its
weight. And we had another nuisance, which was an Unabridged Dictionary.
It weighed about a thousand pounds, and was a ruinous expense, because
the stage-coach Company charged for extra baggage by the ounce. We could
have kept a family for a time on what that dictionary cost in the way of
extra freight--and it wasn't a good dictionary anyway--didn't have any
modern words in it--only had obsolete ones that they used to use when
Noah Webster was a child.

The Government of the new Territory of Nevada was an interesting
menagerie. Governor Nye was an old and seasoned politician from New
York--politician, not statesman. He had white hair; he was in fine
physical condition; he had a winningly friendly face and deep lustrous
brown eyes that could talk as a native language the tongue of every
feeling, every passion, every emotion. His eyes could outtalk his
tongue, and this is saying a good deal, for he was a very remarkable
talker, both in private and on the stump. He was a shrewd man; he
generally saw through surfaces and perceived what was going on inside
without being suspected of having an eye on the matter.

When grown-up persons indulge in practical jokes, the fact gauges them.
They have lived narrow, obscure, and ignorant lives, and at full manhood
they still retain and cherish a job-lot of left-over standards and
ideals that would have been discarded with their boyhood if they had
then moved out into the world and a broader life. There were many
practical jokers in the new Territory. I do not take pleasure in
exposing this fact, for I liked those people; but what I am saying is
true. I wish I could say a kindlier thing about them instead--that they
were burglars, or hat-rack thieves, or something like that, that
wouldn't be utterly uncomplimentary. I would prefer it, but I can't say
those things, they would not be true. These people were practical
jokers, and I will not try to disguise it. In other respects they were
plenty good-enough people; honest people; reputable and likable. They
played practical jokes upon each other with success, and got the
admiration and applause and also the envy of the rest of the community.
Naturally they were eager to try their arts on big game, and that was
what the Governor was. But they were not able to score. They made
several efforts, but the Governor defeated these efforts without any
trouble and went on smiling his pleasant smile as if nothing had
happened. Finally the joker chiefs of Carson City and Virginia City
conspired together to see if their combined talent couldn't win a
victory, for the jokers were getting into a very uncomfortable place:
the people were laughing at them, instead of at their proposed victim.
They banded themselves together to the number of ten and invited the
Governor to what was a most extraordinary attention in those
days--pickled oyster stew and champagne--luxuries very seldom seen in
that region, and existing rather as fabrics of the imagination than as
facts.

The Governor took me with him. He said disparagingly,

"It's a poor invention. It doesn't deceive. Their idea is to get me
drunk and leave me under the table, and from their standpoint this will
be very funny. But they don't know me. I am familiar with champagne and
have no prejudices against it."

The fate of the joke was not decided until two o'clock in the morning.
At that hour the Governor was serene, genial, comfortable, contented,
happy and sober, although he was so full that he couldn't laugh without
shedding champagne tears. Also, at that hour the last joker joined his
comrades under the table, drunk to the last perfection. The Governor
remarked,

"This is a dry place, Sam, let's go and get something to drink and go to
bed."

The Governor's official menagerie had been drawn from the humblest
ranks of his constituents at home--harmless good fellows who had helped
in his campaigns, and now they had their reward in petty salaries
payable in greenbacks that were worth next to nothing. Those boys had a
hard time to make both ends meet. Orion's salary was eighteen hundred
dollars a year, and he wouldn't even support his dictionary on it. But
the Irishwoman who had come out on the Governor's staff charged the
menagerie only ten dollars a week apiece for board and lodging. Orion
and I were of her boarders and lodgers; and so, on these cheap terms the
silver I had brought from home held out very well.

[Sidenote: ('62 or '63)]

At first I roamed about the country seeking silver, but at the end of
'62 or the beginning of '63 when I came up from Aurora to begin a
journalistic life on the Virginia City "Enterprise," I was presently
sent down to Carson City to report the legislative session. Orion was
soon very popular with the members of the legislature, because they
found that whereas they couldn't usually trust each other, nor anybody
else, they could trust him. He easily held the belt for honesty in that
country, but it didn't do him any good in a pecuniary way, because he
had no talent for either persuading or scaring legislators. But I was
differently situated. I was there every day in the legislature to
distribute compliment and censure with evenly balanced justice and
spread the same over half a page of the "Enterprise" every morning,
consequently I was an influence. I got the legislature to pass a wise
and very necessary law requiring every corporation doing business in the
Territory to record its charter in full, without skipping a word, in a
record to be kept by the Secretary of the Territory--my brother. All the
charters were framed in exactly the same words. For this record-service
he was authorized to charge forty cents a folio of one hundred words for
making the record; also five dollars for furnishing a certificate of
each record, and so on. Everybody had a toll-road franchise, but no
toll-road. But the franchise had to be recorded and paid for. Everybody
was a mining corporation, and had to have himself recorded and pay for
it. Very well, we prospered. The record-service paid an average of a
thousand dollars a month, in gold.

Governor Nye was often absent from the Territory. He liked to run down
to San Francisco every little while and enjoy a rest from Territorial
civilization. Nobody complained, for he was prodigiously popular, he
had been a stage-driver in his early days in New York or New England,
and had acquired the habit of remembering names and faces, and of making
himself agreeable to his passengers. As a politician this had been
valuable to him, and he kept his arts in good condition by practice. By
the time he had been Governor a year, he had shaken hands with every
human being in the Territory of Nevada, and after that he always knew
these people instantly at sight and could call them by name. The whole
population, of 20,000 persons, were his personal friends, and he could
do anything he chose to do and count upon their being contented with it.
Whenever he was absent from the Territory--which was generally--Orion
served his office in his place, as Acting Governor, a title which was
soon and easily shortened to "Governor." He recklessly built and
furnished a house at a cost of twelve thousand dollars, and there was no
other house in the sage-brush capital that could approach this property
for style and cost.

When Governor Nye's four-year term was drawing to a close, the mystery
of why he had ever consented to leave the great State of New York and
help inhabit that jack-rabbit desert was solved: he had gone out there
in order to become a United States Senator. All that was now necessary
was to turn the Territory into a State. He did it without any
difficulty. That undeveloped country and that sparse population were not
well fitted for the heavy burden of a State Government, but no matter,
the people were willing to have the change, and so the Governor's game
was made.

Orion's game was made too, apparently, for he was as popular because of
his honesty as the Governor was for more substantial reasons; but at the
critical moment the inborn capriciousness of his character rose up
without warning, and disaster followed.

offices in the gift of the new State of Nevada save two--United States
Senator, and Secretary of State. Nye was certain to get a Senatorship,
and Orion was so sure to get the Secretaryship that no one but him was
named for that office. But he was hit with one of his spasms of virtue
on the very day that the Republican party was to make its nominations in
the Convention, and refused to go near the Convention. He was urged, but
all persuasions failed. He said his presence there would be an unfair
and improper influence and that if he was to be nominated the compliment
must come to him as a free and unspotted gift. This attitude would have
settled his case for him without further effort, but he had another
attack of virtue on the same day, that made it absolutely sure. It had
been his habit for a great many years to change his religion with his
shirt, and his ideas about temperance at the same time. He would be a
teetotaler for a while and the champion of the cause; then he would
change to the other side for a time. On nomination day he suddenly
changed from a friendly attitude toward whiskey--which was the popular
attitude--to uncompromising teetotalism, and went absolutely dry. His
friends besought and implored, but all in vain. He could not be
persuaded to cross the threshold of a saloon. The paper next morning
contained the list of chosen nominees. His name was not in it. He had
not received a vote.

His rich income ceased when the State government came into power. He was
without an occupation. Something had to be done. He put up his sign as
attorney-at-law, but he got no clients. It was strange. It was difficult
to account for. I cannot account for it--but if I were going to guess at
a solution I should guess that by the make of him he would examine both
sides of a case so diligently and so conscientiously that when he got
through with his argument neither he nor a jury would know which side he
was on. I think that his client would find out his make in laying his
case before him, and would take warning and withdraw it in time to save
himself from probable disaster.

I had taken up my residence in San Francisco about a year before the
time I have just been speaking of. One day I got a tip from Mr. Camp, a
bold man who was always making big fortunes in ingenious speculations
and losing them again in the course of six months by other speculative
ingenuities. Camp told me to buy some shares in the Hale and Norcross. I
bought fifty shares at three hundred dollars a share. I bought on a
margin, and put up twenty per cent. It exhausted my funds. I wrote Orion
and offered him half, and asked him to send his share of the money. I
waited and waited. He wrote and said he was going to attend to it. The
stock went along up pretty briskly. It went higher and higher. It
reached a thousand dollars a share. It climbed to two thousand, then to
three thousand; then to twice that figure. The money did not come, but I
was not disturbed. By and by that stock took a turn and began to gallop
down. Then I wrote urgently. Orion answered that he had sent the money
long ago--said he had sent it to the Occidental Hotel. I inquired for
it. They said it was not there. To cut a long story short, that stock
went on down until it fell below the price I had paid for it. Then it
began to eat up the margin, and when at last I got out I was very badly
crippled.

When it was too late, I found out what had become of Orion's money. Any
other human being would have sent a check, but he sent gold. The hotel
clerk put it in the safe and went on vacation, and there it had reposed
all this time enjoying its fatal work, no doubt. Another man might have
thought to tell me that the money was not in a letter, but was in an
express package, but it never occurred to Orion to do that.

Later, Mr. Camp gave me another chance. He agreed to buy our Tennessee
land for two hundred thousand dollars, pay a part of the amount in cash
and give long notes for the rest. His scheme was to import foreigners
from grape-growing and wine-making districts in Europe, settle them on
the land, and turn it into a wine-growing country. He knew what Mr.
Longworth thought of those Tennessee grapes, and was satisfied. I sent
the contracts and things to Orion for his signature, he being one of the
three heirs. But they arrived at a bad time--in a doubly bad time, in
fact. The temperance virtue was temporarily upon him in strong force,
and he wrote and said that he would not be a party to debauching the
country with wine. Also he said how could he know whether Mr. Camp was
going to deal fairly and honestly with those poor people from Europe or
not?--and so, without waiting to find out, he quashed the whole trade,
and there it fell, never to be brought to life again. The land, from
being suddenly worth two hundred thousand dollars, became as suddenly
worth what it was before--nothing, and taxes to pay. I had paid the
taxes and the other expenses for some years, but I dropped the Tennessee
land there, and have never taken any interest in it since, pecuniarily
or otherwise, until yesterday.

I had supposed, until yesterday, that Orion had frittered away the last
acre, and indeed that was his own impression. But a gentleman arrived
yesterday from Tennessee and brought a map showing that by a correction
of the ancient surveys we still own a thousand acres, in a coal
district, out of the hundred thousand acres which my father left us when
he died in 1847. The gentleman brought a proposition; also he brought a
reputable and well-to-do citizen of New York. The proposition was that
the Tennesseean gentleman should sell that land; that the New York
gentleman should pay all the expenses and fight all the lawsuits, in
case any should turn up, and that of such profit as might eventuate the
Tennesseean gentleman should take a third, the New-Yorker a third, and
Sam Moffett and his sister and I--who are surviving heirs--the remaining
third.

This time I hope we shall get rid of the Tennessee land for good and all
and never hear of it again.

[Sidenote: (1867.)]

[Sidenote: (1871.)]

I came East in January, 1867. Orion remained in Carson City perhaps a
year longer. Then he sold his twelve-thousand-dollar house and its
furniture for thirty-five hundred in greenbacks at about sixty per cent.
discount. He and his wife took passage in the steamer for home in
Keokuk. About 1871 or '72 they came to New York. Orion had been trying
to make a living in the law ever since he had arrived from the Pacific
Coast, but he had secured only two cases. Those he was to try free of
charge--but the possible result will never be known, because the parties
settled the cases out of court without his help.

Orion got a job as proof-reader on the New York "Evening Post" at ten
dollars a week. By and by he came to Hartford and wanted me to get him a
place as reporter on a Hartford paper. Here was a chance to try my
scheme again, and I did it. I made him go to the Hartford "Evening
Post," without any letter of introduction, and propose to scrub and
sweep and do all sorts of things for nothing, on the plea that he didn't
need money but only needed work, and that that was what he was pining
for. Within six weeks he was on the editorial staff of that paper at
twenty dollars a week, and he was worth the money. He was presently
called for by some other paper at better wages, but I made him go to the
"Post" people and tell them about it. They stood the raise and kept him.
It was the pleasantest berth he had ever had in his life. It was an easy
berth. He was in every way comfortable. But ill-luck came. It was bound
to come.

A new Republican daily was to be started in a New England city by a
stock company of well-to-do politicians, and they offered him the chief
editorship at three thousand a year. He was eager to accept. My
beseechings and reasonings went for nothing. I said,

"You are as weak as water. Those people will find it out right away.
They will easily see that you have no backbone; that they can deal with
you as they would deal with a slave. You may last six months, but not
longer. Then they will not dismiss you as they would dismiss a
gentleman: they will fling you out as they would fling out an intruding
tramp."

It happened just so. Then he and his wife migrated to Keokuk once more.
Orion wrote from there that he was not resuming the law; that he thought
that what his health needed was the open air, in some sort of outdoor
occupation; that his father-in-law had a strip of ground on the river
border a mile above Keokuk with some sort of a house on it, and his idea
was to buy that place and start a chicken-farm and provide Keokuk with
chickens and eggs, and perhaps butter--but I don't know whether you can
raise butter on a chicken-farm or not. He said the place could be had
for three thousand dollars cash, and I sent the money. He began to raise
chickens, and he made a detailed monthly report to me, whereby it
appeared that he was able to work off his chickens on the Keokuk people
at a dollar and a quarter a pair. But it also appeared that it cost a
dollar and sixty cents to raise the pair. This did not seem to
discourage Orion, and so I let it go. Meantime he was borrowing a
hundred dollars per month of me regularly, month by month. Now to show
Orion's stern and rigid business ways--and he really prided himself on
his large business capacities--the moment he received the advance of a
hundred dollars at the beginning of each month, he always sent me his
note for the amount, and with it he sent, _out of that money, three
months' interest_ on the hundred dollars at six per cent. per annum,
these notes being always for three months.

As I say, he always sent a detailed statement of the month's profit and
loss on the chickens--at least the month's loss on the chickens--and
this detailed statement included the various items of expense--corn for
the chickens, boots for himself, and so on; even car fares, and the
weekly contribution of ten cents to help out the missionaries who were
trying to damn the Chinese after a plan not satisfactory to those
people.

I think the poultry experiment lasted about a year, possibly two years.
It had then cost me six thousand dollars.

Orion returned to the law business, and I suppose he remained in that
harness off and on for the succeeding quarter of a century, but so far
as my knowledge goes he was only a lawyer in name, and had no clients.

[Sidenote: (1890.)]

My mother died, in her eighty-eighth year, in the summer of 1890. She
had saved some money, and she left it to me, because it had come from
me. I gave it to Orion and he said, with thanks, that I had supported
him long enough and now he was going to relieve me of that burden, and
would also hope to pay back some of that expense, and maybe the whole of
it. Accordingly, he proceeded to use up that money in building a
considerable addition to the house, with the idea of taking boarders and
getting rich. We need not dwell upon this venture. It was another of his
failures. His wife tried hard to make the scheme succeed, and if anybody
could have made it succeed she would have done it. She was a good woman,
and was greatly liked. She had a practical side, and she would have made
that boarding-house lucrative if circumstances had not been against her.

Orion had other projects for recouping me, but as they always required
capital I stayed out of them, and they did not materialize. Once he
wanted to start a newspaper. It was a ghastly idea, and I squelched it
with a promptness that was almost rude. Then he invented a wood-sawing
machine and patched it together himself, and he really sawed wood with
it. It was ingenious; it was capable; and it would have made a
comfortable little fortune for him; but just at the wrong time
Providence interfered again. Orion applied for a patent and found that
the same machine had already been patented and had gone into business
and was thriving.

Presently the State of New York offered a fifty-thousand-dollar prize
for a practical method of navigating the Erie Canal with steam
canal-boats. Orion worked at that thing for two or three years, invented
and completed a method, and was once more ready to reach out and seize
upon imminent wealth when somebody pointed out a defect: his steam
canal-boat could not be used in the winter-time; and in the summer-time
the commotion its wheels would make in the water would wash away the
State of New York on both sides.

Innumerable were Orion's projects for acquiring the means to pay off
the debt to me. These projects extended straight through the succeeding
thirty years, but in every case they failed. During all those thirty
years his well-established honesty kept him in offices of trust where
other people's money had to be taken care of, but where no salary was
paid. He was treasurer of all the benevolent institutions; he took care
of the money and other property of widows and orphans; he never lost a
cent for anybody, and never made one for himself. Every time he changed
his religion the church of his new faith was glad to get him; made him
treasurer at once, and at once he stopped the graft and the leaks in
that church. He exhibited a facility in changing his political
complexion that was a marvel to the whole community. Once the following
curious thing happened, and he wrote me all about it himself.

One morning he was a Republican, and upon invitation he agreed to make a
campaign speech at the Republican mass-meeting that night. He prepared
the speech. After luncheon he became a Democrat and agreed to write a
score of exciting mottoes to be painted upon the transparencies which
the Democrats would carry in their torchlight procession that night. He
wrote these shouting Democratic mottoes during the afternoon, and they
occupied so much of his time that it was night before he had a chance to
change his politics again; so he actually made a rousing Republican
campaign speech in the open air while his Democratic transparencies
passed by in front of him, to the joy of every witness present.

He was a most strange creature--but in spite of his eccentricities he
was beloved, all his life, in whatsoever community he lived. And he was
also held in high esteem, for at bottom he was a sterling man.

About twenty-five years ago--along there somewhere--I suggested to Orion
that he write an autobiography. I asked him to try to tell the straight
truth in it; to refrain from exhibiting himself in creditable attitudes
exclusively, and to honorably set down all the incidents of his life
which he had found interesting to him, including those which were burned
into his memory because he was ashamed of them. I said that this had
never been done, and that if he could do it his autobiography would be a
most valuable piece of literature. I said I was offering him a job which
I could not duplicate in my own case, but I would cherish the hope that
he might succeed with it. I recognise now that I was trying to saddle
upon him an impossibility. I have been dictating this autobiography of
mine daily for three months; I have thought of fifteen hundred or two
thousand incidents in my life which I am ashamed of, but I have not
gotten one of them to consent to go on paper yet. I think that that
stock will still be complete and unimpaired when I finish these memoirs,
if I ever finish them. I believe that if I should put in all or any of
those incidents I should be sure to strike them out when I came to
revise this book.

Orion wrote his autobiography and sent it to me. But great was my
disappointment; and my vexation, too. In it he was constantly making a
hero of himself, exactly as I should have done and am doing now, and he
was constantly forgetting to put in the episodes which placed him in an
unheroic light. I knew several incidents of his life which were
distinctly and painfully unheroic, but when I came across them in his
autobiography they had changed color. They had turned themselves inside
out, and were things to be intemperately proud of. In my dissatisfaction
I destroyed a considerable part of that autobiography. But in what
remains there are passages which are interesting, and I shall quote from
them here and there and now and then, as I go along.

[Sidenote: (1898.)]

While we were living in Vienna in 1898 a cablegram came from Keokuk
announcing Orion's death. He was seventy-two years old. He had gone down
to the kitchen in the early hours of a bitter December morning; he had
built the fire, and had then sat down at a table to write something; and
there he died, with the pencil in his hand and resting against the paper
in the middle of an unfinished word--an indication that his release from
the captivity of a long and troubled and pathetic and unprofitable life
was mercifully swift and painless.

[_Dictated in 1904._] A quarter of a century ago I was visiting John Hay
at Whitelaw Reid's house in New York, which Hay was occupying for a few
months while Reid was absent on a holiday in Europe. Temporarily also,
Hay was editing Reid's paper, the New York "Tribune." I remember two
incidents of that Sunday visit particularly well. I had known John Hay a
good many years, I had known him when he was an obscure young editorial
writer on the "Tribune" in Horace Greely's time, earning three or four
times the salary he got, considering the high character of the work
which came from his pen. In those earlier days he was a picture to look
at, for beauty of feature, perfection of form and grace of carriage and
movement. He had a charm about him of a sort quite unusual to my Western
ignorance and inexperience--a charm of manner, intonation, apparently
native and unstudied elocution, and all that--the groundwork of it
native, the ease of it, the polish of it, the winning naturalness of it,
acquired in Europe where he had been Chargé d'Affaires some time at the
Court of Vienna. He was joyous and cordial, a most pleasant comrade. One
of the two incidents above referred to as marking that visit was this:

In trading remarks concerning our ages I confessed to forty-two and Hay
to forty. Then he asked if I had begun to write my autobiography, and I
said I hadn't. He said that I ought to begin at once, and that I had
already lost two years. Then he said in substance this:

"At forty a man reaches the top of the hill of life and starts down on
the sunset side. The ordinary man, the average man, not to particularize
too closely and say the commonplace man, has at that age succeeded or
failed; in either case he has lived all of his life that is likely to be
worth recording; also in either case the life lived is worth setting
down, and cannot fail to be interesting if he comes as near to telling
the truth about himself as he can. And he _will_ tell the truth in spite
of himself, for his facts and his fictions will work loyally together
for the protection of the reader; each fact and each fiction will be a
dab of paint, each will fall in its right place, and together they will
paint his portrait; not the portrait _he_ thinks they are painting, but
his real portrait, the inside of him, the soul of him, his character.
Without intending to lie he will lie all the time; not bluntly,
consciously, not dully unconsciously, but half-consciously--
consciousness in twilight; a soft and gentle and merciful twilight which
makes his general form comely, with his virtuous prominences and
projections discernible and his ungracious ones in shadow. His truths
will be recognizable as truths, his modifications of facts which would
tell against him will go for nothing, the reader will see the fact
through the film and know his man.

"There is a subtle devilish something or other about autobiographical
composition that defeats all the writer's attempts to paint his portrait
_his_ way."

Hay meant that he and I were ordinary average commonplace people, and I
did not resent my share of the verdict, but nursed my wound in silence.
His idea that we had finished our work in life, passed the summit and
were westward bound down-hill, with me two years ahead of him and
neither of us with anything further to do as benefactors to mankind, was
all a mistake. I had written four books then, possibly five. I have been
drowning the world in literary wisdom ever since, volume after volume;
since that day's sun went down he has been the historian of Mr. Lincoln,
and his book will never perish; he has been ambassador, brilliant
orator, competent and admirable Secretary of State.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XIII.

BY MARK TWAIN.


[Sidenote: (1847.)]

... As I have said, that vast plot of Tennessee land[6] was held by my
father twenty years--intact. When he died in 1847, we began to manage it
ourselves. Forty years afterward, we had managed it all away except
10,000 acres, and gotten nothing to remember the sales by. About
1887--possibly it was earlier--the 10,000 went. My brother found a
chance to trade it for a house and lot in the town of Corry, in the oil
regions of Pennsylvania. About 1894 he sold this property for $250. That
ended the Tennessee Land.

If any penny of cash ever came out of my father's wise investment but
that, I have no recollection of it. No, I am overlooking a detail. It
furnished me a field for Sellers and a book. Out of my half of the book
I got $15,000 or $20,000; out of the play I got $75,000 or $80,000--just
about a dollar an acre. It is curious: I was not alive when my father
made the investment, therefore he was not intending any partiality; yet
I was the only member of the family that ever profited by it. I shall
have occasion to mention this land again, now and then, as I go along,
for it influenced our life in one way or another during more than a
generation. Whenever things grew dark it rose and put out its hopeful
Sellers hand and cheered us up, and said "Do not be afraid--trust in
me--wait." It kept us hoping and hoping, during forty years, and forsook
us at last. It put our energies to sleep and made visionaries of
us--dreamers and indolent. We were always going to be rich next year--no
occasion to work. It is good to begin life poor; it is good to begin
life rich--these are wholesome; but to begin it _prospectively_ rich!
The man who has not experienced it cannot imagine the curse of it.

My parents removed to Missouri in the early thirties; I do not remember
just when, for I was not born then, and cared nothing for such things.
It was a long journey in those days, and must have been a rough and
tiresome one. The home was made in the wee village of Florida, in Monroe
county, and I was born there in 1835. The village contained a hundred
people and I increased the population by one per cent. It is more than
the best man in history ever did for any other town. It may not be
modest in me to refer to this, but it is true. There is no record of a
person doing as much--not even Shakespeare. But I did it for Florida,
and it shows that I could have done it for any place--even London, I
suppose.

Recently some one in Missouri has sent me a picture of the house I was
born in. Heretofore I have always stated that it was a palace, but I
shall be more guarded, now.

I remember only one circumstance connected with my life in it. I
remember it very well, though I was but two and a half years old at the
time. The family packed up everything and started in wagons for
Hannibal, on the Mississippi, thirty miles away. Toward night, when they
camped and counted up the children, one was missing. I was the one. I
had been left behind. Parents ought always to count the children before
they start. I was having a good enough time playing by myself until I
found that the doors were fastened and that there was a grisly deep
silence brooding over the place. I knew, then, that the family were
gone, and that they had forgotten me. I was well frightened, and I made
all the noise I could, but no one was near and it did no good. I spent
the afternoon in captivity and was not rescued until the gloaming had
fallen and the place was alive with ghosts.

My brother Henry was six months old at that time. I used to remember his
walking into a fire outdoors when he was a week old. It was remarkable
in me to remember a thing like that, which occurred when I was so young.
And it was still more remarkable that I should cling to the delusion,
for thirty years, that I _did_ remember it--for of course it never
happened; he would not have been able to walk at that age. If I had
stopped to reflect, I should not have burdened my memory with that
impossible rubbish so long. It is believed by many people that an
impression deposited in a child's memory within the first two years of
its life cannot remain there five years, but that is an error. The
incident of Benvenuto Cellini and the salamander must be accepted as
authentic and trustworthy; and then that remarkable and indisputable
instance in the experience of Helen Keller--however, I will speak of
that at another time. For many years I believed that I remembered
helping my grandfather drink his whiskey toddy when I was six weeks old,
but I do not tell about that any more, now; I am grown old, and my
memory is not as active as it used to be. When I was younger I could
remember anything, whether it had happened or not; but my faculties are
decaying, now, and soon I shall be so I cannot remember any but the
things that happened. It is sad to go to pieces like this, but we all
have to do it.

My uncle, John A. Quarles, was a farmer, and his place was in the
country four miles from Florida. He had eight children, and fifteen or
twenty negroes, and was also fortunate in other ways. Particularly in
his character. I have not come across a better man than he was. I was
his guest for two or three months every year, from the fourth year after
we removed to Hannibal till I was eleven or twelve years old. I have
never consciously used him or his wife in a book, but his farm has come
very handy to me in literature, once or twice. In "Huck Finn" and in
"Tom Sawyer Detective" I moved it down to Arkansas. It was all of six
hundred miles, but it was no trouble, it was not a very large farm;
five hundred acres, perhaps, but I could have done it if it had been
twice as large. And as for the morality of it, I cared nothing for that;
I would move a State if the exigencies of literature required it.

It was a heavenly place for a boy, that farm of my uncle John's. The
house was a double log one, with a spacious floor (roofed in) connecting
it with the kitchen. In the summer the table was set in the middle of
that shady and breezy floor, and the sumptuous meals--well, it makes me
cry to think of them. Fried chicken, roast pig, wild and tame turkeys,
ducks and geese; venison just killed; squirrels, rabbits, pheasants,
partridges, prairie-chickens; biscuits, hot batter cakes, hot buckwheat
cakes, hot "wheat bread," hot rolls, hot corn pone; fresh corn boiled on
the ear, succotash, butter-beans, string-beans, tomatoes, pease, Irish
potatoes, sweet-potatoes; buttermilk, sweet milk, "clabber";
watermelons, musk-melons, cantaloups--all fresh from the garden--apple
pie, peach pie, pumpkin pie, apple dumplings, peach cobbler--I can't
remember the rest. The way that the things were cooked was perhaps the
main splendor--particularly a certain few of the dishes. For instance,
the corn bread, the hot biscuits and wheat bread, and the fried chicken.
These things have never been properly cooked in the North--in fact, no
one there is able to learn the art, so far as my experience goes. The
North thinks it knows how to make corn bread, but this is gross
superstition. Perhaps no bread in the world is quite as good as Southern
corn bread, and perhaps no bread in the world is quite so bad as the
Northern imitation of it. The North seldom tries to fry chicken, and
this is well; the art cannot be learned north of the line of Mason and
Dixon, nor anywhere in Europe. This is not hearsay; it is experience
that is speaking. In Europe it is imagined that the custom of serving
various kinds of bread blazing hot is "American," but that is too broad
a spread; it is custom in the South, but is much less than that in the
North. In the North and in Europe hot bread is considered unhealthy.
This is probably another fussy superstition, like the European
superstition that ice-water is unhealthy. Europe does not need
ice-water, and does not drink it; and yet, notwithstanding this, its
word for it is better than ours, because it describes it, whereas ours
doesn't. Europe calls it "iced" water. Our word describes water made
from melted ice--a drink which we have but little acquaintance with.

It seem a pity that the world should throw away so many good things
merely because they are unwholesome. I doubt if God has given us any
refreshment which, taken in moderation, is unwholesome, except microbes.
Yet there are people who strictly deprive themselves of each and every
eatable, drinkable and smokable which has in any way acquired a shady
reputation. They pay this price for health. And health is all they get
for it. How strange it is; it is like paying out your whole fortune for
a cow that has gone dry.

The farmhouse stood in the middle of a very large yard, and the yard was
fenced on three sides with rails and on the rear side with high palings;
against these stood the smokehouse; beyond the palings was the orchard;
beyond the orchard were the negro quarter and the tobacco-fields. The
front yard was entered over a stile, made of sawed-off logs of graduated
heights; I do not remember any gate. In a corner of the front yard were
a dozen lofty hickory-trees and a dozen black-walnuts, and in the
nutting season riches were to be gathered there.

Down a piece, abreast the house, stood a little log cabin against the
rail fence; and there the woody hill fell sharply away, past the barns,
the corn-crib, the stables and the tobacco-curing house, to a limpid
brook which sang along over its gravelly bed and curved and frisked in
and out and here and there and yonder in the deep shade of overhanging
foliage and vines--a divine place for wading, and it had swimming-pools,
too, which were forbidden to us and therefore much frequented by us. For
we were little Christian children, and had early been taught the value
of forbidden fruit.

In the little log cabin lived a bedridden white-headed slave woman whom
we visited daily, and looked upon with awe, for we believed she was
upwards of a thousand years old and had talked with Moses. The younger
negroes credited these statistics, and had furnished them to us in good
faith. We accommodated all the details which came to us about her; and
so we believed that she had lost her health in the long desert trip
coming out of Egypt, and had never been able to get it back again. She
had a round bald place on the crown of her head, and we used to creep
around and gaze at it in reverent silence, and reflect that it was
caused by fright through seeing Pharaoh drowned. We called her "Aunt"
Hannah, Southern fashion. She was superstitious like the other negroes;
also, like them, she was deeply religious. Like them, she had great
faith in prayer, and employed it in all ordinary exigencies, but not in
cases where a dead certainty of result was urgent. Whenever witches were
around she tied up the remnant of her wool in little tufts, with white
thread, and this promptly made the witches impotent.

All the negroes were friends of ours, and with those of our own age we
were in effect comrades. I say in effect, using the phrase as a
modification. We were comrades, and yet not comrades; color and
condition interposed a subtle line which both parties were conscious of,
and which rendered complete fusion impossible. We had a faithful and
affectionate good friend, ally and adviser in "Uncle Dan'l," a
middle-aged slave whose head was the best one in the negro quarter,
whose sympathies were wide and warm, and whose heart was honest and
simple and knew no guile. He has served me well, these many, many years.
I have not seen him for more than half a century, and yet spiritually I
have had his welcome company a good part of that time, and have staged
him in books under his own name and as "Jim," and carted him all
around--to Hannibal, down the Mississippi on a raft, and even across the
Desert of Sahara in a balloon--and he has endured it all with the
patience and friendliness and loyalty which were his birthright. It was
on the farm that I got my strong liking for his race and my appreciation
of certain of its fine qualities. This feeling and this estimate have
stood the test of sixty years and more and have suffered no impairment.
The black face is as welcome to me now as it was then.

In my schoolboy days I had no aversion to slavery. I was not aware that
there was anything wrong about it. No one arraigned it in my hearing;
the local papers said nothing against it; the local pulpit taught us
that God approved it, that it was a holy thing, and that the doubter
need only look in the Bible if he wished to settle his mind--and then
the texts were read aloud to us to make the matter sure; if the slaves
themselves had an aversion to slavery they were wise and said nothing.
In Hannibal we seldom saw a slave misused; on the farm, never.

There was, however, one small incident of my boyhood days which touched
this matter, and it must have meant a good deal to me or it would not
have stayed in my memory, clear and sharp, vivid and shadowless, all
these slow-drifting years. We had a little slave boy whom we had hired
from some one, there in Hannibal. He was from the Eastern Shore of
Maryland, and had been brought away from his family and his friends,
half-way across the American continent, and sold. He was a cheery
spirit, innocent and gentle, and the noisiest creature that ever was,
perhaps. All day long he was singing, whistling, yelling, whooping,
laughing--it was maddening, devastating, unendurable. At last, one day,
I lost all my temper, and went raging to my mother, and said Sandy had
been singing for an hour without a single break, and I couldn't stand
it, and _wouldn't_ she please shut him up. The tears came into her eyes,
and her lip trembled, and she said something like this--

"Poor thing, when he sings, it shows that he is not remembering, and
that comforts me; but when he is still, I am afraid he is thinking, and
I cannot bear it. He will never see his mother again; if he can sing, I
must not hinder it, but be thankful for it. If you were older, you would
understand me; then that friendless child's noise would make you glad."

It was a simple speech, and made up of small words, but it went home,
and Sandy's noise was not a trouble to me any more. She never used large
words, but she had a natural gift for making small ones do effective
work. She lived to reach the neighborhood of ninety years, and was
capable with her tongue to the last--especially when a meanness or an
injustice roused her spirit. She has come handy to me several times in
my books, where she figures as Tom Sawyer's "Aunt Polly." I fitted her
out with a dialect, and tried to think up other improvements for her,
but did not find any. I used Sandy once, also; it was in "Tom Sawyer"; I
tried to get him to whitewash the fence, but it did not work. I do not
remember what name I called him by in the book.

I can see the farm yet, with perfect clearness. I can see all its
belongings, all its details; the family room of the house, with a
"trundle" bed in one corner and a spinning-wheel in another--a wheel
whose rising and falling wail, heard from a distance, was the
mournfulest of all sounds to me, and made me homesick and low-spirited,
and filled my atmosphere with the wandering spirits of the dead: the
vast fireplace, piled high, on winter nights, with flaming hickory logs
from whose ends a sugary sap bubbled out but did not go to waste, for we
scraped it off and ate it; the lazy cat spread out on the rough
hearthstones, the drowsy dogs braced against the jambs and blinking; my
aunt in one chimney-corner knitting, my uncle in the other smoking his
corn-cob pipe; the slick and carpetless oak floor faintly mirroring the
dancing flame-tongues and freckled with black indentations where
fire-coals had popped out and died a leisurely death; half a dozen
children romping in the background twilight; "split"-bottomed chairs
here and there, some with rockers; a cradle--out of service, but
waiting, with confidence; in the early cold mornings a snuggle of
children, in shirts and chemises, occupying the hearthstone and
procrastinating--they could not bear to leave that comfortable place and
go out on the wind-swept floor-space between the house and kitchen where
the general tin basin stood, and wash.

Along outside of the front fence ran the country road; dusty in the
summer-time, and a good place for snakes--they liked to lie in it and
sun themselves; when they were rattlesnakes or puff adders, we killed
them: when they were black snakes, or racers, or belonged to the fabled
"hoop" breed, we fled, without shame; when they were "house snakes" or
"garters" we carried them home and put them in Aunt Patsy's work-basket
for a surprise; for she was prejudiced against snakes, and always when
she took the basket in her lap and they began to climb out of it it
disordered her mind. She never could seem to get used to them; her
opportunities went for nothing. And she was always cold toward bats,
too, and could not bear them; and yet I think a bat is as friendly a
bird as there is. My mother was Aunt Patsy's sister, and had the same
wild superstitions. A bat is beautifully soft and silky: I do not know
any creature that is pleasanter to the touch, or is more grateful for
caressings, if offered in the right spirit. I know all about these
coleoptera, because our great cave, three miles below Hannibal, was
multitudinously stocked with them, and often I brought them home to
amuse my mother with. It was easy to manage if it was a school day,
because then I had ostensibly been to school and hadn't any bats. She
was not a suspicious person, but full of trust and confidence; and when
I said "There's something in my coat pocket for you," she would put her
hand in. But she always took it out again, herself; I didn't have to
tell her. It was remarkable, the way she couldn't learn to like private
bats.

I think she was never in the cave in her life; but everybody else went
there. Many excursion parties came from considerable distances up and
down the river to visit the cave. It was miles in extent, and was a
tangled wilderness of narrow and lofty clefts and passages. It was an
easy place to get lost in; anybody could do it--including the bats. I
got lost in it myself, along with a lady, and our last candle burned
down to almost nothing before we glimpsed the search-party's lights
winding about in the distance.

"Injun Joe" the half-breed got lost in there once, and would have
starved to death if the bats had run short. But there was no chance of
that; there were myriads of them. He told me all his story. In the book
called "Tom Sawyer" I starved him entirely to death in the cave, but
that was in the interest of art; it never happened. "General" Gaines,
who was our first town drunkard before Jimmy Finn got the place, was
lost in there for the space of a week, and finally pushed his
handkerchief out of a hole in a hilltop near Saverton, several miles
down the river from the cave's mouth, and somebody saw it and dug him
out. There is nothing the matter with his statistics except the
handkerchief. I knew him for years, and he hadn't any. But it could have
been his nose. That would attract attention.

Beyond the road where the snakes sunned themselves was a dense young
thicket, and through it a dim-lighted path led a quarter of a mile; then
out of the dimness one emerged abruptly upon a level great prairie which
was covered with wild strawberry-plants, vividly starred with prairie
pinks, and walled in on all sides by forests. The strawberries were
fragrant and fine, and in the season we were generally there in the
crisp freshness of the early morning, while the dew-beads still sparkled
upon the grass and the woods were ringing with the first songs of the
birds.

Down the forest slopes to the left were the swings. They were made of
bark stripped from hickory saplings. When they became dry they were
dangerous. They usually broke when a child was forty feet in the air,
and this was why so many bones had to be mended every year. I had no
ill-luck myself, but none of my cousins escaped. There were eight of
them, and at one time and another they broke fourteen arms among them.
But it cost next to nothing, for the doctor worked by the year--$25 for
the whole family. I remember two of the Florida doctors, Chowning and
Meredith. They not only tended an entire family for $25 a year, but
furnished the medicines themselves. Good measure, too. Only the largest
persons could hold a whole dose. Castor-oil was the principal beverage.
The dose was half a dipperful, with half a dipperful of New Orleans
molasses added to help it down and make it taste good, which it never
did. The next standby was calomel; the next, rhubarb; and the next,
jalap. Then they bled the patient, and put mustard-plasters on him. It
was a dreadful system, and yet the death-rate was not heavy. The calomel
was nearly sure to salivate the patient and cost him some of his teeth.
There were no dentists. When teeth became touched with decay or were
otherwise ailing, the doctor knew of but one thing to do: he fetched his
tongs and dragged them out. If the jaw remained, it was not his fault.

Doctors were not called, in cases of ordinary illness; the family's
grandmother attended to those. Every old woman was a doctor, and
gathered her own medicines in the woods, and knew how to compound doses
that would stir the vitals of a cast-iron dog. And then there was the
"Indian doctor"; a grave savage, remnant of his tribe, deeply read in
the mysteries of nature and the secret properties of herbs; and most
backwoodsmen had high faith in his powers and could tell of wonderful
cures achieved by him. In Mauritius, away off yonder in the solitudes of
the Indian Ocean, there is a person who answers to our Indian doctor of
the old times. He is a negro, and has had no teaching as a doctor, yet
there is one disease which he is master of and can cure, and the doctors
can't. They send for him when they have a case. It is a child's disease
of a strange and deadly sort, and the negro cures it with a herb
medicine which he makes, himself, from a prescription which has come
down to him from his father and grandfather. He will not let any one see
it. He keeps the secret of its components to himself, and it is feared
that he will die without divulging it; then there will be consternation
in Mauritius. I was told these things by the people there, in 1896.

We had the "faith doctor," too, in those early days--a woman. Her
specialty was toothache. She was a farmer's old wife, and lived five
miles from Hannibal. She would lay her hand on the patient's jaw and say
"Believe!" and the cure was prompt. Mrs. Utterback. I remember her very
well. Twice I rode out there behind my mother, horseback, and saw the
cure performed. My mother was the patient.

Dr. Meredith removed to Hannibal, by and by, and was our family
physician there, and saved my life several times. Still, he was a good
man and meant well. Let it go.

I was always told that I was a sickly and precarious and tiresome and
uncertain child, and lived mainly on allopathic medicines during the
first seven years of my life. I asked my mother about this, in her old
age--she was in her 88th year--and said:

"I suppose that during all that time you were uneasy about me?"

"Yes, the whole time."

"Afraid I wouldn't live?"

After a reflective pause--ostensibly to think out the facts--

"No--afraid you would."

It sounds like a plagiarism, but it probably wasn't. The country
schoolhouse was three miles from my uncle's farm. It stood in a clearing
in the woods, and would hold about twenty-five boys and girls. We
attended the school with more or less regularity once or twice a week,
in summer, walking to it in the cool of the morning by the forest paths,
and back in the gloaming at the end of the day. All the pupils brought
their dinners in baskets--corn-dodger, buttermilk and other good
things--and sat in the shade of the trees at noon and ate them. It is
the part of my education which I look back upon with the most
satisfaction. My first visit to the school was when I was seven. A
strapping girl of fifteen, in the customary sunbonnet and calico dress,
asked me if I "used tobacco"--meaning did I chew it. I said, no. It
roused her scorn. She reported me to all the crowd, and said--

"Here is a boy seven years old who can't chaw tobacco."

By the looks and comments which this produced, I realized that I was a
degraded object; I was cruelly ashamed of myself. I determined to
reform. But I only made myself sick; I was not able to learn to chew
tobacco. I learned to smoke fairly well, but that did not conciliate
anybody, and I remained a poor thing, and characterless. I longed to be
respected, but I never was able to rise. Children have but little
charity for each other's defects.

As I have said, I spent some part of every year at the farm until I was
twelve or thirteen years old. The life which I led there with my cousins
was full of charm, and so is the memory of it yet. I can call back the
solemn twilight and mystery of the deep woods, the earthy smells, the
faint odors of the wild flowers, the sheen of rain-washed foliage, the
rattling clatter of drops when the wind shook the trees, the far-off
hammering of woodpeckers and the muffled drumming of wood-pheasants in
the remoteness of the forest, the snap-shot glimpses of disturbed wild
creatures skurrying through the grass,--I can call it all back and make
it as real as it ever was, and as blessed. I can call back the prairie,
and its loneliness and peace, and a vast hawk hanging motionless in the
sky, with his wings spread wide and the blue of the vault showing
through the fringe of their end-feathers. I can see the woods in their
autumn dress, the oaks purple, the hickories washed with gold, the
maples and the sumacs luminous with crimson fires, and I can hear the
rustle made by the fallen leaves as we ploughed through them. I can see
the blue clusters of wild grapes hanging amongst the foliage of the
saplings, and I remember the taste of them and the smell. I know how the
wild blackberries looked, and how they tasted; and the same with the
pawpaws, the hazelnuts and the persimmons; and I can feel the thumping
rain, upon my head, of hickory-nuts and walnuts when we were out in the
frosty dawn to scramble for them with the pigs, and the gusts of wind
loosed them and sent them down. I know the stain of blackberries, and
how pretty it is; and I know the stain of walnut hulls, and how little
it minds soap and water; also what grudged experience it had of either
of them. I know the taste of maple sap, and when to gather it, and how
to arrange the troughs and the delivery tubes, and how to boil down the
juice, and how to hook the sugar after it is made; also how much better
hooked sugar tastes than any that is honestly come by, let bigots say
what they will. I know how a prize watermelon looks when it is sunning
its fat rotundity among pumpkin-vines and "simblins"; I know how to tell
when it is ripe without "plugging" it; I know how inviting it looks when
it is cooling itself in a tub of water under the bed, waiting; I know
how it looks when it lies on the table in the sheltered great
floor-space between house and kitchen, and the children gathered for the
sacrifice and their mouths watering; I know the crackling sound it makes
when the carving-knife enters its end, and I can see the split fly along
in front of the blade as the knife cleaves its way to the other end; I
can see its halves fall apart and display the rich red meat and the
black seeds, and the heart standing up, a luxury fit for the elect; I
know how a boy looks, behind a yard-long slice of that melon, and I know
how he feels; for I have been there. I know the taste of the watermelon
which has been honestly come by, and I know the taste of the watermelon
which has been acquired by art. Both taste good, but the experienced
know which tastes best. I know the look of green apples and peaches and
pears on the trees, and I know how entertaining they are when they are
inside of a person. I know how ripe ones look when they are piled in
pyramids under the trees, and how pretty they are and how vivid their
colors. I know how a frozen apple looks, in a barrel down cellar in the
winter-time, and how hard it is to bite, and how the frost makes the
teeth ache, and yet how good it is, notwithstanding. I know the
disposition of elderly people to select the specked apples for the
children, and I once knew ways to beat the game. I know the look of an
apple that is roasting and sizzling on a hearth on a winter's evening,
and I know the comfort that comes of eating it hot, along with some
sugar and a drench of cream. I know the delicate art and mystery of so
cracking hickory-nuts and walnuts on a flatiron with a hammer that the
kernels will be delivered whole, and I know how the nuts, taken in
conjunction with winter apples, cider and doughnuts, make old people's
tales and old jokes sound fresh and crisp and enchanting, and juggle an
evening away before you know what went with the time. I know the look of
Uncle Dan'l's kitchen as it was on privileged nights when I was a child,
and I can see the white and black children grouped on the hearth, with
the firelight playing on their faces and the shadows flickering upon the
walls, clear back toward the cavernous gloom of the rear, and I can hear
Uncle Dan'l telling the immortal tales which Uncle Remus Harris was to
gather into his books and charm the world with, by and by; and I can
feel again the creepy joy which quivered through me when the time for
the ghost-story of the "Golden Arm" was reached--and the sense of
regret, too, which came over me, for it was always the last story of the
evening, and there was nothing between it and the unwelcome bed.

I can remember the bare wooden stairway in my uncle's house, and the
turn to the left above the landing, and the rafters and the slanting
roof over my bed, and the squares of moonlight on the floor, and the
white cold world of snow outside, seen through the curtainless window.
I can remember the howling of the wind and the quaking of the house on
stormy nights, and how snug and cozy one felt, under the blankets,
listening, and how the powdery snow used to sift in, around the sashes,
and lie in little ridges on the floor, and make the place look chilly in
the morning, and curb the wild desire to get up--in case there was any.
I can remember how very dark that room was, in the dark of the moon, and
how packed it was with ghostly stillness when one woke up by accident
away in the night, and forgotten sins came flocking out of the secret
chambers of the memory and wanted a hearing; and how ill chosen the time
seemed for this kind of business; and how dismal was the hoo-hooing of
the owl and the wailing of the wolf, sent mourning by on the night wind.

I remember the raging of the rain on that roof, summer nights, and how
pleasant it was to lie and listen to it, and enjoy the white splendor of
the lightning and the majestic booming and crashing of the thunder. It
was a very satisfactory room; and there was a lightning-rod which was
reachable from the window, an adorable and skittish thing to climb up
and down, summer nights, when there were duties on hand of a sort to
make privacy desirable.

I remember the 'coon and 'possum hunts, nights, with the negroes, and
the long marches through the black gloom of the woods, and the
excitement which fired everybody when the distant bay of an experienced
dog announced that the game was treed; then the wild scramblings and
stumblings through briars and bushes and over roots to get to the spot;
then the lighting of a fire and the felling of the tree, the joyful
frenzy of the dogs and the negroes, and the weird picture it all made in
the red glare--I remember it all well, and the delight that every one
got out of it, except the 'coon.

I remember the pigeon seasons, when the birds would come in millions,
and cover the trees, and by their weight break down the branches. They
were clubbed to death with sticks; guns were not necessary, and were not
used. I remember the squirrel hunts, and the prairie-chicken hunts, and
the wild-turkey hunts, and all that; and how we turned out, mornings,
while it was still dark, to go on these expeditions, and how chilly and
dismal it was, and how often I regretted that I was well enough to go. A
toot on a tin horn brought twice as many dogs as were needed, and in
their happiness they raced and scampered about, and knocked small people
down, and made no end of unnecessary noise. At the word, they vanished
away toward the woods, and we drifted silently after them in the
melancholy gloom. But presently the gray dawn stole over the world, the
birds piped up, then the sun rose and poured light and comfort all
around, everything was fresh and dewy and fragrant, and life was a boon
again. After three hours of tramping we arrived back wholesomely tired,
overladen with game, very hungry, and just in time for breakfast.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XIV.

BY MARK TWAIN.


[_Dictated Thursday, December 6, 1906._]

_From Susy's Biography of Me._


     _Feb. 27, Sunday._

     Clara's reputation as a baby was always a fine one, mine exactly
     the contrary. One often related story concerning her braveness as a
     baby and her own opinion of this quality of hers is this. Clara and
     I often got slivers in our hands and when mama took them out with a
     much dreaded needle, Clara was always very brave, and I very
     cowardly. One day Clara got one of these slivers in her hand, a
     very bad one, and while mama was taking it out, Clara stood
     perfectly still without even wincing: I saw how brave she was and
     turning to mamma said "Mamma isn't she a brave little thing!"
     presently mamma had to give the little hand quite a dig with the
     needle and noticing how perfectly quiet Clara was about it she
     exclaimed, Why Clara! you are a brave little thing! Clara responded
     "No bodys braver but  God!"--


Clara's pious remark is the main detail, and Susy has accurately
remembered its phrasing. The three-year-older's wound was of a
formidable sort, and not one which the mother's surgery would have been
equal to. The flesh of the finger had been burst by a cruel accident. It
was the doctor that sewed it up, and to all appearances it was he, and
the other independent witnesses, that did the main part of the
suffering; each stitch that he took made Clara wince slightly, but it
shrivelled the others.

I take pride in Clara's remark, because it shows that although she was
only three years old, her fireside teachings were already making her a
thinker--a thinker and also an observer of proportions. I am not
claiming any credit for this. I furnished to the children worldly
knowledge and wisdom, but was not competent to go higher, and so I left
their spiritual education in the hands of the mother. A result of this
modesty of mine was made manifest to me in a very striking way, some
years afterward, when Jean was nine years old. We had recently arrived
in Berlin, at the time, and had begun housekeeping in a furnished
apartment. One morning at breakfast a vast card arrived--an invitation.
To be precise, it was a command from the Emperor of Germany to come to
dinner. During several months I had encountered socially, on the
Continent, men bearing lofty titles; and all this while Jean was
becoming more and more impressed, and awed, and subdued, by these
imposing events, for she had not been abroad before, and they were new
to her--wonders out of dreamland turned into realities. The imperial
card was passed from hand to hand, around the table, and examined with
interest; when it reached Jean she exhibited excitement and emotion, but
for a time was quite speechless; then she said,

"Why, papa, if it keeps going on like this, pretty soon there won't be
anybody left for you to get acquainted with but God."

It was not complimentary to think I was not acquainted in that quarter,
but she was young, and the young jump to conclusions without reflection.

Necessarily, I did myself the honor to obey the command of the Emperor
Wilhelm II. Prince Heinrich, and six or eight other guests were
present. The Emperor did most of the talking, and he talked well, and in
faultless English. In both of these conspicuousnesses I was gratified to
recognize a resemblance to myself--a very exact resemblance; no, almost
exact, but not quite that--a modified exactness, with the advantage in
favor of the Emperor. My English, like his, is nearly faultless; like
him I talk well; and when I have guests at dinner I prefer to do all the
talking myself. It is the best way, and the pleasantest. Also the most
profitable for the others.

I was greatly pleased to perceive that his Majesty was familiar with my
books, and that his attitude toward them was not uncomplimentary. In the
course of his talk he said that my best and most valuable book was "Old
Times on the Mississippi." I will refer to that remark again, presently.

An official who was well up in the Foreign Office at that time, and had
served under Bismarck for fourteen years, was still occupying his old
place under Chancellor Caprivi. Smith, I will call him of whom I am
speaking, though that is not his name. He was a special friend of mine,
and I greatly enjoyed his society, although in order to have it it was
necessary for me to seek it as late as midnight, and not earlier. This
was because Government officials of his rank had to work all day, after
nine in the morning, and then attend official banquets in the evening;
wherefore they were usually unable to get life-restoring fresh air and
exercise for their jaded minds and bodies earlier than midnight; then
they turned out, in groups of two or three, and gratefully and violently
tramped the deserted streets until two in the morning. Smith had been in
the Government service, at home and abroad, for more than thirty years,
and he was now sixty years old, or close upon it. He could not remember
a year in which he had had a vacation of more than a fortnight's length;
he was weary all through to the bones and the marrow, now, and was
yearning for a holiday of a whole three months--yearning so longingly
and so poignantly that he had at last made up his mind to make a
desperate cast for it and stand the consequences, whatever they might
be. It was against all rules to _ask_ for a vacation--quite against all
etiquette; the shock of it would paralyze the Chancellery; stem
etiquette and usage required another form: the applicant was not
privileged to ask for a vacation, he must send in his _resignation_. The
chancellor would know that the applicant was not really trying to
resign, and didn't want to resign, but was merely trying in this
left-handed way to get a vacation.

The night before the Emperor's dinner I helped Smith take his exercise,
after midnight, and he was full of his project. He had sent in his
resignation that day, and was trembling for the result; and naturally,
because it might possibly be that the chancellor would be happy to fill
his place with somebody else, in which case he could accept the
resignation without comment and without offence. Smith was in a very
anxious frame of mind; not that he feared that Caprivi was dissatisfied
with him, for he had no such fear; it was the Emperor that he was afraid
of; he did not know how he stood with the Emperor. He said that while
apparently it was Caprivi who would decide his case, it was in reality
the Emperor who would perform that service; that the Emperor kept
personal watch upon everything, and that no official sparrow could fall
to the ground without his privity and consent; that the resignation
would be laid before his Majesty, who would accept it or decline to
accept it, according to his pleasure, and that then his pleasure in the
matter would be communicated by Caprivi. Smith said he would know his
fate the next evening, after the imperial dinner; that when I should
escort his Majesty into the large salon contiguous to the dining-room, I
would find there about thirty men--Cabinet ministers, admirals, generals
and other great officials of the Empire--and that these men would be
standing talking together in little separate groups of two or three
persons; that the Emperor would move from group to group and say a word
to each, sometimes two words, sometimes ten words; and that the length
of his speech, whether brief or not so brief, would indicate the exact
standing in the Emperor's regard, of the man accosted; and that by
observing this thermometer an expert could tell, to half a degree, the
state of the imperial weather in each case; that in Berlin, as in the
imperial days of Rome, the Emperor was the sun, and that his smile or
his frown meant good fortune or disaster to the man upon whom it should
fall. Smith suggested that I watch the thermometer while the Emperor
went his rounds of the groups; and added that if his Majesty talked four
minutes with any person there present, it meant high favor, and that the
sun was in the zenith, and cloudless, for that man.

I mentally recorded that four-minute altitude, and resolved to see if
any man there on that night stood in sufficient favor to achieve it.

Very well. After the dinner I watched the Emperor while he passed from
group to group, and privately I timed him with a watch. Two or three
times he came near to reaching the four-minute altitude, but always he
fell short a little. The last man he came to was Smith. He put his hand
on Smith's shoulder and began to talk to him; and when he finished, the
thermometer had scored seven minutes! The company then moved toward the
smoking-room, where cigars, beer and anecdotes would be in brisk service
until midnight, and as Smith passed me he whispered,

"That settles it. The chancellor will ask me how much of a vacation I
want, and I sha'n't be afraid to raise the limit. I shall call for six
months."

[Sidenote: (1891)]

[Sidenote: (1899)]

Smith's dream had been to spend his three months' vacation--in case he
got a vacation instead of the other thing--in one of the great capitals
of the Continent--a capital whose name I shall suppress, at present. The
next day the chancellor asked him how much of a vacation he wanted, and
where he desired to spend it. Smith told him. His prayer was granted,
and rather more than granted. The chancellor augmented his salary and
attached him to the German Embassy of that selected capital, giving him
a place of high dignity bearing an imposing title, and with nothing to
do except attend banquets of an extraordinary character at the Embassy,
once or twice a year. The term of his vacation was not specified; he was
to continue it until requested to come back to his work in the Foreign
Office. This was in 1891. Eight years later Smith was passing through
Vienna, and he called upon me. There had been no interruption of his
vacation, as yet, and there was no likelihood that an interruption of it
would occur while he should still be among the living.

[_Dictated Monday, December 17, 1906._] As I have already remarked, "Old
Times on the Mississippi" got the Kaiser's best praise. It was after
midnight when I reached home; I was usually out until toward midnight,
and the pleasure of being out late was poisoned, every night, by the
dread of what I must meet at my front door--an indignant face, a
resentful face, the face of the _portier_. The _portier_ was a
tow-headed young German, twenty-two or three years old; and it had been
for some time apparent to me that he did not enjoy being hammered out of
his sleep, nights, to let me in. He never had a kind word for me, nor a
pleasant look. I couldn't understand it, since it was his business to be
on watch and let the occupants of the several flats in at any and all
hours of the night. I could not see why he so distinctly failed to get
reconciled to it.

The fact is, I was ignorantly violating, every night, a custom in which
he was commercially interested. I did not suspect this. No one had told
me of the custom, and if I had been left to guess it, it would have
taken me a very long time to make a success of it. It was a custom which
was so well established and so universally recognized, that it had all
the force and dignity of law. By authority of this custom, whosoever
entered a Berlin house after ten at night must pay a trifling toll to
the _portier_ for breaking his sleep to let him in. This tax was either
two and a half cents or five cents, I don't remember which; but I had
never paid it, and didn't know I owed it, and as I had been residing in
Berlin several weeks, I was so far in arrears that my presence in the
German capital was getting to be a serious disaster to that young
fellow.

I arrived from the imperial dinner sorrowful and anxious, made my
presence known and prepared myself to wait in patience the tedious
minute or two which the _portier_ usually allowed himself to keep me
tarrying--as a punishment. But this time there was no stage-wait; the
door was instantly unlocked, unbolted, unchained and flung wide; and in
it appeared the strange and welcome apparition of the _portier's_ round
face all sunshine and smiles and welcome, in place of the black frowns
and hostility that I was expecting. Plainly he had not come out of his
bed: he had been waiting for me, watching for me. He began to pour out
upon me in the most enthusiastic and energetic way a generous stream of
German welcome and homage, meanwhile dragging me excitedly to his small
bedroom beside the front door; there he made me bend down over a row of
German translations of my books and said,

"There--you wrote them! I have found it out! By God, I did not know it
before, and I ask a million pardons! That one there, the 'Old Times on
the Mississippi,' is the best book you ever wrote!"

The usual number of those curious accidents which we call coincidences
have fallen to my share in this life, but for picturesqueness this one
puts all the others in the shade: that a crowned head and a _portier_,
the very top of an empire and the very bottom of it, should pass the
very same criticism and deliver the very same verdict upon a book of
mine--and almost in the same hour and the same breath--is a coincidence
which out-coincidences any coincidence which I could have imagined with
such powers of imagination as I have been favored with; and I have not
been accustomed to regard them as being small or of an inferior quality.
It is always a satisfaction to me to remember that whereas I do not
know, for sure, what any other nation thinks of any one of my
twenty-three volumes, I do at least know for a certainty what one nation
of fifty millions thinks of one of them, at any rate; for if the mutual
verdict of the top of an empire and the bottom of it does not establish
for good and all the judgment of the entire nation concerning that book,
then the axiom that we can get a sure estimate of a thing by arriving at
a general average of all the opinions involved, is a fallacy.

[_Dictated Monday, February 10, 1907._] Two months ago (December 6) I
was dictating a brief account of a private dinner in Berlin, where the
Emperor of Germany was host and I the chief guest. Something happened
day before yesterday which moves me to take up that matter again.

At the dinner his Majesty chatted briskly and entertainingly along in
easy and flowing English, and now and then he interrupted himself to
address a remark to me, or to some other individual of the guests. When
the reply had been delivered, he resumed his talk. I noticed that the
table etiquette tallied with that which was the law of my house at home
when we had guests: that is to say, the guests answered when the host
favored them with a remark, and then quieted down and behaved themselves
until they got another chance. If I had been in the Emperor's chair and
he in mine, I should have felt infinitely comfortable and at home, and
should have done a world of talking, and done it well; but I was guest
now, and consequently I felt less at home. From old experience, I was
familiar with the rules of the game, and familiar with their exercise
from the high place of host; but I was not familiar with the trammelled
and less satisfactory position of guest, therefore I felt a little
strange and out of place. But there was no animosity--no, the Emperor
was host, therefore according to my own rule he had a right to do the
talking, and it was my honorable duty to intrude no interruptions or
other improvements, except upon invitation; and of course it could be
_my_ turn some day: some day, on some friendly visit of inspection to
America, it might be my pleasure and distinction to have him as guest at
my table; then I would give him a rest, and a remarkably quiet time.

In one way there was a difference between his table and mine--for
instance, atmosphere; the guests stood in awe of him, and naturally they
conferred that feeling upon me, for, after all, I am only human,
although I regret it. When a guest answered a question he did it with
deferential voice and manner; he did not put any emotion into it, and he
did not spin it out, but got it out of his system as quickly as he
could, and then looked relieved. The Emperor was used to this
atmosphere, and it did not chill his blood; maybe it was an inspiration
to him, for he was alert, brilliant and full of animation; also he was
most gracefully and felicitously complimentary to my books,--and I will
remark here that the happy phrasing of a compliment is one of the rarest
of human gifts, and the happy delivery of it another. In that other
chapter I mentioned the high compliment which he paid to the book, "Old
Times on the Mississippi," but there were others; among them some
gratifying praise of my description in "A Tramp Abroad" of certain
striking phases of German student life. I mention these things here
because I shall have occasion to hark back to them presently.

[_Dictated Tuesday, February 12, 1907._]

       *       *       *       *       *

Those stars indicate the long chapter which I dictated yesterday, a
chapter which is much too long for magazine purposes, and therefore must
wait until this Autobiography shall appear in book form, five years
hence, when I am dead: five years according to my calculation,
twenty-seven years according to the prediction furnished me a week ago
by the latest and most confident of all the palmists who have ever read
my future in my hand. The Emperor's dinner, and its beer-and-anecdote
appendix, covered six hours of diligent industry, and this accounts for
the extraordinary length of that chapter.

A couple of days ago a gentleman called upon me with a message. He had
just arrived from Berlin, where he had been acting for our Government in
a matter concerning tariff revision, he being a member of the commission
appointed by our Government to conduct our share of the affair. Upon the
completion of the commission's labors, the Emperor invited the members
of it to an audience, and in the course of the conversation he made a
reference to me; continuing, he spoke of my chapter on the German
language in "A Tramp Abroad," and characterized it by an adjective which
is too complimentary for me to repeat here without bringing my modesty
under suspicion. Then he paid some compliments to "The Innocents
Abroad," and followed these with the remark that my account in one of my
books of certain striking phases of German student life was the best and
truest that had ever been written. By this I perceive that he remembers
that dinner of sixteen years ago, for he said the same thing to me about
the student-chapter at that time. Next he said he wished this gentleman
to convey two messages to America from him and deliver them--one to the
President, the other to me. The wording of the message to me was:

"Convey to Mr. Clemens my kindest regards. Ask him if he remembers that
dinner, and ask him why he didn't do any talking."

Why, how could I talk when he was talking? He "held the age," as the
poker-clergy say, and two can't talk at the same time with good effect.
It reminds me of the man who was reproached by a friend, who said,

"I think it a shame that you have not spoken to your wife for fifteen
years. How do you explain it? How do you justify it?"

That poor man said,

"I didn't want to interrupt her."

If the Emperor had been at my table, he would not have suffered from my
silence, he would only have suffered from the sorrows of his own
solitude. If I were not too old to travel, I would go to Berlin and
introduce the etiquette of my own table, which tallies with the
etiquette observable at other royal tables. I would say, "Invite me
again, your Majesty, and give me a chance"; then I would courteously
waive rank and do all the talking myself. I thank his Majesty for his
kind message, and am proud to have it and glad to express my sincere
reciprocation of its sentiments.

[_Dictated January 17, 1906._] ... Rev. Joseph T. Harris and I have been
visiting General Sickles. Once, twenty or twenty-five years ago, just as
Harris was coming out of his gate Sunday morning to walk to his church
and preach, a telegram was put into his hand. He read it immediately,
and then, in a manner, collapsed. It said: "General Sickles died last
night at midnight." [He had been a chaplain under Sickles through the
war.]

[Sidenote: (1880.)]

It wasn't so. But no matter--it was so to Harris at the time. He walked
along--walked to the church--but his mind was far away. All his
affection and homage and worship of his General had come to the fore.
His heart was full of these emotions. He hardly knew where he was. In
his pulpit, he stood up and began the service, but with a voice over
which he had almost no command. The congregation had never seen him thus
moved, before, in his pulpit. They sat there and gazed at him and
wondered what was the matter; because he was now reading, in this broken
voice and with occasional tears trickling down his face, what to them
seemed a quite unemotional chapter--that one about Moses begat Aaron,
and Aaron begat Deuteronomy, and Deuteronomy begat St. Peter, and St.
Peter begat Cain, and Cain begat Abel--and he was going along with this,
and half crying--his voice continually breaking. The congregation left
the church that morning without being able to account for this most
extraordinary thing--as it seemed to them. That a man who had been a
soldier for more than four years, and who had preached in that pulpit so
many, many times on really moving subjects, without even the quiver of a
lip, should break all down over the Begats, they couldn't understand.
But there it is--any one can see how such a mystery as that would arouse
the curiosity of those people to the boiling-point.

Harris has had many adventures. He has more adventures in a year than
anybody else has in five. One Saturday night he noticed a bottle on his
uncle's dressing-bureau. He thought the label said "Hair Restorer," and
he took it in his room and gave his head a good drenching and sousing
with it and carried it back and thought no more about it. Next morning
when he got up his head was a bright green! He sent around everywhere
and couldn't get a substitute preacher, so he had to go to his church
himself and preach--and he did it. He hadn't a sermon in his barrel--as
it happened--of any lightsome character, so he had to preach a very
grave one--a very serious one--and it made the matter worse. The gravity
of the sermon did not harmonize with the gayety of his head, and the
people sat all through it with handkerchiefs stuffed in their mouths to
try to keep down their joy. And Harris told me that he was sure he never
had seen his congregation--the whole body of his congregation--the
_entire_ body of his congregation--absorbed in interest in his sermon,
from beginning to end, before. Always there had been an aspect of
indifference, here and there, or wandering, somewhere; but this time
there was nothing of the kind. Those people sat there as if they
thought, "Good for this day and train only: we must have all there is of
this show, not waste any of it." And he said that when he came down out
of the pulpit more people waited to shake him by the hand and tell him
what a good sermon it was, than ever before. And it seemed a pity that
these people should do these fictions in such a place--right in the
church--when it was quite plain they were not interested in the sermon
at all; they only wanted to get a near view of his head.

Well, Harris said--no, Harris didn't say, _I_ say, that as the days went
on and Sunday followed Sunday, the interest in Harris's hair grew and
grew; because it didn't stay merely and monotonously green, it took on
deeper and deeper shades of green; and then it would change and become
reddish, and would go from that to some other color--purplish,
yellowish, bluish, and so on--but it was never a solid color. It was
always mottled. And each Sunday it was a little more interesting than it
was the Sunday before--and Harris's head became famous, and people came
from New York, and Boston, and South Carolina, and Japan, and so on, to
look. There wasn't seating-capacity for all the people that came while
his head was undergoing these various and fascinating mottlings. And it
was a good thing in several ways, because the business had been
languishing a little, and now a lot of people joined the church so that
they could have the show, and it was the beginning of a prosperity for
that church which has never diminished in all these years.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XV.

BY MARK TWAIN.

[_Dictated October 8, 1906._]

_From Susy's Biography of Me._


     Papa says that if the collera comes here he will take Sour Mash to
     the mountains.


[Sidenote: (1885.)]

This remark about the cat is followed by various entries, covering a
month, in which Jean, General Grant, the sculptor Gerhardt, Mrs. Candace
Wheeler, Miss Dora Wheeler, Mr. Frank Stockton, Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge,
and the widow of General Custer appear and drift in procession across
the page, then vanish forever from the Biography; then Susy drops this
remark in the wake of the vanished procession:


     Sour Mash is a constant source of anxiety, care, and pleasure to
     papa.


I did, in truth, think a great deal of that old tortoise-shell harlot;
but I haven't a doubt that in order to impress Susy I was pretending
agonies of solicitude which I didn't honestly feel. Sour Mash never gave
me any real anxiety; she was always able to take care of herself, and
she was ostentatiously vain of the fact; vain of it to a degree which
often made me ashamed of her, much as I esteemed her.

Many persons would like to have the society of cats during the summer
vacation in the country, but they deny themselves this pleasure because
they think they must either take the cats along when they return to the
city, where they would be a trouble and an encumbrance, or leave them in
the country, houseless and homeless. These people have no ingenuity, no
invention, no wisdom; or it would occur to them to do as I do: rent cats
by the month for the summer and return them to their good homes at the
end of it. Early last May I rented a kitten of a farmer's wife, by the
month; then I got a discount by taking three. They have been good
company for about five months now, and are still kittens--at least they
have not grown much, and to all intents and purposes are still kittens,
and as full of romping energy and enthusiasm as they were in the
beginning. This is remarkable. I am an expert in cats, but I have not
seen a kitten keep its kittenhood nearly so long before.

These are beautiful creatures--these triplets. Two of them wear the
blackest and shiniest and thickest of sealskin vestments all over their
bodies except the lower half of their faces and the terminations of
their paws. The black masks reach down below the eyes, therefore when
the eyes are closed they are not visible; the rest of the face, and the
gloves and stockings, are snow white. These markings are just the same
on both cats--so exactly the same that when you call one the other is
likely to answer, because they cannot tell each other apart. Since the
cats are precisely alike, and can't be told apart by any of us, they do
not need two names, so they have but one between them. We call both of
them Sackcloth, and we call the gray one Ashes. I believe I have never
seen such intelligent cats as these before. They are full of the nicest
discriminations. When I read German aloud they weep; you can see the
tears run down. It shows what pathos there is in the German tongue. I
had not noticed before that all German is pathetic, no matter what the
subject is nor how it is treated. It was these humble observers that
brought the knowledge to me. I have tried all kinds of German on these
cats; romance, poetry, philosophy, theology, market reports; and the
result has always been the same--the cats sob, and let the tears run
down, which shows that all German is pathetic. French is not a familiar
tongue to me, and the pronunciation is difficult, and comes out of me
encumbered with a Missouri accent; but the cats like it, and when I make
impassioned speeches in that language they sit in a row and put up their
paws, palm to palm, and frantically give thanks. Hardly any cats are
affected by music, but these are; when I sing they go reverently away,
showing how deeply they feel it. Sour Mash never cared for these things.
She had many noble qualities, but at bottom she was not refined, and
cared little or nothing for theology and the arts.

It is a pity to say it, but these cats are not above the grade of human
beings, for I know by certain signs that they are not sincere in their
exhibitions of emotion, but exhibit them merely to show off and attract
attention--conduct which is distinctly human, yet with a difference:
they do not know enough to conceal their desire to show off, but the
grown human being does. What is ambition? It is only the desire to be
conspicuous. The desire for fame is only the desire to be continuously
conspicuous and attract attention and be talked about.

These cats are like human beings in another way: when Ashes began to
work his fictitious emotions, and show off, the other members of the
firm followed suit, in order to be in the fashion. That is the way with
human beings; they are afraid to be outside; whatever the fashion
happens to be, they conform to it, whether it be a pleasant fashion or
the reverse, they lacking the courage to ignore it and go their own way.
All human beings would like to dress in loose and comfortable and highly
colored and showy garments, and they had their desire until a century
ago, when a king, or some other influential ass, introduced sombre hues
and discomfort and ugly designs into masculine clothing. The meek public
surrendered to the outrage, and by consequence we are in that odious
captivity to-day, and are likely to remain in it for a long time to
come.

Fortunately the women were not included in the disaster, and so their
graces and their beauty still have the enhancing help of delicate
fabrics and varied and beautiful colors. Their clothing makes a great
opera audience an enchanting spectacle, a delight to the eye and the
spirit, a Garden of Eden for charm and color. The men, clothed in dismal
black, are scattered here and there and everywhere over the Garden, like
so many charred stumps, and they damage the effect, but cannot
annihilate it.

In summer we poor creatures have a respite, and may clothe ourselves in
white garments; loose, soft, and in some degree shapely; but in the
winter--the sombre winter, the depressing winter, the cheerless winter,
when white clothes and bright colors are especially needed to brighten
our spirits and lift them up--we all conform to the prevailing insanity,
and go about in dreary black, each man doing it because the others do
it, and not because he wants to. They are really no sincerer than
Sackcloth and Ashes. At bottom the Sackcloths do not care to exhibit
their emotions when I am performing before them, they only do it because
Ashes started it.

I would like to dress in a loose and flowing costume made all of silks
and velvets, resplendent with all the stunning dyes of the rainbow, and
so would every sane man I have ever known; but none of us dares to
venture it. There is such a thing as carrying conspicuousness to the
point of discomfort; and if I should appear on Fifth Avenue on a Sunday
morning, at church-time, clothed as I would like to be clothed, the
churches would be vacant, and I should have all the congregations
tagging after me, to look, and secretly envy, and publicly scoff. It is
the way human beings are made; they are always keeping their real
feelings shut up inside, and publicly exploiting their fictitious ones.

Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, when the
summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and comfortable white
clothes and enter for the winter into the depressing captivity of the
shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the
weather is growing cold up here in the New Hampshire hills, but it will
not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the
neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a
brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a
crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might
take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished
and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in
the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuously, all
solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and
I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten
minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings
I had brought.

I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good
many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted
to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage
enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It
will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps
the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every
scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my
lead.

That mention that I have acquired new and great privileges by grace of
my age, is not an uncalculated remark. When I passed the seventieth
mile-stone, ten months ago, I instantly realized that I had entered a
new country and a new atmosphere. To all the public I was become
recognizably old, undeniably old; and from that moment everybody assumed
a new attitude toward me--the reverent attitude granted by custom to
age--and straightway the stream of generous new privileges began to flow
in upon me and refresh my life. Since then, I have lived an ideal
existence; and I now believe what Choate said last March, and which at
the time I didn't credit: that the best of life begins at seventy; for
then your work is done; you know that you have done your best, let the
quality of the work be what it may; that you have earned your holiday--a
holiday of peace and contentment--and that thenceforth, to the setting
of your sun, nothing will break it, nothing interrupt it.

[_Dictated January 22, 1907._] In an earlier chapter I inserted some
verses beginning "Love Came at Dawn" which had been found among Susy's
papers after her death. I was not able to say that they were hers, but I
judged that they might be, for the reason that she had not enclosed them
in quotation marks according to her habit when storing up treasures
gathered from other people. Stedman was not able to determine the
authorship for me, as the verses were new to him, but the authorship has
now been traced. The verses were written by William Wilfred Campbell, a
Canadian poet, and they form a part of the contents of his book called
"Beyond the Hills of Dream."

The authorship of the beautiful lines which my wife and I inscribed upon
Susy's gravestone was untraceable for a time. We had found them in a
book in India, but had lost the book and with it the author's name. But
in time an application to the editor of "Notes and Queries" furnished me
the author's name,[7] and it has been added to the verses upon the
gravestone.

Last night, at a dinner-party where I was present, Mr. Peter Dunne
Dooley handed to the host several dollars, in satisfaction of a lost
bet. I seemed to see an opportunity to better my condition, and I
invited Dooley, apparently disinterestedly, to come to my house Friday
and play billiards. He accepted, and I judge that there is going to be a
deficit in the Dooley treasury as a result. In great qualities of the
heart and brain, Dooley is gifted beyond all propriety. He is brilliant;
he is an expert with his pen, and he easily stands at the head of all
the satirists of this generation--but he is going to walk in darkness
Friday afternoon. It will be a fraternal kindness to teach him that with
all his light and culture, he does not know all the valuable things; and
it will also be a fraternal kindness to him to complete his education
for him--and I shall do this on Friday, and send him home in that
perfected condition.

I possess a billiard secret which can be valuable to the Dooley sept,
after I shall have conferred it upon Dooley--for a consideration. It is
a discovery which I made by accident, thirty-eight years ago, in my
father-in-law's house in Elmira. There was a scarred and battered and
ancient billiard-table in the garret, and along with it a peck of
checked and chipped balls, and a rackful of crooked and headless cues. I
played solitaire up there every day with that difficult outfit. The
table was not level, but slanted sharply to the southeast; there wasn't
a ball that was round, or would complete the journey you started it on,
but would always get tired and stop half-way and settle, with a jolty
wabble, to a standstill on its chipped side. I tried making counts with
four balls, but found it difficult and discouraging, so I added a fifth
ball, then a sixth, then a seventh, and kept on adding until at last I
had twelve balls on the table and a thirteenth to play with. My game was
caroms--caroms solely--caroms plain, or caroms with cushion to
help--anything that could furnish a count. In the course of time I found
to my astonishment that I was never able to run fifteen, under any
circumstances. By huddling the balls advantageously in the beginning, I
could now and then coax fourteen out of them, but I couldn't reach
fifteen by either luck or skill. Sometimes the balls would get scattered
into difficult positions and defeat me in that way; sometimes if I
managed to keep them together, I would freeze; and always when I froze,
and had to play away from the contact, there was sure to be nothing to
play at but a wide and uninhabited vacancy.

One day Mr. Dalton called on my brother-in-law, on a matter of business,
and I was asked if I could entertain him awhile, until my brother-in-law
should finish an engagement with another gentleman. I said I could, and
took him up to the billiard-table. I had played with him many times at
the club, and knew that he could play billiards tolerably well--only
tolerably well--but not any better than I could. He and I were just a
match. He didn't know our table; he didn't know those balls; he didn't
know those warped and headless cues; he didn't know the southeastern
slant of the table, and how to allow for it. I judged it would be safe
and profitable to offer him a bet on my scheme. I emptied the avalanche
of thirteen balls on the table and said:

"Take a ball and begin, Mr. Dalton. How many can you run with an outlay
like that?"

He said, with the half-affronted air of a mathematician who has been
asked how much of the multiplication table he can recite without a
break:

"I suppose a million--eight hundred thousand, anyway."

I said "You shall hove the privilege of placing the balls to suit
yourself, and I want to bet you a dollar that you can't run fifteen."

I will not dwell upon the sequel. At the end of an hour his face was
red, and wet with perspiration; his outer garments lay scattered here
and there over the place; he was the angriest man in the State, and
there wasn't a rag or remnant of an injurious adjective left in him
anywhere--and I had all his small change.

When the summer was over, we went home to Hartford, and one day Mr.
George Robertson arrived from Boston with two or three hours to spare
between then and the return train, and as he was a young gentleman to
whom we were in debt for much social pleasure, it was my duty, and a
welcome duty, to make his two or three hours interesting for him. So I
took him up-stairs and set up my billiard scheme for his comfort. Mine
was a good table, in perfect repair; the cues were in perfect condition;
the balls were ivory, and flawless--but I knew that Mr. Robertson was my
prey, just the same, for by exhaustive tests with this outfit I had
found that my limit was thirty-one. I had proved to my satisfaction that
whereas I could not fairly expect to get more than six or eight or a
dozen caroms out of a run, I could now and then reach twenty and
twenty-five, and after a long procession of failures finally achieve a
run of thirty-one; but in no case had I ever got beyond thirty-one.
Robertson's game, as I knew, was a little better than mine, so I
resolved to require him to make thirty-two. I believed it would
entertain him. He was one of these brisk and hearty and cheery and
self-satisfied young fellows who are brimful of confidence, and who
plunge with grateful eagerness into any enterprise that offers a showy
test of their abilities. I emptied the balls on the table and said,

"Take a cue and a ball, George, and begin. How many caroms do you think
you can make out of that layout?"

He laughed the laugh of the gay and the care-free, as became his youth
and inexperience, and said,

"I can punch caroms out of that bunch a week without a break."

I said "Place the balls to suit yourself, and begin."

Confidence is a necessary thing in billiards, but overconfidence is bad.
George went at his task with much too much lightsomeness of spirit and
disrespect for the situation. On his first shot he scored three caroms;
on his second shot he scored four caroms; and on his third shot he
missed as simple a carom as could be devised. He was very much
astonished, and said he would not have supposed that careful play could
be needed with an acre of bunched balls in front of a person.

He began again, and played more carefully, but still with too much
lightsomeness; he couldn't seem to learn to take the situation
seriously. He made about a dozen caroms and broke down. He was irritated
with himself now, and he thought he caught me laughing. He didn't. I do
not laugh publicly at my client when this game is going on; I only do it
inside--or save it for after the exhibition is over. But he thought he
had caught me laughing, and it increased his irritation. Of course I
knew he thought I was laughing privately--for I was experienced; they
all think that, and it has a good effect; it sharpens their annoyance
and debilitates their play.

He made another trial and failed. Once more he was astonished; once more
he was humiliated--and as for his anger, it rose to summer-heat. He
arranged the balls again, grouping them carefully, and said he would win
this time, or die. When a client reaches this condition, it is a good
time to damage his nerve further, and this can always be done by saying
some little mocking thing or other that has the outside appearance of a
friendly remark--so I employed this art. I suggested that a bet might
tauten his nerves, and that I would offer one, but that as I did not
want it to be an expense to him, but only a help, I would make it
small--a cigar, if he were willing--a cigar that he would fail again;
not an expensive one, but a cheap native one, of the Crown Jewel breed,
such as is manufactured in Hartford for the clergy. It set him afire all
over! I could see the blue flame issue from his eyes. He said,

"Make it a hundred!--and no Connecticut cabbage-leaf product, but
Havana, $25 the box!"

I took him up, but said I was sorry to see him do this, because it did
not seem to me right or fair for me to rob him under our own roof, when
he had been so kind to us. He said, with energy and acrimony:

"You take care of your own pocket, if you'll be so good, and leave me to
take care of mine."

And he plunged at the congress of balls with a vindictiveness which was
infinitely contenting to me. He scored a failure--and began to undress.
I knew it would come to that, for he was in the condition now that Mr.
Dooley will be in at about that stage of the contest on Friday
afternoon. A clothes-rack will be provided for Mr. Dooley to hang his
things on as fast as he shall from time to time shed them. George raised
his voice four degrees and flung out the challenge--

"Double or quits!"

"Done," I responded, in the gentle and compassionate voice of one who is
apparently getting sorrier and sorrier.

There was an hour and a half of straight disaster after that, and if it
was a sin to enjoy it, it is no matter--I did enjoy it. It is half a
lifetime ago, but I enjoy it yet, every time I think of it George made
failure after failure. His fury increased with each failure as he
scored it. With each defeat he flung off one or another rag of his
raiment, and every time he started on a fresh inning he made it "double
or quits" once more. Twice he reached thirty and broke down; once he
reached thirty-one and broke down. These "nears" made him frantic, and I
believe I was never so happy in my life, except the time, a few years
later, when the Rev. J. H. Twichell and I walked to Boston and he had
the celebrated conversation with the hostler at the Inn at Ashford,
Connecticut.

At last, when we were notified that Patrick was at the door to drive him
to his train, George owed me five thousand cigars at twenty-five cents
apiece, and I was so sorry I could have hugged him. But he shouted,

"Give me ten minutes more!" and added stormily, "it's double or quits
again, and I'll win out free of debt or owe you ten thousand cigars, and
you'll pay the funeral expenses."

He began on his final effort, and I believe that in all my experience
among both amateurs and experts, I have never seen a cue so carefully
handled in my lifetime as George handled his upon this intensely
interesting occasion. He got safely up to twenty-five, and then ceased
to breathe. So did I. He labored along, and added a point, another
point, still another point, and finally reached thirty-one. He stopped
there, and we took a breath. By this time the balls were scattered all
down the cushions, about a foot or two apart, and there wasn't a shot in
sight anywhere that any man might hope to make. In a burst of anger and
confessed defeat, he sent his ball flying around the table at random,
and it crotched a ball that was packed against the cushion and sprang
across to a ball against the bank on the opposite side, and counted!

His luck had set him free, and he didn't owe me anything. He had used up
all his spare time, but we carried his clothes to the carriage, and he
dressed on his way to the station, greatly wondered at and admired by
the ladies, as he drove along--but he got his train.

I am very fond of Mr. Dooley, and shall await his coming with
affectionate and pecuniary interest.

_P.S. Saturday._ He has been here. Let us not talk about it.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XVI.

BY MARK TWAIN.


[_Dictated January 12th, 1905._] ... But I am used to having my
statements discounted. My mother began it before I was seven years old.
Yet all through my life my facts have had a substratum of truth, and
therefore they were not without preciousness. Any person who is familiar
with me knows how to strike my average, and therefore knows how to get
at the jewel of any fact of mine and dig it out of its blue-clay matrix.
My mother knew that art. When I was seven or eight, or ten, or twelve
years old--along there--a neighbor said to her,

"Do you ever believe anything that that boy says?"

My mother said,

"He is the well-spring of truth, but you can't bring up the whole well
with one bucket"--and she added, "I know his average, therefore he never
deceives me. I discount him thirty per cent. for embroidery, and what is
left is perfect and priceless truth, without a flaw in it anywhere."

Now to make a jump of forty years, without breaking the connection: that
word "embroidery" was used again in my presence and concerning me, when
I was fifty years old, one night at Rev. Frank Goodwin's house in
Hartford, at a meeting of the Monday Evening Club. The Monday Evening
Club still exists. It was founded about forty-five years ago by that
theological giant, Rev. Dr. Bushnell, and some comrades of his, men of
large intellectual calibre and more or less distinction, local or
national. I was admitted to membership in it in the fall of 1871 and was
an active member thenceforth until I left Hartford in the summer of
1891. The membership was restricted, in those days, to eighteen--
possibly twenty. The meetings began about the 1st of October and were
held in the private houses of the members every fortnight thereafter
throughout the cold months until the 1st of May. Usually there were a
dozen members present--sometimes as many as fifteen. There was an essay
and a discussion. The essayists followed each other in alphabetical
order through the season. The essayist could choose his own subject and
talk twenty minutes on it, from MS. or orally, according to his
preference. Then the discussion followed, and each member present was
allowed ten minutes in which to express his views. The wives of these
people were always present. It was their privilege. It was also their
privilege to keep still; they were not allowed to throw any light upon
the discussion. After the discussion there was a supper, and talk, and
cigars. This supper began at ten o'clock promptly, and the company broke
up and went away at midnight. At least they did except upon one
occasion. In my recent Birthday speech I remarked upon the fact that I
have always bought cheap cigars, and that is true. I have never bought
costly ones.

Well, that night at the Club meeting--as I was saying--George, our
colored butler, came to me when the supper was nearly over, and I
noticed that he was pale. Normally his complexion was a clear black, and
very handsome, but now it had modified to old amber. He said:

"Mr. Clemens, what are we going to do? There is not a cigar in the house
but those old Wheeling long nines. Can't nobody smoke them but you. They
kill at thirty yards. It is too late to telephone--we couldn't get any
cigars out from town--what can we do? Ain't it best to say nothing, and
let on that we didn't think?"

"No," I said, "that would not be honest. Fetch out the long
nines"--which he did.

I had just come across those "long nines" a few days or a week before. I
hadn't seen a long nine for years. When I was a cub pilot on the
Mississippi in the late '50's, I had had a great affection for them,
because they were not only--to my mind--perfect, but you could get a
basketful of them for a cent--or a dime, they didn't use cents out there
in those days. So when I saw them advertised in Hartford I sent for a
thousand at once. They came out to me in badly battered and
disreputable-looking old square pasteboard boxes, two hundred in a box.
George brought a box, which was caved in on all sides, looking the worst
it could, and began to pass them around. The conversation had been
brilliantly animated up to that moment--but now a frost fell upon the
company. That is to say, not all of a sudden, but the frost fell upon
each man as he took up a cigar and held it poised in the air--and there,
in the middle, his sentence broke off. That kind of thing went on all
around the table, until when George had completed his crime the whole
place was full of a thick solemnity and silence.

Those men began to light the cigars. Rev. Dr. Parker was the first man
to light. He took three or four heroic whiffs--then gave it up. He got
up with the remark that he had to go to the bedside of a sick
parishioner. He started out. Rev. Dr. Burton was the next man. He took
only one whiff, and followed Parker. He furnished a pretext, and you
could see by the sound of his voice that he didn't think much of the
pretext, and was vexed with Parker for getting in ahead with a
fictitious ailing client. Rev. Mr. Twichell followed, and said he had to
go now because he must take the midnight train for Boston. Boston was
the first place that occurred to him, I suppose.

It was only a quarter to eleven when they began to distribute pretexts.
At ten minutes to eleven all those people were out of the house. When
nobody was left but George and me I was cheerful--I had no compunctions
of conscience, no griefs of any kind. But George was beyond speech,
because he held the honor and credit of the family above his own, and he
was ashamed that this smirch had been put upon it. I told him to go to
bed and try to sleep it off. I went to bed myself. At breakfast in the
morning when George was passing a cup of coffee, I saw it tremble in his
hand. I knew by that sign that there was something on his mind. He
brought the cup to me and asked impressively,

"Mr. Clemens, how far is it from the front door to the upper gate?"

I said, "It is a hundred and twenty-five steps."

He said, "Mr. Clemens, you can start at the front door and you can go
plumb to the upper gate and tread on one of them cigars every time."

It wasn't true in detail, but in essentials it was.

The subject under discussion on the night in question was Dreams. The
talk passed from mouth to mouth in the usual serene way.

I do not now remember what form my views concerning dreams took at the
time. I don't remember now what my notion about dreams was then, but I
do remember telling a dream by way of illustrating some detail of my
speech, and I also remember that when I had finished it Rev. Dr. Burton
made that doubting remark which contained that word I have already
spoken of as having been uttered by my mother, in some such connection,
forty or fifty years before. I was probably engaged in trying to make
those people believe that now and then, by some accident, or otherwise,
a dream which was prophetic turned up in the dreamer's mind. The date of
my memorable dream was about the beginning of May, 1858. It was a
remarkable dream, and I had been telling it several times every year for
more than fifteen years--and now I was telling it again, here in the
club.

In 1858 I was a steersman on board the swift and popular New Orleans and
St. Louis packet, "Pennsylvania," Captain Kleinfelter. I had been lent
to Mr. Brown, one of the pilots of the "Pennsylvania," by my owner, Mr.
Horace E. Bixby, and I had been steering for Brown about eighteen
months, I think. Then in the early days of May, 1858, came a tragic
trip--the last trip of that fleet and famous steamboat. I have told all
about it in one of my books called "Old Times on the Mississippi." But
it is not likely that I told the dream in that book. It is impossible
that I can ever have published it, I think, because I never wanted my
mother to know about the dream, and she lived several years after I
published that volume.

I had found a place on the "Pennsylvania" for my brother Henry, who was
two years my junior. It was not a place of profit, it was only a place
of promise. He was "mud" clerk. Mud clerks received no salary, but they
were in the line of promotion. They could become, presently, third clerk
and second clerk, then chief clerk--that is to say, purser. The dream
begins when Henry had been mud clerk about three months. We were lying
in port at St. Louis. Pilots and steersmen had nothing to do during the
three days that the boat lay in port in St. Louis and New Orleans, but
the mud clerk had to begin his labors at dawn and continue them into the
night, by the light of pine-knot torches. Henry and I, moneyless and
unsalaried, had billeted ourselves upon our brother-in-law, Mr. Moffet,
as night lodgers while in port. We took our meals on board the boat. No,
I mean _I_ lodged at the house, not Henry. He spent the _evenings_ at
the house, from nine until eleven, then went to the boat to be ready for
his early duties. On the night of the dream he started away at eleven,
shaking hands with the family, and said good-by according to custom. I
may mention that hand-shaking as a good-by was not merely the custom of
that family, but the custom of the region--the custom of Missouri, I may
say. In all my life, up to that time, I had never seen one member of the
Clemens family kiss another one--except once. When my father lay dying
in our home in Hannibal--the 24th of March, 1847--he put his arm around
my sister's neck and drew her down and kissed her, saying "Let me die."
I remember that, and I remember the death rattle which swiftly followed
those words, which were his last. These good-bys of Henry's were always
executed in the family sitting-room on the second floor, and Henry went
from that room and down-stairs without further ceremony. But this time
my mother went with him to the head of the stairs and said good-by
_again_. As I remember it she was moved to this by something in Henry's
manner, and she remained at the head of the stairs while he descended.
When he reached the door he hesitated, and climbed the stairs and shook
hands good-by once more.

In the morning, when I awoke I had been dreaming, and the dream was so
vivid, so like reality, that it deceived me, and I thought it was real.
In the dream I had seen Henry a corpse. He lay in a metallic
burial-case. He was dressed in a suit of my clothing, and on his breast
lay a great bouquet of flowers, mainly white roses, with a red rose in
the centre. The casket stood upon a couple of chairs. I dressed, and
moved toward that door, thinking I would go in there and look at it, but
I changed my mind. I thought I could not yet bear to meet my mother. I
thought I would wait awhile and make some preparation for that ordeal.
The house was in Locust Street, a little above 13th, and I walked to
14th, and to the middle of the block beyond, before it suddenly flashed
upon me that there was nothing real about this--it was only a dream. I
can still feel something of the grateful upheaval of joy of that moment,
and I can also still feel the remnant of doubt, the suspicion that maybe
it _was_ real, after all. I returned to the house almost on a run, flew
up the stairs two or three steps at a jump, and rushed into that
sitting-room--and was made glad again, for there was no casket there.

We made the usual eventless trip to New Orleans--no, it was not
eventless, for it was on the way down that I had the fight with Mr.
Brown[8] which resulted in his requiring that I be left ashore at New
Orleans. In New Orleans I always had a job. It was my privilege to watch
the freight-piles from seven in the evening until seven in the morning,
and get three dollars for it. It was a three-night job and occurred
every thirty-five days. Henry always joined my watch about nine in the
evening, when his own duties were ended, and we often walked my rounds
and chatted together until midnight. This time we were to part, and so
the night before the boat sailed I gave Henry some advice. I said, "In
case of disaster to the boat, don't lose your head--leave that unwisdom
to the passengers--they are competent--they'll attend to it. But you
rush for the hurricane-deck, and astern to one of the life-boats lashed
aft the wheel-house, and obey the mate's orders--thus you will be
useful. When the boat is launched, give such help as you can in getting
the women and children into it, and be sure you don't try to get into it
yourself. It is summer weather, the river is only a mile wide, as a
rule, and you can swim that without any trouble." Two or three days
afterward the boat's boilers exploded at Ship Island, below Memphis,
early one morning--and what happened afterward I have already told in
"Old Times on the Mississippi." As related there, I followed the
"Pennsylvania" about a day later, on another boat, and we began to get
news of the disaster at every port we touched at, and so by the time we
reached Memphis we knew all about it.

I found Henry stretched upon a mattress on the floor of a great
building, along with thirty or forty other scalded and wounded persons,
and was promptly informed, by some indiscreet person, that he had
inhaled steam; that his body was badly scalded, and that he would live
but a little while; also, I was told that the physicians and nurses were
giving their whole attention to persons who had a chance of being saved.
They were short-handed in the matter of physicians and nurses; and Henry
and such others as were considered to be fatally hurt were receiving
only such attention as could be spared, from time to time, from the more
urgent cases. But Dr. Peyton, a fine and large-hearted old physician of
great reputation in the community, gave me his sympathy and took
vigorous hold of the case, and in about a week he had brought Henry
around. Dr. Peyton never committed himself with prognostications which
might not materialize, but at eleven o'clock one night he told me that
Henry was out of danger, and would get well. Then he said, "At midnight
these poor fellows lying here and there all over this place will begin
to mourn and mutter and lament and make outcries, and if this commotion
should disturb Henry it will be bad for him; therefore ask the physician
on watch to give him an eighth of a grain of morphine, but this is not
to be done unless Henry shall show signs that he is being disturbed."

Oh well, never mind the rest of it. The physicians on watch were young
fellows hardly out of the medical college, and they made a mistake--they
had no way of measuring the eighth of a grain of morphine, so they
guessed at it and gave him a vast quantity heaped on the end of a
knife-blade, and the fatal effects were soon apparent. I think he died
about dawn, I don't remember as to that. He was carried to the dead-room
and I went away for a while to a citizen's house and slept off some of
my accumulated fatigue--and meantime something was happening. The
coffins provided for the dead were of unpainted white pine, but in this
instance some of the ladies of Memphis had made up a fund of sixty
dollars and bought a metallic case, and when I came back and entered the
dead-room Henry lay in that open case, and he was dressed in a suit of
my clothing. He had borrowed it without my knowledge during our last
sojourn in St. Louis; and I recognized instantly that my dream of
several weeks before was here exactly reproduced, so far as these
details went--and I think I missed one detail; but that one was
immediately supplied, for just then an elderly lady entered the place
with a large bouquet consisting mainly of white roses, and in the centre
of it was a red rose, and she laid it on his breast.

I told the dream there in the Club that night just as I have told it
here.

Rev. Dr. Burton swung his leonine head around, focussed me with his eye,
and said:

"When was it that this happened?"

"In June, '58."

"It is a good many years ago. Have you told it several times since?"

"Yes, I have, a good many times."

"How many?"

"Why, I don't know how many."

"Well, strike an average. How many times a year do you think you have
told it?"

"Well, I have told it as many as six times a year, possibly oftener."

"Very well, then you've told it, we'll say, seventy or eighty times
since it happened?"

"Yes," I said, "that's a conservative estimate."

"Now then, Mark, a very extraordinary thing happened to me a great many
years ago, and I used to tell it a number of times--a good many
times--every year, for it was so wonderful that it always astonished the
hearer, and that astonishment gave me a distinct pleasure every time. I
never suspected that that tale was acquiring any auxiliary advantages
through repetition until one day after I had been telling it ten or
fifteen years it struck me that either I was getting old, and slow in
delivery, or that the tale was longer than it was when it was born.
Mark, I diligently and prayerfully examined that tale with this result:
that I found that its proportions were now, as nearly as I could make
oat, one part fact, straight fact, fact pure and undiluted, golden fact,
and twenty-four parts embroidery. I never told that tale afterwards--I
was never able to tell it again, for I had lost confidence in it, and so
the pleasure of telling it was gone, and gone permanently. How much of
this tale of yours is embroidery?"

"Well," I said, "I don't know. I don't think any of it is embroidery. I
think it is all just as I have stated it, detail by detail."

"Very well," he said, "then it is all right, but I wouldn't tell it any
more; because if you keep on, it will begin to collect embroidery sure.
The safest thing is to stop now."

That was a great many years ago. And to-day is the first time that I
have told that dream since Dr. Burton scared me into fatal doubts about
it. No, I don't believe I can say that. I don't believe that I ever
really had any doubts whatever concerning the salient points of the
dream, for those points are of such a nature that they are _pictures_,
and pictures can be remembered, when they are vivid, much better than
one can remember remarks and unconcreted facts. Although it has been so
many years since I have told that dream, I can see those pictures now
just as clearly defined as if they were before me in this room. I have
not told the entire dream. There was a good deal more of it. I mean I
have not told all that happened in the dream's fulfilment. After the
incident in the death-room I may mention one detail, and that is this.
When I arrived in St. Louis with the casket it was about eight o'clock
in the morning, and I ran to my brother-in-law's place of business,
hoping to find him there, but I missed him, for while I was on the way
to his office he was on his way from the house to the boat. When I got
back to the boat the casket was gone. He had conveyed it out to his
house. I hastened thither, and when I arrived the men were just removing
the casket from the vehicle to carry it up-stairs. I stopped that
procedure, for I did not want my mother to see the dead face, because
one side of it was drawn and distorted by the effects of the opium. When
I went up-stairs, there stood the two chairs--placed to receive the
coffin--just as I had seen them in my dream; and if I had arrived two or
three minutes later, the casket would have been resting upon them,
precisely as in my dream of several weeks before.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XVII.

BY MARK TWAIN.


_From Susy's Biography of Me._


     _Sept. 9, '85._--Mamma is teaching Jean a little natural history
     and is making a little collection of insects for her. But mamma
     does not allow Jean to kill any insects she only collects those
     insects that are found dead. Mamma has told us all, perticularly
     Jean, to bring her all the little dead insects that she finds. The
     other day as we were all sitting at supper Jean broke into the room
     and ran triumfantly up to Mamma and presented her with a plate full
     of dead flies. Mamma thanked Jean vary enthusiastically although
     she with difficulty concealed her amusement. Just then Soar Mash
     entered the room and Jean believing her hungry asked Mamma for
     permission to give her the flies. Mamma laughingly consented and
     the flies almost immediately dissapeared.


[_Monday, October 15, 1906._] Sour Hash's presence indicates that this
adventure occurred at Quarry Farm. Susy's Biography interests itself
pretty exclusively with historical facts; where they happen is not a
matter of much concern to her. When other historians refer to the Bunker
Hill Monument they know it is not necessary to mention that that
monument is in Boston. Susy recognizes that when she mentions Sour Mash
it is not necessary to localize her. To Susy, Sour Mash is the Bunker
Hill Monument of Quarry Farm.

Ordinary cats have some partiality for living flies, but none for dead
ones; but Susy does not trouble herself to apologize for Sour Mash's
eccentricities of taste. This Biography was for _us_, and Susy knew that
nothing that Sour Mash might do could startle us or need explanation, we
being aware that she was not an ordinary cat, but moving upon a plane
far above the prejudices and superstitions which are law to common
catdom.

Once in Hartford the flies were so numerous for a time, and so
troublesome, that Mrs. Clemens conceived the idea of paying George[9] a
bounty on all the flies he might kill. The children saw an opportunity
here for the acquisition of sudden wealth. They supposed that their
mother merely wanted to accumulate dead flies, for some æsthetic or
scientific reason or other, and they judged that the more flies she
could get the happier she would be; so they went into business with
George on a commission. Straightway the dead flies began to arrive in
such quantities that Mrs. Clemens was pleased beyond words with the
success of her idea. Next, she was astonished that one house could
furnish so many. She was paying an extravagantly high bounty, and it
presently began to look as if by this addition to our expenses we were
now probably living beyond our income. After a few days there was peace
and comfort; not a fly was discoverable in the house: there wasn't a
straggler left. Still, to Mrs. Clement's surprise, the dead flies
continued to arrive by the plateful, and the bounty expense was as
crushing as ever. Then she made inquiry, and found that our innocent
little rascals had established a Fly Trust, and had hired all the
children in the neighborhood to collect flies on a cheap and
unburdensome commission.

Mrs. Clemens's experience in this matter was a new one for her, but the
governments of the world had tried it, and wept over it, and discarded
it, every half-century since man was created. Any Government could have
told her that the best way to increase wolves in America, rabbits in
Australia, and snakes in India, is to pay a bounty on their scalps. Then
every patriot goes to raising them.

_From Susy's Biography of Me._


     _Sept. 10, '85._--The other evening Clara and I brought down our
     new soap bubble water and we all blew soap bubles. Papa blew his
     soap bubles and filled them with tobacco smoke and as the light
     shone on then they took very beautiful opaline colors. Papa would
     hold them and then let us catch them in our hand and they felt
     delightful to the touch the mixture of the smoke and water had a
     singularly pleasant effect.


It is human life. We are blown upon the world; we float buoyantly upon
the summer air a little while, complacently showing off our grace of
form and our dainty iridescent colors; then we vanish with a little
puff, leaving nothing behind but a memory--and sometimes not even that.
I suppose that at those solemn times when we wake in the deeps of the
night and reflect, there is not one of us who is not willing to confess
that he is really only a soap-bubble, and as little worth the making.

I remember those days of twenty-one years ago, and a certain pathos
clings about them. Susy, with her manifold young charms and her
iridescent mind, was as lovely a bubble as any we made that day--and as
transitory. She passed, as they passed, in her youth and beauty, and
nothing of her is left but a heartbreak and a memory. That long-vanished
day came vividly back to me a few weeks ago when, for the first time in
twenty-one years, I found myself again amusing a child with
smoke-charged soap-bubbles.

[Sidenote: (1885.)]

Susy's next date is November 29th, 1885, the eve of my fiftieth
birthday. It seems a good while ago. I must have been rather young for
my age then, for I was trying to tame an old-fashioned bicycle nine feet
high. It is to me almost unbelievable, at my present stage of life, that
there have really been people willing to trust themselves upon a dizzy
and unstable altitude like that, and that I was one of them. Twichell
and I took lessons every day. He succeeded, and became a master of the
art of riding that wild vehicle, but I had no gift in that direction and
was never able to stay on mine long enough to get any satisfactory view
of the planet. Every time I tried to steal a look at a pretty girl, or
any other kind of scenery, that single moment of inattention gave the
bicycle the chance it had been waiting for, and I went over the front of
it and struck the ground on my head or my back before I had time to
realise that something was happening. I didn't always go over the front
way; I had other ways, and practised them all; but no matter which way
was chosen for me there was always one monotonous result--the bicycle
skinned my leg and leaped up into the air and came down on top of me.
Sometimes its wires were so sprung by this violent performance that it
had the collapsed look of an umbrella that had had a misunderstanding
with a cyclone. After each day's practice I arrived at home with my skin
hanging in ribbons, from my knees down. I plastered the ribbons on where
they belonged, and bound them there with handkerchiefs steeped in Pond's
Extract, and was ready for more adventures next day. It was always a
surprise to me that I had so much skin, and that it held out so well.
There was always plenty, and I soon came to understand that the supply
was going to remain sufficient for all my needs. It turned out that I
had nine skins, in layers, one on top of the other like the leaves of a
book, and some of the doctors said it was quite remarkable.

I was full of enthusiasm over this insane amusement. My teacher was a
young German from the bicycle factory, a gentle, kindly, patient
creature, with a pathetically grave face. He never smiled; he never made
a remark; he always gathered me tenderly up when I plunged off, and
helped me on again without a word. When he had been teaching me twice a
day for three weeks I introduced a new gymnastic--one that he had never
seen before--and so at last a compliment was wrung from him, a thing
which I had been risking my life for days to achieve. He gathered me up
and said mournfully: "Mr. Clemens, you can fall off a bicycle in more
different ways than any person I ever saw before."

[Sidenote: (1849.)]

A boy's life is not all comedy; much of the tragic enters into it. The
drunken tramp--mentioned in "Tom Sawyer" or "Huck Finn"--who was burned
up in the village jail, lay upon my conscience a hundred nights
afterward and filled them with hideous dreams--dreams in which I saw his
appealing face as I had seen it in the pathetic reality, pressed against
the window-bars, with the red hell glowing behind him--a face which
seemed to say to me, "If you had not give me the matches, this would not
have happened; you are responsible for my death." I was _not_
responsible for it, for I had meant him no harm, but only good, when I
let him have the matches; but no matter, mine was a trained Presbyterian
conscience, and knew but the one duty--to hunt and harry its slave upon
all pretexts and on all occasions; particularly when there was no sense
or reason in it. The tramp--who was to blame--suffered ten minutes; I,
who was not to blame, suffered three months.

The shooting down of poor old Smarr in the main street[10] at noonday
supplied me with some more dreams; and in them I always saw again the
grotesque closing picture--the great family Bible spread open on the
profane old man's breast by some thoughtful idiot, and rising and
sinking to the labored breathings, and adding the torture of its leaden
weight to the dying struggles. We are curiously made. In all the throng
of gaping and sympathetic onlookers there was not one with common sense
enough to perceive that an anvil would have been in better taste there
than the Bible, less open to sarcastic criticism, and swifter in its
atrocious work. In my nightmares I gasped and struggled for breath under
the crush of that vast book for many a night.

All within the space of a couple of years we had two or three other
tragedies, and I had the ill-luck to be too near by on each occasion.
There was the slave man who was struck down with a chunk of slag for
some small offence; I saw him die. And the young California emigrant who
was stabbed with a bowie knife by a drunken comrade: I saw the red life
gush from his breast. And the case of the rowdy young Hyde brothers and
their harmless old uncle: one of them held the old man down with his
knees on his breast while the other one tried repeatedly to kill him
with an Allen revolver which wouldn't go off. I happened along just
then, of course.

Then there was the case of the young California emigrant who got drunk
and proposed to raid the "Welshman's house" all alone one dark and
threatening night.[11] This house stood half-way up Holliday's Hill
("Cardiff" Hill), and its sole occupants were a poor but quite
respectable widow and her young and blameless daughter. The invading
ruffian woke the whole village with his ribald yells and coarse
challenges and obscenities. I went up there with a comrade--John Briggs,
I think--to look and listen. The figure of the man was dimly risible;
the women were on their porch, but not visible in the deep shadow of its
roof, but we heard the elder woman's voice. She had loaded an old musket
with slugs, and she warned the man that if he stayed where he was while
she counted ten it would cost him his life. She began to count, slowly:
he began to laugh. He stopped laughing at "six"; then through the deep
stillness, in a steady voice, followed the rest of the tale: "seven ...
eight ... nine"--a long pause, we holding our breath--"ten!" A red spout
of flame gushed out into the night, and the man dropped, with his breast
riddled to rags. Then the rain and the thunder burst loose and the
waiting town swarmed up the hill in the glare of the lightning like an
invasion of ants. Those people saw the rest; I had had my share and was
satisfied. I went home to dream, and was not disappointed.

My teaching and training enabled me to see deeper into these tragedies
than an ignorant person could have done. I knew what they were for. I
tried to disguise it from myself, but down in the secret deeps of my
heart I knew--and I _knew_ that I knew. They were inventions of
Providence to beguile me to a better life. It sounds curiously innocent
and conceited, now, but to me there was nothing strange about it; it was
quite in accordance with the thoughtful and judicious ways of Providence
as I understood them. It would not have surprised me, nor even
over-flattered me, if Providence had killed off that whole community in
trying to save an asset like me. Educated as I had been, it would have
seemed just the thing, and well worth the expense. _Why_ Providence
should take such an anxious interest in such a property--that idea never
entered my head, and there was no one in that simple hamlet who would
have dreamed of putting it there. For one thing, no one was equipped
with it.

It is quite true I took all the tragedies to myself; and tallied them
off, in turn as they happened, saying to myself in each case, with a
sigh, "Another one gone--and on my account; this ought to bring me to
repentance; His patience will not always endure." And yet privately I
believed it would. That is, I believed it in the daytime; but not in the
night. With the going down of the sun my faith failed, and the clammy
fears gathered about my heart. It was then that I repented. Those were
awful nights, nights of despair, nights charged with the bitterness of
death. After each tragedy I recognized the warning and repented;
repented and begged; begged like a coward, begged like a dog; and not in
the interest of those poor people who had been extinguished for my sake,
but only in my own interest. It seems selfish, when I look back on it
now.

My repentances were very real, very earnest; and after each tragedy they
happened every night for a long time. But as a rule they could not stand
the daylight. They faded out and shredded away and disappeared in the
glad splendor of the sun. They were the creatures of fear and darkness,
and they could not live out of their own place. The day gave me cheer
and peace, and at night I repented again. In all my boyhood life I am
not sure that I ever tried to lead a better life in the daytime--or
wanted to. In my age I should never think of wishing to do such a thing.
But in my age, as in my youth, night brings me many a deep remorse. I
realize that from the cradle up I have been like the rest of the
race--never quite sane in the night. When "Injun Joe" died.[12] ... But
never mind: in another chapter I have already described what a raging
hell of repentance I passed through then. I believe that for months I
was as pure as the driven snow. After dark.

It was back in those far-distant days--1848 or '9--that Jim Wolf came to
us. He was from Shelbyville, a hamlet thirty or forty miles back in the
country, and he brought all his native sweetnesses and gentlenesses and
simplicities with him. He was approaching seventeen, a grave and slender
lad, trustful, honest, a creature to love and cling to. And he was
incredibly bashful.

It is to this kind that untoward things happen. My sister gave a
"candy-pull" on a winter's night. I was too young to be of the company,
and Jim was too diffident. I was sent up to bed early, and Jim followed
of his own motion. His room was in the new part of the house, and his
window looked out on the roof of the L annex. That roof was six inches
deep in snow, and the snow had an ice-crust upon it which was as slick
as glass. Out of the comb of the roof projected a short chimney, a
common resort for sentimental cats on moonlight nights--and this was a
moonlight night. Down at the eaves, below the chimney, a canopy of dead
vines spread away to some posts, making a cozy shelter, and after an
hour or two the rollicking crowd of young ladies and gentlemen grouped
themselves in its shade, with their saucers of liquid and piping-hot
candy disposed about them on the frozen ground to cool. There was joyous
chaffing and joking and laughter--peal upon peal of it.

About this time a couple of old disreputable tom-cats got up on the
chimney and started a heated argument about something; also about this
time I gave up trying to get to sleep, and went visiting to Jim's room.
He was awake and fuming about the cats and their intolerable yowling. I
asked him, mockingly, why he didn't climb out and drive them away. He
was nettled, and said over-boldly that for two cents he _would_.

It was a rash remark, and was probably repented of before it was fairly
out of his mouth. But it was too late--he was committed. I knew him; and
I knew he would rather break his neck than back down, if I egged him on
judiciously.

"Oh, of course you would! Who's doubting it?"

It galled him, and he burst out, with sharp irritation--

"Maybe _you_ doubt it!"

"I? Oh no, I shouldn't think of such a thing. You are always doing
wonderful things. With your mouth."

He was in a passion, now. He snatched on his yarn socks and began to
raise the window, saying in a voice unsteady with anger--

"_You_ think I dasn't--_you_ do! Think what you blame please--_I_ don't
care what you think. I'll show you!"

The window made him rage; it wouldn't stay up. I said--

"Never mind, I'll hold it."

Indeed, I would have done anything to help. I was only a boy, and was
already in a radiant heaven of anticipation. He climbed carefully out,
clung to the window-sill until his feet were safely placed, then began
to pick his perilous way on all fours along the glassy comb, a foot and
a hand on each side of it. I believe I enjoy it now as much as I did
then: yet it is a good deal over fifty years ago. The frosty breeze
flapped his short shirt about his lean legs; the crystal roof shone like
polished marble in the intense glory of the moon; the unconscious cats
sat erect upon the chimney, alertly watching each other, lashing their
tails and pouring out their hollow grievances; and slowly and
cautiously Jim crept on, flapping as he went, the gay and frolicsome
young creatures under the vine-canopy unaware, and outraging these
solemnities with their misplaced laughter. Every time Jim slipped I had
a hope; but always on he crept and disappointed it. At last he was
within reaching distance. He paused, raised himself carefully up,
measured his distance deliberately, then made a frantic grab at the
nearest cat--and missed. Of course he lost his balance. His heels flew
up, he struck on his back, and like a rocket he darted down the roof
feet first, crashed through the dead vines and landed in a sitting
posture in fourteen saucers of red-hot candy, in the midst of all that
party--and dressed as _he_ was: this lad who could not look a girl in
the face with his clothes on. There was a wild scramble and a storm of
shrieks, and Jim fled up the stairs, dripping broken crockery all the
way.

[Sidenote: (1867.)]

The incident was ended. But I was not done with it yet, though I
supposed I was. Eighteen or twenty years later I arrived in New York
from California, and by that time I had failed in all my other
undertakings and had stumbled into literature without intending it. This
was early in 1867. I was offered a large sum to write something for the
"Sunday Mercury," and I answered with the tale of "Jim Wolf and the
Cats." I also collected the money for it--twenty-five dollars. It seemed
over-pay, but I did not say anything about that, for I was not so
scrupulous then as I am now.

A year or two later "Jim Wolf and the Cats" appeared in a Tennessee
paper in a new dress--as to spelling; spelling borrowed from Artemus
Ward. The appropriator of the tale had a wide reputation in the West,
and was exceedingly popular. Deservedly so, I think. He wrote some of
the breeziest and funniest things I have ever read, and did his work
with distinguished ease and fluency. His name has passed out of my
memory.

A couple of years went by; then the original story--my own
version--cropped up again and went floating around in the spelling, and
with my name to it. Soon first one paper and then another fell upon me
rigorously for "stealing" Jim Wolf and the Cats from the Tennessee man.
I got a merciless beating, but I did not mind it. It's all in the game.
Besides, I had learned, a good while before that, that it is not wise to
keep the fire going under a slander unless you can get some large
advantage out of keeping it alive. Few slanders can stand the wear of
silence.

[Sidenote: (1873.)]

[Sidenote: (1900.)]

But I was not done with Jim and the Cats yet. In 1873 I was lecturing in
London, in the Queen's Concert Rooms, Hanover Square, and was living at
the Langham Hotel, Portland place. I had no domestic household, and no
official household except George Dolby, lecture-agent, and Charles
Warren Stoddard, the California poet, now (1900) Professor of English
Literature in the Roman Catholic University, Washington. Ostensibly
Stoddard was my private secretary; in reality he was merely my
comrade--I hired him in order to have his company. As secretary there
was nothing for him to do except to scrap-book the daily reports of the
great trial of the Tichborne Claimant for perjury. But he made a
sufficient job out of that, for the reports filled six columns a day and
he usually postponed the scrap-booking until Sunday; then he had 36
columns to cut out and paste in--a proper labor for Hercules. He did his
work well, but if he had been older and feebler it would have killed him
once a week. Without doubt he does his literary lectures well, but also
without doubt he prepares them fifteen minutes before he is due on his
platform and thus gets into them a freshness and sparkle which they
might lack if they underwent the staling process of overstudy.

He was good company when he was awake. He was refined, sensitive,
charming, gentle, generous, honest himself and unsuspicious of other
people's honesty, and I think he was the purest male I have known, in
mind and speech. George Dolby was something of a contrast to him, but
the two were very friendly and sociable together, nevertheless. Dolby
was large and ruddy, full of life and strength and spirits, a tireless
and energetic talker, and always overflowing with good-nature and
bursting with jollity. It was a choice and satisfactory menagerie, this
pensive poet and this gladsome gorilla. An indelicate story was a sharp
distress to Stoddard; Dolby told him twenty-five a day. Dolby always
came home with us after the lecture, and entertained Stoddard till
midnight. Me too. After he left, I walked the floor and talked, and
Stoddard went to sleep on the sofa. I hired him for company.

Dolby had been agent for concerts, and theatres, and Charles Dickens and
all sorts of shows and "attractions" for many years; he had known the
human being in many aspects, and he didn't much believe in him. But the
poet did. The waifs and estrays found a friend in Stoddard: Dolby tried
to persuade him that he was dispensing his charities unworthily, but he
was never able to succeed.

One night a young American got access to Stoddard at the Concert Rooms
and told him a moving tale. He said he was living on the Surrey side,
and for some strange reason his remittances had failed to arrive from
home; he had no money, he was out of employment, and friendless; his
girl-wife and his new baby were actually suffering for food; for the
love of heaven could he lend him a sovereign until his remittances
should resume? Stoddard was deeply touched, and gave him a sovereign on
my account. Dolby scoffed, but Stoddard stood his ground. Each told me
his story later in the evening, and I backed Stoddard's judgment. Dolby
said we were women in disguise, and not a sane kind of women, either.

The next week the young man came again. His wife was ill with the
pleurisy, the baby had the bots, or something, I am not sure of the name
of the disease; the doctor and the drugs had eaten up the money, the
poor little family was starving. If Stoddard "in the kindness of his
heart could only spare him another sovereign," etc., etc. Stoddard was
much moved, and spared him a sovereign for me. Dolby was outraged. He
spoke up and said to the customer--

"Now, young man, you are going to the hotel with us and state your case
to the other member of the family. If you don't make him believe in you
I sha'n't honor this poet's drafts in your interest any longer, for I
don't believe in you myself."

The young man was quite willing. I found no fault in him. On the
contrary, I believed in him at once, and was solicitous to heal the
wounds inflicted by Dolby's too frank incredulity; therefore I did
everything I could think of to cheer him up and entertain him and make
him feel at home and comfortable. I spun many yarns; among others the
tale of Jim Wolf and the Cats. Learning that he had done something in a
small way in literature, I offered to try to find a market for him in
that line. His face lighted joyfully at that, and he said that if I
could only sell a small manuscript to Tom Hood's Annual for him it would
be the happiest event of his sad life and he would hold me in grateful
remembrance always. That was a most pleasant night for three of us, but
Dolby was disgusted and sarcastic.

Next week the baby died. Meantime I had spoken to Tom Hood and gained
his sympathy. The young man had sent his manuscript to him, and the very
day the child died the money for the MS. came--three guineas. The young
man came with a poor little strip of crape around his arm and thanked
me, and said that nothing could have been more timely than that money,
and that his poor little wife was grateful beyond words for the service
I had rendered. He wept, and in fact Stoddard and I wept with him, which
was but natural. Also Dolby wept. At least he wiped his eyes and wrung
out his handkerchief, and sobbed stertorously and made other exaggerated
shows of grief. Stoddard and I were ashamed of Dolby, and tried to make
the young man understand that he meant no harm, it was only his way. The
young man said sadly that he was not minding it, his grief was too deep
for other hurts; that he was only thinking of the funeral, and the heavy
expenses which--

We cut that short and told him not to trouble about it, leave it all to
us; send the bills to Mr. Dolby and--

"Yes," said Dolby, with a mock tremor in his voice, "send them to me,
and I will pay them. What, are you going? You must not go alone in your
worn and broken condition; Mr. Stoddard and I will go with you. Come,
Stoddard. We will comfort the bereaved mamma and get a lock of the
baby's hair."

It was shocking. We were ashamed of him again, and said so. But he was
not disturbed. He said--

"Oh, I know this kind, the woods are full of them. I'll make this offer:
if he will show me his family I will give him twenty pounds. Come!" The
young man said he would not remain to be insulted; and he said
good-night and took his hat. But Dolby said he would go with him, and
stay by him until he found the family. Stoddard went along to soothe the
young man and modify Dolby. They drove across the river and all over
Southwark, but did not find the family. At last the young man confessed
there wasn't any.

The thing he sold to Tom Hood's Annual was "Jim and the Cats." And he
did not put my name to it.

So that small tale was sold three times. I am selling it again, now. It
is one of the best properties I have come across.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XVIII.

BY MARK TWAIN.


[_Dictated December 21, 1906._] I wish to insert here some pages of
Susy's Biography of me in which the biographer does not scatter,
according to her custom, but sticks pretty steadily to a single subject
until she has fought it to a finish:


     _Feb. 27, '86._--Last summer while we were in Elmira an article
     came out in the "Christian Union" by name "What ought he to have
     done" treating of the government of children, or rather giving an
     account of a fathers battle with his little baby boy, by the mother
     of the child and put in the form of a question as to whether the
     father disciplined the child corectly or not, different people
     wrote their opinions of the fathers behavior, and told what they
     thought he should have done. Mamma had long known how to disciplin
     children, for in fact the bringing up of children had been one of
     her specialties for many years. She had a great many theories, but
     one of them was, that if a child was big enough to be nauty, it was
     big enough to be whipped and here we all agreed with her. I
     remember one morning when Dr. ---- came up to the farm he had a
     long discussion with mamma, upon the following topic. Mamma gave
     _this_ as illustrative of one important rule for punishing a child.
     She said we will suppose the boy has thrown a handkerchief onto the
     floor, I tell him to pick it up, he refuses. I tell him again, he
     refuses. Then I say you must either pick up the handkerchief or
     have a whipping. My theory is never to make a child have a whipping
     and pick up the handkerchief too. I say "If you do not pick it up,
     I must punish you," if he doesn't he gets the whipping, but _I_
     pick up the handkerchief, if he does he gets no punishment. I tell
     him to do a thing if he disobeys me he is punished for so doing,
     but not forced to obey me afterwards.

     When Clara and I had been very nauty or were being very nauty, the
     nurse would go and call Mamma and she would appear suddenly and
     look at us (she had a way of looking at us when she was displeased
     as if she could see right through us) till we were ready to sink
     through the floor from embarasment, and total absence of knowing
     what to say. This look was usually followed with "Clara" or "Susy
     what do you mean by this? do you want to come to the bath-room with
     me?" Then followed the climax for Clara and I both new only too
     well what going to the bath-room meant.

     But mamma's first and foremost object was to make the child
     understand that he is being punished for _his_ sake, and because
     the mother so loves him that she cannot allow him to do wrong; also
     that it is as hard for her to punish him as for him to be punished
     and even harder. Mamma never allowed herself to punish us when she
     was angry with us she never struck us because she was enoyed at us
     and felt like striking us if we had been nauty and had enoyed her,
     so that she thought she felt or would show the least bit of temper
     toward us while punnishing us, she always postponed the punishment
     until _she_ was no more chafed by our behavior. She never humored
     herself by striking or punishing us because or while she was the
     least bit enoyed with us.

     Our very worst nautinesses were punished by being taken to the
     bath-room and being whipped by the paper cutter. But after the
     whipping was over, mamma did not allow us to leave her until we
     were perfectly happy, and perfectly understood why we had been
     whipped. I never remember having felt the least bit bitterly toward
     mamma for punishing me. I always felt I had deserved my punishment,
     and was much happier for having received it. For after mamma had
     punished us and shown her displeasure, she showed no signs of
     further displeasure, but acted as if we had not displeased her in
     any way.


Ordinary punishments answered very well for Susy. She was a thinker, and
would reason out the purpose of them, apply the lesson, and achieve the
reform required. But it was much less easy to devise punishments that
would reform Clara. This was because she was a philosopher who was
always turning her attention to finding something good and satisfactory
and entertaining in everything that came her way; consequently it was
sometimes pretty discouraging to the troubled mother to find that after
all her pains and thought in inventing what she meant to be a severe and
reform-compelling punishment, the child had entirely missed the
severities through her native disposition to get interest and pleasure
out of them as novelties. The mother, in her anxiety to find a penalty
that would take sharp hold and do its work effectively, at last
resorted, with a sore heart, and with a reproachful conscience, to that
punishment which the incorrigible criminal in the penitentiary dreads
above all the other punitive miseries which the warden inflicts upon him
for his good--solitary confinement in the dark chamber. The grieved and
worried mother shut Clara up in a very small clothes-closet and went
away and left her there--for fifteen minutes--it was all that the
mother-heart could endure. Then she came softly back and
listened--listened for the sobs, but there weren't any; there were
muffled and inarticulate sounds, but they could not be construed into
sobs. The mother waited half an hour longer; by that time she was
suffering so intensely with sorrow and compassion for the little
prisoner that she was not able to wait any longer for the distressed
sounds which she had counted upon to inform her when there had been
punishment enough and the reform accomplished. She opened the closet to
set the prisoner free and take her back into her loving favor and
forgiveness, but the result was not the one expected. The captive had
manufactured a fairy cavern out of the closet, and friendly fairies out
of the clothes hanging from the hooks, and was having a most sinful and
unrepentant good time, and requested permission to spend the rest of the
day there!

_From Susy's Biography of Me._


     But Mamma's oppinions and ideas upon the subject of bringing up
     children has always been more or less of a joke in our family,
     perticularly since Papa's article in the "Christian Union," and I
     am sure Clara and I have related the history of our old family
     paper-cutter, our punishments and privations with rather more pride
     and triumph than any other sentiment, because of Mamma's way of
     rearing us.

     When the article "What ought he to have done?" came out Mamma read
     it, and was very much interested in it. And when papa heard that
     she had read it he went to work and secretly wrote his opinion of
     what the father ought to have done. He told Aunt Susy, Clara and I,
     about it but mamma was not to see it or hear any thing about it
     till it came out. He gave it to Aunt Susy to read, and after Clara
     and I had gone up to get ready for bed he brought it up for us to
     read. He told what he thought the father ought to have done by
     telling what mamma would have done. The article was a beautiful
     tribute to mamma and every word in it true. But still in writing
     about mamma he partly forgot that the article was going to be
     published, I think, and expressed himself more fully than he would
     do the second time he wrote it; I think the article has done and
     will do a great deal of good, and I think it would have been
     perfect for the family and friend's enjoyment, but a little bit too
     private to have been published as it was. And Papa felt so too,
     because the very next day or a few days after, he went down to New
     York to see if he couldn't get it back before it was published but
     it was too late, and he had to return without it. When the
     Christian Union reached the farm and papa's article in it all ready
     and waiting to be read to mamma papa hadn't the courage to show it
     to her (for he knew she wouldn't like it at all) at first, and he
     didn't but he might have let it go and never let her see it, but
     finally he gave his consent to her seeing it, and told Clara and I
     we could take it to her, which we did, with tardiness, and we all
     stood around mamma while she read it, all wondering what she would
     say and think about it.

     She was too much surprised, (and pleased privately, too) to say
     much at first, but as we all expected publicly, (or rather when she
     remembered that this article was to be read by every one that took
     the Christian Union) she was rather shocked and a little
     displeased.

     Clara and I had great fun the night papa gave it to us to read and
     then hide, so mamma couldn't see it, for just as we were in the
     midst of reading it mamma appeared, papa following anxiously and
     asked why we were not in bed? then a scuffle ensued for we told her
     it was a secret and tried to hide it; but she chased us wherever we
     went, till she thought it was time for us to go to bed, then she
     surendered and left us to tuck it under Clara's matress.

     A little while after the article was published letters began to
     come in to papa crittisizing it, there were some very pleasant ones
     but a few very disagreable. One of these, the very worst, mamma got
     hold of and read, to papa's great regret, it was full of the most
     disagreble things, and so very enoying to papa that he for a time
     felt he must do something to show the author of it his great
     displeasure at being so insulted. But he finally decided not to,
     because he felt the man had some cause for feeling enoyed at, for
     papa had spoken of him, (he was the baby's father) rather
     slightingly in his Christian Union Article.

     After all this, papa and mamma both wished I think they might never
     hear or be spoken to on the subject of the Christian Union article,
     and whenever any has spoken to me and told me "How much they did
     enjoy my father's article in the Christian Union" I almost laughed
     in their faces when I remembered what a great variety of oppinions
     had been expressed upon the subject of the Christian Union article
     of papa's.

     The article was written in July or August and just the other day
     papa received quite a bright letter from a gentleman who has read
     the C. U. article and gave his opinion of it in these words.


It is missing. She probably put the letter between the leaves of the
Biography and it got lost out. She threw away the hostile letters, but
tried to keep the pleasantest one for her book; surely there has been no
kindlier biographer than this one. Yet to a quite creditable degree she
is loyal to the responsibilities of her position as historian--not
eulogist--and honorably gives me a quiet prod now and then. But how
many, many, many she has withheld that I deserved! I could prize them
now; there would be no acid in her words, and it is loss to me that she
did not set them all down. Oh, Susy, you sweet little biographer, you
break my old heart with your gentle charities!

I think a great deal of her work. Her canvases are on their easels, and
her brush flies about in a care-free and random way, delivering a dash
here, a dash there and another yonder, and one might suppose that there
would be no definite result; on the contrary I think that an intelligent
reader of her little book must find that by the time he has finished it
he has somehow accumulated a pretty clear and nicely shaded idea of the
several members of this family--including Susy herself--and that the
random dashes on the canvases have developed into portraits. I feel that
my own portrait, with some of the defects fined down and others left
out, is here; and I am sure that any who knew the mother will recognize
her without difficulty, and will say that the lines are drawn with a
just judgment and a sure hand. Little creature though Susy was, the
penetration which was born in her finds its way to the surface more than
once in these pages.

Before Susy began the Biography she let fall a remark now and then
concerning my character which showed that she had it under observation.
In the Record which we kept of the children's sayings there is an
instance of this. She was twelve years old at the time. We had
established a rule that each member of the family must bring a fact to
breakfast--a fact drawn from a book or from any other source; any fact
would answer. Susy's first contribution was in substance as follows. Two
great exiles and former opponents in war met in Ephesus--Scipio and
Hannibal. Scipio asked Hannibal to name the greatest general the world
had produced.

"Alexander"--and he explained why.

"And the next greatest?"

"Pyrrhus"--and he explained why.

"But where do you place yourself, then?"

"If I had conquered you I would place myself before the others."

Susy's grave comment was--

"That _attracted_ me, it was just like papa--he is so frank about his
books."

So frank in admiring them, she meant.


[_Thursday, March 28, 1907._] Some months ago I commented upon a chapter
of Susy's Biography wherein she very elaborately discussed an article
about the training and disciplining of children, which I had published
in the "Christian Union" (this was twenty-one years ago), an article
which was full of worshipful praises of Mrs. Clemens as a mother, and
which little Clara, and Susy, and I had been hiding from this lovely and
admirable mother because we knew she would disapprove of public and
printed praises of herself. At the time that I was dictating these
comments, several months ago, I was trying to call back to my memory
some of the details of that article, but I was not able to do it, and I
wished I had a copy of the article so that I could see what there was
about it which gave it such large interest for Susy.

Yesterday afternoon I elected to walk home from the luncheon at the St.
Regis, which is in 56th Street and Fifth Avenue, for it was a fine
spring day and I hadn't had a walk for a year or two, and felt the need
of exercise. As I walked along down Fifth Avenue the desire to see that
"Christian Union" article came into my head again. I had just reached
the corner of 42nd Street then, and there was the usual jam of wagons,
carriages, and automobiles there. I stopped to let it thin out before
trying to cross the street, but a stranger, who didn't require as much
room as I do, came racing by and darted into a crack among the vehicles
and made the crossing. But on his way past me he thrust a couple of
ancient newspaper clippings into my hand, and said,

"There, you don't know me, but I have saved them in my scrap-book for
twenty years, and it occurred to me this morning that perhaps you would
like to see them, so I was carrying them down-town to mail them, I not
expecting to run across you in this accidental way, of course; but I
will give them into your own hands now. Good-by!"--and he disappeared
among the wagons.

Those scraps which he had put into my hand were ancient newspaper copies
of that "Christian Union" article! It is a handsome instance of mental
telegraphy--or if it isn't that, it is a handsome case of coincidence.

_From the Biography._


     _March 14th, '86._--Mr. Laurence Barrette and Mr. and Mrs. Hutton
     were here a little while ago, and we had a very interesting visit
     from them. Papa said Mr. Barette never had acted so well before
     when he had seen him, as he did the first night he was staying with
     us. And Mrs. ---- said she never had seen an actor on the stage,
     whom she more wanted to speak with.

     Papa has been very much interested of late, in the "Mind Cure"
     theory. And in fact so have we all. A young lady in town has worked
     wonders by using the "Mind Cure" upon people; she is constantly
     busy now curing peoples deseases in this way--and curing her own
     even, which to me seems the most remarkable of all.

     A little while past, papa was delighted with the knowledge of what
     he thought the best way of curing a cold, which was by starving it.
     This starving did work beautifully, and freed him from a great many
     severe colds. Now he says it wasn't the starving that helped his
     colds, but the trust in the starving, the mind cure connected with
     the starving.

     I shouldn't wonder if we finally became firm believers in Mind
     Cure. The next time papa has a cold, I haven't a doubt, he will
     send for Miss H---- the young lady who is doctoring in the "Mind
     Cure" theory, to cure him of it.

     Mamma was over at Mrs. George Warners to lunch the other day, and
     Miss H---- was there too. Mamma asked if anything as natural as
     near sightedness could be cured she said oh yes just as well as
     other deseases.

     When mamma came home, she took me into her room, and told me that
     perhaps my near-sightedness could be cured by the "Mind Cure" and
     that she was going to have me try the treatment any way, there
     could be no harm in it, and there might be great good. If her plan
     succeeds there certainly will be a great deal in "Mind Cure" to my
     oppinion, for I am very near sighted and so is mamma, and I never
     expected there could be any more cure for it than for blindness,
     but now I dont know but what theres a cure for _that_.


It was a disappointment; her near-sightedness remained with her to the
end. She was born with it, no doubt; yet, strangely enough, she must
have been four years old, and possibly five, before we knew of its
existence. It is not easy to understand how that could have happened. I
discovered the defect by accident. I was half-way up the hall stairs one
day at home, and was leading her by the hand, when I glanced back
through the open door of the dining-room and saw what I thought she
would recognise as a pretty picture. It was "Stray Kit," the slender,
the graceful, the sociable, the beautiful, the incomparable, the cat of
cats, the tortoise-shell, curled up as round as a wheel and sound asleep
on the fire-red cover of the dining-table, with a brilliant stream of
sunlight falling across her. I exclaimed about it, but Susy said she
could see nothing there, neither cat nor table-cloth. The distance was
so slight--not more than twenty feet, perhaps--that if it had been any
other child I should not have credited the statement.

_From the Biography._


     _March 14th, '86._--Clara sprained her ankle, a little while ago,
     by running into a tree, when coasting, and while she was unable to
     walk with it she played solotaire with cards a great deal. While
     Clara was sick and papa saw her play solotaire so much, he got very
     much interested in the game, and finally began to play it himself a
     little, then Jean took it up, and at last _mamma_, even played it
     ocasionally; Jean's and papa's love for it rapidly increased, and
     now Jean brings the cards every night to the table and papa and
     mamma help her play, and before dinner is at an end, papa has
     gotten a separate pack of cards, and is playing alone, with great
     interest. Mamma and Clara next are made subject to the contagious
     solatair, and there are four solotaireans at the table; while you
     hear nothing but "Fill up the place" etc. It is dreadful! after
     supper Clara goes into the library, and gets a little red mahogany
     table, and placing it under the gas fixture seats herself and
     begins to play again, then papa follows with another table of the
     same discription, and they play solatair till bedtime.

     We have just had our Prince and Pauper pictures taken; two groups
     and some little single ones. The groups (the Interview and Lady
     Jane Grey scene) were pretty good, the lady Jane scene was perfect,
     just as pretty as it could be, the Interview was not so good; and
     two of the little single pictures were very good indeed, but one
     was very bad. Yet on the whole we think they were a success.

     Papa has done a great deal in his life I think, that is good, and
     very remarkable, but I think if he had had the advantages with
     which he could have developed the gifts which he has made no use of
     in writing his books, or in any other way for other peoples
     pleasure and benefit outside of his own family and intimate
     friends, he could have done _more_ than he has and a great deal
     more even. He is known to the public as a humorist, but he has much
     more in him that is earnest than that is humorous. He has a keen
     sense of the ludicrous, notices funny stories and incidents knows
     how to tell them, to improve upon them, and does not forget them.
     He has been through a great many of the funny adventures related in
     "Tom Sawyer" and in "Huckleberry Finn," _himself_ and he lived among
     just such boys, and in just such villages all the days of his early
     life. His "Prince and Pauper" is his most orriginal, and best
     production; it shows the most of any of his books what kind of
     pictures are in his mind, usually. Not that the pictures of England
     in the 16th Century and the adventures of a little prince and
     pauper are the kind of things he mainly thinks about; but that
     _that_ book, and those pictures represent the train of thought and
     imagination he would be likely to be thinking of to-day, to-morrow,
     or next day, more nearly than those given in "Tom Sawyer" or
     "Huckleberry Finn."[13]

     Papa can make exceedingly bright jokes, and he enjoys funny things,
     and when he is with people he jokes and laughs a great deal, but
     still he is more interested in earnest books and earnest subjects
     to talk upon, than in humorous ones.[14]

     When we are all alone at home, nine times out of ten, he talks
     about some very earnest subjects, (with an ocasional joke thrown
     in) and he a good deal more often talks upon such subjects than
     upon the other kind.

     He is as much of a Pholosopher as anything I think. I think he
     could have done a great deal in this direction if he had studied
     while young, for he seems to enjoy reasoning out things, no matter
     what; in a great many such directions he has greater ability than
     in the gifts which have made him famous.


Thus at fourteen she had made up her mind about me, and in no timorous
or uncertain terms had set down her reasons for her opinion. Fifteen
years were to pass before any other critic--except Mr. Howells, I
think--was to reutter that daring opinion and print it. Right or wrong,
it was a brave position for that little analyser to take. She never
withdrew it afterward, nor modified it. She has spoken of herself as
lacking physical courage, and has evinced her admiration of Clara's; but
she had moral courage, which is the rarest of human qualities, and she
kept it functionable by exercising it. I think that in questions of
morals and politics she was usually on my side; but when she was not
she had her reasons and maintained her ground. Two years after she
passed out of my life I wrote a Philosophy. Of the three persons who
have seen the manuscript only one understood it, and all three condemned
it. If she could have read it, she also would have condemned it,
possibly,--probably, in fact--but she would have understood it. It would
have had no difficulties for her on that score; also she would have
found a tireless pleasure in analyzing and discussing its problems.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XIX.

BY MARK TWAIN.


_From Susy's Biography of Me._


     _March 23, '86._--The other day was my birthday, and I had a little
     birthday party in the evening and papa acted some very funny
     charades with Mr. Gherhardt, Mr. Jesse Grant (who had come up from
     New York and was spending the evening with us) and Mr. Frank
     Warner. One of them was "on his knees" honys-sneeze. There were a
     good many other funny ones, all of which I dont remember. Mr. Grant
     was very pleasant, and began playing the charades in the most
     delightful way.


Susy's spelling has defeated me, this time. I cannot make out what
"honys-sneeze" stands for. Impromptu charades were almost a nightly
pastime of ours, from the children's earliest days--they played in them
with me when they were only five or six years old. As they increased in
years and practice their love for the sport almost amounted to a
passion, and they acted their parts with a steadily increasing ability.
At first they required much drilling; but later they were generally
ready as soon as the parts were assigned, and they acted them according
to their own devices. Their stage facility and absence of constraint and
self-consciousness in the "Prince and Pauper" was a result of their
charading practice.

At ten and twelve Susy wrote plays, and she and Daisy Warner and Clara
played them in the library or up-stairs in the school-room, with only
themselves and the servants for audience. They were of a tragic and
tremendous sort, and were performed with great energy and earnestness.
They were dramatized (freely) from English history, and in them Mary
Queen of Scots and Elizabeth had few holidays. The clothes were borrowed
from the mother's wardrobe and the gowns were longer than necessary, but
that was not regarded as a defect. In one of these plays Jean (three
years old, perhaps) was Sir Francis Bacon. She was not dressed for the
part, and did not have to say anything, but sat silent and decorous at a
tiny table and was kept busy signing death-warrants. It was a really
important office, for few entered those plays and got out of them alive.


     _March 26._--Mamma and Papa have been in New York for two or three
     days, and Miss Corey has been staying with us. They are coming home
     to-day at two o'clock.

     Papa has just begun to play chess, and he is very fond of it, so he
     has engaged to play with Mrs. Charles Warner every morning from 10
     to 12, he came down to supper last night, full of this pleasant
     prospect, but evidently with something on his mind. Finally he said
     to mamma in an appologetical tone, Susy Warner and I have a plan.

     "Well" mamma said "what now, I wonder?"

     Papa said that Susy Warner and he were going to name the chess
     after some of the old bible heroes, and then play chess on Sunday.


     _April 18, '86._--Mamma and papa Clara and Daisy have gone to New
     York to see the "Mikado." They are coming home to-night at half
     past seven.

     Last winter when Mr. Cable was lecturing with papa, he wrote this
     letter to him just before he came to visit us.


     DEAR UNCLE,--That's one nice thing about me, I never bother any
     one, to offer me a good thing twice. You dont ask me to stay over
     Sunday, but then you dont ask me to leave Saturday night, and
     knowing the nobility of your nature as I do--thank you, I'll stay
     till Monday morning.[15]

                   Your's and the dear familie's
                                              GEORGE W. CABLE.


[_December 22, 1906._] It seems a prodigious while ago! Two or three
nights ago I dined at a friend's house with a score of other men, and at
my side was Cable--actually almost an old man, really almost an old man,
that once so young chap! 62 years old, frost on his head, seven
grandchildren in stock, and a brand-new wife to re-begin life with!

[_Dictated Nov. 19, 1906._]


     Ever since papa and mamma were married, papa has written his books
     and then taken them to mamma in manuscript and she has expergated
     them. Papa read "Huckleberry Finn" to us in manuscript just before
     it came out, and then he would leave parts of it with mamma to
     expergate, while he went off up to the study to work, and sometimes
     Clara and I would be sitting with mamma while she was looking the
     manuscript over, and I remember so well, with what pangs of regret
     we used to see her turn down the leaves of the pages, which meant
     that some delightfully dreadful part must be scratched out. And I
     remember one part pertickularly which was perfectly fascinating it
     was dreadful, that Clara and I used to delight in, and oh with what
     dispair we saw mamma turn down the leaf on which it was written, we
     thought the book would be almost ruined without it. But we
     gradually came to feel as mamma did.


It would be a pity to replace the vivacity and quaintness and felicity
of Susy's innocent free spelling with the dull and petrified
uniformities of the spelling-book. Nearly all the grimness it taken out
of the "expergating" of my books by the subtle mollification
accidentally infused into the word by Susy's modification of the
spelling of it.

I remember the special case mentioned by Susy, and can see the group
yet--two-thirds of it pleading for the life of the culprit sentence that
was so fascinatingly dreadful and the other third of it patiently
explaining why the court could not grant the prayer of the pleaders; but
I do not remember what the condemned phrase was. It had much company,
and they all went to the gallows; but it is possible that that specially
dreadful one which gave those little people so much delight was
cunningly devised and put into the book for just that function, and not
with any hope or expectation that it would get by the "exper-gator"
alive. It is possible, for I had that custom.

Susy's quaint and effective spelling falls quite opportunely into
to-day's atmosphere, which is heavy with the rumblings and grumblings
and mutterings of the Simplified Spelling Reform. Andrew Carnegie
started this storm, a couple of years ago, by moving a simplifying of
English orthography, and establishing a fund for the prosecution and
maintenance of the crusade. He began gently. He addressed a circular to
some hundreds of his friends, asking them to simplify the spelling of a
dozen of our badly spelt words--I think they were only words which end
with the superfluous _ugh_. He asked that these friends use the
suggested spellings in their private correspondence.

By this, one perceives that the beginning was sufficiently quiet and
unaggressive.

Next stage: a small committee was appointed, with Brander Matthews for
managing director and spokesman. It issued a list of three hundred
words, of average silliness as to spelling, and proposed new and sane
spellings for these words. The President of the United States,
unsolicited, adopted these simplified three hundred officially, and
ordered that they be used in the official documents of the Government.
It was now remarked, by all the educated and the thoughtful except the
clergy that Sheol was to pay. This was most justly and comprehensively
descriptive. The indignant British lion rose, with a roar that was heard
across the Atlantic, and stood there on his little isle, gazing,
red-eyed, out over the glooming seas, snow-flecked with driving
spindrift, and lathing his tail--a most scary spectacle to see.

The lion was outraged because we, a nation of children, without any
grown-up people among us, with no property in the language, but using it
merely by courtesy of its owner the English nation, were trying to
defile the sacredness of it by removing from it peculiarities which had
been its ornament and which had made it holy and beautiful for ages.

In truth there is a certain sardonic propriety in preserving our
orthography, since ours is a mongrel language which started with a
child's vocabulary of three hundred words, and now consists of two
hundred and twenty-five thousand; the whole lot, with the exception of
the original and legitimate three hundred, borrowed, stolen, smouched
from every unwatched language under the sun, the spelling of each
individual word of the lot locating the source of the theft and
preserving the memory of the revered crime.

Why is it that I have intruded into this turmoil and manifested a desire
to get our orthography purged of its asininities? Indeed I do not know
why I should manifest any interest in the matter, for at bottom I
disrespect our orthography most heartily, and as heartily disrespect
everything that has been said by anybody in defence of it. Nothing
professing to be a defence of our ludicrous spellings has had any basis,
so far as my observation goes, except sentimentality. In these
"arguments" the term venerable is used instead of mouldy, and hallowed
instead of devilish; whereas there is nothing properly venerable or
antique about a language which is not yet four hundred years old, and
about a jumble of imbecile spellings which were grotesque in the
beginning, and which grow more and more grotesque with the flight of the
years.

[_Dictated Monday, November 30, 1906._]


     Jean and Papa were walking out past the barn the other day when
     Jean saw some little newly born baby ducks, she exclaimed as she
     perceived them "I dont see why God gives us so much ducks when
     Patrick kills them so."


Susy is mistaken as to the origin of the ducks. They were not a gift, I
bought them. I am not finding fault with her, for that would be most
unfair. She is remarkably accurate in her statements as a historian, as
a rule, and it would not be just to make much of this small slip of
hers; besides I think it was a quite natural slip, for by heredity and
habit ours was a religious household, and it was a common thing with us
whenever anybody did a handsome thing, to give the credit of it to
Providence, without examining into the matter. This may be called
automatic religion--in fact that is what it is; it is so used to its
work that it can do it without your help or even your privity; out of
all the facts and statistics that may be placed before it, it will
always get the one result, since it has never been taught to seek any
other. It is thus the unreflecting cause of much injustice. As we have
seen, it betrayed Susy into an injustice toward me. It had to be
automatic, for she would have been far from doing me an injustice when
in her right mind. It was a dear little biographer, and she meant me no
harm, and I am not censuring her now, but am only desirous of correcting
in advance an erroneous impression which her words would be sure to
convey to a reader's mind. No elaboration of this matter is necessary;
it is sufficient to say _I_ provided the ducks.

It was in Hartford. The greensward sloped down-hill from the house to
the sluggish little river that flowed through the grounds, and Patrick,
who was fertile in good ideas, had early conceived the idea of having
home-made ducks for our table. Every morning he drove them from the
stable down to the river, and the children were always there to see and
admire the waddling white procession; they were there again at sunset to
see Patrick conduct the procession back to its lodgings in the stable.
But this was not always a gay and happy holiday show, with joy in it for
the witnesses; no, too frequently there was a tragedy connected with it,
and then there were tears and pain for the children. There was a
stranded log or two in the river, and on these certain families of
snapping-turtles used to congregate and drowse in the sun and give
thanks, in their dumb way, to Providence for benevolence extended to
them. It was but another instance of misplaced credit; it was the young
ducks that those pious reptiles were so thankful for--whereas they were
_my_ ducks. I bought the ducks.

When a crop of young ducks, not yet quite old enough for the table but
approaching that age, began to join the procession, and paddle around in
the sluggish water, and give thanks--not to me--for that privilege, the
snapping-turtles would suspend their songs of praise and slide off the
logs and paddle along under the water and chew the feet of the young
ducks. Presently Patrick would notice that two or three of those little
creatures were not moving about, but were apparently at anchor, and were
not looking as thankful as they had been looking a short time before. He
early found out what that sign meant--a submerged snapping-turtle was
taking his breakfast, and silently singing his gratitude. Every day or
two Patrick would rescue and fetch up a little duck with incomplete legs
to stand upon--nothing left of their extremities but gnawed and bleeding
stumps. Then the children said pitying things and wept--and at dinner we
finished the tragedy which the turtles had begun. Thus, as will be
seen--out of season, at least--it was really the turtles that gave us
so much ducks. At my expense.


     Papa has written a new version of "There is a happy land" it is--


     "There is a boarding-house
               Far, far away,
     Where they have ham and eggs,
               Three times a day.
     Oh dont those boarders yell
     When they hear the dinner-bell,
     They give that land-lord rats
               Three times a day."


Again Susy has made a small error. It was not I that wrote the song. I
heard Billy Rice sing it in the negro minstrel show, and I brought it
home and sang it--with great spirit--for the elevation of the household.
The children admired it to the limit, and made me sing it with
burdensome frequency. To their minds it was superior to the Battle Hymn
of the Republic.

How many years ago that was! Where now is Billy Rice? He was a joy to
me, and so were the other stars of the nigger-show--Billy Birch, David
Wambold, Backus, and a delightful dozen of their brethren, who made life
a pleasure to me forty years ago, and later. Birch, Wambold, and Backus
are gone years ago; and with them departed to return no more forever, I
suppose, the real nigger-show--the genuine nigger-show, the extravagant
nigger-show,--the show which to me had no peer and whose peer has not
yet arrived, in my experience. We have the grand opera; and I have
witnessed, and greatly enjoyed, the first act of everything which Wagner
created, but the effect on me has always been so powerful that one act
was quite sufficient; whenever I have witnessed two acts I have gone
away physically exhausted; and whenever I have ventured an entire opera
the result has been the next thing to suicide. But if I could have the
nigger-show back again, in its pristine purity and perfection, I should
have but little further use for opera. It seems to me that to the
elevated mind and the sensitive spirit the hand-organ and the
nigger-show are a standard and a summit to whose rarefied altitude the
other forms of musical art may not hope to reach.

[_Dictated September 5, 1906._] It is years since I have examined "The
Children's Record." I have turned over a few of its pages this morning.
This book is a record in which Mrs. Clemens and I registered some of
the sayings and doings of the children, in the long ago, when they were
little chaps. Of course, we wrote these things down at the time because
they were of momentary interest--things of the passing hour, and of no
permanent value--but at this distant day I find that they still possess
an interest for me and also a value, because it turns out that they were
_registrations of character_. The qualities then revealed by fitful
glimpses, in childish acts and speeches, remained as a permanency in the
children's characters in the drift of the years, and were always
afterwards clearly and definitely recognizable.

There is a masterful streak in Jean that now and then moves her to set
my authority aside for a moment and end a losing argument in that prompt
and effective fashion. And here in this old book I find evidence that
she was just like that before she was quite four years old.


     _From The Children's Record. Quarry Farm, July 7, 1884._--Yesterday
     evening our cows (after being inspected and worshipped by Jean from
     the shed for an hour,) wandered off down into the pasture, and left
     her bereft. I thought I was going to get back home, now, but that
     was an error. Jean knew of some more cows, in a field somewhere,
     and took my hand and led me thitherward. When we turned the corner
     and took the right-hand road, I saw that we should presently be out
     of range of call and sight; so I began to argue against continuing
     the expedition, and Jean began to argue in favor of it--she using
     English for light skirmishing, and German for "business." I kept up
     my end with vigor, and demolished her arguments in detail, one
     after the other, till I judged I had her about cornered. She
     hesitated a moment, then answered up sharply:

     "_Wir werden nichts mehr darüber sprechen!_" (We won't talk any
     more about it!)

     It nearly took my breath away; though I thought I might possibly
     have misunderstood. I said:

     "Why, you little rascal! _Was hast du gesagt?_"

     But she said the same words over again, and in the same decided
     way. I suppose I ought to have been outraged; but I wasn't, I was
     charmed. And I suppose I ought to have spanked her; but I didn't, I
     fraternized with the enemy, and we went on and spent half an hour
     with the cows.


That incident is followed in the "Record" by the following paragraph,
which is another instance of a juvenile characteristic maintaining
itself into mature age. Susy was persistently and conscientiously
truthful throughout her life with the exception of one interruption
covering several months, and perhaps a year. This was while she was
still a little child. Suddenly--not gradually--she began to lie; not
furtively, but frankly, openly, and on a scale quite disproportioned to
her size. Her mother was so stunned, so nearly paralyzed for a day or
two, that she did not know what to do with the emergency. Reasonings,
persuasions, beseechings, all went for nothing; they produced no effect;
the lying went tranquilly on. Other remedies were tried, but they
failed. There is a tradition that success was finally accomplished by
whipping. I think the Record says so, but if it does it is because the
Record is incomplete. Whipping was indeed tried, and was faithfully kept
up during two or three weeks, but the results were merely temporary; the
reforms achieved were discouragingly brief.

Fortunately for Susy, an incident presently occurred which put a
complete stop to all the mother's efforts in the direction of reform.
This incident was the chance discovery in Darwin of a passage which said
that when a child exhibits a sudden and unaccountable disposition to
forsake the truth and restrict itself to lying, the explanation must be
sought away back in the past; that an ancestor of the child had had the
same disease, at the same tender age; that it was irremovable by
persuasion or punishment, and that it had ceased as suddenly and as
mysteriously as it had come, when it had run its appointed course. I
think Mr. Darwin said that nothing was necessary but to leave the matter
alone and let the malady have its way and perish by the statute of
limitations.

We had confidence in Darwin, and after that day Susy was relieved of our
reformatory persecutions. She went on lying without let or hindrance
during several months, or a year; then the lying suddenly ceased, and
she became as conscientiously and exactingly truthful as she had been
before the attack, and she remained so to the end of her life.

The paragraph in the Record to which I have been leading up is in my
handwriting, and is of a date so long posterior to the time of the lying
malady that she had evidently forgotten that truth-speaking had ever had
any difficulties for her.


     Mama was speaking of a servant who had been pretty unveracious, but
     was now "trying to tell the truth." Susy was a good deal surprised,
     and said she shouldn't think anybody would have to _try_ to tell
     the truth.


In the Record the children's acts and speeches quite definitely define
their characters. Susy's indicated the presence of mentality--
thought--and they were generally marked by gravity. She was timid, on
her physical side, but had an abundance of moral courage. Clara was
sturdy, independent, orderly, practical, persistent, plucky--just a
little animal, and very satisfactory. Charles Dudley Warner said Susy
was made of mind, and Clara of matter.

When Motley, the kitten, died, some one said that the thoughts of the
two children need not be inquired into, they could be divined: that Susy
was wondering if this was the _end_ of Motley, and had his life been
worth while; whereas Clara was merely interested in seeing to it that
there should be a creditable funeral.

In those days Susy was a dreamer, a thinker, a poet and philosopher, and
Clara--well, Clara wasn't. In after-years a passion for music developed
the latent spirituality and intellectuality in Clara, and her
practicality took second and, in fact, even third place. Jean was from
the beginning orderly, steady, diligent, persistent; and remains so. She
picked up languages easily, and kept them.


     _Susy aged eleven, Jean three._--Susy said the other day when she
     saw Jean bringing a cat to me of her own motion, "Jean has found
     out already that mamma loves morals and papa loves cats."


It is another of Susy's remorselessly sound verdicts.

As a child, Jean neglected my books. When she was nine years old Will
Gillette invited her and the rest of us to a dinner at the Murray Hill
Hotel in New York, in order that we might get acquainted with Mrs.
Leslie and her daughters. Elsie Leslie was nine years old, and was a
great celebrity on the stage. Jean was astonished and awed to see that
little slip of a thing sit up at table and take part in the conversation
of the grown people, capably and with ease and tranquillity. Poor Jean
was obliged to keep still, for the subjects discussed never happened to
hit her level, but at last the talk fell within her limit and she had
her chance to contribute to it. "Tom Sawyer" was mentioned. Jean spoke
gratefully up and said,

"I know who wrote that book--Harriet Beecher Stowe!"


     One evening Susy had prayed, Clara was curled up for sleep; she was
     reminded that it was her turn to pray now. She laid "Oh! one's
     enough," and dropped off to slumber.

     _Clara five years old._--We were in Germany. The nurse, Rosa, was
     not allowed to speak to the children otherwise than in German.
     Clara grew very tired of it; by and by the little creature's
     patience was exhausted, and she said "Aunt Clara, I wish God had
     made Rosa in English."

     _Clara four years old, Susy six._--This morning when Clara
     discovered that this is my birthday, she was greatly troubled
     because she had provided no gift for me, and repeated her sorrow
     several times. Finally she went musing to the nursery and presently
     returned with her newest and dearest treasure, a large toy horse,
     and said, "You shall have this horse for your birthday, papa."

     I accepted it with many thanks. After an hour she was racing up and
     down the room with the horse, when Susy said,

     "Why Clara, you gave that horse to papa, and now you've tooken it
     again."

     _Clara._--"I never give it to him for always; I give it to him for
     his birthday."


     In Geneva, in September, I lay abed late one morning, and as Clara
     was passing through the room I took her on my bed a moment. Then
     the child went to Clara Spaulding and said,

     "Aunt Clara, papa is a good deal of trouble to me."

     "Is he? Why?"

     "Well, he wants me to get in bed with him, and I can't do that with
     jelmuls [gentlemen]--I don't like jelmuls anyway."

     "What, you don't like gentlemen! Don't you like Uncle Theodore
     Crane?"

     "Oh yes, but he's not a jelmul, he's a friend."


                                                     MARK TWAIN.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XX.

BY MARK TWAIN.


[Sidenote: (1868.)]

[_Notes on "Innocents Abroad." Dictated in Florence, Italy, April,
1904._]--I will begin with a note upon the dedication. I wrote the book
in the months of March and April, 1868, in San Francisco. It was
published in August, 1869. Three years afterward Mr. Goodman, of
Virginia City, Nevada, on whose newspaper I had served ten years before,
came East, and we were walking down Broadway one day when he said: "How
did you come to steal Oliver Wendell Holmes's dedication and put it in
your book?"

I made a careless and inconsequential answer, for I supposed he was
joking. But he assured me that he was in earnest. He said: "I'm not
discussing the question of whether you stole it or didn't--for that is a
question that can be settled in the first bookstore we come to--I am
only asking you _how_ you came to steal it, for that is where my
curiosity is focalized."

I couldn't accommodate him with this information, as I hadn't it in
stock. I could have made oath that I had not stolen anything, therefore
my vanity was not hurt nor my spirit troubled. At bottom I supposed that
he had mistaken another book for mine, and was now getting himself into
an untenable place and preparing sorrow for himself and triumph for me.
We entered a bookstore and he asked for "The Innocents Abroad" and for
the dainty little blue and gold edition of Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes's
poems. He opened the books, exposed their dedications and said: "Read
them. It is plain that the author of the second one stole the first one,
isn't it?"

I was very much ashamed, and unspeakably astonished. We continued our
walk, but I was not able to throw any gleam of light upon that original
question of his. I could not remember ever having seen Dr. Holmes's
dedication. I knew the poems, but the dedication was new to me.

I did not get hold of the key to that secret until months afterward,
then it came in a curious way, and yet it was a natural way; for the
natural way provided by nature and the construction of the human mind
for the discovery of a forgotten event is to employ another forgotten
event for its resurrection.

[Sidenote: (1866.)]

I received a letter from the Rev. Dr. Rising, who had been rector of the
Episcopal church in Virginia City in my time, in which letter Dr. Rising
made reference to certain things which had happened to us in the
Sandwich Islands six years before; among things he made casual mention
of the Honolulu Hotel's poverty in the matter of literature. At first I
did not see the bearing of the remark, it called nothing to my mind. But
presently it did--with a flash! There was but one book in Mr. Kirchhof's
hotel, and that was the first volume of Dr. Holmes's blue and gold
series. I had had a fortnight's chance to get well acquainted with its
contents, for I had ridden around the big island (Hawaii) on horseback
and had brought back so many saddle boils that if there had been a duty
on them it would have bankrupted me to pay it. They kept me in my room,
unclothed, and in persistent pain for two weeks, with no company but
cigars and the little volume of poems. Of course I read them almost
constantly; I read them from beginning to end, then read them backwards,
then began in the middle and read them both ways, then read them wrong
end first and upside down. In a word, I read the book to rags, and was
infinitely grateful to the hand that wrote it.

Here we have an exhibition of what repetition can do, when persisted in
daily and hourly over a considerable stretch of time, where one is
merely reading for entertainment, without thought or intention of
preserving in the memory that which is read. It is a process which in
the course of years dries all the juice out of a familiar verse of
Scripture, leaving nothing but a sapless husk behind. In that case you
at least know the origin of the husk, but in the case in point I
apparently preserved the husk but presently forgot whence it came. It
lay lost in some dim corner of my memory a year or two, then came
forward when I needed a dedication, and was promptly mistaken by me as a
child of my own happy fancy.

I was new, I was ignorant, the mysteries of the human mind were a sealed
book to me as yet, and I stupidly looked upon myself as a tough and
unforgivable criminal. I wrote to Dr. Holmes and told him the whole
disgraceful affair, implored him in impassioned language to believe that
I had never intended to commit this crime, and was unaware that I had
committed it until I was confronted with the awful evidence. I have lost
his answer, I could better have afforded to lose an uncle. Of these I
had a surplus, many of them of no real value to me, but that letter was
beyond price, beyond uncledom, and unsparable. In it Dr. Holmes laughed
the kindest and healingest laugh over the whole matter, and at
considerable length and in happy phrase assured me that there was no
crime in unconscious plagiarism; that I committed it every day, that he
committed it every day, that every man alive on the earth who writes or
speaks commits it every day and not merely once or twice but every time
he opens his mouth; that all our phrasings are spiritualized shadows
cast multitudinously from our readings; that no happy phrase of ours is
ever quite original with us, there is nothing of our own in it except
some slight change born of our temperament, character, environment,
teachings and associations; that this slight change differentiates it
from another man's manner of saying it, stamps it with our special
style, and makes it our own for the time being; all the rest of it being
old, moldy, antique, and smelling of the breath of a thousand
generations of them that have passed it over their teeth before!

In the thirty-odd years which have come and gone since then, I have
satisfied myself that what Dr. Holmes said was true.

I wish to make a note upon the preface of the "Innocents." In the last
paragraph of that brief preface, I speak of the proprietors of the
"Daily Alta California" having "waived their rights" in certain letters
which I wrote for that journal while absent on the "Quaker City" trip. I
was young then, I am white-headed now, but the insult of that word
rankles yet, now that I am reading that paragraph for the first time in
many years, reading it for the first time since it was written, perhaps.
There were rights, it is true--such rights as the strong are able to
acquire over the weak and the absent. Early in '66 George Barnes invited
me to resign my reportership on his paper, the San Francisco "Morning
Call," and for some months thereafter I was without money or work; then
I had a pleasant turn of fortune. The proprietors of the "Sacramento
Union," a great and influential daily journal, sent me to the Sandwich
Islands to write four letters a month at twenty dollars apiece. I was
there four or five months, and returned to find myself about the best
known honest man on the Pacific Coast. Thomas McGuire, proprietor of
several theatres, said that now was the time to make my fortune--strike
while the iron was hot!--break into the lecture field! I did it. I
announced a lecture on the Sandwich Islands, closing the advertisement
with the remark, "Admission one dollar; doors open at half-past 7, the
trouble begins at 8." A true prophecy. The trouble certainly did begin
at 8, when I found myself in front of the only audience I had ever
faced, for the fright which pervaded me from head to foot was
paralyzing. It lasted two minutes and was as bitter as death, the memory
of it is indestructible, but it had its compensations, for it made me
immune from timidity before audiences for all time to come. I lectured
in all the principal Californian towns and in Nevada, then lectured once
or twice more in San Francisco, then retired from the field rich--for
me--and laid out a plan to sail Westward from San Francisco, and go
around the world. The proprietors of the "Alta" engaged me to write an
account of the trip for that paper--fifty letters of a column and a half
each, which would be about two thousand words per letter, and the pay to
be twenty dollars per letter.

I went East to St. Louis to say good-bye to my mother, and then I was
bitten by the prospectus of Captain Duncan of the "Quaker City"
excursion, and I ended by joining it. During the trip I wrote and sent
the fifty letters; six of them miscarried, and I wrote six new ones to
complete my contract. Then I put together a lecture on the trip and
delivered it in San Francisco at great and satisfactory pecuniary
profit, then I branched out into the country and was aghast at the
result: I had been entirely forgotten, I never had people enough in my
houses to sit as a jury of inquest on my lost reputation! I inquired
into this curious condition of things and found that the thrifty owners
of that prodigiously rich "Alta" newspaper had _copyrighted_ all those
poor little twenty-dollar letters, and had threatened with prosecution
any journal which should venture to copy a paragraph from them!

And there I was! I had contracted to furnish a large book, concerning
the excursion, to the American Publishing Co. of Hartford, and I
supposed I should need all those letters to fill it out with. I was in
an uncomfortable situation--that is, if the proprietors of this
stealthily acquired copyright should refuse to let me use the letters.
That is just what they did; Mr. Mac--something--I have forgotten the
rest of his name--said his firm were going to make a book out of the
letters in order to get back the thousand dollars which they had paid
for them. I said that if they had acted fairly and honorably, and had
allowed the country press to use the letters or portions of them, my
lecture-skirmish on the coast would have paid me ten thousand dollars,
whereas the "Alta" had lost me that amount. Then he offered a
compromise: he would publish the book and allow me ten per cent. royalty
on it. The compromise did not appeal to me, and I said so. I was now
quite unknown outside of San Francisco, the book's sale would be
confined to that city, and my royalty would not pay me enough to board
me three months; whereas my Eastern contract, if carried out, could be
profitable to me, for I had a sort of reputation on the Atlantic
seaboard acquired through the publication of six excursion-letters in
the New York "Tribune" and one or two in the "Herald."

In the end Mr. Mac agreed to suppress his book, on certain conditions:
in my preface I must thank the "Alta" for waiving "rights" and granting
me permission. I objected to the thanks. I could not with any large
degree of sincerity thank the "Alta" for bankrupting my lecture-raid.
After considerable debate my point was conceded and the thanks left out.

[Sidenote: (1902.)]

[Sidenote: (1897.)]

Noah Brooks was the editor of the "Alta" at the time, a man of sterling
character and equipped with a right heart, also a good historian where
facts were not essential. In biographical sketches of me written many
years afterward (1902), he was quite eloquent in praises of the
generosity of the "Alta" people in giving to me without compensation a
book which, as history had afterward shown, was worth a fortune. After
all the fuss, I did not levy heavily upon the "Alta" letters. I found
that they were newspaper matter, not book matter. They had been written
here and there and yonder, as opportunity had given me a chance
working-moment or two during our feverish flight around about Europe or
in the furnace-heat of my stateroom on board the "Quaker City,"
therefore they were loosely constructed, and needed to have some of the
wind and water squeezed out of them. I used several of them--ten or
twelve, perhaps. I wrote the rest of "The Innocents Abroad" in sixty
days, and I could have added a fortnight's labor with the pen and gotten
along without the letters altogether. I was very young in those days,
exceedingly young, marvellously young, younger than I am now, younger
than I shall ever be again, by hundreds of years. I worked every night
from eleven or twelve until broad day in the morning, and as I did two
hundred thousand words in the sixty days, the average was more than
three thousand words a day--nothing for Sir Walter Scott, nothing for
Louis Stevenson, nothing for plenty of other people, but quite handsome
for me. In 1897, when we were living in Tedworth Square, London, and I
was writing the book called "Following the Equator" my average was
eighteen hundred words a day; here in Florence (1904), my average seems
to be fourteen hundred words per sitting of four or five hours.[16]

I was deducing from the above that I have been slowing down steadily in
these thirty-six years, but I perceive that my statistics have a
defect: three thousand words in the spring of 1868 when I was working
seven or eight or nine hours at a sitting has little or no advantage
over the sitting of to-day, covering half the time and producing half
the output. Figures often beguile me, particularly when I have the
arranging of them myself; in which case the remark attributed to
Disraeli would often apply with justice and force:

"There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics."

[_Dictated, January 23, 1907._]--The proverb says that Providence
protects children and idiots. This is really true. I know it because I
have tested it. It did not protect George through the most of his
campaign, but it saved him in his last inning, and the veracity of the
proverb stood confirmed.

[Sidenote: (1865.)]

I have several times been saved by this mysterious interposition, when I
was manifestly in extreme peril. It has been common, all my life, for
smart people to perceive in me an easy prey for selfish designs, and I
have walked without suspicion into the trap set for me, yet have often
come out unscathed, against all the likelihoods. More than forty years
ago, in San Francisco, the office staff adjourned, upon conclusion of
its work at two o'clock in the morning, to a great bowling establishment
where there were twelve alleys. I was invited, rather perfunctorily, and
as a matter of etiquette--by which I mean that I was invited politely,
but not urgently. But when I diffidently declined, with thanks, and
explained that I knew nothing about the game, those lively young fellows
became at once eager and anxious and urgent to have my society. This
flattered me, for I perceived no trap, and I innocently and gratefully
accepted their invitation. I was given an alley all to myself. The boys
explained the game to me, and they also explained to me that there would
be an hour's play, and that the player who scored the fewest ten-strikes
in the hour would have to provide oysters and beer for the combination.
This disturbed me very seriously, since it promised me bankruptcy, and I
was sorry that this detail had been overlooked in the beginning. But my
pride would not allow me to back out now, so I stayed in, and did what I
could to look satisfied and glad I had come. It is not likely that I
looked as contented as I wanted to, but the others looked glad enough to
make up for it, for they were quite unable to hide their evil joy. They
showed me how to stand, and how to stoop, and how to aim the ball, and
how to let fly; and then the game began. The results were astonishing.
In my ignorance I delivered the balls in apparently every way except the
right one; but no matter--during half an hour I never started a ball
down the alley that didn't score a ten-strike, every time, at the other
end. The others lost their grip early, and their joy along with it. Now
and then one of them got a ten-strike, but the occurrence was so rare
that it made no show alongside of my giant score. The boys surrendered
at the end of the half-hour, and put on their coats and gathered around
me and in courteous, but sufficiently definite, language expressed their
opinion of an experience-worn and seasoned expert who would stoop to
lying and deception in order to rob kind and well-meaning friends who
had put their trust in him under the delusion that he was an honest and
honorable person. I was not able to convince them that I had not lied,
for now my character was gone, and they refused to attach any value to
anything I said. The proprietor of the place stood by for a while saying
nothing, then he came to my defence. He said: "It looks like a mystery,
gentlemen, but it isn't a mystery after it's explained. That is a
_grooved_ alley; you've only to start a ball down it any way you please
and the groove will do the rest; it will slam the ball against the
northeast curve of the head pin every time, and nothing can save the ten
from going down."

It was true. The boys made the experiment and they found that there was
no art that could send a ball down that alley and fail to score a
ten-strike with it. When I had told those boys that I knew nothing about
that game I was speaking only the truth; but it was ever thus, all
through my life: whenever I have diverged from custom and principle and
uttered a truth, the rule has been that the hearer hadn't strength of
mind enough to believe it.

[Sidenote: (1873.)]

A quarter of a century ago I arrived in London to lecture a few weeks
under the management of George Dolby, who had conducted the Dickens
readings in America five or six years before. He took me to the
Albemarle and fed me, and in the course of the dinner he enlarged a good
deal, and with great satisfaction, upon his reputation as a player of
fifteen-ball pool, and when he learned by my testimony that I had never
seen the game played, and knew nothing of the art of pocketing balls,
he enlarged more and more, and still more, and kept on enlarging, until
I recognized that I was either in the presence of the very father of
fifteen-ball pool or in the presence of his most immediate descendant.
At the end of the dinner Dolby was eager to introduce me to the game and
show me what he could do. We adjourned to the billiard-room and he
framed the balls in a flat pyramid and told me to fire at the apex ball
and then go on and do what I could toward pocketing the fifteen, after
which he would take the cue and show me what a past-master of the game
could do with those balls. I did as required. I began with the
diffidence proper to my ignorant estate, and when I had finished my
inning all the balls were in the pockets and Dolby was burying me under
a volcanic irruption of acid sarcasms.

So I was a liar in Dolby's belief. He thought he had been sold, and at a
cheap rate; but he divided his sarcasms quite fairly and quite equally
between the two of us. He was full of ironical admiration of his
childishness and innocence in letting a wandering and characterless and
scandalous American load him up with deceptions of so transparent a
character that they ought not to have deceived the house cat. On the
other hand, he was remorselessly severe upon me for beguiling him, by
studied and discreditable artifice, into bragging and boasting about his
poor game in the presence of a professional expert disguised in lies and
frauds, who could empty more balls in billiard pockets in an hour than
he could empty into a basket in a day.

In the matter of fifteen-ball pool I never got Dolby's confidence wholly
back, though I got it in other ways, and kept it until his death. I have
played that game a number of times since, but that first time was the
only time in my life that I have ever pocketed all the fifteen in a
single inning.

[Sidenote: (1876.)]

My unsuspicious nature has made it necessary for Providence to save me
from traps a number of times. Thirty years ago, a couple of Elmira
bankers invited me to play the game of "Quaker" with them. I had never
heard of the game before, and said that if it required intellect, I
should not be able to entertain them. But they said it was merely a game
of chance, and required no mentality--so I agreed to make a trial of it.
They appointed four in the afternoon for the sacrifice. As the place,
they chose a ground-floor room with a large window in it. Then they
went treacherously around and advertised the "sell" which they were
going to play upon me.

I arrived on time, and we began the game--with a large and eager
free-list to superintend it. These superintendents were outside, with
their noses pressed against the window-pane. The bankers described the
game to me. So far as I recollect, the pattern of it was this: they had
a pile of Mexican dollars on the table; twelve of them were of even
date, fifty of them were of odd dates. The bankers were to separate a
coin from the pile and hide it under a hand, and I must guess "odd" or
"even." If I guessed correctly, the coin would be mine; if incorrectly,
I lost a dollar. The first guess I made was "even," and was right. I
guessed again, "even," and took the money. They fed me another one and I
guessed "even" again, and took the money. I guessed "even" the fourth
time, and took the money. It seemed to me that "even" was a good guess,
and I might as well stay by it, which I did. I guessed "even" twelve
times, and took the twelve dollars. I was doing as they secretly
desired. Their experience of human nature had convinced them that any
human being as innocent as my face proclaimed me to be, would repeat his
first guess if it won, and would go on repeating it if it should
continue to win. It was their belief that an innocent would be almost
sure at the beginning to guess "even," and not "odd," and that if an
innocent should guess "even" twelve times in succession and win every
time, he would go on guessing "even" to the end--so it was their purpose
to let me win those twelve even dates and then advance the odd dates,
one by one, until I should lose fifty dollars, and furnish those
superintendents something to laugh about for a week to come.

But it did not come out in that way; for by the time I had won the
twelfth dollar and last even date, I withdrew from the game because it
was so one-sided that it was monotonous, and did not entertain me. There
was a burst of laughter from the superintendents at the window when I
came out of the place, but I did not know what they were laughing at nor
whom they were laughing at, and it was a matter of no interest to me
anyway. Through that incident I acquired an enviable reputation for
smartness and penetration, but it was not my due, for I had not
penetrated anything that the cow could not have penetrated.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XXI.

BY MARK TWAIN.


_From Susy's Biography of Me._


     _Feb. 12, '86._

     Mamma and I have both been very much troubled of late because papa
     since he has been publishing Gen. Grant's book has seemed to forget
     his own books and work entirely, and the other evening as papa and
     I were promonading up and down the library he told me that he
     didn't expect to write but one more book, and then he was ready to
     give up work altogether, die, or do anything, he said that he had
     written more than he had ever expected to, and the only book that
     he had been pertickularly anxious to write was one locked up in the
     safe down stairs, not yet published.[17]

     But this intended future of course will never do, and although papa
     usually holds to his own opinions and intents with outsiders, when
     mamma realy desires anything and says that it must be, papa allways
     gives up his plans (at least so far) and does as she says is right
     (and she is usually right, if she dissagrees with him at all). It
     was because he knew his great tendency to being convinced by her,
     that he published without her knowledge that article in the
     "Christian Union" concerning the government of children. So judging
     by the proofs of past years, I think that we will be able to
     persuade papa to go back to work as before, and not leave off
     writing with the end of his next story. Mamma says that she
     sometimes feels, and I do too, that she would rather have papa
     depend on his writing for a living than to have him think of giving
     it up.


[_Dictated, November 8, 1906._] I have a defect of a sort which I think
is not common; certainly I hope it isn't: it is rare that I can call
before my mind's eye the form and face of either friend or enemy. If I
should make a list, now, of persons whom I know in America and
abroad--say to the number of even an entire thousand--it is quite
unlikely that I could reproduce five of them in my mind's eye. Of my
dearest and most intimate friends, I could name eight whom I have seen
and talked with four days ago, but when I try to call them before me
they are formless shadows. Jean has been absent, this past eight or ten
days, in the country, and I wish I could reproduce her in the mirror of
my mind, but I can't do it.

It may be that this defect is not constitutional, but a result of
lifelong absence of mind and indolent and inadequate observation. Once
or twice in my life it has been an embarrassment to me. Twenty years
ago, in the days of Susy's Biography of Me, there was a dispute one
morning at the breakfast-table about the color of a neighbor's eyes. I
was asked for a verdict, but had to confess that if that valued neighbor
and old friend had eyes I was not sure that I had ever seen them. It was
then mockingly suggested that perhaps I didn't even know the color of
the eyes of my own family, and I was required to shut my own at once and
testify. I was able to name the color of Mrs. Clemens's eyes, but was
not able to even suggest a color for Jean's, or Clara's, or Susy's.

All this talk is suggested by Susy's remark: "The other evening as papa
and I were promenading up and down the library." Down to the bottom of
my heart I am thankful that I can see _that_ picture! And it is not dim,
but stands out clear in the unfaded light of twenty-one years ago. In
those days Susy and I used to "promonade" daily up and down the
library, with our arms about each other's waists, and deal in intimate
communion concerning affairs of State, or the deep questions of human
life, or our small personal affairs.

It was quite natural that I should think I had written myself out when I
was only fifty years old, for everybody who has ever written has been
smitten with that superstition at about that age. Not even yet have I
really written myself out. I have merely stopped writing because
dictating is pleasanter work, and because dictating has given me a
strong aversion to the pen, and because two hours of talking per day is
enough, and because--But I am only damaging my mind with this digging
around in it for pretexts where no pretext is needed, and where the
simple truth is for this one time better than any invention, in this
small emergency. I shall never finish my five or six unfinished books,
for the reason that by forty years of slavery to the pen I have earned
my freedom. I detest the pen and I wouldn't use it again to sign the
death warrant of my dearest enemy.

[_Dictated, March 8, 1906._] For thirty years, I have received an
average of a dozen letters a year from strangers who remember me, or
whose fathers remember me as boy and young man. But these letters are
almost always disappointing. I have not known these strangers nor their
fathers. I have not heard of the names they mention; the reminiscences
to which they call attention have had no part in my experience; all of
which means that these strangers have been mistaking me for somebody
else. But at last I have the refreshment, this morning, of a letter from
a man who deals in names that were familiar to me in my boyhood. The
writer encloses a newspaper clipping which has been wandering through
the press for four or five weeks, and he wants to know if Capt Tonkray,
lately deceased, was (as stated in the clipping) the original of
"Huckleberry Finn."

I have replied that "Huckleberry Finn" was Frank F. As this inquirer
evidently knew the Hannibal of the forties, he will easily recall Frank.
Frank's father was at one time Town Drunkard, an exceedingly
well-defined and unofficial office of those days. He succeeded "General"
Gaines, and for a time he was sole and only incumbent of the office; but
afterward Jimmy Finn proved competency and disputed the place with him,
so we had two town drunkards at one time--and it made as much trouble in
that village as Christendom experienced in the fourteenth century when
there were two Popes at the same time.

In "Huckleberry Finn" I have drawn Frank exactly as he was. He was
ignorant, unwashed, insufficiently fed; but he had as good a heart as
ever any boy had. His liberties were totally unrestricted. He was the
only really independent person--boy or man--in the community, and by
consequence he was tranquilly and continuously happy, and was envied by
all the rest of us. We liked him; we enjoyed his society. And as his
society was forbidden us by our parents, the prohibition trebled and
quadrupled its value, and therefore we sought and got more of his
society than of any other boy's. I heard, four years ago, that he was
Justice of the Peace in a remote village in the State of ----, and was a
good citizen and was greatly respected.

During Jimmy Finn's term he (Jimmy) was not exclusive; he was not
finical; he was not hypercritical; he was largely and handsomely
democratic--and slept in the deserted tan-yard with the hogs. My father
tried to reform him once, but did not succeed. My father was not a
professional reformer. In him the spirit of reform was spasmodic. It
only broke out now and then, with considerable intervals between. Once
he tried to reform Injun Joe. That also was a failure. It was a failure,
and we boys were glad. For Injun Joe, drunk, was interesting and a
benefaction to us, but Injun Joe, sober, was a dreary spectacle. We
watched my father's experiments upon him with a good deal of anxiety,
but it came out all right and we were satisfied. Injun Joe got drunk
oftener than before, and became intolerably interesting.

I think that in "Tom Sawyer" I starved Injun Joe to death in the cave.
But that may have been to meet the exigencies of romantic literature. I
can't remember now whether the real Injun Joe died in the cave or out of
it, but I do remember that the news of his death reached me at a most
unhappy time--that is to say, just at bedtime on a summer night when a
prodigious storm of thunder and lightning accompanied by a deluging rain
that turned the streets and lanes into rivers, caused me to repent and
resolve to lead a better life. I can remember those awful thunder-bursts
and the white glare of the lightning yet, and the wild lashing of the
rain against the window-panes. By my teachings I perfectly well knew
what all that wild riot was for--Satan had come to get Injun Joe. I had
no shadow of doubt about it. It was the proper thing when a person like
Injun Joe was required in the under world, and I should have thought it
strange and unaccountable if Satan had come for him in a less impressive
way. With every glare of lightning I shrivelled and shrunk together in
mortal terror, and in the interval of black darkness that followed I
poured out my lamentings over my lost condition, and my supplications
for just one more chance, with an energy and feeling and sincerity quite
foreign to my nature.

But in the morning I saw that it was a false alarm and concluded to
resume business at the old stand and wait for another reminder.

The axiom says "History repeats itself." A week or two ago Mr.
Blank-Blank dined with us. At dinner he mentioned a circumstance which
flashed me back over about sixty years and landed me in that little
bedroom on that tempestuous night, and brought to my mind how creditable
to me was my conduct through the whole night, and how barren it was of
moral spot or fleck during that entire period: he said Mr. X was sexton,
or something, of the Episcopal church in his town, and had been for many
years the competent superintendent of all the church's worldly affairs,
and was regarded by the whole congregation as a stay, a blessing, a
priceless treasure. But he had a couple of defects--not large defects,
but they seemed large when flung against the background of his
profoundly religious character: he drank a good deal, and he could
outswear a brakeman. A movement arose to persuade him to lay aside these
vices, and after consulting with his pal, who occupied the same position
as himself in the other Episcopal church, and whose defects were
duplicates of his own and had inspired regret in the congregation he was
serving, they concluded to try for reform--not wholesale, but half at a
time. They took the liquor pledge and waited for results. During nine
days the results were entirely satisfactory, and they were recipients of
many compliments and much congratulation. Then on New-year's eve they
had business a mile and a half out of town, just beyond the State line.
Everything went well with them that evening in the barroom of the
inn--but at last the celebration of the occasion by those villagers
came to be of a burdensome nature. It was a bitter cold night and the
multitudinous hot toddies that were circulating began by and by to exert
a powerful influence upon the new prohibitionists. At last X's friend
remarked,

"X, does it occur to you that we are _outside the diocese_?"

That ended reform No. 1. Then they took a chance in reform No. 2. For a
while that one prospered, and they got much applause. I now reach the
incident which sent me back a matter of sixty years, as I have remarked
a while ago.

One morning Mr. Blank-Blank met X on the street and said,

"You have made a gallant struggle against those defects of yours. I am
aware that you failed on No. 1, but I am also aware that you are having
better luck with No. 2."

"Yes," X said; "No. 2 is all right and sound up to date, and we are full
of hope."

Blank-Blank said, "X, of course you have your troubles like other
people, but they never show on the outside. I have never seen you when
you were not cheerful. Are you always cheerful? Really always cheerful?"

"Well, no," he said, "no, I can't say that I am always cheerful,
but--well, you know that kind of a night that comes: _say_--you wake up
'way in the night and the whole world is sunk in gloom and there are
storms and earthquakes and all sorts of disasters in the air
threatening, and you get cold and clammy; and when that happens to me I
recognize how sinful I am and it all goes clear to my heart and wrings
it and I have such terrors and terrors!--oh, they are indescribable,
those terrors that assail me, and I slip out of bed and get on my knees
and pray and pray and promise that I will be good, if I can only have
another chance. And then, you know, in the morning the sun shines out so
lovely, and the birds sing and the whole world is so beautiful, and--_b'
God, I rally!_"

Now I will quote a brief paragraph from this letter which I have a
minute ago spoken of. The writer says:


     You no doubt are at a loss to know who I am. I will tell you. In my
     younger days I was a resident of Hannibal, Mo., and you and I were
     schoolmates attending Mr. Dawson's school along with Sam and Will
     Bowen and Andy Fuqua and others whose names I have forgotten. I was
     then about the smallest boy in school, for my age, and they called
     me little Aleck for short.


I only dimly remember him, but I knew those other people as well as I
knew the town drunkards. I remember Dawson's schoolhouse perfectly. If I
wanted to describe it I could save myself the trouble by conveying the
description of it to these pages from "Tom Sawyer." I can remember the
drowsy and inviting summer sounds that used to float in through the open
windows from that distant boy-Paradise, Cardiff Hill (Holliday's Hill),
and mingle with the murmurs of the studying pupils and make them the
more dreary by the contrast. I remember Andy Fuqua, the oldest pupil--a
man of twenty-five. I remember the youngest pupil, Nannie Owsley, a
child of seven. I remember George Robards, eighteen or twenty years old,
the only pupil who studied Latin. I remember--in some cases vividly, in
others vaguely--the rest of the twenty-five boys and girls. I remember
Mr. Dawson very well. I remember his boy, Theodore, who was as good as
he could be. In fact, he was inordinately good, extravagantly good,
offensively good, detestably good--and he had pop-eyes--and I would have
drowned him if I had had a chance. In that school we were all about on
an equality, and, so far as I remember, the passion of envy had no place
in our hearts, except in the case of Arch Fuqua--the other one's
brother. Of course we all went barefoot in the summer-time. Arch Fuqua
was about my own age--ten or eleven. In the winter we could stand him,
because he wore shoes then, and his great gift was hidden from our sight
and we were enabled to forget it. But in the summer-time he was a
bitterness to us. He was our envy, for he could double back his big toe
and let it fly and you could hear it snap thirty yards. There was not
another boy in the school that could approach this feat. He had not a
rival as regards a physical distinction--except in Theodore Eddy, who
could work his ears like a horse. But he was no real rival, because you
couldn't hear him work his ears; so all the advantage lay with Arch
Fuqua.

I am not done with Dawson's school; I will return to it in a later
chapter.

[_Dictated at Hamilton, Bermuda, January 6, 1907._] "That reminds me."
In conversation we are always using that phrase, and seldom or never
noticing how large a significance it bears. It stands for a curious and
interesting fact, to wit: that sleeping or waking, dreaming or talking,
the thoughts which swarm through our heads are almost constantly,
almost continuously, accompanied by a like swarm of reminders of
incidents and episodes of our past. A man can never know what a large
traffic this commerce of association carries on in our minds until he
sets out to write his autobiography; he then finds that a thought is
seldom born to him that does not immediately remind him of some event,
large or small, in his past experience. Quite naturally these remarks
remind me of various things, among others this: that sometimes a
thought, by the power of association, will bring back to your mind a
lost word or a lost name which you have not been able to recover by any
other process known to your mental equipment. Yesterday we had an
instance of this. Rev. Joseph H. Twichell is with me on this flying trip
to Bermuda. He was with me on my last visit to Bermuda, and to-day we
were trying to remember when it was. We thought it was somewhere in the
neighborhood of thirty years ago, but that was as near as we could get
at the date. Twichell said that the landlady in whose boarding-house we
sojourned in that ancient time could doubtless furnish us the date, and
we must look her up. We wanted to see her, anyway, because she and her
blooming daughter of eighteen were the only persons whose acquaintance
we had made at that time, for we were travelling under fictitious names,
and people who wear aliases are not given to seeking society and
bringing themselves under suspicion. But at this point in our talk we
encountered an obstruction: we could not recall the landlady's name. We
hunted all around through our minds for that name, using all the
customary methods of research, but without success; the name was gone
from us, apparently permanently. We finally gave the matter up, and fell
to talking about something else. The talk wandered from one subject to
another, and finally arrived at Twichell's school-days in Hartford--the
Hartford of something more than half a century ago--and he mentioned
several of his schoolmasters, dwelling with special interest upon the
peculiarities of an aged one named Olney. He remarked that Olney, humble
village schoolmaster as he was, was yet a man of superior parts, and had
published text-books which had enjoyed a wide currency in America in
their day. I said I remembered those books, and had studied Olney's
Geography in school when I was a boy. Then Twichell said,

"That reminds me--our landlady's name was a name that was associated
with school-books of some kind or other fifty or sixty years ago. I
wonder what it was. I believe it began with K."

Association did the rest, and did it instantly. I said,

"Kirkham's Grammar!"

That settled it. Kirkham was the name; and we went out to seek for the
owner of it. There was no trouble about that, for Bermuda is not large,
and is like the earlier Garden of Eden, in that everybody in it knows
everybody else, just as it was in the serpent's headquarters in Adam's
time. We easily found Miss Kirkham--she that had been the blooming girl
of a generation before--and she was still keeping boarders; but her
mother had passed from this life. She settled the date for us, and did
it with certainty, by help of a couple of uncommon circumstances, events
of that ancient time. She said we had sailed from Bermuda on the 24th of
May, 1877, which was the day on which her only nephew was born--and he
is now thirty years of age. The other unusual circumstance--she called
it an unusual circumstance, and I didn't say anything--was that on that
day the Rev. Mr. Twichell (bearing the assumed name of Peters) had made
a statement to her which she regarded as a fiction. I remembered the
circumstance very well. We had bidden the young girl good-by and had
gone fifty yards, perhaps, when Twichell said he had forgotten something
(I doubted it) and must go back. When he rejoined me he was silent, and
this alarmed me, because I had not seen an example of it before. He
seemed quite uncomfortable, and I asked him what the trouble was. He
said he had been inspired to give the girl a pleasant surprise, and so
had gone back and said to her--

"That young fellow's name is not Wilkinson--that's Mark Twain."

She did not lose her mind; she did not exhibit any excitement at all,
but said quite simply, quite tranquilly,

"Tell it to the marines, Mr. Peters--if that should happen to be _your_
name."

It was very pleasant to meet her again. We were white-headed, but she
was not; in the sweet and unvexed spiritual atmosphere of the Bermudas
one does not achieve gray hairs at forty-eight.

I had a dream last night, and of course it was born of association, like
nearly everything else that drifts into a person's head, asleep or
awake. On board ship, on the passage down, Twichell was talking about
the swiftly developing possibilities of aerial navigation, and he quoted
those striking verses of Tennyson's which forecast a future when
air-borne vessels of war shall meet and fight above the clouds and
redden the earth below with a rain of blood. This picture of carnage and
blood and death reminded me of something which I had read a fortnight
ago--statistics of railway accidents compiled by the United States
Government, wherein the appalling fact was set forth that on our 200,000
miles of railway we annually kill 10,000 persons outright and injure
80,000. The war-ships in the air suggested the railway horrors, and
three nights afterward the railway horrors suggested my dream. The work
of association was going on in my head, unconsciously, all that time. It
was an admirable dream, what there was of it.

In it I saw a funeral procession; I saw it from a mountain peak; I saw
it crawling along and curving here and there, serpentlike, through a
level vast plain. I seemed to see a hundred miles of the procession, but
neither the beginning of it nor the end of it was within the limits of
my vision. The procession was in ten divisions, each division marked by
a sombre flag, and the whole represented ten years of our railway
activities in the accident line; each division was composed of 80,000
cripples, and was bearing its own year's 10,000 mutilated corpses to the
grave: in the aggregate 800,000 cripples and 100,000 dead, drenched in
blood!

                                                     MARK TWAIN.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XXII.

BY MARK TWAIN.


[Sidenote: (1890.)]

[_Dictated, October 10, 1906._] Susy has named a number of the friends
who were assembled at Onteora at the time of our visit, but there were
others--among them Laurence Hutton, Charles Dudley Warner, and Carroll
Beckwith, and their wives. It was a bright and jolly company. Some of
those choice spirits are still with us; the others have passed from this
life: Mrs. Clemens, Susy, Mr. Warner, Mary Mapes Dodge, Laurence Hutton,
Dean Sage--peace to their ashes! Susy is in error in thinking Mrs. Dodge
was not there at that time; we were her guests.

We arrived at nightfall, dreary from a tiresome journey; but the
dreariness did not last. Mrs. Dodge had provided a home-made banquet,
and the happy company sat down to it, twenty strong, or more. Then the
thing happened which always happens at large dinners, and is always
exasperating: everybody talked to his elbow-mates and all talked at
once, and gradually raised their voices higher, and higher, and higher,
in the desperate effort to be heard. It was like a riot, an
insurrection; it was an intolerable volume of noise. Presently I said to
the lady next me--

"I will subdue this riot, I will silence this racket. There is only one
way to do it, but I know the art. You must tilt your head toward mine
and seem to be deeply interested in what I am saying; I will talk in a
low voice; then, just because our neighbors won't be able to hear me,
they will _want_ to hear me. If I mumble long enough--say two
minutes--you will see that the dialogues will one after another come to
a standstill, and there will be silence, not a sound anywhere but my
mumbling."

Then in a very low voice I began:

"When I went out to Chicago, eleven years ago, to witness the Grant
festivities, there was a great banquet on the first night, with six
hundred ex-soldiers present. The gentleman who sat next me was Mr. X. X.
He was very hard of hearing, and he had a habit common to deaf people of
shouting his remarks instead of delivering them in an ordinary voice. He
would handle his knife and fork in reflective silence for five or six
minutes at a time and then suddenly fetch out a shout that would make
you jump out of the United States."

By this time the insurrection at Mrs. Dodge's table--at least that part
of it in my immediate neighborhood--had died down, and the silence was
spreading, couple by couple, down the long table. I went on in a lower
and still lower mumble, and most impressively--

"During one of Mr. X. X.'s mute intervals, a man opposite us approached
the end of a story which he had been telling his elbow-neighbor. He was
speaking in a low voice--there was much noise--I was deeply interested,
and straining my ears to catch his words, stretching my neck, holding my
breath, to hear, unconscious of everything but the fascinating tale. I
heard him say, 'At this point he seized her by her long hair--she
shrieking and begging--bent her neck across his knee, and with one awful
sweep of the razor--'

"HOW DO YOU LIKE CHICA-A-AGO?!!!"

That was X. X.'s interruption, hearable at thirty miles. By the time I
had reached that place in my mumblings Mrs. Dodge's dining-room was so
silent, so breathlessly still, that if you had dropped a thought
anywhere in it you could have heard it smack the floor.[18] When I
delivered that yell the entire dinner company jumped as one person, and
punched their heads through the ceiling, damaging it, for it was only
lath and plaster, and it all came down on us, and much of it went into
the victuals and made them gritty, but no one was hurt. Then I explained
why it was that I had played that game, and begged them to take the
moral of it home to their hearts and be rational and merciful
thenceforth, and cease from screaming in mass, and agree to let one
person talk at a time and the rest listen in grateful and unvexed peace.
They granted my prayer, and we had a happy time all the rest of the
evening; I do not think I have ever had a better time in my life. This
was largely because the new terms enabled me to keep the floor--now that
I had it--and do all the talking myself. I do like to hear myself talk.
Susy has exposed this in her Biography of me.

Dean Sage was a delightful man, yet in one way a terror to his friends,
for he loved them so well that he could not refrain from playing
practical jokes on them. We have to be pretty deeply in love with a
person before we can do him the honor of joking familiarly with him.
Dean Sage was the best citizen I have known in America. It takes courage
to be a good citizen, and he had plenty of it. He allowed no individual
and no corporation to infringe his smallest right and escape unpunished.
He was very rich, and very generous, and benevolent, and he gave away
his money with a prodigal hand; but if an individual or corporation
infringed a right of his, to the value of ten cents, he would spend
thousands of dollars' worth of time and labor and money and persistence
on the matter, and would not lower his flag until he had won his battle
or lost it.

He and Rev. Mr. Harris had been classmates in college, and to the day of
Sage's death they were as fond of each other as an engaged pair. It
follows, without saying, that whenever Sage found an opportunity to play
a joke upon Harris, Harris was sure to suffer.

Along about 1873 Sage fell a victim to an illness which reduced him to a
skeleton, and defied all the efforts of the physicians to cure it. He
went to the Adirondacks and took Harris with him. Sage had always been
an active man, and he couldn't idle any day wholly away in inanition,
but walked every day to the limit of his strength. One day, toward
nightfall, the pair came upon a humble log cabin which bore these words
painted upon a shingle: "Entertainment for Man and Beast." They were
obliged to stop there for the night, Sage's strength being exhausted.
They entered the cabin and found its owner and sole occupant there, a
rugged and sturdy and simple-hearted man of middle age. He cooked supper
and placed it before the travellers--salt junk, boiled beans, corn bread
and black coffee. Sage's stomach could abide nothing but the most
delicate food, therefore this banquet revolted him, and he sat at the
table unemployed, while Harris fed ravenously, limitlessly, gratefully;
for he had been chaplain in a fighting regiment all through the war, and
had kept in perfection the grand and uncritical appetite and splendid
physical vigor which those four years of tough fare and activity had
furnished him. Sage went supperless to bed, and tossed and writhed all
night upon a shuck mattress that was full of attentive and interested
corn-cobs. In the morning Harris was ravenous again, and devoured the
odious breakfast as contentedly and as delightedly as he had devoured
its twin the night before. Sage sat upon the porch, empty, and
contemplated the performance and meditated revenge. Presently he
beckoned to the landlord and took him aside and had a confidential talk
with him. He said,

"I am the paymaster. What is the bill?"

"Two suppers, fifty cents; two beds, thirty cents; two breakfasts, fifty
cents--total, a dollar and thirty cents."

Sage said, "Go back and make out the bill and fetch it to me here on the
porch. Make it thirteen dollars."

"Thirteen dollars! Why, it's impossible! I am no robber. I am charging
you what I charge everybody. It's a dollar and thirty cents, and that's
all it is."

"My man, I've got something to say about this as well as you. It's
thirteen dollars. You'll make out your bill for that, and you'll _take_
it, too, or you'll not get a cent."

The man was troubled, and said, "I don't understand this. I can't make
it out."

"Well, I understand it. I know what I am about. It's thirteen dollars,
and I want the bill made out for that. There's no other terms. Get it
ready and bring it out here. I will examine it and be outraged. You
understand? I will dispute the bill. You must stand to it. You must
refuse to take less. I will begin to lose my temper; you must begin to
lose yours. I will call you hard names; you must answer with harder
ones. I will raise my voice; you must raise yours. You must go into a
rage--foam at the mouth, if you can; insert some soap to help it along.
Now go along and follow your instructions."

The man played his assigned part, and played it well. He brought the
bill and stood waiting for results. Sage's face began to cloud up, his
eyes to snap, and his nostrils to inflate like a horse's; then he broke
out with--

"_Thirteen dollars!_ You mean to say that you charge thirteen dollars
for these damned inhuman hospitalities of yours? Are you a professional
buccaneer? Is it your custom to--"

The man burst in with spirit: "Now, I don't want any more out of
you--that's a plenty. The bill is thirteen dollars and you'll _pay_
it--that's all; a couple of characterless adventurers bilking their way
through this country and attempting to dictate terms to a gentleman! a
gentleman who received you supposing you were gentlemen yourselves,
whereas in my opinion hell's full of--"

Sage broke in--

"Not another word of that!--I won't have it. I regard you as the
lowest-down thief that ever--"

"Don't you use that word again! By ----, I'll take you by the neck
and--"

Harris came rushing out, and just as the two were about to grapple he
pushed himself between them and began to implore--

"Oh, Dean, don't, _don't_--now, Mr. Smith, control yourself! Oh, think
of your family, Dean!--think what a scandal--"

But they burst out with maledictions, imprecations and all the hard
names they could dig out of the rich accumulations of their educated
memories, and in the midst of it the man shouted--

"When _gentlemen_ come to this house, I treat them _as_ gentlemen. When
people come to this house with the ordinary appetites of gentlemen, I
charge them a dollar and thirty cents for what I furnished you; but when
a man brings a hell-fired Famine here that gorges a barrel of pork and
four barrels of beans at two sittings--"

Sage broke in, in a voice that was eloquent with remorse and
self-reproach, "I never thought of that, and I ask your pardon; I am
ashamed of myself and of my friend. Here's your thirteen dollars, and my
apologies along with it."


[_Dictated March 12, 1906._] I have always taken a great interest in
other people's duels. One always feels an abiding interest in any heroic
thing which has entered into his own experience.

[Sidenote: (1878.)]

In 1878, fourteen years after my unmaterialized duel, Messieurs Fortu
and Gambetta fought a duel which made heroes of both of them in France,
but made them rather ridiculous throughout the rest of the world. I was
living in Munich that fall and winter, and I was so interested in that
funny tragedy that I wrote a long account of it, and it is in one of my
books, somewhere--an account which had some inaccuracies in it, but as
an exhibition of the _spirit_ of that duel, I think it was correct and
trustworthy. And when I was living in Vienna, thirty-four years after my
ineffectual duel, my interest in that kind of incident was still strong;
and I find here among my Autobiographical manuscripts of that day a
chapter which I began concerning it, but did not finish. I wanted to
finish it, but held it open in the hope that the Italian ambassador, M.
Nigra, would find time to furnish me the _full_ history of Señor
Cavalotti's adventures in that line. But he was a busy man; there was
always an interruption before he could get well started; so my hope was
never fulfilled. The following is the unfinished chapter:


[Sidenote: (1898.)]

     As concerns duelling. This pastime is as common in Austria to-day
     as it is in France. But with this difference, that here in the
     Austrian States the duel is dangerous, while in France it is not.
     Here it is tragedy, in France it in comedy; here it is a solemnity,
     there it is monkey-shines; here the duellist risks his life, there
     he does not even risk his shirt. Here he fights with pistol or
     sabre, in France with a hairpin--a blunt one. Here the desperately
     wounded man tries to walk to the hospital; there they paint the
     scratch so that they can find it again, lay the sufferer on a
     stretcher, and conduct him off the field with a band of music.

     At the end of a French duel the pair hug and kiss and cry, and
     praise each other's valor; then the surgeons make an examination
     and pick out the scratched one, and the other one helps him on to
     the litter and pays his fare; and in return the scratched one
     treats to champagne and oysters in the evening, and then "the
     incident is closed," as the French say. It is all polite, and
     gracious, and pretty, and impressive. At the end of an Austrian
     duel the antagonist that is alive gravely offers his hand to the
     other man, utters some phrases of courteous regret, then bids him
     good-by and goes his way, and that incident also is closed. The
     French duellist is painstakingly protected from danger, by the
     rules of the game. His antagonist's weapon cannot reach so far as
     his body; if he get a scratch it will not be above his elbow. But
     in Austria the rules of the game do not provide against danger,
     they carefully provide _for_ it, usually. Commonly the combat must
     be kept up until one of the men is disabled; a non-disabling slash
     or stab does not retire him.

     For a matter of three months I watched the Viennese journals, and
     whenever a duel was reported in their telegraphic columns I
     scrap-booked it. By this record I find that duelling in Austria is
     not confined to journalists and old maids, as in France, but is
     indulged in by military men, journalists, students, physicians,
     lawyers, members of the legislature, and even the Cabinet, the
     Bench and the police. Duelling is forbidden by law; and so it seems
     odd to see the makers and administrators of the laws dancing on
     their work in this way. Some months ago Count Bodeni, at that time
     Chief of the Government, fought a pistol-duel here in the capital
     city of the Empire with representative Wolf, and both of those
     distinguished Christians came near getting turned out of the
     Church--for the Church as well as the State forbids duelling.

     In one case, lately, in Hungary, the police interfered and stopped
     a duel after the first innings. This was a sabre-duel between the
     chief of police and the city attorney. Unkind things were said
     about it by the newspapers. They said the police remembered their
     duty uncommonly well when their own officials were the parties
     concerned in duels. But I think the underlings showed good
     bread-and-butter judgment. If their superiors had carved each other
     well, the public would have asked, Where were the police? and their
     places would have been endangered; but custom does not require them
     to be around where mere unofficial citizens are explaining a thing
     with sabres.

     There was another duel--a double duel--going on in the immediate
     neighborhood at the time, and in this case the police obeyed custom
     and did not disturb it. Their bread and butter was not at stake
     there. In this duel a physician fought a couple of surgeons, and
     wounded both--one of them lightly, the other seriously. An
     undertaker wanted to keep people from interfering, but that was
     quite natural again.

     Selecting at random from my record, I next find a duel at Tarnopol
     between military men. An officer of the Tenth Dragoons charged an
     officer of the Ninth Dragoons with an offence against the laws of
     the card-table. There was a defect or a doubt somewhere in the
     matter, and this had to be examined and passed upon by a Court of
     Honor. So the case was sent up to Lemberg for this purpose. One
     would like to know what the defect was, but the newspaper does not
     say. A man here who has fought many duels and has a graveyard, says
     that probably the matter in question was as to whether the
     accusation was true or not; that if the charge was a very grave
     one--cheating, for instance--proof of its truth would rule the
     guilty officer out of the field of honor; the Court would not allow
     a gentleman to fight with such a person. You see what a solemn
     thing it is; you see how particular they are; any little careless
     act can lose you your privilege of getting yourself shot, here. The
     Court seems to have gone into the matter in a searching and careful
     fashion, for several months elapsed before it reached a decision.
     It then sanctioned a duel and the accused killed his accuser.

     Next I find a duel between a prince and a major; first with
     pistols--no result satisfactory to either party; then with sabres,
     and the major badly hurt.

     Next, a sabre-duel between journalists--the one a strong man, the
     other feeble and in poor health. It was brief; the strong one drove
     his sword through the weak one, and death was immediate.

     Next, a duel between a lieutenant and a student of medicine.
     According to the newspaper report these are the details. The
     student was in a restaurant one evening: passing along, he halted
     at a table to speak with some friends; near by sat a dozen military
     men; the student conceived that one of these was "staring" at him;
     he asked the officer to step outside and explain. This officer and
     another one gathered up their caps and sabres and went out with the
     student. Outside--this is the student's account--the student
     introduced himself to the offending officer and said, "You seemed
     to stare at me"; for answer, the officer struck at the student with
     his fist; the student parried the blow; both officers drew their
     sabres and attacked the young fellow, and one of them gave him a
     wound on the left arm; then they withdrew. This was Saturday night.
     The duel followed on Monday, in the military riding-school--the
     customary duelling-ground all over Austria, apparently. The weapons
     were pistols. The duelling terms were somewhat beyond custom in the
     matter of severity, if I may gather that from the statement that
     the combat was fought "_unter sehr schweren Bedingungen_"--to wit,
     "Distance, 15 steps--with 3 steps advance." There was but one
     exchange of shots. The student was hit. "He put his hand on his
     breast, his body began to bend slowly forward, then collapsed in
     death and sank to the ground."

     It is pathetic. There are other duels in my list, but I find in
     each and all of them one and the same ever-recurring defect--the
     _principals_ are never present, but only their sham
     representatives. The _real_ principals in any duel are not the
     duellists themselves, but their families. They do the mourning, the
     suffering, theirs is the loss and theirs the misery. They stake all
     that, the duellist stakes nothing but his life, and that is a
     trivial thing compared with what his death must cost those whom he
     leaves behind him. Challenges should not mention the duellist; he
     has nothing much at stake, and the real vengeance cannot reach him.
     The challenge should summon the offender's old gray mother, and his
     young wife and his little children,--these, or any to whom he is a
     dear and worshipped possession--and should say, "You have done me
     no harm, but I am the meek slave of a custom which requires me to
     crush the happiness out of your hearts and condemn you to years of
     pain and grief, in order that I may wash clean with your tears a
     stain which has been put upon me by another person."

     The logic of it is admirable: a person has robbed me of a penny; I
     must beggar ten innocent persons to make good my loss. Surely
     nobody's "honor" is worth all that.

     Since the duellist's family are the real principals in a duel, the
     State ought to compel them to be present at it. Custom, also, ought
     to be so amended as to require it; and without it no duel ought to
     be allowed to go on. If that student's unoffending mother had been
     present and watching the officer through her tears as he raised his
     pistol, he--why, he would have fired in the air. We know that. For
     we know how we are all made. Laws ought to be based upon the
     ascertained facts of our nature. It would be a simple thing to make
     a duelling law which would stop duelling.

     As things are now, the mother is never invited. She submits to
     this; and without outward complaint, for she, too, is the vassal of
     custom, and custom requires her to conceal her pain when she learns
     the disastrous news that her son must go to the duelling-field, and
     by the powerful force that is lodged in habit and custom she is
     enabled to obey this trying requirement--a requirement which exacts
     a miracle of her, and gets it. Last January a neighbor of ours who
     has a young son in the army was wakened by this youth at three
     o'clock one morning, and she sat up in bed and listened to his
     message:

     "I have come to tell you something, mother, which will distress
     you, but you must be good and brave, and bear it. I have been
     affronted by a fellow officer, and we fight at three this
     afternoon. Lie down and sleep, now, and think no more about it."

     She kissed him good night and lay down paralyzed with grief and
     fear, but said nothing. But she did not sleep; she prayed and
     mourned till the first streak of dawn, then fled to the nearest
     church and implored the Virgin for help; and from that church she
     went to another and another and another; church after church, and
     still church after church, and so spent all the day until three
     o'clock on her knees in agony and tears; then dragged herself home
     and sat down comfortless and desolate, to count the minutes, and
     wait, with an outward show of calm, for what had been ordained for
     her--happiness, or endless misery. Presently she heard the clank of
     a sabre--she had not known before what music was in that
     sound!--and her son put his head in and said:

     "X was in the wrong, and he apologized."

     So that incident was closed; and for the rest of her life the
     mother will always find something pleasant about the clank of a
     sabre, no doubt.

     In one of my listed duels--however, let it go, there is nothing
     particularly striking about it except that the seconds interfered.
     And prematurely, too, for neither man was dead. This was certainly
     irregular. Neither of the men liked it. It was a duel with cavalry
     sabres, between an editor and a lieutenant. The editor walked to
     the hospital, the lieutenant was carried. In this country an editor
     who can write well is valuable, but he is not likely to remain so
     unless he can handle a sabre with charm.

     The following very recent telegram shows that also in France duels
     are humanely stopped as soon as they approach the (French)
     danger-point:

     "_Reuter's Telegram._--PARIS, _March 5_.--The duel between Colonels
     Henry and Picquart took place this morning in the Riding School of
     the Ecole Militaire, the doors of which were strictly guarded in
     order to prevent intrusion. The combatants, who fought with swords,
     were in position at ten o'clock.

     "At the first reengagement Lieutenant-Colonel Henry was slightly
     scratched in the fore arm, and just at the same moment his own
     blade appeared to touch his adversary's neck. Senator Ranc, who was
     Colonel Picquart's second, stopped the fight, but as it was found
     that his principal had not been touched, the combat continued. A
     very sharp encounter ensued, in which Colonel Henry was wounded in
     the elbow, and the duel terminated."

     After which, the stretcher and the band. In lurid contrast with
     this delicate flirtation, we have this fatal duel of day before
     yesterday in Italy, where the earnest Austrian duel is in vogue. I
     knew Cavalotti slightly, and this gives me a sort of personal
     interest in his duel. I first saw him in Rome several years ago. He
     was sitting on a block of stone in the Forum, and was writing
     something in his note-book--a poem or a challenge, or something
     like that--and the friend who pointed him out to me said, "That is
     Cavalotti--he has fought thirty duels; do not disturb him." I did
     not disturb him.


[_May 13, 1907._] It is a long time ago. Cavalotti--poet, orator,
satirist, statesman, patriot--was a great man, and his death was deeply
lamented by his countrymen: many monuments to his memory testify to
this. In his duels he killed several of his antagonists and disabled the
rest. By nature he was a little irascible. Once when the officials of
the library of Bologna threw out his books the gentle poet went up there
and challenged the whole fifteen! His parliamentary duties were
exacting, but he proposed to keep coming up and fighting duels between
trains until all those officials had been retired from the activities of
life. Although he always chose the sword to fight with, he had never had
a lesson with that weapon. When game was called he waited for nothing,
but always plunged at his opponent and rained such a storm of wild and
original thrusts and whacks upon him that the man was dead or crippled
before he could bring his science to bear. But his latest antagonist
discarded science, and won. He held his sword straight forward like a
lance when Cavalotti made his plunge--with the result that he impaled
himself upon it. It entered his mouth and passed out at the back of his
neck. Death was instantaneous.


[_Dictated December 20, 1906._] Six months ago, when I was recalling
early days in San Francisco, I broke off at a place where I was about
to tell about Captain Osborn's odd adventure at the "What Cheer," or
perhaps it was at another cheap feeding-place--the "Miners' Restaurant."
It was a place where one could get good food on the cheapest possible
terms, and its popularity was great among the multitudes whose purses
were light It was a good place to go to, to observe mixed humanity.
Captain Osborn and Bret Harte went there one day and took a meal, and in
the course of it Osborn fished up an interesting reminiscence of a dozen
years before and told about it. It was to this effect:

He was a midshipman in the navy when the Californian gold craze burst
upon the world and set it wild with excitement. His ship made the long
journey around the Horn and was approaching her goal, the Golden Gate,
when an accident happened.

"It happened to me," said Osborn. "I fell overboard. There was a heavy
sea running, but no one was much alarmed about me, because we had on
board a newly patented life-saving device which was believed to be
competent to rescue anything that could fall overboard, from a
midshipman to an anchor. Ours was the only ship that had this device; we
were very proud of it, and had been anxious to give its powers a
practical test. This thing was lashed to the garboard-strake of the
main-to'gallant mizzen-yard amidships,[19] and there was nothing to do
but cut the lashings and heave it over; it would do the rest. One day
the cry of 'Man overboard!' brought all hands on deck. Instantly the
lashings were cut and the machine flung joyously over. Damnation, it
went to the bottom like an anvil! By the time that the ship was brought
to and a boat manned, I was become but a bobbing speck on the waves half
a mile astern and losing my strength very fast; but by good luck there
was a common seaman on board who had practical ideas in his head and
hadn't waited to see what the patent machine was going to do, but had
run aft and sprung over after me the moment the alarm was cried through
the ship. I had a good deal of a start of him, and the seas made his
progress slow and difficult, but he stuck to his work and fought his way
to me, and just in the nick of time he put his saving arms about me when
I was about to go down. He held me up until the boat reached us and
rescued us. By that time I was unconscious, and I was still unconscious
when we arrived at the ship. A dangerous fever followed, and I was
delirious for three days; then I come to myself and at once inquired
for my benefactor, of course. He was gone. We were lying at anchor in
the Bay and every man had deserted to the gold-mines except the
commissioned officers. I found out nothing about my benefactor but his
name--Burton Sanders--a name which I have held in grateful memory ever
since. Every time I have been on the Coast, these twelve or thirteen
years, I have tried to get track of him, but have never succeeded. I
wish I could find him and make him understand that his brave act has
never been forgotten by me. Harte, I would rather see him and take him
by the hand than any other man on the planet."

At this stage or a little later there was an interruption. A waiter near
by said to another waiter, pointing,

"Take a look at that tramp that's coming in. Ain't that the one that
bilked the house, last week, out of ten cents?"

"I believe it is. Let him alone--don't pay any attention to him; wait
till we can get a good look at him."

The tramp approached timidly and hesitatingly, with the air of one
unsure and apprehensive. The waiters watched him furtively. When he was
passing behind Harte's chair one of them said,

"He's the one!"--and they pounced upon him and proposed to turn him over
to the police as a bilk. He begged piteously. He confessed his guilt,
but said he had been driven to his crime by necessity--that when he had
eaten the plate of beans and flipped out without paying for it, it was
because he was starving, and hadn't the ten cents to pay for it with.
But the waiters would listen to no explanations, no palliations; he must
be placed in custody. He brushed his hand across his eyes and said
meekly that he would submit, being friendless. Each waiter took him by
an arm and faced him about to conduct him away. Then his melancholy eyes
fell upon Captain Osborn, and a light of glad and eager recognition
flashed from them. He said,

"Weren't you a midshipman once, sir, in the old 'Lancaster'?"

"Yes," said Osborn. "Why?"

"Didn't you fall overboard?"

"Yes, I did. How do you come to know about it?"

"Wasn't there a new patent machine aboard, and didn't they throw it over
to save you?"

"Why, yes," said Osborn, laughing gently, "but it didn't do it."

"No, sir, it was a sailor that done it."

"It certainly was. Look here, my man, you are getting distinctly
interesting. Were you of our crew?"

"Yes, sir, I was."

"I reckon you may be right. You do certainly know a good deal about that
incident. What is your name?"

"Burton Sanders."

The Captain sprang up, excited, and said,

"Give me your hand! Give me both your hands! I'd rather shake them than
inherit a fortune!"--and then he cried to the waiters, "Let him
go!--take your hands off! He is my guest, and can have anything and
everything this house is able to furnish. I am responsible."

There was a love-feast, then. Captain Osborn ordered it regardless of
expense, and he and Harte sat there and listened while the man told
stirring adventures of his life and fed himself up to the eyebrows. Then
Osborn wanted to be benefactor in his turn, and pay back some of his
debt. The man said it could all be paid with ten dollars--that it had
been so long since he had owned that amount of money that it would seem
a fortune to him, and he should be grateful beyond words if the Captain
could spare him that amount. The Captain spared him ten broad
twenty-dollar gold pieces, and made him take them in spite of his modest
protestations, and gave him his address and said he must never fail to
give him notice when he needed grateful service.

Several months later Harte stumbled upon the man in the street. He was
most comfortably drunk, and pleasant and chatty. Harte remarked upon the
splendidly and movingly dramatic incident of the restaurant, and said,

"How curious and fortunate and happy and interesting it was that you two
should come together, after that long separation, and at exactly the
right moment to save you from disaster and turn your defeat by the
waiters into a victory. A preacher could make a great sermon out of
that, for it does look as if the hand of Providence was in it."

The hero's face assumed a sweetly genial expression, and he said,

"Well now, it wasn't Providence this time. I was running the
arrangements myself."

"How do you mean?"

"Oh, I hadn't ever seen the gentleman before. I was at the next table,
with my back to you the whole time he was telling about it. I saw my
chance, and slipped out and fetched the two waiters with me and offered
to give them a commission out of what I could get out of the Captain if
they would do a quarrel act with me and give me an opening. So, then,
after a minute or two I straggled back, and you know the rest of it as
well as I do."

                                                     MARK TWAIN.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XXIII.

BY MARK TWAIN.


[Sidenote: (1845.)]

[_Dictated March 9, 1906._] ... I am talking of a time sixty years ago,
and upwards. I remember the names of some of those schoolmates, and, by
fitful glimpses, even their faces rise dimly before me for a
moment--only just long enough to be recognized; then they vanish. I
catch glimpses of George Robards, the Latin pupil--slender, pale,
studious, bending over his book and absorbed in it, his long straight
black hair hanging down below his jaws like a pair of curtains on the
sides of his face. I can see him give his head a toss and flirt one of
the curtains back around his head--to get it out of his way, apparently;
really to show off. In that day it was a great thing among the boys to
have hair of so flexible a sort that it could be flung back in that way,
with a flirt of the head. George Robards was the envy of us all. For
there was no hair among us that was so competent for this exhibition as
his--except, perhaps, the yellow locks of Will Bowen and John Robards.
My hair was a dense ruck of short curls, and so was my brother Henry's.
We tried all kinds of devices to get these crooks straightened out so
that they would flirt, but we never succeeded. Sometimes, by soaking our
heads and then combing and brushing our hair down tight and flat to our
skulls, we could get it straight, temporarily, and this gave us a
comforting moment of joy; but the first time we gave it a flirt it all
shrivelled into curls again and our happiness was gone.

John Robards was the little brother of George; he was a wee chap with
silky golden curtains to his face which dangled to his shoulders and
below, and could be flung back ravishingly. When he was twelve years old
he crossed the plains with his father amidst the rush of the
gold-seekers of '49; and I remember the departure of the cavalcade when
it spurred westward. We were all there to see and to envy. And I can
still see that proud little chap sailing by on a great horse, with his
long locks streaming out behind. We were all on hand to gaze and envy
when he returned, two years later, in unimaginable glory--_for he had
travelled_! None of us had ever been forty miles from home. But he had
crossed the Continent. He had been in the gold-mines, that fairyland of
our imagination. And he had done a still more wonderful thing. He had
been in ships--in ships on the actual ocean; in ships on three actual
oceans. For he had sailed down the Pacific and around the Horn among
icebergs and through snow-storms and wild wintry gales, and had sailed
on and turned the corner and flown northward in the trades and up
through the blistering equatorial waters--and there in his brown face
were the proofs of what he had been through. We would have sold our
souls to Satan for the privilege of trading places with him.

I saw him when I was out on that Missouri trip four years ago. He was
old then--though not quite so old as I--and the burden of life was upon
him. He said his granddaughter, twelve years old, had read my books and
would like to see me. It was a pathetic time, for she was a prisoner in
her room and marked for death. And John knew that she was passing
swiftly away. Twelve years old--just her grandfather's age when he rode
away on that great journey with his yellow hair flapping behind him. In
her I seemed to see that boy again. It was as if he had come back out of
that remote past and was present before me in his golden youth. Her
malady was heart disease, and her brief life came to a close a few days
later.

Another of those schoolboys was John Garth. He became a prosperous
banker and a prominent and valued citizen; and a few years ago he died,
rich and honored. _He died._ It is what I have to say about so many of
those boys and girls. The widow still lives, and there are
grandchildren. In her pantalette days and my barefoot days she was a
schoolmate of mine. I saw John's tomb when I made that Missouri visit.

Her father, Mr. Kercheval, had an apprentice in the early days when I
was nine years old, and he had also a slave woman who had many merits.
But I can't feel very kindly or forgivingly toward either that good
apprentice boy or that good slave woman, for they saved my life. One day
when I was playing on a loose log which I supposed was attached to a
raft--but it wasn't--it tilted me into Bear Creek. And when I had been
under water twice and was coming up to make the third and fatal descent
my fingers appeared above the water and that slave woman seized them and
pulled me out. Within a week I was in again, and that apprentice had to
come along just at the wrong time, and he plunged in and dived, pawed
around on the bottom and found me, and dragged me out and emptied the
water out of me, and I was saved again. I was drowned seven times after
that before I learned to swim--once in Bear Creek and six times in the
Mississippi. I do not now know who the people were who interfered with
the intentions of a Providence wiser than themselves, but I hold a
grudge against them yet. When I told the tale of these remarkable
happenings to Rev. Dr. Burton of Hartford, he said he did not believe
it. _He slipped on the ice the very next year and sprained his ankle._

Will Bowen was another schoolmate, and so was his brother, Sam, who was
his junior by a couple of years. Before the Civil War broke out, both
became St. Louis and New Orleans pilots. Both are dead, long ago.

[Sidenote: (1845.)]

[_Dictated March 16, 1906._] We will return to those schoolchildren of
sixty years ago. I recall Mary Miller. She was not my first sweetheart,
but I think she was the first one that furnished me a broken heart. I
fell in love with her when she was eighteen and I was nine, but she
scorned me, and I recognized that this was a cold world. I had not
noticed that temperature before. I believe I was as miserable as even a
grown man could be. But I think that this sorrow did not remain with me
long. As I remember it, I soon transferred my worship to Artimisia
Briggs, who was a year older than Mary Miller. When I revealed my
passion to her she did not scoff at it. She did not make fun of it. She
was very kind and gentle about it. But she was also firm, and said she
did not want to be pestered by children.

And there was Mary Lacy. She was a schoolmate. But she also was out of
my class because of her advanced age. She was pretty wild and determined
and independent. But she married, and at once settled down and became in
all ways a model matron and was as highly respected as any matron in the
town. Four years ago she was still living, and had been married fifty
years.

Jimmie McDaniel was another schoolmate. His age and mine about tallied.
His father kept the candy-shop and he was the most envied little chap in
the town--after Tom Blankenship ("Huck Finn")--for although we never saw
him eating candy, we supposed that it was, nevertheless, his ordinary
diet. He pretended that he never ate it, and didn't care for it because
there was nothing forbidden about it--there was plenty of it and he
could have as much of it as he wanted. He was the first human being to
whom I ever told a humorous story, so far as I can remember. This was
about Jim Wolfe and the cats; and I gave him that tale the morning after
that memorable episode. I thought he would laugh his teeth out. I had
never been so proud and happy before, and have seldom been so proud and
happy since. I saw him four years ago when I was out there. He wore a
beard, gray and venerable, that came half-way down to his knees, and yet
it was not difficult for me to recognize him. He had been married
fifty-four years. He had many children and grandchildren and
great-grandchildren, and also even posterity, they all said--
thousands--yet the boy to whom I had told the cat story when we were
callow juveniles was still present in that cheerful little old man.

Artimisia Briggs got married not long after refusing me. She married
Richmond, the stone mason, who was my Methodist Sunday-school teacher in
the earliest days, and he had one distinction which I envied him: at
some time or other he had hit his thumb with his hammer and the result
was a thumb nail which remained permanently twisted and distorted and
curved and pointed, like a parrot's beak. I should not consider it an
ornament now, I suppose, but it had a fascination for me then, and a
vast value, because it was the only one in the town. He was a very
kindly and considerate Sunday-school teacher, and patient and
compassionate, so he was the favorite teacher with us little chaps. In
that school they had slender oblong pasteboard blue tickets, each with a
verse from the Testament printed on it, and you could get a blue ticket
by reciting two verses. By reciting five verses you could get three blue
tickets, and you could trade these at the bookcase and borrow a book for
a week. I was under Mr. Richmond's spiritual care every now and then for
two or three years, and he was never hard upon me. I always recited the
same five verses every Sunday. He was always satisfied with the
performance. He never seemed to notice that these were the same five
foolish virgins that he had been hearing about every Sunday for months.
I always got my tickets and exchanged them for a book. They were pretty
dreary books, for there was not a bad boy in the entire bookcase. They
were _all_ good boys and good girls and drearily uninteresting, but they
were better society than none, and I was glad to have their company and
disapprove of it.

[Sidenote: (1849.)]

Twenty years ago Mr. Richmond had become possessed of Tom Sawyer's cave
in the hills three miles from town, and had made a tourist-resort of it.
In 1849 when the gold-seekers were streaming through our little town of
Hannibal, many of our grown men got the gold fever, and I think that all
the boys had it. On the Saturday holidays in summer-time we used to
borrow skiffs whose owners were not present and go down the river three
miles to the cave hollow (Missourian for "valley"), and there we staked
out claims and pretended to dig gold, panning out half a dollar a day at
first; two or three times as much, later, and by and by whole fortunes,
as our imaginations became inured to the work. Stupid and unprophetic
lads! We were doing this in play and never suspecting. Why, that cave
hollow and all the adjacent hills were made of gold! But we did not know
it. We took it for dirt. We left its rich secret in its own peaceful
possession and grew up in poverty and went wandering about the world
struggling for bread--and this because we had not the gift of prophecy.
That region was all dirt and rocks to us, yet all it needed was to be
ground up and scientifically handled and it was gold. That is to say,
the whole region was a cement-mine--and they make the finest kind of
Portland cement there now, five thousand barrels a day, with a plant
that cost $2,000,000.

For a little while Reuel Gridley attended that school of ours. He was an
elderly pupil; he was perhaps twenty-two or twenty-three years old. Then
came the Mexican War and he volunteered. A company of infantry was
raised in our town and Mr. Hickman, a tall, straight, handsome athlete
of twenty-five, was made captain of it and had a sword by his side and a
broad yellow stripe down the leg of his gray pants. And when that
company marched back and forth through the streets in its smart
uniform--which it did several times a day for drill--its evolutions were
attended by all the boys whenever the school hours permitted. I can see
that marching company yet, and I can almost feel again the consuming
desire that I had to join it. But they had no use for boys of twelve and
thirteen, and before I had a chance in another war the desire to kill
people to whom I had not been introduced had passed away.

I saw the splendid Hickman in his old age. He seemed about the oldest
man I had ever seen--an amazing and melancholy contrast with the showy
young captain I had seen preparing his warriors for carnage so many,
many years before. Hickman is dead--it is the old story. As Susy said,
"What is it all for?"

Reuel Gridley went away to the wars and we heard of him no more for
fifteen or sixteen years. Then one day in Carson City while I was having
a difficulty with an editor on the sidewalk--an editor better built for
war than I was--I heard a voice say, "Give him the best you've got, Sam,
I'm at your back." It was Reuel Gridley. He said he had not recognized
me by my face but by my drawling style of speech.

He went down to the Reese River mines about that time and presently he
lost an election bet in his mining camp, and by the terms of it he was
obliged to buy a fifty-pound sack of self-raising flour and carry it
through the town, preceded by music, and deliver it to the winner of the
bet. Of course the whole camp was present and full of fluid and
enthusiasm. The winner of the bet put up the sack at auction for the
benefit of the United States Sanitary Fund, and sold it. The excitement
grew and grew. The sack was sold over and over again for the benefit of
the Fund. The news of it came to Virginia City by telegraph. It produced
great enthusiasm, and Reuel Gridley was begged by telegraph to bring the
sack and have an auction in Virginia City. He brought it. An open
barouche was provided, also a brass band. The sack was sold over and
over again at Gold Hill, then was brought up to Virginia City toward
night and sold--and sold again, and again, and still again, netting
twenty or thirty thousand dollars for the Sanitary Fund. Gridley carried
it across California and sold it at various towns. He sold it for large
sums in Sacramento and in San Francisco. He brought it East, sold it in
New York and in various other cities, then carried it out to a great
Fair at St. Louis, and went on selling it; and finally made it up into
small cakes and sold those at a dollar apiece. First and last, the sack
of flour which had originally cost ten dollars, perhaps, netted more
than two hundred thousand dollars for the Sanitary Fund. Reuel Gridley
has been dead these many, many years--it is the old story.

In that school were the first Jews I had ever seen. It took me a good
while to get over the awe of it. To my fancy they were clothed invisibly
in the damp and cobwebby mould of antiquity. They carried me back to
Egypt, and in imagination I moved among the Pharaohs and all the shadowy
celebrities of that remote age. The name of the boys was Levin. We had a
collective name for them which was the only really large and handsome
witticism that was ever born in that Congressional district. We called
them "Twenty-two"--and even when the joke was old and had been worn
threadbare we always followed it with the explanation, to make sure that
it would be understood, "Twice Levin--twenty-two."

There were other boys whose names remain with me. Irving Ayres--but no
matter, he is dead. Then there was George Butler, whom I remember as a
child of seven wearing a blue leather belt with a brass buckle, and
hated and envied by all the boys on account of it. He was a nephew of
General Ben Butler and fought gallantly at Ball's Bluff and in several
other actions of the Civil War. He is dead, long and long ago.

Will Bowen (dead long ago), Ed Stevens (dead long ago) and John Briggs
were special mates of mine. John is still living.

[Sidenote: (1845.)]

In 1845, when I was ten years old, there was an epidemic of measles in
the town and it made a most alarming slaughter among the little people.
There was a funeral almost daily, and the mothers of the town were
nearly demented with fright. My mother was greatly troubled. She worried
over Pamela and Henry and me, and took constant and extraordinary pains
to keep us from coming into contact with the contagion. But upon
reflection I believed that her judgment was at fault. It seemed to me
that I could improve upon it if left to my own devices. I cannot
remember now whether I was frightened about the measles or not, but I
clearly remember that I grew very tired of the suspense I suffered on
account of being continually under the threat of death. I remember that
I got so weary of it and so anxious to have the matter settled one way
or the other, and promptly, that this anxiety spoiled my days and my
nights. I had no pleasure in them. I made up my mind to end this
suspense and be done with it. Will Bowen was dangerously ill with the
measles and I thought I would go down there and catch them. I entered
the house by the front way and slipped along through rooms and halls,
keeping sharp watch against discovery, and at last I reached Will's
bed-chamber in the rear of the house on the second floor and got into it
uncaptured. But that was as far as my victory reached. His mother caught
me there a moment later and snatched me out of the house and gave me a
most competent scolding and drove me away. She was so scared that she
could hardly get her words out, and her face was white. I saw that I
must manage better next time, and I did. I hung about the lane at the
rear of the house and watched through cracks in the fence until I was
convinced that the conditions were favorable; then I slipped through the
back yard and up the back way and got into the room and into the bed
with Will Bowen without being observed. I don't know how long I was in
the bed. I only remember that Will Bowen, as society, had no value for
me, for he was too sick to even notice that I was there. When I heard
his mother coming I covered up my head, but that device was a failure.
It was dead summer-time--the cover was nothing more than a limp blanket
or sheet, and anybody could see that there were two of us under it. It
didn't remain two very long. Mrs. Bowen snatched me out of the bed and
conducted me home herself, with a grip on my collar which she never
loosened until she delivered me into my mother's hands along with her
opinion of that kind of a boy.

It was a good case of measles that resulted. It brought me within a
shade of death's door. It brought me to where I no longer took any
interest in anything, but, on the contrary, felt a total absence of
interest--which was most placid and enchanting. I have never enjoyed
anything in my life any more than I enjoyed dying that time. I _was_, in
effect, dying. The word had been passed and the family notified to
assemble around the bed and see me off. I knew them all. There was no
doubtfulness in my vision. They were all crying, but that did not affect
me. I took but the vaguest interest in it, and that merely because I was
the centre of all this emotional attention and was gratified by it and
vain of it.

When Dr. Cunningham had made up his mind that nothing more could be done
for me he put bags of hot ashes all over me. He put them on my breast,
on my wrists, on my ankles; and so, very much to his astonishment--and
doubtless to my regret--he dragged me back into this world and set me
going again.

[_Dictated July 26, 1907._] In an article entitled "England's Ovation to
Mark Twain," Sydney Brooks--but never mind that, now.

I was in Oxford by seven o'clock that evening (June 25, 1907), and
trying on the scarlet gown which the tailor had been constructing, and
found it right--right and surpassingly becoming. At half past ten the
next morning we assembled at All Souls College and marched thence,
gowned, mortar-boarded and in double file, down a long street to the
Sheldonian Theatre, between solid walls of the populace, very much
hurrah'd and limitlessly kodak'd. We made a procession of considerable
length and distinction and picturesqueness, with the Chancellor, Lord
Curzon, late Viceroy of India, in his rich robe of black and gold, in
the lead, followed by a pair of trim little boy train-bearers, and the
train-bearers followed by the young Prince Arthur of Connaught, who was
to be made a D.C.L. The detachment of D.C.L.'s were followed by the
Doctors of Science, and these by the Doctors of Literature, and these
in turn by the Doctors of Music. Sidney Colvin marched in front of me; I
was coupled with Sidney Lee, and Kipling followed us; General Booth, of
the Salvation Army, was in the squadron of D.C.L.'s.

Our journey ended, we were halted in a fine old hall whence we could
see, through a corridor of some length, the massed audience in the
theatre. Here for a little time we moved about and chatted and made
acquaintanceships; then the D.C.L.'s were summoned, and they marched
through that corridor and the shouting began in the theatre. It would be
some time before the Doctors of Literature and of Science would be
called for, because each of those D.C.L.'s had to have a couple of Latin
speeches made over him before his promotion would be complete--one by
the Regius Professor of Civil Law, the other by the Chancellor. After a
while I asked Sir William Ramsay if a person might smoke here and not
get shot. He said, "Yes," but that whoever did it and got caught would
be fined a guinea, and perhaps hanged later. He said he knew of a place
where we could accomplish at least as much as half of a smoke before any
informers would be likely to chance upon us, and he was ready to show
the way to any who might be willing to risk the guinea and the hanging.
By request he led the way, and Kipling, Sir Norman Lockyer and I
followed. We crossed an unpopulated quadrangle and stood under one of
its exits--an archway of massive masonry--and there we lit up and began
to take comfort. The photographers soon arrived, but they were courteous
and friendly and gave us no trouble, and we gave them none. They grouped
us in all sorts of ways and photographed us at their diligent leisure,
while we smoked and talked. We were there more than an hour; then we
returned to headquarters, happy, content, and greatly refreshed.
Presently we filed into the theatre, under a very satisfactory hurrah,
and waited in a crimson column, dividing the crowded pit through the
middle, until each of us in his turn should be called to stand before
the Chancellor and hear our merits set forth in sonorous Latin.
Meantime, Kipling and I wrote autographs until some good kind soul
interfered in our behalf and procured for us a rest.

I will now save what is left of my modesty by quoting a paragraph from
Sydney Brooks's "Ovation."

       *       *       *       *       *

Let those stars take the place of it for the present. Sydney Brooks has
done it well. It makes me proud to read it; as proud as I was in that
old day, sixty-two years ago, when I lay dying, the centre of
attraction, with one eye piously closed upon the fleeting vanities of
this life--an excellent effect--and the other open a crack to observe
the tears, the sorrow, the admiration--all for me--all for me!

Ah, that was the proudest moment of my long life--until Oxford!

       *       *       *       *       *

Most Americans have been to Oxford and will remember what a dream of the
Middle Ages it is, with its crooked lanes, its gray and stately piles of
ancient architecture and its meditation-breeding air of repose and
dignity and unkinship with the noise and fret and hurry and bustle of
these modern days. As a dream of the Middle Ages Oxford was not perfect
until Pageant day arrived and furnished certain details which had been
for generations lacking. These details began to appear at mid-afternoon
on the 27th. At that time singles, couples, groups and squadrons of the
three thousand five hundred costumed characters who were to take part in
the Pageant began to ooze and drip and stream through house doors, all
over the old town, and wend toward the meadows outside the walls. Soon
the lanes were thronged with costumes which Oxford had from time to time
seen and been familiar with in bygone centuries--fashions of dress which
marked off centuries as by dates, and mile-stoned them back, and back,
and back, until history faded into legend and tradition, when Arthur was
a fact and the Round Table a reality. In this rich commingling of quaint
and strange and brilliantly colored fashions in dress the dress-changes
of Oxford for twelve centuries stood livid and realized to the eye;
Oxford as a dream of the Middle Ages was complete now as it had never,
in our day, before been complete; at last there was no discord; the
mouldering old buildings, and the picturesque throngs drifting past
them, were in harmony; soon--astonishingly soon!--the only persons that
seemed out of place, and grotesquely and offensively and criminally out
of place were such persons as came intruding along clothed in the ugly
and odious fashions of the twentieth century; they were a bitterness to
the feelings, an insult to the eye.

The make-ups of illustrious historic personages seemed perfect, both as
to portraiture and costume; one had no trouble in recognizing them.
Also, I was apparently quite easily recognizable myself. The first
corner I turned brought me suddenly face to face with Henry VIII, a
person whom I had been implacably disliking for sixty years; but when he
put out his hand with royal courtliness and grace and said, "Welcome,
well-beloved stranger, to my century and to the hospitalities of my
realm," my old prejudices vanished away and I forgave him. I think now
that Henry the Eighth has been over-abused, and that most of us, if we
had been situated as he was, domestically, would not have been able to
get along with as limited a graveyard as he forced himself to put up
with. I feel now that he was one of the nicest men in history. Personal
contact with a king is more effective in removing baleful prejudices
than is any amount of argument drawn from tales and histories. If I had
a child I would name it Henry the Eighth, regardless of sex.

Do you remember Charles the First?--and his broad slouch with the plume
in it? and his slender, tall figure? and his body clothed in velvet
doublet with lace sleeves, and his legs in leather, with long rapier at
his side and his spurs on his heels? I encountered him at the next
corner, and knew him in a moment--knew him as perfectly and as vividly
as I should know the Grand Chain in the Mississippi if I should see it
from the pilot-house after all these years. He bent his body and gave
his hat a sweep that fetched its plume within an inch of the ground, and
gave me a welcome that went to my heart. This king has been much
maligned; I shall understand him better hereafter, and shall regret him
more than I have been in the habit of doing these fifty or sixty years.
He did some things in his time, which might better have been left
undone, and which cast a shadow upon his name--we all know that, we all
concede it--but our error has been in regarding them as crimes and in
calling them by that name, whereas I perceive now that they were only
indiscretions. At every few steps I met persons of deathless name whom I
had never encountered before outside of pictures and statuary and
history, and these were most thrilling and charming encounters. I had
hand-shakes with Henry the Second, who had not been seen in the Oxford
streets for nearly eight hundred years; and with the Fair Rosamond, whom
I now believe to have been chaste and blameless, although I had thought
differently about it before; and with Shakespeare, one of the
pleasantest foreigners I have ever gotten acquainted with; and with
Roger Bacon; and with Queen Elizabeth, who talked five minutes and never
swore once--a fact which gave me a new and good opinion of her and moved
me to forgive her for beheading the Scottish Mary, if she really did it,
which I now doubt; and with the quaintly and anciently clad young King
Harold Harefoot, of near nine hundred years ago, who came flying by on a
bicycle and smoking a pipe, but at once checked up and got off to shake
with me; and also I met a bishop who had lost his way because this was
the first time he had been inside the walls of Oxford for as much as
twelve hundred years or thereabouts. By this time I had grown so used to
the obliterated ages and their best-known people that if I had met Adam
I should not have been either surprised or embarrassed; and if he had
come in a racing automobile and a cloud of dust, with nothing on but his
fig-leaf, it would have seemed to me all right and harmonious.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XXIV.

BY MARK TWAIN.

_From Susy's Biography of Me_ [1885-6].


     Mamma and papa have returned from Onteora and they have had a
     delightful visit. Mr. Frank Stockton was down in Virginia and could
     not reach Onteora in time, so they did not see him, and Mrs. Mary
     Mapes Dodge was ill and couldn't go to Onteora, but Mrs. General
     Custer was there, and mamma said that she was a very attractive,
     sweet appearing woman.


[_Dictated October 9, 1906._] Onteora was situated high up in the
Catskill Mountains, in the centre of a far-reaching solitude. I do not
mean that the region was wholly uninhabited; there were farmhouses here
and there, at generous distances apart. Their occupants were descendants
of ancestors who had built the houses in Rip Van Winkle's time, or
earlier; and those ancestors were not more primitive than were this
posterity of theirs. The city people were as foreign and unfamiliar and
strange to them as monkeys would have been, and they would have
respected the monkeys as much as they respected these elegant
summer-resorters. The resorters were a puzzle to them, their ways were
so strange and their interests so trivial. They drove the resorters over
the mountain roads and listened in shamed surprise at their bursts of
enthusiasm over the scenery. The farmers had had that scenery on
exhibition from their mountain roosts all their lives, and had never
noticed anything remarkable about it. By way of an incident: a pair of
these primitives were overheard chatting about the resorters, one day,
and in the course of their talk this remark was dropped:

"I was a-drivin' a passel of 'em round about yisterday evenin', quiet
ones, you know, still and solemn, and all to wunst they busted out to
make your hair lift and I judged hell was to pay. Now what do you reckon
it was? It wa'n't anything but jest one of them common damned yaller
sunsets."

In those days--

[_Tuesday, October 16, 1906._] ... Warner is gone. Stockton is gone. I
attended both funerals. Warner was a near neighbor, from the autumn of
'71 until his death, nineteen years afterward. It is not the privilege
of the most of us to have many intimate friends--a dozen is our
aggregate--but I think he could count his by the score. It is seldom
that a man is so beloved by both sexes and all ages as Warner was. There
was a charm about his spirit, and his ways, and his words, that won all
that came within the sphere of its influence. Our children adopted him
while they were little creatures, and thenceforth, to the end, he was
"Cousin Charley" to them. He was "Uncle Charley" to the children of more
than one other friend. Mrs. Clemens was very fond of him, and he always
called her by her first name--shortened. Warner died, as she died, and
as I would die--without premonition, without a moment's warning.

Uncle Remus still lives, and must be over a thousand years old. Indeed,
I know that this must be so, because I have seen a new photograph of him
in the public prints within the last month or so, and in that picture
his aspects are distinctly and strikingly geological, and one can see he
is thinking about the mastodons and plesiosaurians that he used to play
with when he was young.

It is just a quarter of a century since I have seen Uncle Remus. He
visited us in our home in Hartford and was reverently devoured by the
big eyes of Susy and Clara, for I made a deep and awful impression upon
the little creatures--who knew his book by heart through my nightly
declamation of its tales to them--by revealing to them privately that he
was the real Uncle Remus whitewashed so that he could come into people's
houses the front way.

He was the bashfulest grown person I have ever met. When there were
people about he stayed silent, and seemed to suffer until they were
gone. But he was lovely, nevertheless; for the sweetness and benignity
of the immortal Remus looked out from his eyes, and the graces and
sincerities of his character shone in his face.

It may be that Jim Wolf was as bashful as Harris. It hardly seems
possible, yet as I look back fifty-six years and consider Jim Wolf, I am
almost persuaded that he was. He was our long slim apprentice in my
brother's printing-office in Hannibal. He was seventeen, and yet he was
as much as four times as bashful as I was, though I was only fourteen.
He boarded and slept in the house, but he was always tongue-tied in the
presence of my sister, and when even my gentle mother spoke to him he
could not answer save in frightened monosyllables. He would not enter a
room where a girl was; nothing could persuade him to do such a thing.
Once when he was in our small parlor alone, two majestic old maids
entered and seated themselves in such a way that Jim could not escape
without passing by them. He would as soon have thought of passing by one
of Harris's plesiosaurians ninety feet long. I came in presently, was
charmed with the situation, and sat down in a corner to watch Jim
suffer, and enjoy it. My mother followed a minute later and sat down
with the visitors and began to talk. Jim sat upright in his chair, and
during a quarter of an hour he did not change his position by a
shade--neither General Grant nor a bronze image could have maintained
that immovable pose more successfully. I mean as to body and limbs; with
the face there was a difference. By fleeting revealments of the face I
saw that something was happening--something out of the common. There
would be a sudden twitch of the muscles of the face, an instant
distortion, which in the next instant had passed and left no trace.
These twitches gradually grew in frequency, but no muscle outside of the
face lost any of its rigidity, or betrayed any interest in what was
happening to Jim. I mean if something _was_ happening to him, and I knew
perfectly well that that was the case. At last a pair of tears began to
swim slowly down his cheeks amongst the twitchings, but Jim sat still
and let them run; then I saw his right hand steal along his thigh until
half-way to his knee, then take a vigorous grip upon the cloth.

That was a _wasp_ that he was grabbing! A colony of them were climbing
up his legs and prospecting around, and every time he winced they
stabbed him to the hilt--so for a quarter of an hour one group of
excursionists after another climbed up Jim's legs and resented even the
slightest wince or squirm that he indulged himself with, in his misery.
When the entertainment had become nearly unbearable, he conceived the
idea of gripping them between his fingers and putting them out of
commission. He succeeded with many of them, but at great cost, for, as
he couldn't see the wasp, he was as likely to take hold of the wrong end
of him as he was the right; then the dying wasp gave him a punch to
remember the incident by.

If those ladies had stayed all day, and if all the wasps in Missouri had
come and climbed up Jim's legs, nobody there would ever have known it
but Jim and the wasps and me. There he would have sat until the ladies
left.

When they finally went away we went up-stairs and he took his clothes
off, and his legs were a picture to look at. They looked as if they were
mailed all over with shirt buttons, each with a single red hole in the
centre. The pain was intolerable--no, would have been intolerable, but
the pain of the presence of those ladies had been so much harder to bear
that the pain of the wasps' stings was quite pleasant and enjoyable by
comparison.

Jim never could enjoy wasps. I remember once--


     _From Susy's Biography of Me_ [1885-6].

     Mamma has given me a very pleasant little newspaper scrap about
     papa, to copy. I will put it in here.


[_Thursday, October 11, 1906._] It was a rather strong compliment; I
think I will leave it out. It was from James Redpath.

The chief ingredients of Redpath's make-up were honesty, sincerity,
kindliness, and pluck. He wasn't afraid. He was one of Ossawatomie
Brown's right-hand men in the bleeding Kansas days; he was all through
that struggle. He carried his life in his hands, and from one day to
another it wasn't worth the price of a night's lodging. He had a small
body of daring men under him, and they were constantly being hunted by
the "jayhawkers," who were proslavery Missourians, guerillas, modern
free lances.

[_Friday, October 12, 1906._] ... I can't think of the name of that
daredevil guerilla who led the jayhawkers and chased Redpath up and
down the country, and, in turn, was chased by Redpath. By grace of the
chances of war, the two men never met in the field, though they several
times came within an ace of it.

Ten or twelve years later, Redpath was earning his living in Boston as
chief of the lecture business in the United States. Fifteen or sixteen
years after his Kansas adventures I became a public lecturer, and he was
my agent. Along there somewhere was a press dinner, one November night,
at the Tremont Hotel in Boston, and I attended it. I sat near the head
of the table, with Redpath between me and the chairman; a stranger sat
on my other side. I tried several times to talk with the stranger, but
he seemed to be out of words and I presently ceased from troubling him.
He was manifestly a very shy man, and, moreover, he might have been
losing sleep the night before.

The first man called up was Redpath. At the mention of the name the
stranger started, and showed interest. He fixed a fascinated eye on
Redpath, and lost not a word of his speech. Redpath told some stirring
incidents of his career in Kansas, and said, among other things:

"Three times I came near capturing the gallant jayhawker chief, and once
he actually captured _me_, but didn't know me and let me go, because he
said he was hot on Redpath's trail and couldn't afford to waste time and
rope on inconsequential small fry."

My stranger was called up next, and when Redpath heard his name he, in
turn, showed a startled interest. The stranger said, bending a caressing
glance upon Redpath and speaking gently--I may even say sweetly:

"You realize that I was that jayhawker chief. I am glad to know you now
and take you to my heart and call you friend"--then he added, in a voice
that was pathetic with regret, "but if I had only known you then, what
tumultuous happiness I should have had in your society!--while it
lasted."

The last quarter of a century of my life has been pretty constantly and
faithfully devoted to the study of the human race--that is to say, the
study of myself, for, in my individual person, I am the entire human
race compacted together. I have found that then is no ingredient of the
race which I do not possess in either a small way or a large way. When
it is small, as compared with the same ingredient in somebody else,
there is still enough of it for all the purposes of examination. In my
contacts with the species I find no one who possesses a quality which I
do not possess. The shades of difference between other people and me
serve to make variety and prevent monotony, but that is all; broadly
speaking, we are all alike; and so by studying myself carefully and
comparing myself with other people, and noting the divergences, I have
been enabled to acquire a knowledge of the human race which I perceive
is more accurate and more comprehensive than that which has been
acquired and revealed by any other member of our species. As a result,
my private and concealed opinion of myself is not of a complimentary
sort. It follows that my estimate of the human race is the duplicate of
my estimate of myself.

I am not proposing to discuss all of the peculiarities of the human
race, at this time; I only wish to touch lightly upon one or two of
them. To begin with, I wonder why a man should prefer a good
billiard-table to a poor one; and why he should prefer straight cues to
crooked ones; and why he should prefer round balls to chipped ones; and
why he should prefer a level table to one that slants; and why he should
prefer responsive cushions to the dull and unresponsive kind. I wonder
at these things, because when we examine the matter we find that the
essentials involved in billiards are as competently and exhaustively
furnished by a bad billiard outfit as they are by the best one. One of
the essentials is amusement. Very well, if there is any more amusement
to be gotten out of the one outfit than out of the other, the facts are
in favor of the bad outfit. The bad outfit will always furnish thirty
per cent. more fun for the players and for the spectators than will the
good outfit. Another essential of the game is that the outfit shall give
the players full opportunity to exercise their best skill, and display
it in a way to compel the admiration of the spectators. Very well, the
bad outfit is nothing behind the good one in this regard. It is a
difficult matter to estimate correctly the eccentricities of chipped
balls and a slanting table, and make the right allowance for them and
secure a count; the finest kind of skill is required to accomplish the
satisfactory result. Another essential of the game is that it shall add
to the interest of the game by furnishing opportunities to bet. Very
well, in this regard no good outfit can claim any advantage over a bad
one. I know, by experience, that a bad outfit is as valuable as the
best one; that an outfit that couldn't be sold at auction for seven
dollars is just as valuable for all the essentials of the game as an
outfit that is worth a thousand.

I acquired some of this learning in Jackass Gulch, California, more than
forty years ago. Jackass Gulch had once been a rich and thriving
surface-mining camp. By and by its gold deposits were exhausted; then
the people began to go away, and the town began to decay, and rapidly;
in my time it had disappeared. Where the bank, and the city hall, and
the church, and the gambling-dens, and the newspaper office, and the
streets of brick blocks had been, was nothing now but a wide and
beautiful expanse of green grass, a peaceful and charming solitude. Half
a dozen scattered dwellings were still inhabited, and there was still
one saloon of a ruined and rickety character struggling for life, but
doomed. In its bar was a billiard outfit that was the counterpart of the
one in my father-in-law's garret. The balls were chipped, the cloth was
darned and patched, the table's surface was undulating, and the cues
were headless and had the curve of a parenthesis--but the forlorn
remnant of marooned miners played games there, and those games were more
entertaining to look at than a circus and a grand opera combined.
Nothing but a quite extraordinary skill could score a carom on that
table--a skill that required the nicest estimate of force, distance, and
how much to allow for the various slants of the table and the other
formidable peculiarities and idiosyncrasies furnished by the
contradictions of the outfit. Last winter, here in New York, I saw Hoppe
and Schaefer and Sutton and the three or four other billiard champions
of world-wide fame contend against each other, and certainly the art and
science displayed were a wonder to see; yet I saw nothing there in the
way of science and art that was more wonderful than shots which I had
seen Texas Tom make on the wavy surface of that poor old wreck in the
perishing saloon at Jackass Gulch forty years before. Once I saw Texas
Tom make a string of seven points on a single inning!--all calculated
shots, and not a fluke or a scratch among them. I often saw him make
runs of four, but when he made his great string of seven, the boys went
wild with enthusiasm and admiration. The joy and the noise exceeded that
which the great gathering at Madison Square produced when Sutton scored
five hundred points at the eighteen-inch game, on a world-famous night
last winter. With practice, that champion could score nineteen or
twenty on the Jackass Gulch table; but to start with, Texas Tom would
show him miracles that would astonish him; also it might have another
handsome result: it might persuade the great experts to discard their
own trifling game and bring the Jackass Gulch outfit here and exhibit
their skill in a game worth a hundred of the discarded one, for profound
and breathless interest, and for displays of almost superhuman skill.

In my experience, games played with a fiendish outfit furnish ecstasies
of delight which games played with the other kind cannot match.
Twenty-seven years ago my budding little family spent the summer at
Bateman's Point, near Newport, Rhode Island. It was a comfortable
boarding-place, well stocked with sweet mothers and little children, but
the male sex was scarce; however, there was another young fellow besides
myself, and he and I had good times--Higgins was his name, but that was
not his fault. He was a very pleasant and companionable person. On the
premises there was what had once been a bowling-alley. It was a single
alley, and it was estimated that it had been out of repair for sixty
years--but not the balls, the balls were in good condition; there were
forty-one of them, and they ranged in size from a grapefruit up to a
lignum-vitæ sphere that you could hardly lift. Higgins and I played on
that alley day after day. At first, one of us located himself at the
bottom end to set up the pins in case anything should happen to them,
but nothing happened. The surface of that alley consisted of a rolling
stretch of elevations and depressions, and neither of us could, by any
art known to us, persuade a ball to stay on the alley until it should
accomplish something. Little balls and big, the same thing always
happened--the ball left the alley before it was half-way home and went
thundering down alongside of it the rest of the way and made the
gamekeeper climb out and take care of himself. No matter, we persevered,
and were rewarded. We examined the alley, noted and located a lot of its
peculiarities, and little by little we learned how to deliver a ball in
such a way that it would travel home and knock down a pin or two. By and
by we succeeded in improving our game to a point where we were able to
get all of the pins with thirty-five balls--so we made it a
thirty-five-ball game. If the player did not succeed with thirty-five,
he had lost the game. I suppose that all the balls, taken together,
weighed five hundred pounds, or maybe a ton--or along there
somewhere--but anyway it was hot weather, and by the time that a player
had sent thirty-five of them home he was in a drench of perspiration,
and physically exhausted.

Next, we started cocked hat--that is to say, a triangle of three pins,
the other seven being discarded. In this game we used the three smallest
balls and kept on delivering them until we got the three pins down.
After a day or two of practice we were able to get the chief pin with an
output of four balls, but it cost us a great many deliveries to get the
other two; but by and by we succeeded in perfecting our art--at least we
perfected it to our limit. We reached a scientific excellence where we
could get the three pins down with twelve deliveries of the three small
balls, making thirty-six shots to conquer the cocked hat.

Having reached our limit for daylight work, we set up a couple of
candles and played at night. As the alley was fifty or sixty feet long,
we couldn't see the pins, but the candles indicated their locality. We
continued this game until we were able to knock down the invisible pins
with thirty-six shots. Having now reached the limit of the candle game,
we changed and played it left-handed. We continued the left-handed game
until we conquered its limit, which was fifty-four shots. Sometimes we
sent down a succession of fifteen balls without getting anything at all.
We easily got out of that old alley five times the fun that anybody
could have gotten out of the best alley in New York.

One blazing hot day, a modest and courteous officer of the regular army
appeared in our den and introduced himself. He was about thirty-five
years old, well built and militarily erect and straight, and he was
hermetically sealed up in the uniform of that ignorant old day--a
uniform made of heavy material, and much properer for January than July.
When he saw the venerable alley, and glanced from that to the long
procession of shining balls in the trough, his eye lit with desire, and
we judged that he was our meat. We politely invited him to take a hand,
and he could not conceal his gratitude; though his breeding, and the
etiquette of his profession, made him try. We explained the game to him,
and said that there were forty-one balls, and that the player was
privileged to extend his inning and keep on playing until he had used
them all up--repeatedly--and that for every ten-strike he got a prize.
We didn't name the prize--it wasn't necessary, as no prize would ever be
needed or called for. He started a sarcastic smile, but quenched it,
according to the etiquette of his profession. He merely remarked that he
would like to select a couple of medium balls and one small one, adding
that he didn't think he would need the rest.

Then he began, and he was an astonished man. He couldn't get a ball to
stay on the alley. When he had fired about fifteen balls and hadn't yet
reached the cluster of pins, his annoyance began to show out through his
clothes. He wouldn't let it show in his face; but after another fifteen
balls he was not able to control his face; he didn't utter a word, but
he exuded mute blasphemy from every pore. He asked permission to take
off his coat, which was granted; then he turned himself loose, with
bitter determination, and although he was only an infantry officer he
could have been mistaken for a battery, he got up such a volleying
thunder with those balls. Presently he removed his cravat; after a
little he took off his vest; and still he went bravely on. Higgins was
suffocating. My condition was the same, but it would not be courteous to
laugh; it would be better to burst, and we came near it. That officer
was good pluck. He stood to his work without uttering a word, and kept
the balls going until he had expended the outfit four times, making four
times forty-one shots; then he had to give it up, and he did; for he was
no longer able to stand without wobbling. He put on his clothes, bade us
a courteous good-by, invited us to call at the Fort, and started away.
Then he came back, and said,

"What is the prize for the ten-strike?"

We had to confess that we had not selected it yet.

He said, gravely, that he thought there was no occasion for hurry about
it.

I believe Bateman's alley was a better one than any other in America, in
the matter of the essentials of the game. It compelled skill; it
provided opportunity for bets; and if you could get a stranger to do the
bowling for you, there was more and wholesomer and delightfuler
entertainment to be gotten out of his industries than out of the finest
game by the best expert, and played upon the best alley elsewhere in
existence.

CHAPTERS FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.--XXV.

BY MARK TWAIN.


_January 11, 1906._ Answer to a letter received this morning:


     DEAR MRS. H.,--I am forever your debtor for reminding me of that
     curious passage in my life. During the first year or two after it
     happened, I could not bear to think of it. My pain and shame were
     so intense, and my sense of having been an imbecile so settled,
     established and confirmed, that I drove the episode entirely from
     my mind--and so all these twenty-eight or twenty-nine years I have
     lived in the conviction that my performance of that time was
     coarse, vulgar and destitute of humor. But your suggestion that you
     and your family found humor in it twenty-eight years ago moved me
     to look into the matter. So I commissioned a Boston typewriter to
     delve among the Boston papers of that bygone time and send me a
     copy of it.

     It came this morning, and if there is any vulgarity about it I am
     not able to discover it. If it isn't innocently and ridiculously
     funny, I am no judge. I will see to it that you get a copy.


                Address of Samuel L. Clemens ("Mark Twain")
            From a report of the dinner given by the Publishers
                 of the Atlantic Monthly in honor of the
                      Seventieth Anniversary of the
         Birth of John Greenleaf Whittier, at the Hotel Brunswick,
                         Boston, December 17, 1877,
                            as published in the
                         BOSTON EVENING TRANSCRIPT,
                             December 18, 1877


     Mr. Chairman--This is an occasion peculiarly meet for the digging
     up of pleasant reminiscences concerning literary folk; therefore I
     will drop lightly into history myself. Standing here on the shore
     of the Atlantic and contemplating certain of its largest literary
     billows, I am reminded of a thing which happened to me thirteen
     years ago, when I had just succeeded in stirring up a little
     Nevadian literary puddle myself, whose spume-flakes were beginning
     to blow thinly Californiawards. I started an inspection tramp
     through the southern mines of California. I was callow and
     conceited, and I resolved to try the virtue of my _nom de guerre._
     I very soon had an opportunity. I knocked at a miner's lonely log
     cabin in the foothills of the Sierras just at nightfall. It was
     snowing at the time. A jaded, melancholy man of fifty, barefooted,
     opened the door to me. When he heard my _nom de guerre_ he looked
     more dejected than before. He let me in--pretty reluctantly, I
     thought--and after the customary bacon and beans, black coffee and
     hot whiskey, I took a pipe. This sorrowful man had not said three
     words up to this time. Now he spoke up and said, in the voice of
     one who is secretly suffering, "You're the fourth--I'm going to
     move." "The fourth what!" said I. "The fourth littery man that has
     been here in twenty-four hours--I'm going to move." "You don't tell
     me!" said I; "who were the others!" "Mr. Longfellow, Mr. Emerson
     and Mr. Oliver Wendell Holmes--consound the lot!"

     You can easily believe I was interested. I supplicated--three hot
     whiskeys did the rest--and finally the melancholy miner began. Said
     he--

     "They came here just at dark yesterday evening, and I let them in
     of course. Said they were going to the Yosemite. They were a rough
     lot, but that's nothing; everybody looks rough that travels afoot.
     Mr. Emerson was a seedy little bit of a chap, red-headed. Mr.
     Holmes as fat as a balloon; he weighed as much as three hundred,
     and double chins all the way down to his stomach. Mr. Longfellow
     built like a prize-fighter. His head was cropped and bristly, like
     as if he had a wig made of hair-brushes. His nose lay straight down
     his face, like a finger with the end joint tilted up. They had been
     drinking, I could see that. And what queer talk they used! Mr.
     Holmes inspected this cabin, then he took me by the buttonhole, and
     says he--


     "'Through the deep cares of thought
     I hear a voice that sings,
     Build thee more stately mansions,
     O my soul!'


     "Says I, 'I can't afford it, Mr. Holmes, and moreover I don't want
     to.' Blamed if I liked it pretty well, either, coming from a
     stranger, that way. However, I started to get out my bacon and
     beans, when Mr. Emerson came and looked on awhile, and then he
     takes me aside by the buttonhole and says--


     "'Give me agates for my meat;
     Give me cantharids to eat;
     From air and ocean bring me foods,
     From all zones and altitudes.'


     "Says I, 'Mr. Emerson, if you'll excuse me, this ain't no hotel.'
     You see it sort of riled me--I warn't used to the ways of littery
     swells. But I went on a-sweating over my work, and next comes Mr.
     Longfellow and buttonholes me, and interrupts me. Says he,


     "'Honor be to Mudjekeewis!
     You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis--'


     "But I broke in, and says I, 'Beg your pardon, Mr. Longfellow, if
     you'll be so kind as to hold your yawp for about five minutes and
     let me get this grub ready, you'll do me proud.' Well, sir, after
     they'd filled up I set out the jug. Mr. Holmes looks at it and then
     he fires up all of a sudden and yells--


     "'Flash out a stream of blood-red wine!
     For I would drink to other days.'


     "By George, I was getting kind of worked up. I don't deny it, I was
     getting kind of worked up. I turns to Mr. Holmes, and says I,
     'Looky here, my fat friend, I'm a-running this shanty, and if the
     court knows herself, you'll take whiskey straight or you'll go
     dry.' Them's the very words I said to him. Now I don't want to sass
     such famous littery people, but you see they kind of forced me.
     There ain't nothing onreasonable 'bout me; I don't mind a passel of
     guests a-treadin' on my tail three or four times, but when it comes
     to _standing_ on it it's different, 'and if the court knows
     herself,' I says, 'you'll take whiskey straight or you'll go dry.'
     Well, between drinks they'd swell around the cabin and strike
     attitudes and spout; and pretty soon they got out a greasy old deck
     and went to playing euchre at ten cents a corner--on trust. I began
     to notice some pretty suspicious things. Mr. Emerson dealt, looked
     at his hand, shook his head, says--


     "'I am the doubter and the doubt--'


     and ca'mly bunched the hands and went to shuffling for a new
     layout. Says he--


     "'They reckon ill who leave me out;
     They know not well the subtle ways I keep.
     I pass and deal _again_!'


     Hang'd if he didn't go ahead and do it, too! O, he was a cool one!
     Well, in about a minute, things were running pretty tight, but all
     of a sudden I see by Mr. Emerson's eye he judged he had 'em. He had
     already corralled two tricks and each of the others one. So now he
     kind of lifts a little in his chair and says--


     "'I tire of globes and aces!--
     Too long the game is played!'


     --and down he fetched a right bower. Mr. Longfellow smiles as sweet
     as pie and says--


     "'Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,
     For the lesson thou hast taught,'


     --and blamed if he didn't down with _another_ right bower! Emerson
     claps his hand on his bowie, Longfellow claps his on his revolver,
     and I went under a bunk. There was going to be trouble; but that
     monstrous Holmes rose up, wobbling his double chins, and says he,
     'Order, gentlemen; the first man that draws, I'll lay down on him
     and smother him!' All quiet on the Potomac, you bet!

     "They were pretty how-come-you-so, by now, and they begun to blow.
     Emerson says, 'The nobbiest thing I ever wrote was Barbara
     Frietchie.' Says Longfellow, 'It don't begin with my Biglow
     Papers.' Says Holmes, 'My Thanatopsis lays over 'em both.' They
     mighty near ended in a fight. Then they wished they had some more
     company--and Mr. Emerson pointed to me and says--


     "'Is yonder squalid peasant all
     That this proud nursery could breed?'


     He was a-whetting his bowie on his boot--so I let it pass. Well,
     sir, next they took it into their heads that they would like some
     music; so they made me stand up and sing 'When Johnny Comes
     Marching Home' till I dropped--at thirteen minutes past four this
     morning. That's what I've been through, my friend. When I woke at
     seven, they were leaving, thank goodness, and Mr. Longfellow had my
     only boots on, and his'n under his arm. Says I, 'Hold on, there,
     Evangeline, what are you going to do with _them_! He says, 'Going
     to make tracks with 'em; because--


     "'Lives of great men all remind us
     We can make our lives sublime;
     And, departing, leave behind us
     Footprints on the sands of time.'


     As I said, Mr. Twain, you are the fourth in twenty-four hours--and
     I'm going to move; I ain't suited to a littery atmosphere."

     I said to the miner, "Why, my dear sir, _these_ were not the
     gracious singers to whom we and the world pay loving reverence and
     homage; these were impostors."

     The miner investigated me with a calm eye for a while; then said
     he, "Ah! impostors, were they? Are _you_?

     I did not pursue the subject, and since then I have not travelled
     on my _nom de guerre_ enough to hurt. Such was the reminiscence I
     was moved to contribute, Mr. Chairman. In my enthusiasm I may have
     exaggerated the details a little, but you will easily forgive me
     that fault, since I believe it is the first time I have ever
     deflected from perpendicular fact on an occasion like this.


What I have said to Mrs. H. is true. I did suffer during a year or two
from the deep humiliations of that episode. But at last, in 1888, in
Venice, my wife and I came across Mr. and Mrs. A. P. C., of Concord,
Massachusetts, and a friendship began then of the sort which nothing but
death terminates. The C.'s were very bright people and in every way
charming and companionable. We were together a month or two in Venice
and several months in Rome, afterwards, and one day that lamented break
of mine was mentioned. And when I was on the point of lathering those
people for bringing it to my mind when I had gotten the memory of it
almost squelched, I perceived with joy that the C.'s were indignant
about the way that my performance had been received in Boston. They
poured out their opinions most freely and frankly about the frosty
attitude of the people who were present at that performance, and about
the Boston newspapers for the position they had taken in regard to the
matter. That position was that I had been irreverent beyond belief,
beyond imagination. Very well, I had accepted that as a fact for a year
or two, and had been thoroughly miserable about it whenever I thought of
it--which was not frequently, if I could help it. Whenever I thought of
it I wondered how I ever could have been inspired to do so unholy a
thing. Well, the C.'s comforted me, but they did not persuade me to
continue to think about the unhappy episode. I resisted that. I tried to
get it out of my mind, and let it die, and I succeeded. Until Mrs. H.'s
letter came, it had been a good twenty-five years since I had thought of
that matter; and when she said that the thing was funny I wondered if
possibly she might be right. At any rate, my curiosity was aroused, and
I wrote to Boston and got the whole thing copied, as above set forth.

I vaguely remember some of the details of that gathering--dimly I can
see a hundred people--no, perhaps fifty--shadowy figures sitting at
tables feeding, ghosts now to me, and nameless forever more. I don't
know who they were, but I can very distinctly see, seated at the grand
table and facing the rest of us, Mr. Emerson, supernaturally grave,
unsmiling; Mr. Whittier, grave, lovely, his beautiful spirit shining out
of his face; Mr. Longfellow, with his silken white hair and his
benignant face; Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, flashing smiles and affection
and all good-fellowship everywhere like a rose-diamond whose facets are
being turned toward the light first one way and then another--a charming
man, and always fascinating, whether he was talking or whether he was
sitting still (what _he_ would call still, but what would be more or
lees motion to other people). I can see those figures with entire
distinctness across this abyss of time.

One other feature is clear--Willie Winter (for these past thousand years
dramatic editor of the "New York Tribune," and still occupying that high
post in his old age) was there. He was much younger then than he is now,
and he showed it. It was always a pleasure to me to see Willie Winter at
a banquet. During a matter of twenty years I was seldom at a banquet
where Willie Winter was not also present, and where he did not read a
charming poem written for the occasion. He did it this time, and it was
up to standard: dainty, happy, choicely phrased, and as good to listen
to as music, and sounding exactly as if it was pouring unprepared out of
heart and brain.

Now at that point ends all that was pleasurable about that notable
celebration of Mr. Whittier's seventieth birthday--because I got up at
that point and followed Winter, with what I have no doubt I supposed
would be the gem of the evening--the gay oration above quoted from the
Boston paper. I had written it all out the day before and had perfectly
memorized it, and I stood up there at my genial and happy and
self-satisfied ease, and began to deliver it. Those majestic guests,
that row of venerable and still active volcanoes, listened, as did
everybody else in the house, with attentive interest. Well, I delivered
myself of--we'll say the first two hundred words of my speech. I was
expecting no returns from that part of the speech, but this was not the
case as regarded the rest of it. I arrived now at the dialogue: 'The old
miner said, "You are the fourth, I'm going to move." "The fourth what?"
said I. He answered, "The fourth littery man that has been here in
twenty-four hours. I am going to move." "Why, you don't tell me," said
I. "Who were the others?" "Mr. Longfellow, Mr. Emerson, Mr. Oliver
Wendell Holmes, consound the lot--"'

Now then the house's _attention_ continued, but the expression of
interest in the faces turned to a sort of black frost. I wondered what
the trouble was. I didn't know. I went on, but with difficulty--I
struggled along, and entered upon that miner's fearful description of
the bogus Emerson, the bogus Holmes, the bogus Longfellow, always
hoping--but with a gradually perishing hope--that somebody would laugh,
or that somebody would at least smile, but nobody did. I didn't know
enough to give it up and sit down, I was too new to public speaking, and
so I went on with this awful performance, and carried it clear through
to the end, in front of a body of people who seemed turned to stone with
horror. It was the sort of expression their faces would have worn if I
had been making these remarks about the Deity and the rest of the
Trinity; there is no milder way in which to describe the petrified
condition and the ghastly expression of those people.

When I sat down it was with a heart which had long ceased to beat. I
shall never be as dead again as I was then. I shall never be as
miserable again as I was then. I speak now as one who doesn't know what
the condition of things may be in the next world, but in this one I
shall never be as wretched again as I was then. Howells, who was near
me, tried to say a comforting word, but couldn't get beyond a gasp.
There was no use--he understood the whole size of the disaster. He had
good intentions, but the words froze before they could get out. It was
an atmosphere that would freeze anything. If Benvenuto Cellini's
salamander had been in that place he would not have survived to be put
into Cellini's autobiography. There was a frightful pause. There was an
awful silence, a desolating silence. Then the next man on the list had
to get up--there was no help for it. That was Bishop--Bishop had just
burst handsomely upon the world with a most acceptable novel, which had
appeared in the "Atlantic Monthly," a place which would make any novel
respectable and any author noteworthy. In this case the novel itself was
recognized as being, without extraneous help, respectable. Bishop was
away up in the public favor, and he was an object of high interest,
consequently there was a sort of national expectancy in the air; we may
say our American millions were standing, from Maine to Texas and from
Alaska to Florida, holding their breath, their lips parted, their hands
ready to applaud when Bishop should get up on that occasion, and for the
first time in his life speak in public. It was under these damaging
conditions that he got up to "make good," as the vulgar say. I had
spoken several times before, and that in the reason why I was able to go
on without dying in my tracks, as I ought to have done--but Bishop had
had no experience. He was up facing those awful deities--facing those
other people, those strangers--facing human beings for the first time in
his life, with a speech to utter. No doubt it was well packed away in
his memory, no doubt it was fresh and usable, until I had been heard
from. I suppose that after that, and under the smothering pall of that
dreary silence, it began to waste away and disappear out of his head
like the rags breaking from the edge of a fog, and presently there
wasn't any fog left. He didn't go on--he didn't last long. It was not
many sentences after his first before he began to hesitate, and break,
and lose his grip, and totter, and wobble, and at last he slumped down
in a limp and mushy pile.

Well, the programme for the occasion was probably not more than
one-third finished, but it ended there. Nobody rose. The next man hadn't
strength enough to get up, and everybody looked so dazed, so stupefied,
paralyzed, it was impossible for anybody to do anything, or even try.
Nothing could go on in that strange atmosphere. Howells mournfully, and
without words, hitched himself to Bishop and me and supported us out of
the room. It was very kind--he was most generous. He towed us tottering
away into some room in that building, and we sat down there. I don't
know what my remark was now, but I know the nature of it. It was the
kind of remark you make when you know that nothing in the world can help
your case. But Howells was honest--he had to say the heart-breaking
things he did say: that there was no help for this calamity, this
shipwreck, this cataclysm; that this was the most disastrous thing that
had ever happened in anybody's history--and then he added, "That is, for
_you_--and consider what you have done for Bishop. It is bad enough in
your case, you deserve to suffer. You have committed this crime, and you
deserve to have all you are going to get. But here is an innocent man.
Bishop had never done you any harm, and see what you have done to him.
He can never hold his head up again. The world can never look upon
Bishop as being a live person. He is a corpse."

That is the history of that episode of twenty-eight years ago, which
pretty nearly killed me with shame during that first year or two
whenever it forced its way into my mind.

Now, then, I take that speech up and examine it. As I said, it arrived
this morning, from Boston. I have read it twice, and unless I am an
idiot, it hasn't a single defect in it from the first word to the last.
It is just as good as good can be. It is smart; it is saturated with
humor. There isn't a suggestion of coarseness or vulgarity in it
anywhere. What could have been the matter with that house? It is
amazing, it is incredible, that they didn't shout with laughter, and
those deities the loudest of them all. Could the fault have been with
me? Did I lose courage when I saw those great men up there whom I was
going to describe in such a strange fashion? If that happened, if I
showed doubt, that can account for it, for you can't be successfully
funny if you show that you are afraid of it. Well, I can't account for
it, but if I had those beloved and revered old literary immortals back
here now on the platform at Carnegie Hall I would take that same old
speech, deliver it, word for word, and melt them till they'd run all
over that stage. Oh, the fault must have been with _me_, it is not in
the speech at all.

[_Dictated October 3, 1907._] In some ways, I was always honest; even
from my earliest years I could never bring myself to use money which I
had acquired in questionable ways; many a time I tried, but principle
was always stronger than desire. Six or eight months ago,
Lieutenant-General Nelson A. Miles was given a great dinner-party in New
York, and when he and I were chatting together in the drawing-room
before going out to dinner he said,

"I've known you as much as thirty years, isn't it?"

I said, "Yes, that's about it, I think."

He mused a moment or two and then said,

"I wonder we didn't meet in Washington in 1867; you were there at that
time, weren't you?"

I said, "Yes, but there was a difference; I was not known then; I had
not begun to bud--I was an obscurity; but you had been adding to your
fine Civil War record; you had just come back from your brilliant
Indian campaign in the Far West, and had been rewarded with a
brigadier-generalship in the regular army, and everybody was talking
about you and praising you. If you had met me, you wouldn't be able to
remember it now--unless some unusual circumstance of the meeting had
burnt it into your memory. It is forty years ago, and people don't
remember nobodies over a stretch of time like that."

I didn't wish to continue the conversation along that line, so I changed
the subject. I could have proven to him, without any trouble, that we
did meet in Washington in 1867, but I thought it might embarrass one or
the other of us, so I didn't do it. I remember the incident very well.
This was the way of it:

I had just come back from the Quaker City Excursion, and had made a
contract with Bliss of Hartford to write "The Innocents Abroad." I was
out of money, and I went down to Washington to see if I could earn
enough there to keep me in bread and butter while I should write the
book. I came across William Clinton, brother of the astronomer, and
together we invented a scheme for our mutual sustenance; we became the
fathers and originators of what is a common feature in the newspaper
world now--the syndicate. We became the old original first Newspaper
Syndicate on the planet; it was on a small scale, but that is usual with
untried new enterprises. We had twelve journals on our list; they were
all weeklies, all obscure and poor, and all scattered far away among the
back settlements. It was a proud thing for those little newspapers to
have a Washington correspondence, and a fortunate thing for us that they
felt in that way about it. Each of the twelve took two letters a week
from us, at a dollar per letter; each of us wrote one letter per week
and sent off six duplicates of it to these benefactors, thus acquiring
twenty-four dollars a week to live on--which was all we needed, in our
cheap and humble quarters.

Clinton was one of the dearest and loveliest human beings I have ever
known, and we led a charmed existence together, in a contentment which
knew no bounds. Clinton was refined by nature and breeding; he was a
gentleman by nature and breeding; he was highly educated; he was of a
beautiful spirit; he was pure in heart and speech. He was a Scotchman,
and a Presbyterian; a Presbyterian of the old and genuine school, being
honest and sincere in his religion, and loving it, and finding serenity
and peace in it. He hadn't a vice--unless a large and grateful sympathy
with Scotch whiskey may be called by that name. I didn't regard it as a
vice, because he was a Scotchman, and Scotch whiskey to a Scotchman is
as innocent as milk is to the rest of the human race. In Clinton's case
it was a virtue, and not an economical one. Twenty-four dollars a week
would really have been riches to us if we hadn't had to support that
jug; because of the jug we were always sailing pretty close to the wind,
and any tardiness in the arrival of any part of our income was sure to
cause us some inconvenience.

I remember a time when a shortage occurred; we had to have three
dollars, and we had to have it before the close of the day. I don't know
now how we happened to want all that money at one time; I only know we
had to have it. Clinton told me to go out and find it--and he said he
would also go out and see what he could do. He didn't seem to have any
doubt that we would succeed, but I knew that that was his religion
working in him; I hadn't the same confidence; I hadn't any idea where to
turn to raise all that bullion, and I said so. I think he was ashamed of
me, privately, because of my weak faith. He told me to give myself no
uneasiness, no concern; and said in a simple, confident, and
unquestioning way, "the Lord will provide." I saw that he fully believed
the Lord would provide, but it seemed to me that if he had had my
experience--

But never mind that; before he was done with me his strong faith had had
its influence, and I went forth from the place almost convinced that the
Lord really would provide.

I wandered around the streets for an hour, trying to think up some way
to get that money, but nothing suggested itself. At last I lounged into
the big lobby of the Ebbitt House, which was then a new hotel, and sat
down. Presently a dog came loafing along. He paused, glanced up at me
and said, with his eyes, "Are you friendly?" I answered, with my eyes,
that I was. He gave his tail a grateful little wag and came forward and
rested his jaw on my knee and lifted his brown eyes to my face in a
winningly affectionate way. He was a lovely creature--as beautiful as a
girl, and he was made all of silk and velvet. I stroked his smooth brown
head and fondled his drooping ears, and we were a pair of lovers right
away. Pretty soon Brigadier-General Miles, the hero of the land, came
strolling by in his blue and gold splendors, with everybody's admiring
gaze upon him. He saw the dog and stopped, and there was a light in his
eye which showed that he had a warm place in his heart for dogs like
this gracious creature; then he came forward and patted the dog and
said,

"He is very fine--he is a wonder; would you sell him?"

I was greatly moved; it seemed a marvellous thing to me, the way
Clinton's prediction had come true. I said,

"Yes."

The General said,

"What do you ask for him?"

"Three dollars."

The General was manifestly surprised. He said,

"Three dollars? Only three dollars? Why, that dog is a most uncommon
dog; he can't possibly be worth leas than fifty. If he were mine, I
wouldn't take a hundred for him. I'm afraid you are not aware of his
value. Reconsider your price if you like, I don't wish to wrong you."

But if he had known me he would have known that I was no more capable of
wronging him than he was of wronging me. I responded with the same quiet
decision as before,

"No--three dollars. That is his price."

"Very well, since you insist upon it," said the General, and he gave me
three dollars and led the dog away, and disappeared up-stairs.

In about ten minutes a gentle-faced middle-aged gentleman came along,
and began to look around here and there and under tables and everywhere,
and I said to him,

"Is it a dog you are looking for?"

His face was sad, before, and troubled; but it lit up gladly now, and he
answered,

"Yes--have you seen him?"

"Yes," I said, "he was here a minute ago, and I saw him follow a
gentleman away. I think I could find him for you if you would like me to
try."

I have seldom seen a person look so grateful--and there was gratitude in
his voice, too, when he conceded that he would like me to try. I said I
would do it with great pleasure, but that as it might take a little time
I hoped he would not mind paying me something for my trouble. He said he
would do it most gladly--repeating that phrase "most gladly"--and asked
me how much. I said--

"Three dollars."

He looked surprised, and said,

"Dear me, it is nothing! I will pay you ten, quite willingly."

But I said,

"No, three is the price"--and I started for the stairs without waiting
for any further argument, for Clinton had said that that was the amount
that the Lord would provide, and it seemed to me that it would be
sacrilegious to take a penny more than was promised.

I got the number of the General's room from the office-clerk, as I
passed by his wicket, and when I reached the room I found the General
there caressing his dog, and quite happy. I said,

"I am sorry, but I have to take the dog again."

He seemed very much surprised, and said,

"Take him again? Why, he is my dog; you sold him to me, and at your own
price."

"Yes," I said, "it is true--but I have to have him, because the man
wants him again."

"What man?"

"The man that owns him; he wasn't my dog."

The General looked even more surprised than before, and for a moment he
couldn't seem to find his voice; then he said,

"Do you mean to tell me that you were selling another man's dog--and
knew it?"

"Yes, I knew it wasn't my dog."

"Then why did you sell him?"

I said,

"Well, that is a curious question to ask. I sold him because you wanted
him. You offered to buy the dog; you can't deny that I was not anxious
to sell him--I had not even thought of selling him, but it seemed to me
that if it could be any accommodation to you--"

He broke me off in the middle, and said,

"_Accommodation_ to me? It is the most extraordinary spirit of
accommodation I have ever heard of--the idea of your selling a dog that
didn't belong to you--"

I broke him off there, and said,

"There is no relevancy about this kind of argument; you said yourself
that the dog was probably worth a hundred dollars, I only asked you
three; was there anything unfair about that? You offered to pay more,
you know you did. I only asked you three; you can't deny it."

"Oh, what in the world has that to do with it! The crux of the matter is
that you didn't own the dog--can't you see that? You seem to think that
there is no impropriety in selling property that isn't yours provided
you sell it cheap. Now, then--"

I said,

"Please don't argue about it any more. You can't get around the fact
that the price was perfectly fair, perfectly reasonable--considering
that I didn't own the dog--and so arguing about it is only a waste of
words. I have to have him back again because the man wants him; don't
you see that I haven't any choice in the matter? Put yourself in my
place. Suppose you had sold a dog that didn't belong to you; suppose
you--"

"Oh," he said, "don't muddle my brains any more with your idiotic
reasonings! Take him along, and give me a rest."

So I paid back the three dollars and led the dog down-stairs and passed
him over to his owner, and collected three for my trouble.

I went away then with a good conscience, because I had acted honorably;
I never could have used the three that I sold the dog for, because it
was not rightly my own, but the three I got for restoring him to his
rightful owner was righteously and properly mine, because I had earned
it. That man might never have gotten that dog back at all, if it hadn't
been for me. My principles have remained to this day what they were
then. I was always honest; I know I can never be otherwise. It is as I
said in the beginning--I was never able to persuade myself to use money
which I had acquired in questionable ways.

Now, then, that is the tale. Some of it is true.

CHAPTER XVIII

THAT was Tom's great secret--the scheme to return home with his
brother pirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to
the Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six
miles below the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the
town till nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and
alleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a
chaos of invalided benches.

At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to
Tom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of
talk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:

"Well, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody
suffering 'most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity
you could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come
over on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give
me a hint some way that you warn't dead, but only run off."

"Yes, you could have done that, Tom," said Mary; "and I believe you
would if you had thought of it."

"Would you, Tom?" said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. "Say,
now, would you, if you'd thought of it?"

"I--well, I don't know. 'Twould 'a' spoiled everything."

"Tom, I hoped you loved me that much," said Aunt Polly, with a grieved
tone that discomforted the boy. "It would have been something if you'd
cared enough to THINK of it, even if you didn't DO it."

"Now, auntie, that ain't any harm," pleaded Mary; "it's only Tom's
giddy way--he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of
anything."

"More's the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and
DONE it, too. Tom, you'll look back, some day, when it's too late, and
wish you'd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so
little."

"Now, auntie, you know I do care for you," said Tom.

"I'd know it better if you acted more like it."

"I wish now I'd thought," said Tom, with a repentant tone; "but I
dreamt about you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?"

"It ain't much--a cat does that much--but it's better than nothing.
What did you dream?"

"Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the
bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him."

"Well, so we did. So we always do. I'm glad your dreams could take
even that much trouble about us."

"And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here."

"Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?"

"Oh, lots. But it's so dim, now."

"Well, try to recollect--can't you?"

"Somehow it seems to me that the wind--the wind blowed the--the--"

"Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!"

Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then
said:

"I've got it now! I've got it now! It blowed the candle!"

"Mercy on us! Go on, Tom--go on!"

"And it seems to me that you said, 'Why, I believe that that door--'"

"Go ON, Tom!"

"Just let me study a moment--just a moment. Oh, yes--you said you
believed the door was open."

"As I'm sitting here, I did! Didn't I, Mary! Go on!"

"And then--and then--well I won't be certain, but it seems like as if
you made Sid go and--and--"

"Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?"

"You made him--you--Oh, you made him shut it."

"Well, for the land's sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my
days! Don't tell ME there ain't anything in dreams, any more. Sereny
Harper shall know of this before I'm an hour older. I'd like to see her
get around THIS with her rubbage 'bout superstition. Go on, Tom!"

"Oh, it's all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I
warn't BAD, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more
responsible than--than--I think it was a colt, or something."

"And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!"

"And then you began to cry."

"So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then--"

"Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same,
and she wished she hadn't whipped him for taking cream when she'd
throwed it out her own self--"

"Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying--that's what you
was doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!"

"Then Sid he said--he said--"

"I don't think I said anything," said Sid.

"Yes you did, Sid," said Mary.

"Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?"

"He said--I THINK he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone
to, but if I'd been better sometimes--"

"THERE, d'you hear that! It was his very words!"

"And you shut him up sharp."

"I lay I did! There must 'a' been an angel there. There WAS an angel
there, somewheres!"

"And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and
you told about Peter and the Painkiller--"

"Just as true as I live!"

"And then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river for
us, and 'bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss
Harper hugged and cried, and she went."

"It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I'm a-sitting in
these very tracks. Tom, you couldn't told it more like if you'd 'a'
seen it! And then what? Go on, Tom!"

"Then I thought you prayed for me--and I could see you and hear every
word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and
wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, 'We ain't dead--we are only off
being pirates,' and put it on the table by the candle; and then you
looked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned
over and kissed you on the lips."

"Did you, Tom, DID you! I just forgive you everything for that!" And
she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the
guiltiest of villains.

"It was very kind, even though it was only a--dream," Sid soliloquized
just audibly.

"Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he'd do if he
was awake. Here's a big Milum apple I've been saving for you, Tom, if
you was ever found again--now go 'long to school. I'm thankful to the
good God and Father of us all I've got you back, that's long-suffering
and merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though
goodness knows I'm unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His
blessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places, there's
few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long
night comes. Go 'long Sid, Mary, Tom--take yourselves off--you've
hendered me long enough."

The children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper
and vanquish her realism with Tom's marvellous dream. Sid had better
judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the
house. It was this: "Pretty thin--as long a dream as that, without any
mistakes in it!"

What a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing,
but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the
public eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see
the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food
and drink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as
proud to be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the
drummer at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie
into town. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away
at all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would
have given anything to have that swarthy suntanned skin of his, and his
glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a
circus.

At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered
such eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were not
long in becoming insufferably "stuck-up." They began to tell their
adventures to hungry listeners--but they only began; it was not a thing
likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish
material. And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely
puffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.

Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory
was sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished,
maybe she would be wanting to "make up." Well, let her--she should see
that he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she
arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group
of boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was
tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,
pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter
when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her
captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye
in his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious
vanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only "set
him up" the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that
he knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved
irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and
wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more
particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp
pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but
her feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She
said to a girl almost at Tom's elbow--with sham vivacity:

"Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn't you come to Sunday-school?"

"I did come--didn't you see me?"

"Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?"

"I was in Miss Peters' class, where I always go. I saw YOU."

"Did you? Why, it's funny I didn't see you. I wanted to tell you about
the picnic."

"Oh, that's jolly. Who's going to give it?"

"My ma's going to let me have one."

"Oh, goody; I hope she'll let ME come."

"Well, she will. The picnic's for me. She'll let anybody come that I
want, and I want you."

"That's ever so nice. When is it going to be?"

"By and by. Maybe about vacation."

"Oh, won't it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?"

"Yes, every one that's friends to me--or wants to be"; and she glanced
ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence
about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the
great sycamore tree "all to flinders" while he was "standing within
three feet of it."

"Oh, may I come?" said Grace Miller.

"Yes."

"And me?" said Sally Rogers.

"Yes."

"And me, too?" said Susy Harper. "And Joe?"

"Yes."

And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged
for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still
talking, and took Amy with him. Becky's lips trembled and the tears
came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on
chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of
everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and
had what her sex call "a good cry." Then she sat moody, with wounded
pride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast
in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what
SHE'D do.

At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant
self-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate
her with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden
falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind
the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple--and so
absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,
that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.
Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom's veins. He began to hate himself for
throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He
called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He
wanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,
for her heart was singing, but Tom's tongue had lost its function. He
did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he
could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as
otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and
again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could
not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that
Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the
living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her
fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.

Amy's happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had to
attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in
vain--the girl chirped on. Tom thought, "Oh, hang her, ain't I ever
going to get rid of her?" At last he must be attending to those
things--and she said artlessly that she would be "around" when school
let out. And he hastened away, hating her for it.

"Any other boy!" Tom thought, grating his teeth. "Any boy in the whole
town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is
aristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw
this town, mister, and I'll lick you again! You just wait till I catch
you out! I'll just take and--"

And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy
--pummelling the air, and kicking and gouging. "Oh, you do, do you? You
holler 'nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!" And so the
imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction.

Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of
Amy's grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the
other distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but
as the minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph
began to cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absent-mindedness
followed, and then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her
ear at a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she
grew entirely miserable and wished she hadn't carried it so far. When
poor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept
exclaiming: "Oh, here's a jolly one! look at this!" she lost patience
at last, and said, "Oh, don't bother me! I don't care for them!" and
burst into tears, and got up and walked away.

Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she
said:

"Go away and leave me alone, can't you! I hate you!"

So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done--for she had said
she would look at pictures all through the nooning--and she walked on,
crying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was
humiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth--the girl
had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.
He was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.
He wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much
risk to himself. Tom's spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his
opportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and
poured ink upon the page.

Becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,
and moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now,
intending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their
troubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she
had changed her mind. The thought of Tom's treatment of her when she
was talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with
shame. She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged
spelling-book's account, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.



CHAPTER XIX

TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt
said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an
unpromising market:

"Tom, I've a notion to skin you alive!"

"Auntie, what have I done?"

"Well, you've done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an
old softy, expecting I'm going to make her believe all that rubbage
about that dream, when lo and behold you she'd found out from Joe that
you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I
don't know what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes
me feel so bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make
such a fool of myself and never say a word."

This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had
seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked
mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything
to say for a moment. Then he said:

"Auntie, I wish I hadn't done it--but I didn't think."

"Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your own
selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from
Jackson's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could
think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn't ever think
to pity us and save us from sorrow."

"Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean. I
didn't, honest. And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh at you
that night."

"What did you come for, then?"

"It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn't got
drownded."

"Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could
believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never
did--and I know it, Tom."

"Indeed and 'deed I did, auntie--I wish I may never stir if I didn't."

"Oh, Tom, don't lie--don't do it. It only makes things a hundred times
worse."

"It ain't a lie, auntie; it's the truth. I wanted to keep you from
grieving--that was all that made me come."

"I'd give the whole world to believe that--it would cover up a power
of sins, Tom. I'd 'most be glad you'd run off and acted so bad. But it
ain't reasonable; because, why didn't you tell me, child?"

"Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got
all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I
couldn't somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my
pocket and kept mum."

"What bark?"

"The bark I had wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirating. I wish, now,
you'd waked up when I kissed you--I do, honest."

The hard lines in his aunt's face relaxed and a sudden tenderness
dawned in her eyes.

"DID you kiss me, Tom?"

"Why, yes, I did."

"Are you sure you did, Tom?"

"Why, yes, I did, auntie--certain sure."

"What did you kiss me for, Tom?"

"Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry."

The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in
her voice when she said:

"Kiss me again, Tom!--and be off with you to school, now, and don't
bother me any more."

The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a
jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her
hand, and said to herself:

"No, I don't dare. Poor boy, I reckon he's lied about it--but it's a
blessed, blessed lie, there's such a comfort come from it. I hope the
Lord--I KNOW the Lord will forgive him, because it was such
goodheartedness in him to tell it. But I don't want to find out it's a
lie. I won't look."

She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put
out her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once
more she ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the
thought: "It's a good lie--it's a good lie--I won't let it grieve me."
So she sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom's
piece of bark through flowing tears and saying: "I could forgive the
boy, now, if he'd committed a million sins!"



CHAPTER XX

THERE was something about Aunt Polly's manner, when she kissed Tom,
that swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy
again. He started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky
Thatcher at the head of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his
manner. Without a moment's hesitation he ran to her and said:

"I acted mighty mean to-day, Becky, and I'm so sorry. I won't ever,
ever do that way again, as long as ever I live--please make up, won't
you?"

The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:

"I'll thank you to keep yourself TO yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I'll
never speak to you again."

She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not
even presence of mind enough to say "Who cares, Miss Smarty?" until the
right time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a
fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were
a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently
encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She
hurled one in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to
Becky, in her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to
"take in," she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured
spelling-book. If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred
Temple, Tom's offensive fling had driven it entirely away.

Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.
The master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied
ambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but poverty
had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village
schoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and
absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept
that book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was
perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy
and girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two
theories were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in
the case. Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the
door, she noticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious
moment. She glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant
she had the book in her hands. The title-page--Professor Somebody's
ANATOMY--carried no information to her mind; so she began to turn the
leaves. She came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored
frontispiece--a human figure, stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell
on the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse
of the picture. Becky snatched at the book to close it, and had the
hard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle. She thrust
the volume into the desk, turned the key, and burst out crying with
shame and vexation.

"Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a
person and look at what they're looking at."

"How could I know you was looking at anything?"

"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you're
going to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I'll be
whipped, and I never was whipped in school."

Then she stamped her little foot and said:

"BE so mean if you want to! I know something that's going to happen.
You just wait and you'll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!"--and she
flung out of the house with a new explosion of crying.

Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said
to himself:

"What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in school!
Shucks! What's a licking! That's just like a girl--they're so
thin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain't going to tell
old Dobbins on this little fool, because there's other ways of getting
even on her, that ain't so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask
who it was tore his book. Nobody'll answer. Then he'll do just the way
he always does--ask first one and then t'other, and when he comes to the
right girl he'll know it, without any telling. Girls' faces always tell
on them. They ain't got any backbone. She'll get licked. Well, it's a
kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain't any way
out of it." Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: "All
right, though; she'd like to see me in just such a fix--let her sweat it
out!"

Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments
the master arrived and school "took in." Tom did not feel a strong
interest in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls'
side of the room Becky's face troubled him. Considering all things, he
did not want to pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He
could get up no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently
the spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom's mind was entirely full
of his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her
lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She
did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he
spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only
seemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be
glad of that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she
found she was not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an
impulse to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and
forced herself to keep still--because, said she to herself, "he'll tell
about me tearing the picture sure. I wouldn't say a word, not to save
his life!"

Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all
broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly
upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout--he
had denied it for form's sake and because it was custom, and had stuck
to the denial from principle.

A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air
was drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened
himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book,
but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the
pupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched
his movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently
for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!
Tom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit
look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot
his quarrel with her. Quick--something must be done! done in a flash,
too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.
Good!--he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring
through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little
instant, and the chance was lost--the master opened the volume. If Tom
only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help
for Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.
Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even
the innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten
--the master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: "Who tore this book?"

There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness
continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.

"Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?"

A denial. Another pause.

"Joseph Harper, did you?"

Another denial. Tom's uneasiness grew more and more intense under the
slow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of
boys--considered a while, then turned to the girls:

"Amy Lawrence?"

A shake of the head.

"Gracie Miller?"

The same sign.

"Susan Harper, did you do this?"

Another negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling
from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of
the situation.

"Rebecca Thatcher" [Tom glanced at her face--it was white with terror]
--"did you tear--no, look me in the face" [her hands rose in appeal]
--"did you tear this book?"

A thought shot like lightning through Tom's brain. He sprang to his
feet and shouted--"I done it!"

The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a
moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped
forward to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the
adoration that shone upon him out of poor Becky's eyes seemed pay
enough for a hundred floggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own
act, he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr.
Dobbins had ever administered; and also received with indifference the
added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be
dismissed--for he knew who would wait for him outside till his
captivity was done, and not count the tedious time as loss, either.

Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple;
for with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting
her own treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way,
soon, to pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky's
latest words lingering dreamily in his ear--

"Tom, how COULD you be so noble!"



CHAPTER XXI

VACATION was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew
severer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a
good showing on "Examination" day. His rod and his ferule were seldom
idle now--at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and
young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins'
lashings were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under
his wig, a perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle
age, and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great
day approached, all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he
seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least
shortcomings. The consequence was, that the smaller boys spent their
days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge. They
threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief. But he kept
ahead all the time. The retribution that followed every vengeful
success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from
the field badly worsted. At last they conspired together and hit upon a
plan that promised a dazzling victory. They swore in the sign-painter's
boy, told him the scheme, and asked his help. He had his own reasons
for being delighted, for the master boarded in his father's family and
had given the boy ample cause to hate him. The master's wife would go
on a visit to the country in a few days, and there would be nothing to
interfere with the plan; the master always prepared himself for great
occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and the sign-painter's boy
said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on
Examination Evening he would "manage the thing" while he napped in his
chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried
away to school.

In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in
the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with
wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in
his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.
He was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and
six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town
and by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of
citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the
scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of
small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;
rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in
lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their
grandmothers' ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and
the flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with
non-participating scholars.

The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly
recited, "You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the
stage," etc.--accompanying himself with the painfully exact and
spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used--supposing the
machine to be a trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though
cruelly scared, and got a fine round of applause when he made his
manufactured bow and retired.

A little shamefaced girl lisped, "Mary had a little lamb," etc.,
performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and
sat down flushed and happy.

Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into
the unquenchable and indestructible "Give me liberty or give me death"
speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the
middle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under
him and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the
house but he had the house's silence, too, which was even worse than
its sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom
struggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak
attempt at applause, but it died early.

"The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck" followed; also "The Assyrian Came
Down," and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises,
and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The
prime feature of the evening was in order, now--original "compositions"
by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of
the platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with
dainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to
"expression" and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been
illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their
grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line
clear back to the Crusades. "Friendship" was one; "Memories of Other
Days"; "Religion in History"; "Dream Land"; "The Advantages of
Culture"; "Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted";
"Melancholy"; "Filial Love"; "Heart Longings," etc., etc.

A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted
melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of "fine language";
another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words
and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that
conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable
sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one
of them. No matter what the subject might be, a brain-racking effort
was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and
religious mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring
insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the
banishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient
to-day; it never will be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps.
There is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel
obliged to close their compositions with a sermon; and you will find
that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in
the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious. But
enough of this. Homely truth is unpalatable.

Let us return to the "Examination." The first composition that was
read was one entitled "Is this, then, Life?" Perhaps the reader can
endure an extract from it:

  "In the common walks of life, with what delightful
   emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some
   anticipated scene of festivity! Imagination is busy
   sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the
   voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the
   festive throng, 'the observed of all observers.' Her
   graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling
   through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is
   brightest, her step is lightest in the gay assembly.

  "In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by,
   and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into
   the Elysian world, of which she has had such bright
   dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to
   her enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming
   than the last. But after a while she finds that
   beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the
   flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates
   harshly upon her ear; the ball-room has lost its
   charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart,
   she turns away with the conviction that earthly
   pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!"

And so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to
time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of "How
sweet!" "How eloquent!" "So true!" etc., and after the thing had closed
with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.

Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the "interesting"
paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a "poem." Two
stanzas of it will do:

   "A MISSOURI MAIDEN'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA

   "Alabama, good-bye! I love thee well!
      But yet for a while do I leave thee now!
    Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,
      And burning recollections throng my brow!
    For I have wandered through thy flowery woods;
      Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa's stream;
    Have listened to Tallassee's warring floods,
      And wooed on Coosa's side Aurora's beam.

   "Yet shame I not to bear an o'er-full heart,
      Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;
    'Tis from no stranger land I now must part,
      'Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.
    Welcome and home were mine within this State,
      Whose vales I leave--whose spires fade fast from me
    And cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete,
      When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!"

There were very few there who knew what "tete" meant, but the poem was
very satisfactory, nevertheless.

Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young
lady, who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and
began to read in a measured, solemn tone:

  "A VISION

   "Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the
   throne on high not a single star quivered; but
   the deep intonations of the heavy thunder
   constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the
   terrific lightning revelled in angry mood
   through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming
   to scorn the power exerted over its terror by
   the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous
   winds unanimously came forth from their mystic
   homes, and blustered about as if to enhance by
   their aid the wildness of the scene.

   "At such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human
   sympathy my very spirit sighed; but instead thereof,

   "'My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter
   and guide--My joy in grief, my second bliss
   in joy,' came to my side. She moved like one of
   those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks
   of fancy's Eden by the romantic and young, a
   queen of beauty unadorned save by her own
   transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it
   failed to make even a sound, and but for the
   magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as
   other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided
   away un-perceived--unsought. A strange sadness
   rested upon her features, like icy tears upon
   the robe of December, as she pointed to the
   contending elements without, and bade me contemplate
   the two beings presented."

This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with
a sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took
the first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest
effort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the
prize to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it
was by far the most "eloquent" thing he had ever listened to, and that
Daniel Webster himself might well be proud of it.

It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in
which the word "beauteous" was over-fondled, and human experience
referred to as "life's page," was up to the usual average.

Now the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair
aside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of
America on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he
made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered
titter rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set
himself to right it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only
distorted them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced.
He threw his entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not
to be put down by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon
him; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it
even manifestly increased. And well it might. There was a garret above,
pierced with a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle
came a cat, suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag
tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly
descended she curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung
downward and clawed at the intangible air. The tittering rose higher
and higher--the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher's
head--down, down, a little lower, and she grabbed his wig with her
desperate claws, clung to it, and was snatched up into the garret in an
instant with her trophy still in her possession! And how the light did
blaze abroad from the master's bald pate--for the sign-painter's boy
had GILDED it!

That broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.

   NOTE:--The pretended "compositions" quoted in
   this chapter are taken without alteration from a
   volume entitled "Prose and Poetry, by a Western
   Lady"--but they are exactly and precisely after
   the schoolgirl pattern, and hence are much
   happier than any mere imitations could be.



CHAPTER XXII

TOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by
the showy character of their "regalia." He promised to abstain from
smoking, chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he
found out a new thing--namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the
surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very
thing. Tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and
swear; the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a
chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing
from the order. Fourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that up
--gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours--and
fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was
apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral, since
he was so high an official. During three days Tom was deeply concerned
about the Judge's condition and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his
hopes ran high--so high that he would venture to get out his regalia
and practise before the looking-glass. But the Judge had a most
discouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was pronounced upon the
mend--and then convalescent. Tom was disgusted; and felt a sense of
injury, too. He handed in his resignation at once--and that night the
Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom resolved that he would never
trust a man like that again.

The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated
to kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again, however
--there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now--but found
to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he could,
took the desire away, and the charm of it.

Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning
to hang a little heavily on his hands.

He attempted a diary--but nothing happened during three days, and so
he abandoned it.

The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a
sensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were
happy for two days.

Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained
hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man in
the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States
Senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment--for he was not
twenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.

A circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in
tents made of rag carpeting--admission, three pins for boys, two for
girls--and then circusing was abandoned.

A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came--and went again and left the
village duller and drearier than ever.

There were some boys-and-girls' parties, but they were so few and so
delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.

Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her
parents during vacation--so there was no bright side to life anywhere.

The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very
cancer for permanency and pain.

Then came the measles.

During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its
happenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got
upon his feet at last and moved feebly down-town, a melancholy change
had come over everything and every creature. There had been a
"revival," and everybody had "got religion," not only the adults, but
even the boys and girls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the
sight of one blessed sinful face, but disappointment crossed him
everywhere. He found Joe Harper studying a Testament, and turned sadly
away from the depressing spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him
visiting the poor with a basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who
called his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a
warning. Every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression;
and when, in desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of
Huckleberry Finn and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his
heart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all
the town was lost, forever and forever.

And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain,
awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his
head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his
doom; for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was
about him. He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above
to the extremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might
have seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a
battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the
getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf
from under an insect like himself.

By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its
object. The boy's first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His
second was to wait--for there might not be any more storms.

The next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks
he spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad
at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how
lonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted
listlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a
juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her
victim, a bird. He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a
stolen melon. Poor lads! they--like Tom--had suffered a relapse.

Meine Uhr.


Meine schöne neue Uhr ging nun schon anderthalb Jahre weder vor noch
nach, sie war kein einziges Mal stehen geblieben und an dem Werk war
nichts zerbrochen. Nunmehr galt mir ihr Urteil über die Tageszeit
für völlig untrüglich, ihre Lebenskraft und ihr Knochenbau für
unzerstörbar. Aber endlich ließ ich sie eines Abends doch ablaufen.
Ich trauerte darüber, als sei dies Versehen ein Vorbote von kommendem
Unheil und Mißgeschick. Erst allmählich wurde meine Stimmung wieder
heiterer, ich zog die Uhr auf, stellte sie nach Gutdünken und schlug
mir alle abergläubischen Gedanken und trüben Ahnungen aus dem Sinn.

Am nächsten Morgen trat ich in den Laden des ersten Uhrmachers der
Stadt, um meine Uhr genau nach richtiger Zeit zu stellen. Der Herr nahm
sie mir aus der Hand, um dies Geschäft für mich zu besorgen.

»Sie geht vier Minuten nach,« sagte er dabei, »der Regulator muß
vorgerückt werden.«

Ich versuchte ihn daran zu hindern, versuchte ihm begreiflich zu
machen, daß der Gang der Uhr unübertrefflich sei. Vergebens -- der
Kohlkopf in Menschengestalt sah nur das _eine_: die Uhr ging vier
Minuten nach und der Regulator _mußte_ vorgestellt werden. Ich bat und
flehte, er solle es nicht thun, ich sprang in meiner Seelenpein um ihn
herum, aber alles umsonst. Mit kaltblütiger Grausamkeit vollbrachte er
die schändliche That.



Von da an begann meine Uhr zu laufen -- schneller und schneller, Tag
für Tag. Innerhalb einer Woche geriet sie in ein wahres Fieber, ihr
Puls stieg bis auf hundertundfünfzig Grad im Schatten. Noch ehe zwei
Monate zu Ende waren, hatte sie alle Uhren der Stadt weit hinter sich
gelassen und war vierzehntehalb Tage vor dem Kalender voraus. Noch hing
das bunte Oktoberlaub an den Bäumen und sie tummelte sich schon mitten
im Novemberschnee. Die Zahltage für die Hausmiete, für alle fälligen
Rechnungen und sonstigen Schulden kamen in so wahnsinniger Hast näher,
daß ich mir schier kaum mehr zu helfen wußte. So brachte ich sie denn
zum Uhrmacher, um sie regulieren zu lassen. Dieser fragte mich, ob
sie schon jemals repariert worden sei. Als ich das mit dem Bemerken
verneinte, es sei noch nicht nötig gewesen, glitt ein boshaftes Lächeln
über seine Züge. Gierig öffnete er die Uhr, guckte hinein, klemmte
sich ein Ding ins Auge, das aussah wie ein kleiner Würfelbecher, und
betrachtete das Räderwerk genau.

»Sie muß gereinigt und geölt werden,« sagte er, »und außerdem
reguliert; -- fragen Sie in einer Woche wieder nach.«

Gereinigt, geölt und reguliert war meine Uhr; aber nun ging sie
schrecklich langsam, ihr Ticken klang wie Grabgeläute. Ich versäumte
alle Eisenbahnzüge, hielt keine meiner Verabredungen ein und kam wegen
Verspätung um mein Mittagessen. Allmählich machte meine Uhr aus drei
Tagen vier; zuerst wurde es bei mir gestern, dann vorgestern, dann
letzte Woche; ich geriet immer weiter ins Hintertreffen und konnte mich
nicht mehr in die jetzige Welt finden.

Wieder begab ich mich zum Uhrmacher. Er nahm in meinem Beisein die Uhr
ganz auseinander und sagte, der Cylinder sei ›gequollen‹, in drei Tagen
könne er ihn aber wieder auf das richtige Maß bringen.

Hierauf ging die Uhr im Durchschnitt gut, aber auch nur im
Durchschnitt. Den halben Tag lang raste sie wie im Donnerwetter unter
fortwährendem Schnarren, Quieken, Schnauben und Schnaufen, so daß ich
vor dem Lärm meine eigenen Gedanken nicht hören konnte. Keine Uhr im
ganzen Lande hätte vermocht sie einzuholen in ihrem tollen Lauf. Den
Rest des Tages blieb sie allmählich immer mehr zurück und trödelte
derart, daß sie ihren ganzen Vorsprung einbüßte und sämtliche Uhren
ihr wieder nachkamen. _Einmal_ in vierundzwanzig Stunden war sie aber
ganz auf dem richtigen Fleck und gab die Zeit genau an. Dies hielt
sie pünktlich ein und niemand hätte daher behaupten können, sie thue
weniger als ihre Pflicht und Schuldigkeit, oder mehr.

An die Tugend einer Uhr stellt man jedoch höhere Ansprüche, als daß
sie nur im Großen und Ganzen richtig geht. Ich trug sie daher abermals
zum Uhrmacher. Er sagte, der Hauptzapfen wäre zerbrochen, und ich
sprach ihm meine Freude darüber aus, daß der Schaden nicht größer sei.
Offen gestanden hatte ich noch nie etwas von einem Hauptzapfen gehört,
aber ich wollte mich doch einem Fremden gegenüber nicht unwissend
zeigen. Der Zapfen ward ausgebessert, aber das half nur wenig. Die Uhr
ging jetzt eine Weile und dann blieb sie wieder eine Weile stehen,
ganz nach ihrem Belieben. Jedesmal, wenn sie losging, that sie einen
Rückschlag wie eine Muskete. Ein paar Tage lang wattierte ich mir die
Brusttasche aus, schließlich trug ich die Uhr aber zu einem andern
Uhrmacher. Der zerpflückte sie in lauter einzelne Stücke, drehte die
Trümmer vor seinem Vergrößerungsglas hin und her und meinte, es müsse
an der Hemmung etwas nicht in Ordnung sein. Das besserte er aus und
setzte die Uhr wieder zusammen. Nun ging sie gut -- nur alle zehn
Minuten schlossen sich die Zeiger wie eine Schere und machten die Runde
gemeinsam weiter.

Der Weiseste unter den Menschenkindern würde von solcher Uhr nicht
herauskriegen können, was die Glocke geschlagen hat. Ich ging also
wieder hin, um dem Uebelstand abhelfen zu lassen. Jetzt meinte der
Mensch, der Kristall sei verbogen und die Spiralfeder krumm, auch
müsse ein Teil des Werkes neu gefüttert werden. Alle diese Schäden
beseitigte er und meine Uhr ließ nun nichts zu wünschen übrig, nur dann
und wann, nachdem sie etwa acht Stunden regelmäßig gegangen war, geriet
bei ihr inwendig alles in Bewegung, so daß sie zu summen begann wie
eine Biene und die Zeiger sich stracks so flink im Kreise drehten, daß
man sie nicht mehr unterscheiden konnte, sie sahen aus wie ein zartes
Spinngewebe auf dem Zifferblatt. In sechs oder sieben Minuten hatte sie
die ganzen nächsten vierundzwanzig Stunden durchwirbelt, dann gab es
einen Krach und sie stand still. Mit schwerem Herzen ging ich wieder zu
einem andern Uhrmacher und sah wie er das Werk auseinander nahm. Dabei
rüstete ich mich, ein Kreuzverhör mit ihm anzustellen, denn das Ding
ging mir jetzt über den Spaß. Ursprünglich hatte die Uhr zweihundert
Dollars gekostet und ich mußte jetzt für Reparaturen zweitausend bis
dreitausend ausgegeben haben. Während ich so dastand und dem Manne
zusah, kam er mir plötzlich bekannt vor. Nein, ich irrte mich nicht
-- der Uhrmacher war ein früherer Dampfbootmaschinist und zwar nicht
einmal ein guter. Er betrachtete alle Teile sorgfältig, gerade wie
die andern Uhrmacher auch, und fällte dann seinen Urteilsspruch mit
derselben Zuversicht.

Er sagte: »Sie macht zu viel Dampf -- wir müssen den stellbaren
Schraubenschlüssel an das Sicherheitsventil hängen!«

Ich schlug ihm auf der Stelle den Schädel ein und ließ ihn auf meine
Kosten beerdigen.

Mein Onkel William -- Gott hab' ihn selig! -- pflegte zu sagen, ein
gutes Pferd sei ein gutes Pferd, bis es einmal durchgegangen wäre,
und eine gute Uhr eine gute Uhr, bis sie den Reparierern in die Hände
fiele. Er zerbrach sich oftmals den Kopf, was denn eigentlich aus allen
verdorbenen Kesselflickern, Büchsenmachern, Schustern, Grobschmieden
und Maschinisten in der Welt schließlich würde -- aber niemand konnte
ihm je Auskunft geben. --




Einiges über Barbiere.


Alle Dinge sind dem Wechsel unterworfen, ausgenommen die Barbiere, die
Gewohnheiten der Barbiere und die Umgebung der Barbiere. Diese ändern
sich nie. Was man erlebt und erfährt, wenn man zum erstenmal eine
Barbierstube betritt, das erlebt und erfährt man später in allen andern
Barbierstuben, bis an das Ende seiner Tage.

       *       *       *       *       *

Heute morgen ließ ich mich wie gewöhnlich barbieren. Ein Mann kam von
der Jonesstraße auf die Thür zu, als ich auf der Hauptstraße herankam
-- so trifft sich das stets. Ich beschleunigte meine Schritte, aber
umsonst; er war mir um eine Sekunde voraus, ich folgte ihm auf den
Fersen und sah, wie er den einzigen unbesetzten Stuhl einnahm, wo der
erste Barbier sein Amt versah. Das trifft sich immer so. Ich setzte
mich in der stillen Hoffnung nieder, Erbe des Stuhles zu werden,
welcher dem besseren von den zwei übrigen Barbiergehilfen gehörte,
denn dieser hatte schon angefangen seinem Kunden das Haar zu kämmen,
während sein Kamerad noch damit beschäftigt war, dem seinigen die
Locken einzuölen und einzureiben. In großer Spannung beobachtete ich,
was für Aussichten sich mir boten. Als ich sah, daß Nr. 2 drohte
Nr. 1 einzuholen, verwandelte sich meine Spannung in Besorgnis. Als
Nr. 1 einen Augenblick innehielt, um einem neuen Ankömmling, der
ein Badebillet verlangte, Geld herauszugeben und dabei im Wettlauf
zurückblieb, wurde meine Besorgnis zur Angst. Als Nr. 1 das Versäumte
wieder nachholte und gleichzeitig mit seinem Kameraden dem Kunden das
Handtuch abnahm und das Pulver aus dem Gesicht wischte, so daß sich
unmöglich voraussehen ließ, welcher von beiden zuerst ›Der nächste!‹
rufen würde, stockte mir der Atem vor banger Erwartung. Als ich nun
aber sah, wie sich Nr. 1 im entscheidenden Moment noch damit aufhielt,
seinem Kunden ein paarmal mit dem Kamm durch die Augenbrauen zu fahren,
da wußte ich, daß er den Wettlauf um dieses einzigen Augenblicks willen
verloren habe. Entrüstet stand ich auf und verließ den Laden, um nicht
Nr. 2 in die Hände zu fallen; denn jene beneidenswerte Festigkeit
besitze ich nicht, die den Menschen in den Stand setzt, einem
dienstbereiten Barbiergehilfen ruhig ins Angesicht zu sehen und ihm zu
sagen, man wolle auf den Stuhl seines Kollegen warten.

Etwa fünfzehn Minuten blieb ich draußen und kam dann wieder zurück,
in der Hoffnung, es werde mir besser glücken. Natürlich waren jetzt
alle Stühle besetzt und vier Männer warteten schweigend, ungesellig,
zerstreut und mit gelangweilten Mienen, wie das immer der Fall ist,
wenn Leute in einer Barbierstube darauf passen, daß die Reihe an sie
kommt.

Ich ließ mich auf einem steinharten alten Sofa nieder und vertrieb mir
eine Weile die Zeit damit, die eingerahmten Anzeigen verschiedener
Quacksalber zu lesen, die ihre Haarfärbemittel anpriesen. Dann las ich
die fettigen Namen auf den Branntweinflaschen, welche einzelnen Kunden
angehörten, und las auch die Namen und Zahlen auf den Barbierbecken,
die als Privateigentum in den offenen Fächern des Schrankes standen,
studierte die beschmutzten und schadhaften wohlfeilen Bilder an
den Wänden, welche Schlachten darstellten, ehemalige Präsidenten,
wollüstig zurückgelehnte Sultaninnen und das langweilige, ewig
wiederkehrende Mädchen, das des Großvaters Brille aufsetzt. Auch
verfluchte ich in meinem Herzen den lustigen Kanarienvogel und den
unausstehlichen Papagei, die selten in einer Barbierstube fehlen.
Zuletzt suchte ich mir aus den vorjährigen illustrierten Zeitungen,
welche auf dem schmutzigen Mitteltisch herumlagen, die am wenigsten
zerlesene heraus und starrte die unerhört falschen Abbildungen alter,
vergessener Ereignisse an, die sie enthielt.

Endlich kam ich an die Reihe. Eine Stimme rief: »Der nächste!« und
ich geriet natürlich in die Hände von -- Nr. 2. So geht es immer. Ich
äußerte schüchtern, daß ich Eile habe, was ihm einen gerade so tiefen
Eindruck machte, als hätte er es nicht gehört. Er schob mir nun den
Kopf in die Höhe und legte mir eine Serviette unters Kinn. Er fuhr mir
mit den Fingern in den Halskragen und stopfte ein Handtuch hinein. Er
grub seine Klauen in mein Haar und sagte, es müsse beschnitten werden.
Ich erwiderte, ich wolle es nicht schneiden lassen. Nun wühlte er
wieder darin und meinte, es sei für die jetzige Mode ziemlich lang,
besonders hinten; es müsse durchaus unter die Schere. Ich sagte, es
wäre erst vor einer Woche geschnitten worden. Darauf sann er einen
Augenblick gedankenvoll nach und fragte dann mit verächtlicher Miene,
wer es besorgt habe. »Sie!« antwortete ich schnell. Da war er in der
Falle.

Nun fing er an den Seifenschaum zu rühren und sich dabei im Spiegel zu
besehen; von Zeit zu Zeit hielt er inne und trat näher herzu, um sein
Kinn in Augenschein zu nehmen und einen kleinen Pickel zu besichtigen.
Dann seifte er mir eine Seite des Gesichts gründlich ein und wollte
eben die andere in Angriff nehmen, als zwei sich beißende Hunde seine
Aufmerksamkeit fesselten. Er lief ans Fenster, blieb da stehen bis
der Kampf vorbei war und verlor beim Wetten über den Ausgang zwei
Schillinge an die andern Barbiergehilfen, was mir große Befriedigung
gewährte. Nun strich er mir die Seife vollends mit dem Pinsel auf und
begann sie mit der Hand einzureiben.



Dann schärfte er sein Rasiermesser auf einem alten Hosenträger, wobei
ihn ein lebhaftes Gespräch über den öffentlichen Maskenball sehr
aufhielt, bei dem er am Abend zuvor in rotem Kattun und falschem
Hermelin eine Art König dargestellt hatte. Daß seine Kameraden ihn mit
einem Dämchen aufzogen, welches er durch seine Reize erobert haben
sollte, schmeichelte ihm sehr und er trachtete die Unterhaltung auf
jede Weise fortzusetzen, indem er sich stellte, als ärgere ihn die
Neckerei. Dies trieb ihn auch zu einer abermaligen genauen Betrachtung
seiner Person im Spiegel; er legte das Rasiermesser hin, bürstete sich
das Haar mit großer Umständlichkeit, klebte sich eine kühne Locke vorn
im Bogen auf die Stirn, machte sich hinten einen wundervollen Scheitel
und strich sich beide Seitenflügel mit genauester Sorgfalt über die
Ohren. Inzwischen trocknete mir der Seifenschaum im Gesicht und zehrte
mir förmlich am Leben.

Nunmehr begann er mich zu rasieren. Er drückte mir mit den Fingern im
Gesicht herum, um die Haut auszudehnen, und warf meinen Kopf hin und
her, wie es ihm beim Barbieren bequem war. Solange er nur die weniger
empfindlichen Stellen berührte, litt ich keine Schmerzen, als er aber
an meinem Kinn herum zu kratzen, zu scharren und zu schaben anfing, kam
mir das Wasser in die Augen. Nun brauchte er meine Nase als Anfasser,
um die Winkel meiner Oberlippe besser rasieren zu können. Bei diesem
Anlaß machte ich die Entdeckung, daß es zu seinen Obliegenheiten im
Laden gehörte, die Petroleumlampen zu reinigen. Ich hatte mich oft
schon aus Langeweile gefragt, ob das wohl der Geschäftsinhaber selber
besorge, oder die Barbiergehilfen.

Indessen vergnügte ich mich damit, mir auszudenken, wo er mich heute
wohl schneiden werde; ich hatte es jedoch hierüber noch zu keiner
Entscheidung gebracht, als er mir zuvorkam und mir das Kinn aufritzte.
Sogleich begann er sein Messer zu schärfen -- das hätte er vorher thun
sollen. Ich mag nicht zu dicht an der Haut rasiert sein, daher wollte
ich ihn nicht zum zweitenmal an mich kommen lassen und versuchte ihn
zu überreden, das Rasiermesser fortzulegen, aus Angst, er möchte an
die Seite meines Kinns geraten, wo meine allerempfindlichste Stelle
ist, die kein Messer zum zweitenmal berühren darf ohne Schaden
anzurichten. Er sagte, er müsse nur noch einige Rauhheiten glätten,
aber ehe ich mich's versah, fuhr er schon über den verbotenen Grund
und Boden hin und das gefürchtete Brennen und Prickeln meiner Haut
begann sich, wie gerufen, bemerklich zu machen. Nun tauchte er das
Handtuch in Lorbeerbranntwein und klatschte mir damit ins Gesicht,
bald hier bald da -- ein widerliches Gefühl! Hat sich wohl je ein
menschliches Wesen auf solche Weise gewaschen? Dann nahm er das
trockene Ende des Handtuchs und schlug mir auch dieses ins Gesicht,
als ob ein Menschenkind sich jemals so abtrocknete! Aber ein Barbier
reibt einen nur selten ordentlich ab wie ein Christenmensch. Dann goß
er mir Branntwein auf die wunde Stelle, verklebte sie mit Stärkemehl,
feuchtete sie wieder mit Branntwein an und würde gewiß in alle Ewigkeit
mit Kleben und Anfeuchten fortgefahren haben, wenn ich mich nicht
dagegen aufgelehnt und ihn ersucht hätte, es bleiben zu lassen.

Er puderte mir nun das ganze Gesicht ein, richtete mich in die Höhe,
wühlte nachdenklich mit den Händen in meinem Haar und schlug vor,
mir die Kopfhaut gründlich zu waschen, das sei ganz notwendig, ganz
notwendig! Ich entgegnete, daß ich mir erst gestern im Bade das Haar
tüchtig gereinigt hätte. Da war er wieder in der Falle.

Hierauf empfahl er mir ›Smiths Haarverschönerungstinktur‹ und bot mir
eine Flasche zum Kauf an. Das schlug ich aus. Nun pries er mir ›Jones'
Wonne des Toilettentisches‹ und wollte mir von diesem neuen Wohlgeruch
ein Gläschen verkaufen. Aber ich ging nicht darauf ein. Er drang
endlich in mich, ein gräßliches Mundwasser seiner eigenen Erfindung
mitzunehmen.

Nachdem auch dieser letzte Versuch fehlgeschlagen war, ging er wieder
an sein Geschäft, bestreute mich über und über mit Puder, mit Einschluß
der Beine, fettete mir die Haare ein, obgleich ich Einsprache dagegen
erhob, zog und riß mir dabei eine Menge mit der Wurzel aus, kämmte
und bürstete dann den Rest, teilte mir hinten einen Scheitel ab und
klebte mir die unvermeidliche, bogenförmige Haarlocke auf die Stirn.
Während er mir dann meine dünnen Augenbrauen auskämmte und mit Pomade
beschmierte, erging er sich über die Leistungen eines ihm gehörigen
schwarz und braun gefleckten Dachshundes bis ich das Pfeifen des
Mittagszuges hörte und wußte, daß ich zu demselben fünf Minuten zu
spät kommen würde. Nun nahm er mir das Handtuch ab, wischte mir damit
noch einmal über das Gesicht, fuhr mir wieder mit dem Kamm durch die
Augenbrauen und rief munter: »Der nächste!«




Wie ein Schnupfen kuriert wird.


Es ist zwar etwas Gutes für die Unterhaltung des Publikums zu
schreiben, aber etwas noch weit Höheres und Edleres ist es, wenn man
zur Belehrung, zum Nutzen, zum wahren Wohl seiner Mitmenschen schreibt
-- und das ist der einzige Zweck der folgenden Abhandlung. Wenn es mir
gelänge, dadurch auch nur _einem_ Leidenden wieder zur Gesundheit zu
verhelfen, das Feuer der Hoffnung und Freude in seinem matten Blick
aufs neue zu entzünden und seinem erstorbenen Herzen den raschen,
fröhlichen Pulsschlag vergangener Tage zurückzugeben, so wäre mir alle
Mühe reichlich vergolten und jene heilige Wonne würde meine Seele
durchströmen, welche der Christ fühlt, wenn er eine gute, selbstlose
That vollbracht hat.

Da ich stets ein untadeliges Leben geführt habe, bin ich berechtigt
zu glauben, daß niemand, der mich kennt, aus Furcht, ich hätte die
Absicht ihn zu täuschen, meine Ratschläge zurückweisen wird. Möge das
Publikum sich die Ehre anthun, meine hier niedergelegten Erfahrungen
bei Behandlung eines Schnupfens zu lesen -- und dann meinem Beispiel
folgen.

Als das weiße Haus in Virginia-City abbrannte, verlor ich meine
Häuslichkeit, meine Behaglichkeit, meine Gesundheit und meinen
Koffer. Der Verlust der beiden erstgenannten Artikel war leicht zu
verschmerzen; denn eine Häuslichkeit ohne eine Mutter, eine Schwester
oder eine entfernte junge Verwandte, welche uns die schmutzige Wäsche
wegräumt, unsere Stiefel vom Kaminsims herunternimmt und uns so daran
erinnert, daß jemand an uns denkt und für uns sorgt, ist nicht schwer
zu finden. Und was meine Behaglichkeit betrifft, so war ich kein
Dichter und brauchte der Schwermut über ihren Verlust nicht lange
nachzuhängen. Aber eine gute Gesundheit zu verlieren und einen noch
besseren Koffer, das waren ernstliche Unglücksfälle. Am Tage der
Feuersbrunst zog ich mir nämlich infolge der übergroßen Anstrengung,
mit welcher ich mich anschickte etwas zu thun, eine starke Erkältung zu.

Als ich das erstemal zu niesen begann, riet mir ein Freund ein warmes
Fußbad zu nehmen und dann zu Bette zu gehen. Das that ich. Gleich
darauf meinte ein zweiter, ich solle aufstehen und ein kaltes Sturzbad
nehmen. Eine Stunde später versicherte mir ein dritter, man müsse einen
›Schnupfen füttern und ein Fieber aushungern.‹ Ich litt an beiden und
hielt es daher für das beste, mich des Schnupfens wegen voll und satt
zu essen, dann Hausarrest zu nehmen und das Fieber eine Weile hungern
zu lassen.

Bei halben Maßregeln lasse ich es in solchem Falle nie bewenden. Ich
aß also nach Herzenslust und wendete meine Kundschaft einem Fremden
zu, der an jenem Morgen gerade sein Speisehaus eröffnet hatte. Er
stand in ehrerbietigem Schweigen dabei, bis ich meinen Schnupfen genug
gefüttert hatte und fragte dann, ob die Leute in Virginia-City häufig
vom Schnupfen befallen würden. Als ich erwiderte das könne wohl möglich
sein, ging er hinaus und nahm sein Wirtshausschild ab.

Ich begab mich nun nach dem Bureau und begegnete unterwegs abermals
einem vertrauten Freunde, der mir sagte, daß es auf der Welt nichts
Wirksameres gäbe, um sich vom Schnupfen zu kurieren, als wenn man ein
Quart warmes Salzwasser tränke. Ich zweifelte stark, daß ich noch
Platz dafür haben könne, aber versuchen wollte ich es jedenfalls. Der
Erfolg war überraschend. Mir war als hätte ich meine unsterbliche Seele
von mir gegeben.

Da ich meine Erfahrungen nur zum Nutzen derjenigen niederschreibe,
welche von demselben Uebel befallen sind wie ich, halte ich es für
angemessen, sie vor den Mitteln zu warnen, die sich bei mir als
unwirksam erwiesen haben. Aus vollster Ueberzeugung muß ich ihnen
daher raten, sich vor warmem Salzwasser zu hüten. Wenn ich wieder den
Schnupfen hätte und mir nur die Wahl bliebe, meine Zuflucht zu einem
Erdbeben oder einem Quart Salzwasser zu nehmen, so würde ich mein Heil
mit dem Erdbeben versuchen.



Nachdem der Sturm, der in meinem Innern wütete, sich etwas gelegt hatte
und da zufällig kein guter Samariter mehr bei der Hand war, borgte
ich mir wieder Taschentücher und zerschneuzte sie zu Atomen, wie ich
es in den ersten Stadien meines Schnupfens gethan hatte. Dies trieb
ich solange, bis ich einer Dame begegnete, die eben von jenseits der
Prairie herkam. Sie hatte in einer Gegend gelebt, wo Mangel an Aerzten
war, und sagte, die Not habe sie gelehrt, einfache Alltagskrankheiten
mit vielem Geschick zu behandeln. Ich war überzeugt, daß sie eine
lange Erfahrung hinter sich haben müsse, denn sie sah aus, als sei sie
hundertfünfzig Jahre alt.

Sie mischte einen Trank aus Sirup, Scheidewasser, Terpentin
und allerlei Kräutern zusammen und gab mir die Anweisung, alle
Viertelstunden ein Weinglas voll davon zu nehmen. Ich ließ es
jedoch bei der ersten Dosis bewenden; sie reichte hin, um mich aller
moralischen Grundsätze zu berauben und die unwürdigsten Triebe in mir
wach zu rufen. Unter ihrem bösartigen Einfluß wälzte ich in meinem Hirn
die ungeheuerlichsten und niederträchtigsten Pläne und Entwürfe, aber
meine Hand war damals zu schwach, sie auszuführen. Hätten nicht die
unfehlbaren Heilmittel für den Schnupfen durch wiederholte Angriffe
meine Kräfte völlig erschöpft, ich wäre wahrlich imstande gewesen auf
Leichenraub auszugehen.

Wie die meisten andern Leute habe ich zuweilen gemeine Regungen und
handle darnach; aber bis zu einem solchen Grade von unmenschlicher
Ruchlosigkeit hatte ich es noch nie gebracht, bevor ich jene Arzenei
einnahm, und obendrein war ich noch stolz darauf. Nach Verlauf von zwei
Tagen war ich wieder soweit, aufs neue an mir herumdoktern zu können.
Ich wandte noch mehrere untrügliche Mittel an und trieb mir schließlich
die Erkältung aus dem Kopf in die Lunge.

Nun bekam ich fortwährend Hustenanfälle und meine Stimme sank unter
den Nullpunkt. Ich sprach mit den Leuten in einem grollenden Baß, zwei
Oktaven unter meinem gewöhnlichen Tonfall. Eine regelmäßige Nachtruhe
konnte ich nur dadurch erlangen, daß ich mich in einen Zustand
gänzlicher Erschöpfung hineinhustete; sobald ich aber im Schlaf zu
sprechen anfing, weckte mich der Mißlaut meiner Stimme wieder auf.

Mein Fall verschlimmerte sich von Tag zu Tag. Man empfahl mir
Wacholderschnaps. Den trank ich. Dann Schnaps mit Sirup. Ich trank auch
den. Ferner Schnaps mit Zwiebeln. Die that ich dazu und schluckte alle
drei zusammen, jedoch ohne besonderes Ergebnis.

Ich sah mich jetzt genötigt meiner Gesundheit durch Luftveränderung
wieder aufzuhelfen und reiste mit meinem Kollegen, dem Zeitungsreporter
Wilson, nach dem Bigler-See. Nicht ohne eine gewisse Befriedigung
denke ich daran, daß wir auf ganz vornehme Weise reisten, wir benutzten
nämlich die Pionierpost und mein Freund nahm sein ganzes Gepäck mit,
welches aus zwei prachtvollen seidenen Halstüchern und dem Daguerrebild
seiner Großmutter bestand. Dort machten wir den Tag über Segelfahrten,
gingen auf die Jagd, auf den Fischfang und zum Tanz und die Nacht
hindurch kurierte ich meine Erkältung. Durch diese Einrichtung gelang
es mir, jede von den vierundzwanzig Stunden nutzbringend zu verwenden.
Aber mein Uebel wurde nur immer schlimmer.

Man riet mir nun zu einer nassen Wickelung. Bisher hatte ich kein
einziges Heilmittel zurückgewiesen und es schien Thorheit, jetzt
noch damit anzufangen. So beschloß ich denn die Wickelung zu
versuchen, obwohl ich keine Ahnung hatte, was das eigentlich für
eine Veranstaltung sei. Sie wurde um Mitternacht vorgenommen und das
Wasser war brennend kalt. Ein Leintuch, das mindestens tausend Meter
lang zu sein schien, wurde in Eiswasser getaucht und mir um Brust und
Rücken gewickelt, bis ich aussah wie der Wischer für eine der neuen
Riesenkanonen.

Es ist ein grausames Verfahren. Wenn der kalte Lappen das warme Fleisch
berührt, fährt man vor Schrecken zusammen und schnappt nach Atem wie
ein Mensch in der Todesnot. Mir erfror das Mark in den Knochen und mein
Herzschlag schien stillzustehen. Ich glaubte mein letztes Stündlein sei
gekommen.

Ich warne hiermit jedermann vor kalten Wickelungen. Es giebt nichts
Unbehaglicheres in der Welt -- außer vielleicht, einer Dame unserer
Bekanntschaft zu begegnen, die aus Gründen, die sie selbst am besten
weiß, über uns hinweg sieht, oder, wenn sie uns wirklich ansieht, uns
nicht kennt.

Aber, was ich noch sagen wollte, -- als mein Schnupfen nach der
Wickelung nicht kuriert war, empfahl mir eine befreundete Dame ein
Senfpflaster auf die Brust zu legen. Das hätte mich, glaube ich,
auch wirklich geheilt, wäre der junge Wilson nicht gewesen. Beim
Zubettegehen legte ich mir das Senfpflaster, das ganz großartig war --
es maß achtzehn Zoll im Viereck -- bequem zur Hand, wo ich es erreichen
konnte. Aber Wilson bekam in der Nacht Hunger und -- den Rest kann sich
der Leser selber denken.

Nach einem achttägigen Aufenthalt am Bigler-See ging ich nach
Steamboat-Springs, wo ich Dampfbäder nahm und noch eine Masse der
erbärmlichsten Arzneien zu schlucken bekam, die je zusammengebraut
worden sind. Sie würden mich ganz hergestellt haben, aber ich
mußte nach Virginia-City zurückkehren, wo ich es trotz der
verschiedenartigsten Heilmittel, die ich jeden Tag verschlang, möglich
machte, meine Krankheit durch Vernachlässigung und Ausgehen bei kalter
Witterung sehr zu verschlimmern.

Endlich beschloß ich nach San Francisco zu reisen. Am ersten Tag nach
meiner Ankunft daselbst sagte mir eine Dame im Gasthaus, ich solle alle
vierundzwanzig Stunden ein Quart Whisky trinken und ein Freund, der in
der Stadt wohnte, gab mir denselben Rat. Das machte also zusammen zwei
Quart oder eine halbe Gallone. Soviel trank ich und bin noch am Leben.

       *       *       *       *       *

In obigem habe ich mit der allerbesten Absicht von der Welt das
mannigfaltige Heilverfahren geschildert, welches ich kürzlich zur Kur
meines Schnupfens durchzumachen hatte. Ich empfehle es besonders allen,
die an der Schwindsucht leiden. Wenn sie einen Versuch damit anstellen
und nicht gesund werden, so kann es sie höchstens umbringen.




Kinderkrankheiten.

    Diese Geschichte hat Herr Mc Williams, ein freundlicher Herr
    aus New York, dem Verfasser erzählt, der ihn zufällig auf einer
    Reise traf.




Sie können sich kaum vorstellen, Herr Mark Twain, wie schrecklich die
unheilbare Krankheit, welche man die häutige Bräune nennt, in unserer
Stadt gewütet hat. Ebenso schlimm als die Krankheit selbst war der
Umstand, daß alle Mütter vor Angst und Schrecken fast den Verstand
verloren. Hören Sie zu, was ich mit meiner Frau während jener Zeit
erlebte. Eines Mittags kam ich nach Hause und machte meine Frau auf die
kleine Penelope aufmerksam, indem ich bemerkte:

»Mein Herz, ich würde an deiner Stelle nicht erlauben, daß das Kind an
dem Kienspan kaut.«

»Was in aller Welt soll denn das schaden?« entgegnete sie, schickte
sich aber zugleich an, den Span fortzunehmen; -- ohne weitläufige
Erörterung können Frauenzimmer nun einmal nicht den geringsten Rat
befolgen, wenn dessen Weisheit auch noch so sehr auf der Hand liegt; d.
h. _verheiratete_ Frauen.

Ich erwiderte: »Herzchen, man weiß, daß keine Holzart so wenig Nährwert
für ein Kind besitzt wie Tannenholz.«

Meine Frau zog die Hand zurück, mit der sie den Span ergreifen wollte
und legte sie wieder in den Schoß.

»Du bist im Irrtum,« sagte sie merklich erregt; »alle Aerzte
versichern, daß das Terpentin im Tannenholz für ein schwaches Rückgrat
und für die Nieren sehr gut ist.«

»Ah so -- ich bitte um Entschuldigung. Ich habe nicht gewußt, daß unser
Kind an Rückenschwäche und an den Nieren leidet und daß der Hausarzt
verordnet hat --«

»Das Kind denkt gar nicht daran, an dergleichen zu leiden -- wie kommst
du darauf?«

»Aber liebe Frau, du hast doch angedeutet --«

»Bewahre, so etwas ist mir nicht eingefallen.«

»Es ist ja kaum zwei Minuten her, mein Herz, daß du sagtest --«

»Dummes Zeug! Ich mag gesagt haben was ich will -- jedenfalls ist es
kein Unglück, daß die Kleine an einem Stück Holz kaut, wenn sie Lust
dazu hat; ich dächte, du könntest das auch einsehen. Ich verwehre es
ihr nicht und damit ist's gut!«

»Ereifere dich nicht, mein Kind; ich sehe schon ein, daß du recht hast
und werde gleich ausgehen, um ein paar Klafter vom besten Tannenholz zu
bestellen. Solange _ich_ lebe, soll mein Kind -- --«

»O bitte, geh in dein Geschäft und laß mich einen Augenblick in Ruhe.
Man kann auch nicht die geringste Bemerkung machen, du mußt darüber
streiten, streiten, streiten, bis du nicht mehr weißt, wovon du
sprichst -- wie immer.«

»Nun gut, du sollst deinen Willen haben. Aber in deiner letzten
Bemerkung war ein Mangel an Logik, der -- --«

Ehe ich jedoch ausgeredet hatte, war sie zur Thüre hinausgesegelt und
hatte das Kind mitgenommen.

       *       *       *       *       *

Als ich am Abend desselben Tages zu Tische nach Hause kam, trat sie mir
mit kreideweißem Gesicht entgegen.

»O Mortimer, ein neuer Fall! Der kleine George vom Nachbar Gordon ist
krank!«

»Häutige Bräune?«

»Häutige Bräune!«

»Hat der Arzt noch Hoffnung?«

»Nicht die geringste! O, was soll aus uns werden!«

Kurz darauf brachte eine Wärterin die kleine Penelope herein, um uns
gute Nacht zu sagen und das übliche Abendgebet auf der Mutter Schoß zu
sprechen. Aber mitten in: »Jetzt leg' ich mich zu süßer Ruh,« hustete
sie ein wenig. Meine Frau fuhr zurück als hätte sie der Schlag gerührt.
Doch schon im nächsten Augenblick war sie auf den Füßen, der Schrecken
spornte sie zu fieberhafter Thätigkeit.

Sie befahl, das Bett des Kindes aus der Kinderstube in unser
Schlafzimmer zu bringen, und ging selbst mit, um die Ausführung des
Befehls zu beaufsichtigen. Natürlich mußte ich auch dabei sein, und wir
brachten die Sache schnell in Ordnung. Für die Kinderfrau wurde ein
Bett in dem Ankleidezimmer meiner Frau aufgeschlagen. Nun fiel ihr aber
ein, daß wir zu weit von dem andern Kind entfernt seien, und wenn sich
in der Nacht bei ihm Symptome zeigen sollten -- mein armes Frauchen
wurde wieder leichenblaß.

Darauf schafften wir das Kinderbett und die Kinderfrau wieder in die
Kinderstube und schlugen für uns beide ein Bett im Nebenzimmer auf.
Plötzlich bekam meine Frau jedoch Angst, Penelope könne den Kleinen
anstecken. Dieser Gedanke jagte ihr ein solches Entsetzen ein, daß
ihre ganze Hilfsmannschaft das Bettchen nicht schnell genug wieder
hinaustragen konnte. Meine Frau half in eigener Person und riß es
beinahe in Stücke in ihrer verzweifelten Hast.

Wir zogen in den unteren Stock, aber da war nicht Platz genug, die
Kinderfrau unterzubringen, und meine Frau meinte, ihre Erfahrung
würde eine unschätzbare Hilfe sein. So kehrten wir denn mit Sack und
Pack wieder in unser eigenes Schlafzimmer zurück und fühlten uns so
glücklich, wie ein Paar vom Sturm verschlagene Vögel, die ihr warmes
Nestchen wiederfinden.

Meine Frau eilte jetzt in die Kinderstube, um zu sehen, wie es dort
stände. Im Nu war sie aber wieder da, von neuer Furcht ergriffen.

»Wie kann es nur kommen, daß der Kleine so fest schläft?«

»Aber mein Herz,« sagte ich, »der Kleine schläft ja immer so fest, daß
er aussieht wie ein Bild.«

»Ich weiß, ich weiß; aber heute hat sein Schlaf etwas Unnatürliches. Er
scheint -- er scheint so regelmäßig zu atmen.«

»Aber, liebes Kind, er atmet immer regelmäßig.«

»O, das weiß ich; aber heute macht es einen schrecklichen Eindruck.
Seine Wärterin ist viel zu jung und unerfahren, Marie soll bei ihr
bleiben, damit sie bei der Hand ist, wenn etwas passiert.«

»Das ist ein guter Gedanke; aber, wer wird _dir_ helfen?«

»_Du_ kannst mir alle Hilfe leisten, die ich brauche. Ich werde mich ja
so wie so in dieser schrecklichen Zeit auf keinen Menschen verlassen,
sondern alles selbst thun.«

Ich erwiderte, daß ich mich selbst verachten würde, wenn ich zu Bette
gehen und schlafen wollte, während sie wachte und sich um unsere Kranke
mühte, die lange, bange Nacht. Doch endlich ließ ich mich überreden. So
begab sich also die alte Marie wieder zurück auf ihren Posten in der
Kinderstube.

Penelope hustete ein- oder zweimal im Schlaf.

»Warum nur dieser Doktor nicht kommt. -- Mortimer, es ist gewiß zu
warm im Zimmer. Mache den Schieber zu -- schnell!«

Ich schloß die Luftheizung ab, sah nach dem Thermometer und fragte
mich, ob denn 14° wirklich zu warm sei für ein krankes Kind.

Der Kutscher kam jetzt aus der Stadt mit der Nachricht, daß unser
Hausarzt krank zu Bette liege. Meine Frau warf mir einen erlöschenden
Blick zu und sagte mit sterbender Stimme:

»Es ist der Wille der Vorsehung. So war es vorher bestimmt. -- Noch nie
ist er krank gewesen, _nie_! Wir haben nicht so gelebt wie wir sollten,
Mortimer. Immer und immer wieder habe ich es dir gesagt. Nun siehst du,
wohin es führt. Danke Gott, wenn du es dir _je_ verzeihen kannst -- ich
kann es mir nicht vergeben.«

Ich sagte, ohne die Worte genau zu wählen, aber durchaus nicht in
der Absicht, sie zu kränken, es sei mir nicht bewußt, daß wir ein so
gottloses Leben geführt hätten.

»Mortimer -- willst du das Gericht Gottes auch über der Kleinen
heraufbeschwören?«

Sie brach in Thränen aus -- aber plötzlich rief sie:

»Der Doktor muß doch Arzenei geschickt haben!«

»Gewiß,« versetzte ich, »hier ist sie. Ich habe nur auf den passenden
Moment gewartet, es dir zu sagen.«

»So gieb sie doch her; weißt du nicht, daß jetzt jeder Augenblick
kostbar ist! Aber ach, wozu schickt er überhaupt Arzenei, wenn er doch
weiß, daß alles vergebens ist.«

Ich sagte, wo noch Leben wäre, sei auch noch Hoffnung.

»Hoffnung! -- Mortimer, du weißt so wenig was du sprichst, wie ein
neugeborenes Kind. Wenn du nur -- Welcher Unsinn -- die Anweisung sagt:
alle Stunde einen Theelöffel! Einmal stündlich -- als ob wir ein ganzes
Jahr vor uns hätten, um das Kind zu retten! Mortimer, schnell, gieb
dem armen verschmachtenden Würmchen einen Eßlöffel voll; nur diesmal
beeile dich!«

»Aber, mein Herz, ein Eßlöffel voll könnte --«

»Mache mich nicht toll! ... Hier, mein Engelchen, mein süßes, nimm das
häßliche bittere Zeug; es ist gut für Nelly, für Mamas süßen, kleinen
Liebling und soll sie gesund machen. Da, da, da, lege dein Köpfchen an
Mütterchens Brust und schlaf' ein, damit du bald -- -- o, ich weiß, sie
wird den Morgen nicht erleben! -- Mortimer, einen Eßlöffel alle halbe
Stunde! Aber das Kind sollte auch Belladonna nehmen und Acconit. Hole
die Fläschchen, Mortimer. Bitte, thue was ich sage; du verstehst ja
doch nichts davon.«

Wir stellten nun das Bett des Kindes dicht an das Kopfende meiner Frau
und legten uns nieder. Das viele Durcheinander hatte mich schrecklich
müde gemacht, und in zwei Minuten war ich halb eingeschlafen.

Meine Frau weckte mich.

»Männchen, ist die Luftheizung offen?«

»Ich glaube nicht.«

»Das habe ich mir gedacht. Bitte mache den Schieber gleich auf; das
Zimmer ist kalt.«

Ich schob ihn auf und schlief wieder ein: da wurde ich nochmals geweckt.

»Bester Mann, du könntest doch so gut sein, das Bettchen an deine Seite
zu stellen, es ist näher an der Heizung.«

Ich stellte das Bett an _meine_ Seite, verwickelte mich aber in den
Bettteppich und weckte das Kind. Wieder verfiel ich in Schlaf, während
meine Frau die kleine Kranke beruhigte. Aber nicht lange, so kamen wie
aus weiter Ferne durch den Nebel meiner Schlaftrunkenheit die Worte an
mein Ohr:

»Mortimer, wenn wir nur etwas Gänsefett hätten -- bitte, willst du
klingeln.«

Ich kletterte im Halbschlaf heraus und trat auf die Katze, welche mit
einem lauten Protest antwortete; ich wollte ihr dafür einen Fußtritt
verabreichen, aber der Stuhl bekam ihn statt der Katze.

»Mortimer, was fällt dir ein? Warum drehst du den Gashahn auf? Willst
du das Kind zum zweitenmal wecken?«

»Ich will sehen, ob ich mir Schaden gethan habe, Evangeline.«

»Dann sieh nur auch den Stuhl an; ich bin überzeugt, er ist in Stücken.
Die arme Katze; wenn du nun -- --«

»Die Katze ist mir völlig gleichgültig. Das alles wäre nicht geschehen,
wenn du Marie hier behalten hättest, um diese Pflichten zu übernehmen,
die sie angehen, und nicht mich.«

»Du solltest dich schämen, Mortimer, eine solche Bemerkung zu machen.
Wahrhaftig, wenn du die Kleinigkeiten, um die ich dich bitte, nicht
einmal besorgen willst -- da doch unser Kind -- --«

»Schon gut, ich will ja alles thun. Aber kein Mensch hört auf mein
Läuten. Sie sind wahrscheinlich alle zu Bett gegangen. -- Wo steht das
Gänsefett?«

»Auf dem Kamin im Kinderzimmer. Wenn du hingehen willst und mit Marie
sprechen -- --«

Ich holte das Gänsefett und schlief wieder ein. Abermals wurde ich
gerufen: »Mortimer, es ist mir schrecklich, dich zu stören, aber das
Zimmer ist immer noch zu kalt, wenn ich die Einreibung machen soll.
Könntest du nicht das Feuer anzünden? Es ist alles zurechtgelegt, du
brauchst nur ein Schwefelhölzchen hineinzustecken.«

Ich kroch aus dem Bett, machte das Feuer an, und setzte mich als
Jammergestalt daneben.

»Mortimer, du erkältest dich zu Tode, wenn du da sitzen bleibst. Komm'
zu Bett!«

Ich wollte hineinsteigen, da sagte sie:

»Nur einen Augenblick! Bitte, gieb dem Kinde noch etwas Arzenei.« --
Das that ich, und meine Frau benutzte die Gelegenheit, da die Kleine
doch einmal wach war, sie auszuziehen und über und über mit dem
Gänsefett einzuschmieren. Bald schlief ich von neuem -- aber nicht
lange.



»Mortimer, es zieht irgendwo; ich fühle es ganz deutlich. Nichts ist
verhängnisvoller bei solcher Krankheit als Zugwind. Bitte, stelle das
Kinderbett näher ans Feuer.« Das that ich und wickelte mich wieder in
den Bettteppich, den ich dabei ins Feuer warf. Meine Frau sprang aus
dem Bett und rettete ihn, wobei wir etwas aneinander gerieten. Nun
folgte wieder eine kleine Schlafpause, bis mir befohlen wurde, einen
Umschlag von Leinsamen zu machen. Dieser wurde dem Kinde auf die Brust
gelegt, um dort seine heilende Wirkung zu üben.

Ein Holzfeuer hat nicht lange Bestand. Alle zwanzig Minuten stand ich
auf, um das unsrige anzufachen und Holz nachzulegen; dadurch verkürzten
sich auch die Zwischenräume beim Eingeben der Arzenei um zehn Minuten,
was meiner Frau eine große Erleichterung war. Dazwischen erneuerte ich
die Umschläge und legte einen Senfteig oder andere Zugpflaster überall
da auf, wo noch eine freie Stelle an dem Kinde zu finden war. Endlich,
gegen Morgen, war das Holz verbraucht, und meine Frau meinte, ich solle
in den Keller gehen, um welches zu holen.

»Das ist eine schwere Arbeit, liebes Kind,« bemerkte ich. »Der Kleinen
ist gewiß warm genug bei ihren vielen Umhüllungen. Wir können ihr ja
auch noch eine Lage Brei auflegen und --«

Ich kam nicht zu Ende, denn ich wurde unterbrochen. Eine Weile
schleppte ich Holz herauf und kroch dann wieder in mein Bett. Bald
schnarchte ich, wie nur ein Mensch schnarchen kann, der völlig
abgemattet ist an Körper und Geist. Bei Tagesanbruch fühlte ich ein
Rütteln an meiner Schulter, was mich schnell zur Besinnung brachte.
Meine Frau stand mit stierem Blick vor mir und rang nach Luft. Sobald
sie sprechen konnte, sagte sie:

»Es ist alles aus -- alles aus! -- Das Kind schwitzt. Was fangen wir
an?«

»Mein Gott, wie du mich erschreckt hast! Ich weiß nicht, was ich dir
raten soll. Vielleicht wenn wir alles abkratzten und Penelope wieder in
den Zug brächten --«

»Welcher Blödsinn! -- Jetzt ist kein Augenblick zu verlieren! Hole
den Doktor, schnell! Du mußt _selbst_ gehen. Bringe ihn her, tot oder
lebendig.«

Ich zerrte den armen kranken Mann aus dem Bett und brachte ihn zu uns.
Er sah das Kind an und sagte, es läge nicht im Sterben. Das war mir
eine unaussprechliche Freude, aber meine Frau wurde so böse, als habe
er sie persönlich beleidigt. Dann meinte er, der Husten des Kindes wäre
nur durch einen kleinen Reiz in der Kehle verursacht. Wie er das sagte,
fürchtete ich fast, meine Frau würde ihm die Thüre weisen. Der Doktor
wollte die Kleine nun stärker zum Husten bringen, um die Störung zu
beseitigen. Er gab ihr etwas ein, sie hustete heftig, und heraus kam,
-- ein kleiner Holzsplitter.

»Das Kind hat keine Bräune,« sagte der Arzt. »Es hat an einem Stück
Tannenholz gekaut, und ein paar kleine Splitter in den Hals bekommen.
Die werden ihm nichts schaden.«

»Nein,« sagte ich, »das glaube ich auch. Das Terpentin darin ist sogar
sehr gut für einige Krankheiten, die bei Kindern vorkommen. Meine Frau
kann Ihnen das sagen.«

Aber das that sie nicht. Sie wendete sich empört von uns ab und verließ
das Zimmer. Seit der Zeit ist in unserm ehelichen Leben _eine_ Episode,
die wir nie erwähnen. Im übrigen fließt der Strom unserer Tage in
ungetrübter Heiterkeit dahin.

    Sehr wenig Ehemänner haben ähnliche Erfahrungen gemacht, wie
    Herr Mc Williams; deshalb dachte der Verfasser dieses Buches,
    die Sache würde durch ihre Neuheit vielleicht in den Augen des
    Lesers ein flüchtiges Interesse erhalten.




Frau Mc Williams beim Gewitter.


Ja, fuhr Herr Mc Williams fort, -- dies war nämlich nicht der Anfang
seiner Rede -- die Furcht vor dem Gewitter ist eine der qualvollsten
Schwächen, von denen ein menschliches Wesen heimgesucht werden kann.
Sie ist meistens auf Frauen beschränkt, hie und da findet sie sich
jedoch auch bei einem kleinen Hunde und manchmal auch bei einem Manne.
Es ist eine ganz besonders traurige Schwäche, indem sie einem Menschen
den Verstand in höherem Grade raubt als irgend eine andere Furcht, da
sie sich weder durch Vernunftgründe noch durch Beschämung unterdrücken
läßt. Eine Frau, die dem Teufel selber ins Gesicht sehen könnte -- oder
einer Maus -- verliert ihre Schneidigkeit und ist rein weg angesichts
eines zuckenden Blitzes.

Also wie ich Ihnen sagte, ich wachte auf an dem halberstickten von
irgendwo herkommenden Schrei: »Mortimer, Mortimer!« Sobald ich meine
fünf Sinne zusammenfassen konnte, richtete ich mich in der Dunkelheit
auf und antwortete:

»Evangeline, rufst du? was giebts? wo bist du?«

»In die Wäschekammer eingeschlossen! Du solltest dich schämen,
dazuliegen und so zu schlafen, während solch ein fürchterliches
Gewitter losbricht.«

»Nun, wie kann man sich denn schämen, wenn man schläft? Das hat ja
keinen Sinn; ein Mensch kann sich nicht schämen, derweil er schläft,
Evangeline.«

»Das thust du freilich nie, Mortimer, das weiß _ich_ wohl!«

Ich vernahm den Laut unterdrückten Schluchzens. Dieser Klang machte die
scharfe Rede, die sich auf meine Lippen drängte, ersterben und ich ließ
mich statt dessen folgendermaßen vernehmen:

»Es thut mir leid, Liebe, es thut mir wirklich leid. Ich wollte es
nicht thun, komm' heraus und --«

»Mortimer!«

»Himmel, was giebts, mein Schatz?«

»Ich glaube gar, daß du _noch_ im Bett liegst?«

»Warum nicht? natürlich.«



»Augenblicklich stehe auf! Ich dächte, du solltest doch ein klein wenig
acht auf dein Leben geben, um meinet- und der Kinder willen, wenn nicht
schon um deinetwillen.«

»Aber lieber Schatz --«

»Hör' auf, Mortimer, du weißt, bei einem solchen Gewitter ist der
allergefährlichste Platz das Bett. Das steht in allen Büchern. Aber das
ist dir einerlei, du bleibst doch darin liegen und wirfst lieber dein
Leben rücksichtslos weg, der Himmel weiß warum, höchstens aus ewiger
Rechthaberei und --«

»Aber zum Kuckuck, Evangeline, ich bin ja jetzt nicht mehr im Bett, ich
bin --«

Dieser Satz wurde unterbrochen durch einen plötzlichen Blitzstrahl,
begleitet von einem unterdrückten Aufschrei meiner Frau und einem
furchtbaren Donnerschlag.

»Da! Nun siehst du, wozu das führt. O, Mortimer, wie kannst du so
ruchlos sein, bei einem solchen Wetter zu fluchen?«

»Ich habe ja nicht geflucht. Und das kam gar nicht davon her, es wäre
ganz ebenso gekommen, auch wenn ich kein Wörtchen gesagt hätte, und du
weißt ganz gut, Evangeline, oder solltest es wenigstens wissen, daß,
wenn die Atmosphäre mit Elektrizität geladen ist --«

»O, ja, jetzt habe nur recht und wieder recht und noch einmal recht.
Ich begreife nicht, wie du so handeln magst, da du doch weißt, daß wir
keinen Blitzableiter haben und daß deine arme Frau und Kinder rein
der Gnade der Vorsehung anheimgegeben sind. -- Aber was thust du? Ein
Zündhölzchen anstecken? bei einem solchen Wetter, bist du völlig toll?«

»Zum Henker, Frau, was schadet denn das? Es ist ja hier so finster wie
in einer Kuh und --«

»Lösch' es aus, lösch' es augenblicklich aus! Willst du uns alle
geflissentlich zu Grunde richten? Du weißt doch, daß nichts so den
Blitz anzieht wie ein Licht.«

(Fzt, -- krach! -- bum! -- bolum! -- bum!)

»O, da höre, jetzt siehst du, was du angerichtet hast.«

»Wieso? Ein Schwefelhölzchen kann allenfalls den Blitz anziehen, aber
gewiß ruft es keinen Blitz hervor, -- ich stehe dafür ein. Sollte aber
dieser Schuß dennoch meinem Zündhölzchen gegolten haben, so war er
jämmerlich gezielt, -- eine Leistung, die unter Tausenden kaum einer
fertig bringt.«

»Schäme dich, Mortimer. Da stehen wir dem Tode Auge in Auge gegenüber,
und doch bist du fähig, in einem so feierlichen Augenblick eine solche
Sprache zu führen. Wenn du nicht den Wunsch hast, -- Mortimer --«

»Nun?«

»Hast du eigentlich heute ein Nachtgebet gesprochen?«

»Ich -- ich -- war eben dabei, da fiel mir ein, auszurechnen, wie viel
zwölfmal dreizehn ist und --«

(Fzt, -- bum! -- bum! -- bumerumbum! -- bang! -- krach!)

»O, wir sind verloren, rettungslos verloren. Wie konntest du so etwas
versäumen, bei solch einem Wetter!«

»Aber es war ja noch nicht so ein Wetter. Es war kein Wölkchen
am Himmel. Wie konnte ich ahnen, daß wegen einer so kleinen
Unterlassungssünde all dies Gerumpel und Gepolter losgehen würde? Und
ich meine, es ist gerade nicht hübsch von dir, so viel Aufhebens davon
zu machen, da du doch weißt, daß es so selten vorkommt. Vorher habe ich
es nie versäumt, nie seit dem großen Erdbeben, an dem ich schuld war.«

»Mortimer, wie du sprichst! Hast du das gelbe Fieber vergessen?«

»Meine Liebe, du legst mir immer das gelbe Fieber zur Last, und
ich meine doch, das ist ganz sinnlos. Wie soll denn ein kleines
Frömmigkeitsvergehen von mir so weithin wirken? Das Erdbeben will ich
meinetwegen auf mich nehmen, weil es in der Nachbarschaft stattfand,
aber ich will mich hängen lassen, wenn ich verantwortlich sein soll für
jedes lumpige --«

(Fzt, bum, bum, belum, bum, bang!)

»O Gott, o Gott, gewiß hat es irgendwo eingeschlagen. Wir werden keinen
Tag mehr erleben, und dann, wenn wir nicht mehr sind, kann es dir eine
Genugthuung sein, zu wissen, daß dein gottloses Gerede -- Mortimer!«

»Nun, was ist wieder los?«

»Deine Stimme klingt, wie wenn -- Mortimer, stehst du wirklich vor dem
offenen Kamin?«

»Das ist allerdings mein Verbrechen in diesem Augenblick.«

»Geh' augenblicklich davon weg. Es scheint, du bist entschlossen,
Vernichtung über uns alle zu bringen. Weißt du nicht, daß es keinen
besseren Leiter für den Blitz giebt, als ein offenes Kamin? -- Wo bist
du nun hingegangen?«

»Da ans Fenster.«

»O, um Gottes willen, hast du den Verstand verloren? Geh' weg von dort,
augenblicklich! Die kleinsten Kinder wissen, daß es lebensgefährlich
ist, während eines Gewitters am Fenster zu stehen. Lieber, Guter, ich
weiß, ich erlebe keinen Tag mehr -- Mortimer?«

»Ja!«

»Was ist das für ein Rascheln?«

»Ich bin's.«

»Was thust du denn?«

»Ich bemühe mich, das obere Ende meiner Unterbeinkleider zu finden.«

»Schnell, wirf das Zeug weg. Du wirst doch nicht diese Kleidungsstücke
bei einem solchen Wetter anziehen wollen? Du weißt doch, daß allen
Autoritäten zufolge wollene Stoffe den Blitz anziehen. O, Liebster,
Bester, ist es nicht genug, daß man aus natürlichen Ursachen stets in
Lebensgefahr schwebt? Und du thust alles Erdenkbare, was die Gefahr
vermehren kann. -- So singe doch nicht! Wie kannst du auf den Einfall
kommen?«

»Nun, was kann denn das schaden?«

»Mortimer, ich habe dir einmal, habe dir hundertmal gesagt, daß Singen
Schwingungen in der Atmosphäre verursacht, die den Zug des elektrischen
Stroms unterbrechen und -- um alles in der Welt, wozu machst du die
Thür auf?«

»Gerechter Himmel, Weib, ist auch dabei Gefahr?«

»Gefahr? Der Tod ist dabei. Jeder, der irgend darauf geachtet hat,
weiß, daß einen Luftzug verursachen geradezu den Blitz herbeiziehen
heißt. Du hast sie nur halb zugemacht, schließe sie fest und mach'
schnell, oder wir sind alle verloren. O, es ist etwas Fürchterliches,
bei einem solchen Wetter mit einem Wahnwitzigen eingeschlossen zu sein.
Mortimer, was thust du?«

»Nichts, ich drehe eben den Wasserhahn auf, dieses Zimmer ist zum
Ersticken dumpf, ich muß mir Gesicht und Hände netzen.«

»Du hast scheints den letzten Rest deines Verstandes verloren. Wo der
Blitz einen andern Gegenstand _ein_mal trifft, schlägt er fünfzigmal
ins Wasser. Drehe schnell zu. O, Lieber, ich sehe schon, daß nichts auf
dieser Welt uns retten kann, ich glaube, daß -- -- Mortimer, was war
das?«

»Es war ein verfl... es war ein Bild, hab's heruntergestoßen.«

»Dann stehst du also hart an der Wand? Eine unerhörte Unvorsichtigkeit.
Weißt du nicht, daß es keinen besseren Leiter für den Blitz giebt, als
eine Wand! Mach', daß du davon weg kommst. -- Und eben warst du auch
wieder nahe daran zu fluchen. O, wie kannst du so verzweifelt gottlos
sein, während deine Familie in solcher Gefahr schwebt? Mortimer, hast
du ein Federbett herthun lassen, wie ich dich gebeten habe?«

»Nein, hab's vergessen.«

»Vergessen? Es kann dich dein Leben kosten. Hättest du jetzt ein
Federbett, um es in die Mitte des Zimmers zu breiten und dich darauf zu
legen, so wärst du völlig in Sicherheit. Komm' hier herein -- schnell,
ehe du noch weitere tolle Streiche machen kannst.«

Ich versuchte es, aber die Kammer vermochte uns beide bei geschlossener
Thüre nicht zu fassen, wenn wir nicht ersticken wollten. Ich schnappte
eine Weile nach Luft, dann stürzte ich hinaus. Meine Frau rief:

»Mortimer, es muß etwas zu deiner Rettung geschehen, gieb mir das
deutsche Buch, das auf dem Kaminsims liegt, und ein Licht, -- aber
steck' es nicht an. In dem Buche finden sich einige Ratschläge.«

Ich holte das Buch auf Kosten einer Vase und anderer zerbrechlicher
Sachen. Meine Frau schloß sich mit ihrem Licht ein, worauf ich einen
Augenblick Ruhe hatte, dann rief sie heraus: »Mortimer, was war das?«

»Nur die Katze.«

»O, Jammer. Fang' sie und sperr' sie in den Waschschrank ein. Rasch,
lieber Schatz. Die Katzen sind voll Elektrizität, ich bekomme gewiß
noch weiße Haare bei den furchtbaren Gefahren dieser Nacht.«

Ich vernahm wieder das unterdrückte Schluchzen, sonst würde ich weder
Hand noch Fuß geregt haben zu einem solchen Beginnen in der Dunkelheit,
nämlich über Stühle und alle Arten von Hindernissen, die meist sehr
hart und scharfkantig waren, auf die Katze Jagd zu machen. Endlich war
es mir gelungen, Mieze in den Schrank zu schließen, freilich auf Kosten
von über 400 Dollars an zerbrochenen Möbeln und Schienbeinen. Dann
drang es dumpf aus dem Kämmerchen:

»In dem deutschen Buche steht, es sei bei einem Gewitter am sichersten,
sich mitten im Zimmer auf einen Stuhl zu stellen, -- die Stuhlbeine
müssen durch Nichtleiter isoliert werden, d. h. du mußt die Stuhlbeine
auf Sturzbecher von Glas stellen -- (Fzt, -- bum, bam, krach). O, höre
doch. Eile dich, Mortimer, ehe du getroffen wirst.«

Es gelang mir, die Gläser zu finden, es waren die letzten vier. Alle
andern hatte ich zusammengeschlagen. Ich isolierte die Stuhlbeine und
bat um weitere Verhaltungsmaßregeln.

»Mortimer, dann heißt es: ›Während eines Gewitters entferne man
Metalle, wie z. B. Uhren, Ringe, Schlüssel von sich und halte sich auch
nicht an solchen Stellen auf, wo viele Metalle beieinander liegen, oder
mit andern Körpern verbunden sind, wie an Herden, Oefen, Eisengittern
u. dgl.‹ Verstehst du das, Mortimer? Heißt das, daß man Metalle bei
sich behalten muß, oder fern von sich halten?«

»Ja, ich weiß auch nicht recht, es kommt mir etwas unklar vor, ich
kenne die Sprache nicht so genau. Wenn ich das Deutsch recht verstehe,
so scheint es mir zu besagen, daß man Metall an sich haben soll.«

»Ja, so muß es wohl sein, das sagt ja der gesunde Menschenverstand. Es
wirkt wie beim Blitzableiter, weißt du. Setz' deinen Feuerwehrhelm auf,
Mortimer, der ist fast ganz aus Metall.«

Ich holte ihn und setzte ihn auf, -- ein recht schweres, plumpes und
unbequemes Ding, in einer heißen Nacht in einem dumpfen Zimmer. War
mir doch schon mein Nachtgewand mehr Bekleidung, als ich eigentlich
bedurfte.

»Mortimer, ich glaube, dein Unterleib bedarf auch eines Schutzes,
willst du nicht so gut sein und deinen Bürgerwehrsäbel umschnallen?«

Ich willfahrte.

»Jetzt, Mortimer, mußt du noch etwas zum Schutz deiner Füße haben,
bitte, schnalle deine Sporen an.«

Ich that es, ohne ein Wort zu sagen, und hielt meine gute Laune
aufrecht, so gut ich konnte.

»Mortimer, es heißt in dem deutschen Buche weiter: ›Das Gewitterläuten
ist sehr gefährlich, weil die Glocke selbst, sowie der durch das Läuten
veranlaßte Luftzug und die Höhe des Turmes den Blitz anziehen könnten;‹
Mortimer, heißt das, daß es gefährlich sei, die Kirchenglocken während
eines Gewitters nicht zu läuten?«

»Ja, es sieht so aus. -- Wenn dies das Partizip der Vergangenheit im
Nominativ Singularis ist, -- und das scheint mir so --; ja, ich denke,
es heißt, daß in Anbetracht der Höhe des Kirchturms und in Ermangelung
von Luftzug es sehr gefährlich sein würde, während eines Gewitters die
Glocken nicht zu läuten, -- und außerdem, siehst du nicht, daß gerade
der Ausdruck -- --«

»Schon gut, Mortimer, verliere die kostbare Zeit nicht mit Reden, hole
die große Tischglocke, sie ist gerade dort auf dem Vorplatz. Geschwind,
lieber Mortimer, wir sind beinahe in Sicherheit; o mein Bester, ich
glaube, wir kommen diesmal noch davon.«

Unsere kleine Sommerwohnung steht oben auf einer Hügelreihe, die
über ein Thal hineinschaut. Mehrere Bauernhäuser sind in unserer
Nachbarschaft, das nächste 3--400 Yards entfernt.



Als ich auf dem Isolierstuhle stehend, die schreckliche Glocke sieben
oder acht Minuten lang geläutet hatte, wurden unsere Läden plötzlich
von außen aufgerissen und eine Laterne fuhr blendend an das Fenster,
während eine Stimme also sprach: »Was in aller Welt ist hier los?«

Das Fenster war voll von menschlichen Köpfen und die Köpfe voll von
Augen, welche mein Nachtgewand, mit der kriegerischen Ausrüstung
darüber, wild anstierten. Ich ließ die Glocke sinken, sprang verwirrt
vom Stuhl herunter und sagte:

»Es ist nichts los, gute Freunde; nur eine kleine Störung wegen des
Gewitters; ich habe mich bemüht, den Blitz abzuhalten.«

»Gewitter? Blitz? Ei, Herr Mc Williams, haben Sie den Verstand
verloren? Es ist eine schöne sternenhelle Nacht, keine Spur von
Gewitter.«

Ich schaute hinaus und war so erstaunt, daß ich eine Zeit lang kein
Wort herausbrachte. Dann sagte ich:

»Ich begreife das nicht, wir sahen das Zucken der Blitze ganz deutlich
durch die Vorhänge und Läden und hörten den Donner.«

Die Leute legten sich nach einander auf den Boden und wälzten sich vor
Lachen, -- zwei lachten sich zu Tode.

Einer von den Ueberlebenden bemerkte: »Aber, daß Sie nicht daran
dachten, ihre Läden aufzumachen und einmal auf den hohen Hügel dort
hinauf zu sehen! Was Sie hörten, waren Kanonenschüsse, was Sie sahen,
war das Feuer derselben. Wissen Sie, der Telegraph hat gerade um
Mitternacht die Kunde gebracht, daß Cleveland ernannt ist, und darum
die ganze Geschichte.«

       *       *       *       *       *

»Ja, Herr Twain, wie ich gleich zu Anfang sagte,« bemerkte Herr Mc
Williams zum Schluß, »die Vorschriften, um die Menschen vor Blitzschlag
zu bewahren, sind so vortrefflich und so zahllos, daß es mir
schlechterdings unbegreiflich ist, wie irgend jemand es fertig bringt
getroffen zu werden.«

Mit diesen Worten raffte er sein Bündel und seinen Schirm zusammen und
stieg aus, denn der Zug war an seinem Wohnort angekommen.




Ueber frühreife Kinder.


Alle kleinen Kinder scheinen heutzutage die lästige und naseweise
Angewohnheit zu haben, bei jeder Gelegenheit schlaue Aeußerungen
zu thun, besonders in Zeiten, da sie ganz stillschweigen sollten.
Nach den Witzworten dieser Art zu urteilen, welche im Durchschnitt
veröffentlicht werden, müssen die Kinder der jüngsten Generation
förmlich blödsinnig sein. Und ihre Eltern stehen ihnen an Dummheit
sicherlich nur wenig nach, denn durch sie werden meist jene kindischen
Albernheiten -- die Geistesblitze, wie sie uns aus den Zeitschriften
entgegenleuchten -- zur allgemeinen Kenntnis gebracht.

Man argwöhnt vielleicht, daß Neid oder Groll aus mir spricht, wenn ich
mich hierüber so sehr ereifere; ich muß auch wirklich gestehen, daß
mir ärgerlich ist zu hören, wieviele gescheite Kinder es heute auf
der Welt giebt, weil es mich daran erinnert, wie selten _ich_ etwas
Witziges gesagt habe, solange ich noch klein war. Zwei- oder dreimal
habe ich es versucht, aber es fand keinen Anklang. Meine Angehörigen
erwarteten nicht, geistreiche Bemerkungen von mir zu hören; überraschte
ich sie damit, so wurde ich entweder vorlaut gescholten oder ich
bekam Schläge. Mich überläuft eine Gänsehaut und das Blut erstarrt
mir in den Adern, wenn ich bedenke, was wohl aus mir geworden wäre,
hätte ich mich unterstanden, in Gegenwart meines Vaters einige von
den schlauen Aeußerungen zu thun, welche man in unserer Zeit von
vierjährigen Kindern erzählt. Mir einfach bei lebendigem Leibe die Haut
über die Ohren zu ziehen, wäre ihm, einem solchen Sünder gegenüber, als
verbrecherische Milde und Verletzung seiner Pflicht erschienen. Dem
strengen ernsten Mann war alles vorlaute Wesen ein Greuel; hätte er von
mir solche gescheite Dinge gehört, wie sie andere Kinder sagen, es wäre
mein Tod gewesen. Ja, er würde mich sicherlich umgebracht haben, falls
nämlich noch Zeit dazu gewesen wäre. Aber das ist zweifelhaft, denn ich
hätte natürlich aus Vorsicht zuerst eine Dosis Strychnin genommen und
dann meine witzige Aeußerung gethan.

Ueber _eine_ Bemerkung, die ich in meiner frühsten Kindheit machte --
es war nicht einmal ein Witzwort -- wäre es beinahe zu einem ernsten
Zerwürfnis zwischen meinem Vater und mir gekommen. Das trug sich
nämlich so zu: Eines Tages unterhielten sich meine Eltern mit Onkel,
Tante und mehreren Freunden darüber, welchen Namen man mir geben solle.
Ich lag da, beschäftigt verschiedene Gummiringe zu probieren, um die
besten auszuwählen, weil ich es satt hatte, mir die kommenden Zähnchen
an anderer Leute Fingern durchzubeißen, und nach einem Gegenstand
trachtete, mit dessen Hilfe ich dies Geschäft rasch zu Ende führen und
dann etwas Neues beginnen könne. Man weiß ja, was für eine Quälerei es
ist, sich die Zähne am Finger der Amme durchzubeißen, oder welche Mühe
man hat und wie man sich den Rücken fast zerbricht, wenn man die eigene
große Zehe dazu benützen will. Wer hat nicht dabei schon die Geduld
verloren und seine Zähne ins Pfefferland gewünscht, noch ehe ihre
ersten Spitzchen durchguckten? -- Mir ist's, als wäre das alles erst
gestern geschehen.

Doch, ich will nicht weiter abschweifen. Also -- ich lag da und wählte
mir meine Gummiringe; als dabei mein Blick zufällig die Uhr traf, fiel
mir ein, daß ich in einer Stunde und fünfundzwanzig Minuten gerade
zwei Wochen alt sein würde. Ach, wie wenig hatte ich noch gethan, um
die Wohlthaten zu verdienen, mit denen man mich so verschwenderisch
überhäufte!

Jetzt hörte ich, wie der Vater sagte: »Abraham ist ein guter Name; mein
Großvater hieß Abraham.«

»Jawohl,« erwiderte die Mutter, »mir ist Abraham für einen seiner
Zunamen ganz recht.«

Ich wollte auch meine Meinung abgeben: »Abraham gefällt dem
Unterzeichneten,« sagte ich.

Da runzelte der Vater die Stirn, aber meine Mutter machte ein ganz
vergnügtes Gesicht und die Tante rief: »Hört nur den lieben kleinen
Schelm!«

»Isaak ist ein guter Name,« fuhr mein Vater fort, »auch Jakob könnten
wir wählen.«

»Gewiß,« stimmte die Mutter bei, »bessere Namen giebt es gar nicht. Wir
wollen ihn auch Isaak und Jakob nennen.«

»Einverstanden,« sagte ich, »mit Isaak und Jakob bin ich zufrieden und
verbleibe ganz der Ihrige. Bitte, gebt mir doch einmal die Klapper her;
ich kann nicht den ganzen Tag an Gummiringen kauen.«

Keine Seele machte sich Notizen von meinen Aeußerungen zum Zweck der
Veröffentlichung. Das sah ich und that es selber, sonst wären sie
gänzlich verloren gegangen. Statt daß man mich liebevoll ermuntert
hätte, wie es bei andern Kindern geschieht, die sich geistig aufgeweckt
zeigen, strafte mich der Vater mit einem Zornesblick, die Mutter sah
ängstlich und bekümmert aus und auch die Tante schien zu meinen,
ich hätte mir zu viel herausgenommen. Voll Ingrimm biß ich meinen
Gummiring entzwei und zerschlug verstohlen die Klapper auf dem Kopf des
Kätzchens, doch sagte ich nichts.

»Der allerbeste Name ist Samuel,« begann mein Vater von neuem.

Da wußte ich, daß ein Sturm im Anzug sei, den nichts abwenden könne.
Ich legte meine Klapper hin, ließ des Onkels silberne Uhr über den Rand
der Wiege fallen, desgleichen die Kleiderbürste, das hölzerne Hündchen,
meine Zinnsoldaten, das Reibeisen und sonstige Gegenstände, mit welchen
ich für gewöhnlich meine Untersuchungen und Beobachtungen anstellte,
oder ein angenehmes Geräusch hervorbrachte -- gelegentlich zerschlug,
zerbrach und zertrümmerte ich sie auch, wenn es galt, mir eine gesunde
Bewegung zu machen. Dann zog ich mein Röckchen an, setzte mein Mützchen
auf, nahm die kleinen Schuhe in eine Hand, das Stück Lakritze in die
andere und kletterte auf den Fußboden hinunter.

»Mag daraus werden was will,« dachte ich bei mir, »ich bin bereit.«

Mit lauter, fester Stimme sagte ich nun: »Vater, das ist unmöglich --
den Namen Samuel kann ich nicht tragen.«

»Wie, mein Sohn?«

»Wirklich, Vater, ich kann es nicht.«

»Warum nicht?«

»Ich habe eine unbezwingliche Abneigung dagegen.«

»Das ist unverständig, mein Sohn. Viele große und gute Männer hießen
Samuel.«

»Davon ist mir kein Beispiel bekannt.«

»Was? War nicht Samuel, der Prophet, groß und gut?«

»Hm! Nicht so besonders.«

»Aber, mein Sohn! Der Herr rief ihn doch mit seiner eigenen Stimme.«

»Jawohl, aber er mußte ihn ein paarmal rufen, bis er endlich kam.«

Damit ergriff ich die Flucht, und der strenge alte Mann lief mir nach.
Um die Mittagsstunde des nächsten Tages holte er mich ein, und als
unsere Zusammenkunft vorüber war, hatte ich richtig den Namen Samuel
erhalten, dazu eine Tracht Schläge und manche nützliche Belehrung
obendrein. Nachdem mein Vater die Sache auf diese Weise ausgeglichen
hatte, war sein Zorn beschwichtigt. Gut, daß ich Vernunft annahm, sonst
hätte unsere Uneinigkeit leicht zu einem unheilbaren Bruch führen
können.



Was würde mir aber mein Vater -- nach diesem Vorfall zu urteilen
-- wohl angethan haben, wenn jemals eine von den schwächlichen
Albernheiten aus meinem Munde gekommen wäre, welche als Aeußerungen
gescheiter zweijähriger Kinder jetzt im Druck erscheinen? -- Ich bin
überzeugt, daraus wäre ein Fall des Kindsmords in unserer Familie
entstanden.




Staatswirtschaft.


»Die Staatswirtschaft,« schrieb ich, »ist die Grundlage einer jeden
guten Regierung. Die weisesten Männer aller Jahrhunderte haben diesem
Gegenstand stets --«

Hier wurde ich durch die Meldung unterbrochen, daß ein Fremder unten
sei, der mich zu sprechen wünsche. Ich folgte dem Ruf, trat vor ihn hin
und fragte nach seinem Begehr. Dabei war ich aus allen Kräften bemüht,
die in mir gärenden staatswirtschaftlichen Gedanken festzuhalten und
ihnen weder die Zügel schießen zu lassen noch zu dulden, daß sie sich
im Geschirr verwickelten. Heimlich wünschte ich jedoch, der Fremde läge
auf dem Grunde des Meeres und auf ihm eine Ladung Getreide. Ich war
wie im Fieber; er blieb völlig kühl. Es thue ihm leid mich zu stören,
sagte er, aber er habe im Vorbeigehen bemerkt, daß ich auf meinem Haus
ein paar Blitzableiter brauchen könne. »Nun -- und --« sagte ich, »was
weiter, was wollen Sie?« Er entgegnete, er wolle nichts weiter, nur
würde er die Blitzableiter gern bei mir anbringen.

Es ist noch nicht lange, daß ich einen eigenen Haushalt führe, bisher
habe ich immer in Hotels und Kosthäusern gewohnt. Natürlich wollte
ich aber vor einem Fremden von meiner Unerfahrenheit nichts merken
lassen und als gewiegter Hausbesitzer auftreten: das wird jedermann
begreiflich finden. Ich sagte daher mit ernster Miene, es sei schon
längst meine Absicht gewesen, sechs oder acht Blitzableiter bei mir
anbringen zu lassen, allein -- der Fremde fuhr zusammen und sah mich
fragend an, aber ich verlor die Fassung nicht. Wenn ich Fehler machte,
sollte er mir meine Unkenntnis wenigstens nicht im Gesicht lesen.
Er sagte, es würde ihm lieber sein, mich zum Kunden zu haben, als
irgend einen andern in der ganzen Stadt. »Schon gut,« versetzte ich
und stand eben im Begriff mich wieder an die Verfolgung meines großen
Gegenstands zu begeben, als er mich zurückrief und erklärte, erst müsse
er genau wissen, wie viele Spitzen ich zu haben wünsche, an welchen
Teilen des Hauses er sie anbringen solle und welcher Art von Stangen
ich den Vorzug gäbe. Das war eine schöne Klemme für jemand, der erst
so kurze Zeit verantwortlicher Hausbesitzer ist; aber ich hielt mich
wacker, und er merkte mir höchst wahrscheinlich nicht einmal an, daß
ich ein Neuling sei. Er solle acht Spitzen anbringen, sagte ich,
sämtlich auf dem Dach, und Stangen von der besten Qualität nehmen.
Die gewöhnliche Ware, lautete seine Antwort, könne er für zwanzig
Cent liefern, gekupferte für fünfundzwanzig, mit Zink plattierte und
spiralförmig gebogene für dreißig Cent den Fuß. Letztere würden jedem
Blitzstrahl Halt gebieten, wohin er auch unterwegs sei, »seine Wirkung
unschädlich machen und seinen weiteren Fortgang apokryph.« Ich sagte
›apogryph‹ wäre kein schlechtes Wort, da es aus heiliger Quelle stamme,
aber, ohne der Philologie zu nahe zu treten, zöge ich die spiralförmig
gebogenen Blitzableiter vor und würde diese Sorte nehmen. Hierauf
erwiderte er, man _könne_ zwar im Notfall mit zweihundertfünfzig Fuß
auskommen; wenn die Arbeit aber ordentlich gemacht werden solle, so
daß sie als die beste in der Stadt gelten, Gerechte und Ungerechte
befriedigen werde und jedermann zwingen einzugestehen, er habe noch nie
eine symmetrischere und hypothetischere Aufstellung von Blitzableitern
gesehen, seit er das Licht der Welt erblickt -- dann würde er, um
diesen Zweck zu erreichen, sicherlich vierhundert Fuß verbrauchen
müssen. Doch wolle er nicht auf seinem Kopf bestehen und gewiß sein
Möglichstes thun. »So nehmen Sie denn vierhundert,« sagte ich, »und
machen Sie die Arbeit wie Sie wollen, nur halten Sie mich nicht länger
auf.« Nachdem ich ihn glücklich los geworden, brauchte ich eine halbe
Stunde, um meine staatswirtschaftlichen Gedanken wieder da anzuknüpfen,
wo ich sie gelassen hatte und sie weiter zu spinnen, wie folgt:

    »nicht nur die reichsten Schätze ihres Geistes zugewandt,
    sondern auch ihre Lebenserfahrung und ihre Kenntnisse. Die
    großen Lichter der Handelsgesetzgebung, der Völkerverbrüderung
    und der verschiedensten Lebensordnungen in allen Jahrhunderten,
    allen Kulturen, allen Nationen, von ~Zoroaster~ bis auf ~Horace
    Greeley~, sind bemüht gewesen --«

Hier wurde ich wieder unterbrochen und gebeten, hinunterzukommen,
weil der Blitzableitermann noch ein Anliegen habe. Ich eilte zu ihm,
während in mir die mächtigsten Gedanken wogten und wallten und sich in
so majestätische Worte kleideten, daß jedes derselben in einer langen
Prozession von Silben einherzog, die schwerlich in weniger als fünfzehn
Minuten vorüber sein konnte. Wieder befand ich mich in fieberhafter
Aufregung ihm gegenüber, während er sanft und ruhig blieb. Er hatte die
beschauliche Stellung des Kolosses von Rhodus angenommen; mit einem Fuß
stand er auf meiner neugepflanzten Tuberose, mit dem andern auf dem
Stiefmütterchenbeet, die Hände in die Hüften gestemmt, die Hutkrempe
ins Gesicht gezogen, ein Auge zugekniffen und das andere mit kritischem
und bewunderndem Blick auf meinen größten Schornstein gerichtet. Ein
solches Schauspiel zu betrachten, sagte er, sei die höchste Lebenslust.
»Gestehen Sie selbst,« wandte er sich zu mir, »haben Sie je etwas von
so entzückendem landschaftlichem Reiz gesehen, als acht Blitzableiter
auf einem einzigen Schornstein?« Ich erwiderte, ich könne mich nicht
gerade auf einen Anblick besinnen, der diesen überträfe, worauf er
bemerkte, daß es nach seiner Ansicht auf Erden nichts gäbe, was
sich an Naturschönheiten damit vergleichen ließe -- ausgenommen der
Niagarafall. Um mein Haus zu einer vollkommenen Augenweide zu machen,
brauche man nur noch die andern Schornsteine etwas auszuschmücken,
damit der ganze ~coup d'oeil~ sich zu einer Harmonie entwickele, die
geeignet sei, die Aufregung, in welche man durch den ersten ~coup
d'état~ versetzt werde, einigermaßen zu mildern.



Als ich ihn fragte, ob er seine Art sich auszudrücken aus Büchern habe,
die ich mir vielleicht irgendwo aus einer Leihbibliothek verschaffen
könne, lächelte er wohlgefällig und meinte, solche Redeweise lasse sich
nicht aus Büchern lernen. Nur wer mit dem Blitz vertraut sei, dürfe
es wagen, sich ungestraft solcher Unterhaltungsform zu bedienen. Dann
machte er einen ungefähren Anschlag und versicherte, wenn noch acht
Blitzableiter über das Dach verteilt würden, so ließe sich mein Zweck
wohl erreichen; mit fünfhundert Fuß des Leitungsmaterials dächte er
auszukommen. Bei den ersten acht hätte er sich nämlich etwas verrechnet
-- nur um eine Kleinigkeit, etwa um hundert Fuß, genau könne er es noch
nicht angeben. Ich sagte ihm, ich sei in schrecklicher Eile und wünsche
das Geschäft schnell abzumachen, um wieder an meine Arbeit zu kommen.
Da entgegnete er: »Einen Augenblick habe ich wohl daran gedacht, die
acht Blitzableiter anzubringen und dann ruhig meiner Wege zu gehen.
Mancher würde vielleicht an meiner Stelle so gehandelt haben, aber
ich sagte mir: Nein, ich kenne den Mann nicht und lieber möchte ich
sterben, als einen Fremdling ins Unglück stürzen. Auf dem Haus sind
noch nicht genug Blitzableiter und ich rühre mich nicht vom Platz, bis
ich ihm das gesagt habe und also gethan, was ich wünschte, daß man mir
in demselben Falle thäte. -- Fremdling, meine Pflicht ist erfüllt! Wenn
der recalcitrante und dephlogistische Himmelsbote Ihr Haus trifft,
so -- --«

»Schon gut, schon gut,« rief ich; »pflanzen Sie die andern acht auch
auf -- verwenden Sie meinetwegen noch fünfhundert Fuß spiralförmig
gebogene Leitungsstangen; thun Sie, was Sie nicht lassen können;
stillen Sie Ihr Sehnen, aber gestatten Sie Ihren Gefühlen nur so weit
freien Lauf, als Sie mit dem Wörterbuch reichen können. Wenn wir uns
jetzt genügend verständigt haben, möchte ich wieder an meine Arbeit
gehen.«

Nun sitze ich schon seit einer vollen Stunde hier und versuche meinen
Gedankengang da wieder aufzunehmen, wo ich zuletzt unterbrochen wurde;
jetzt endlich ist es mir gelungen; ich fahre also fort:

    »diesen großen Gegenstand zu bezwingen, aber selbst die
    Geistesmächtigsten unter ihnen haben einen würdigen Gegner
    an ihm gefunden, der sich nach jeder Niederlage nur um so
    mutiger erhebt. Der berühmte Confucius sagte, lieber wollte er
    ein tüchtiger Staatsmann sein, als Polizeipräsident. Cicero
    hat häufig den Ausspruch gethan, daß die Staatswirtschaft
    die größte Wirtschaft sei, welche der Mensch imstande sei zu
    betreiben, und selbst unser Greeley hat im allgemeinen mit
    Nachdruck angedeutet, daß _Staats_ --«

Hier ließ mich der Blitzableitermann wieder abrufen und ich ging in
einem Gemütszustand hinunter, der an Ungeduld grenzte. Er sagte, daß er
untröstlich sei, mich noch einmal stören zu müssen -- weit lieber wäre
er gestorben. Aber, wenn ihm eine Arbeit übertragen sei, von der man
erwarte, daß er sie ordentlich und kunstgerecht ausführe und er nach
Vollendung des Werkes, im Begriff sich seiner so wohl verdienten Ruhe
und Erholung hinzugeben, noch einen betrachtenden Blick darauf werfe
und zu seinem Schrecken gewahr werde, daß alle Berechnungen nicht genau
genug gewesen seien und daß das Haus, für welches er ein persönliches
Interesse fühle, falls ein Gewitter losbrechen sollte, dastehen
werde, ohne auf der Welt einen andern Schutz zu haben als sechzehn
Blitzableiter auf dem Dach, ja dann -- --

»Kein Wort mehr,« schrie ich in wahnsinniger Erregung, »warum pflanzen
Sie nicht hundertfünfzig auf? Zehn Stück auf die Küche, ein Dutzend
auf die Scheune, ein paar auf die Kuh, einen auf die Köchin! Spicken
Sie das ganze unselige Gebäude damit, bis es aussieht wie ein großes,
zinkplattiertes, spiralförmig gewundenes, an den Spitzen versilbertes
Stachelschwein. Fort ans Werk! Verbrauchen Sie das sämtliche
verfügbare Material, und wenn Sie keine Blitzableiter mehr haben,
stecken Sie Kolbenstangen auf, Ladestöcke, Wagendeichseln, Meßstangen
-- kurz alles, was Ihren schrecklichen Hunger nach künstlichen
Landschaftsbildern zu stillen vermag, damit mein tobendes Gehirn und
meine gemarterte Seele endlich Ruhe und Erlösung finden.«

Völlig ungerührt, lächelte das eiserne Geschöpf nur freundlich,
streifte sich die Manschetten vorsorglich zurück und sagte, jetzt wolle
er sich dahinter machen, daß es eine Art habe.

Seitdem sind drei Stunden vergangen und mir scheint, ich habe mich noch
immer nicht genügend beruhigt, um mich aufs neue der Staatswirtschaft,
meinem hohen Thema, wieder zuzuwenden. Ich kann jedoch dem Wunsch
nicht widerstehen, wenigstens einen Versuch zu machen, denn von der
ganzen Weisheit der Welt liegt meinem Herzen nichts so nahe und nichts
beschäftigt meinen Verstand so sehr.

    »--_wirtschaft des Himmels beste Gabe für die Menschheit sei_.
    Als der lockere, aber begabte Byron zu Venedig im Exil war,
    soll er die Bemerkung gemacht haben, daß, wenn ihm gestattet
    wäre zurückzukehren und sein vergeudetes Leben von vorn
    anzufangen, er seine klaren und nüchternen Stunden nicht dazu
    verwenden wolle, leichtsinnige Reime zu schmieden, sondern
    Aufsätze über Staatswirtschaft zu schreiben. Washington liebte
    diese herrliche Wissenschaft, Namen wie Baker, Beckwith,
    Judson, Smith sind auf ewige Zeiten damit verbunden. Sogar der
    unsterbliche Homer sagt in dem neunten Buch seiner Iliade:

    ~Fiat justitia, ruat coelum
    Post mortem unum, ante bellum
    Hic jacet hoc, ex-parte res
    Politicum e-conomico est.~

    Der Gedankenreichtum des alten Dichters, verbunden mit der
    glücklichen Wahl der Worte, in die er seine erhabenen Bilder
    kleidet, haben diese Verse vor allen andern berühmt gemacht,
    welche jemals --«

»Schweigen Sie, sage ich -- kein Wort weiter! -- Her mit Ihrer Rechnung
und dann verschwinden Sie auf ewige Zeiten aus meinem Gesichtskreis. --
Neunhundert Dollars? -- Ist das alles? -- Nun gut, auf diese Anweisung
hier wird Ihnen jedes achtbare Bankhaus in Amerika Zahlung leisten.
-- Aber was bedeutet denn der Volksauflauf unten auf der Straße? --
Nach den Blitzableitern wollen die Leute schauen? Du meine Güte! Haben
sie denn noch nie im Leben Blitzableiter gesehen? -- ›Noch nie einen
solchen Haufen auf einem Dach,‹ sagen Sie, wenn ich Sie recht verstehe.
Da muß ich doch einmal hinuntergehen und mir die Menschen betrachten,
die eine solche Unkenntnis öffentlich zur Schau tragen.«

       *       *       *       *       *

_Drei Tage später._ Wir sind alle in einem Zustand völliger
Erschöpfung. Unser Haus, das wie ein Stachelschwein von Blitzableitern
starrte, war vierundzwanzig Stunden lang der Gegenstand allgemeinen
Staunens und das einzige Stadtgespräch. Die Theater standen leer,
denn ihre neuesten scenischen Erfindungen konnten es bei weitem
nicht mit meinen Blitzableitern aufnehmen. Tag und Nacht war unsere
Straße von Zuschauern belagert; viele fuhren sogar vom Lande herein,
um das Schauspiel zu genießen. Endlich am zweiten Tage kam uns
glücklicherweise ein Gewitter zu Hilfe. Kaum begann der Blitz auf mein
Haus loszugehen, als sich, sozusagen, sämtliche Bänke und Galerien
im Handumdrehen leerten. Fünf Minuten später war im Umkreis einer
halben Meile von meinem Besitztum kein einziger Zuschauer mehr zu
erblicken. In den ferner gelegenen hohen Häusern jedoch drängte sich
Kopf an Kopf an den Fenstern, auf den Dächern und überall. Das war
auch nicht zu verwundern, denn alle Sternschnuppenfälle und glänzenden
Feuerwerke eines Menschenalters zusammengenommen und gleichzeitig in
einer ungeheuern Feuergarbe vom Himmel herab gegen ein schutzloses
Dach losgelassen, hätten nicht die großartige pyrotechnische Wirkung
erzielen können, durch welche mein Haus, mitten in der Dunkelheit,
die während des Unwetters herrschte, wie mit Strahlenglanz umleuchtet
war. Innerhalb vierzig Minuten schlug der Blitz -- ich habe es genau
gezählt -- siebenhundertvierundsechzigmal in mein Grundstück ein,
jedesmal angelockt durch einen der getreuen Blitzableiter. Er glitt an
dem spiralförmig gewundenen Eisen entlang und schoß in den Boden, bevor
er noch selbst recht wußte, wie ihm geschah. Während dieses ganzen
Bombardements wurde mir nur eine einzige Schieferplatte zertrümmert und
zwar deshalb, weil sämtliche Blitzableiter der Nachbarschaft in ein
und demselben Augenblick alle Blitze, die sie gesammelt hatten, auf
uns übertrugen. Seit Anbeginn der Welt war ein ähnliches Schauspiel
nie gesehen worden. Während eines ganzen Tages und einer Nacht konnte
kein Mitglied meiner Familie den Kopf aus dem Fenster strecken, ohne
daß ihm das Haar ausgerissen und er so glatt rasiert wurde, wie eine
Billardkugel; daß sich eins von uns hinausgewagt hätte, davon war schon
gar nicht die Rede. Endlich wurde aber doch die entsetzliche Belagerung
aufgehoben, weil auch keine Spur von Elektrizität mehr in den Wolken
über uns vorhanden war, soweit meine unersättlichen Blitzableiter
reichen konnten.

Sofort machte ich einen Ausfall, sammelte eine Schar unerschrockener
Arbeiter um mich, und kein Bissen Brot kam über unsere Lippen, kein
Schlaf in unsere Augen, bevor wir nicht das ganze Gebäude seiner
schrecklichen Stachelrüstung entkleidet hatten. Nur drei Blitzableiter
blieben auf dem Hause, einer auf der Küche, und einer auf dem
Scheunendach, wo sie noch heutigen Tages zu sehen sind. Erst als
dieses geschehen war, wagten die Leute es wieder, unsere Straße zu
betreten. Beiläufig will ich hier noch bemerken, daß ich während jener
entsetzlichen Zeit meinen Aufsatz über die Staatswirtschaft nicht
weiter geschrieben habe. Selbst jetzt sind mir Kopf und Nerven noch so
angegriffen, daß ich die Arbeit nicht wieder aufnehmen kann.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Für Liebhaber._ -- Leute, welche dreitausendzweihundert und
elf Fuß der besten, zinkplattierten, spiralförmig gewundenen
Blitzableiterstangen und sechzehnhunderteinunddreißig versilberte
Spitzen verwenden können -- alles in leidlichem Zustande und obgleich
durch den Gebrauch stark abgenutzt, doch für jeden gewöhnlichen Fall
zu benützen -- mögen sich zum Abschluß des Geschäfts an den Verfasser
dieses Buches wenden. --




Es ist gefährlich im Bette zu liegen.


»Auch ein Unfallversicherungsbillet?« fragte der Mann am Schalter.

»Nein,« entgegnete ich nach kurzem Ueberlegen, »nein, ich glaube nicht.
Heute fahre ich den ganzen Tag mit der Eisenbahn. Aber -- warten Sie
einmal -- morgen bin ich nicht auf Reisen. Geben Sie mir eins für
morgen.«

Der Mann sah mich verblüfft an. Dann sagte er:

»Aber die Versicherung ist ja gerade gegen Unfälle. Und wenn Sie mit
der Eisenbahn reisen --«

»Da habe ich keine Furcht. Man läuft nur Gefahr, wenn man zu Hause
bleibt und im Bette liegt.«

Ich hatte mich über diese Angelegenheit gründlich unterrichtet. Im
vergangenen Jahr war ich zwanzigtausend Meilen, hauptsächlich mit der
Eisenbahn gefahren, vor zwei Jahren hatte ich fünfundzwanzigtausend
Meilen zurückgelegt, teils mit dem Dampfboot, teils mit der Eisenbahn,
vor drei Jahren nahe an zehntausend Meilen, ausschließlich mit der
Eisenbahn. Wollte ich noch alle die verschiedenen kleinen Reisen in
Anschlag bringen, die ich im Laufe der drei letzten Jahre bald hierhin
bald dorthin unternommen habe, so würden zusammen wohl sechzigtausend
Meilen herauskommen, -- und das alles ohne einen Unfall.

Eine Zeitlang dachte ich jeden Morgen bei mir: »Na, bis jetzt bin
ich noch immer gut weggekommen, um so größer ist aber auch die
Wahrscheinlichkeit, daß ich diesmal etwas abkriegen werde. Ich will
schlau sein und mir ein Unfallbillet lösen.« Aber so oft ich das
that -- jedesmal zog ich eine Niete und legte mich am Abend mit
heilen Knochen und ohne daß mir ein Glied ausgerenkt war, zu Bette.
Schließlich bekam ich diese tägliche Plackerei satt und kaufte mir nur
noch Unfallbillete, die auf einen Monat gültig waren. Ich sagte mir:
»Wenn man ein ganzes Bündel von dreißig Stück auf einmal kauft, können
es doch unmöglich lauter Nieten sein.«

Aber ich irrte mich. In dem ganzen Haufen war nicht _ein_ Gewinn.
Täglich las ich von Eisenbahnunfällen -- sie lagerten wie ein Nebel
über der ganzen Zeitungsatmosphäre, aber niemals kam etwas davon auf
mein Teil. Ich mußte mir eingestehen, daß ich in dem Unfallgeschäft
viel Geld verthan hatte und für mich nichts herausgekommen war. Mein
Argwohn erwachte; ich begann mich nach jemand umzusehen, der bei dieser
Lotterie einen Treffer gezogen hatte. Zwar fand ich viele Leute, die
ihr Geld darin anlegten, aber keinen Menschen, der je einen Unfall
gehabt oder einen Cent damit verdient hatte. Nun kaufte ich keine
Unfallbillete mehr, sondern begab mich ans Rechnen und kam zu einem
erstaunlichen Ergebnis: _Die Gefahr lag nicht im Reisen, sondern im
Zuhausebleiben._

Ich verschaffte mir statistische Berichte und fand zu meiner
Ueberraschung, daß nach all den fettgedruckten Zeitungsüberschriften,
welche Eisenbahnunfälle ankündigten, noch nicht einmal dreihundert
Menschen während der letzten zwölf Monate wirklich ihr Leben durch
solche Unfälle verloren hatten. Die Eriebahn war die mörderischste
auf der ganzen Liste. Sie hatte sechsundvierzig oder sechsundzwanzig
Menschen umgebracht -- ich erinnere mich nicht mehr genau an die Zahl,
nur soviel weiß ich, daß sie doppelt so groß war, als auf jeder andern
Bahn. Doch fiel mir dabei sofort ein, daß die Eriebahn eine ungeheure
Länge hat und den größten Geschäftsbetrieb von allen Bahnen des
Landes; da ist es leicht begreiflich, daß sie noch einmal soviele Tote
aufweisen kann als die übrigen.

Als ich weiter rechnete, fand ich, daß zwischen New York und Rochester
auf der Eriebahn täglich acht Personenzüge hin- und zurückfahren,
also zusammen sechzehn, welche durchschnittlich sechstausend Reisende
befördern. Das beträgt in sechs Monaten etwa eine Million -- soviel als
New York Einwohner hat. Nun denn: die Eriebahn tötet von ihrer Million
zwischen dreizehn und dreiundzwanzig Personen in sechs Monaten, und
in der gleichen Zeit sterben von der in New York wohnenden Million
dreizehntausend in ihren Betten!

Mich überlief eine Gänsehaut, die Haare standen mir zu Berge. »Wie
entsetzlich!« rief ich aus. »Nicht das Reisen auf der Eisenbahn bringt
die Menschen in Gefahr, sondern daß sie sich den totbringenden Betten
anvertrauen. Nie wieder will ich in einem Bette schlafen!«

Hiernach wird es der Leser nur natürlich finden, daß ich dem
Billetverkäufer am Schalter die obenerwähnte Antwort gab. Mit den
Betten, vor denen mir graut, will ich es nicht noch einmal versuchen;
für mich sind die Eisenbahnen gut genug.

Auch ist mein Rat für jedermann: Bleibt so wenig zu Hause wie irgend
möglich; aber wenn ihr einmal durchaus zu Hause bleiben müßt, dann
kauft euch ein Paket Versicherungsbillete und legt euch nachts nicht
schlafen. Man kann gar nicht vorsichtig genug sein.

Die Moral dieses Aufsatzes ist, daß Leute, die sich nicht die Mühe
geben nachzudenken, ganz unbilligerweise über die Eisenbahnverwaltung
der Vereinigten Staaten murren. Wenn wir uns überlegen, daß das ganze
Jahr hindurch, Tag und Nacht, mehr als vierzehntausend Eisenbahnzüge
der verschiedensten Art, mit Menschen beladen, deren Leben oder Tod
in ihrer Gewalt ist, durch die Lande donnern und jagen, so werden wir
uns nicht _darüber_ wundern, daß sie dreihundert menschliche Wesen in
einem Jahre umbringen, sondern vielmehr _darüber_, daß ihnen nicht
dreihundert mal dreihundert zum Opfer fallen.




Brüder, knipst ein!


Darf ich den gefälligen Leser bitten, einen Blick auf nachstehende
Verse zu werfen und mir zu sagen, ob er etwas besonders Gefährliches
darin entdecken kann?

    »Schaffner, knips' ein das Fahrpapier,
    Zahlt die Taxe der Passagier.
    Acht-Cents-Fahrt ein blau' Papier,
    Sechs-Cents-Fahrt ein gelb' Papier,
    Drei-Cents-Fahrt ein rot' Papier.
    Zahlt die Taxe der Passagier,
    Knips' ein, knips' ein das Fahrpapier!«

            _Chor der Schaffner_:
      »Zahlt die Taxe der Passagier,
      Brüder knipst ein das Fahrpapier!«

Kürzlich stieß ich zufällig in einem Tageblatt auf dies Reimgebimmel
und las es ein paarmal durch. Augenblicklich war ich davon wie
besessen; es schwirrte mir beim Frühstück fort und fort durch den Kopf
und als ich meine Serviette zusammenlegte, wäre ich nicht imstande
gewesen zu sagen, ob ich etwas gegessen hatte oder nicht.

Ich trat nun an das Schreibpult, um mein Tagewerk zu beginnen, wie ich
es mir schon am vergangenen Abend vorgesetzt hatte. In dem Roman, an
welchem ich schrieb, war ich gerade bei einer erschütternden Tragödie
angekommen. Ich griff nach der Feder, um den blutigen Auftritt zu
schildern, aber ich dachte nichts als: »Schaffner, knips' ein das
Fahrpapier.« Eine Stunde lang kämpfte ich aus allen Kräften dagegen an,
allein umsonst.

»Acht-Cents-Fahrt ein blau' Papier. Sechs-Cents-Fahrt ein gelb'
Papier u. s. w. u. s. w.« summte es mir im Kopf ohne Rast und Ruh.
Von Arbeiten konnte keine Rede sein, das lag auf der Hand. Ich gab
es auf und schlenderte in der Stadt umher, aber bald merkte ich, daß
meine Füße nach dem Takt jenes Reimgeklingels marschierten. Auf die
Länge ward mir das unerträglich; ich änderte meinen Schritt, allein
das half nichts. Die Verse paßten sich sofort der neuen Gangart an und
verfolgten mich nach wie vor.



Ich kehrte um und ertrug das Leiden zu Hause den Vormittag über, es
quälte mich beim Mittagessen, welches ich mechanisch und ohne Genuß
verzehrte, den ganzen Abend hindurch bimmelte es mir in den Ohren, ich
ging voll Jammer zu Bett, und während ich mich ruhelos hin und her
warf, wälzten sich mir immer wieder die Verse durch das Hirn, bis ich
gegen Mitternacht wie wahnsinnig aufsprang und zu lesen versuchte.
Aber die Buchstaben tanzten vor meinen Augen und alles was ich sah
war: »Schaffner, knips' ein das Fahrpapier.« Bei Sonnenaufgang hatte
ich den Verstand verloren und meine Angehörigen horchten mit Staunen
und Bekümmernis auf meinen Blödsinn. »Knips' ein, o, knips' ein das
Fahrpapier,« faselte ich immer von neuem.

Zwei Tage später, am Sonnabend morgen, erhob ich mich -- eine
jammervolle Ruine -- schwankend vom Lager. Ich suchte den Pfarrer N.,
meinen werten Freund auf, um mit ihm, wie wir verabredet hatten, einen
Spaziergang von zehn Meilen nach dem Talcott-Turm zu unternehmen. Er
sah mich mit großen Augen an, lieh jedoch seiner Verwunderung keine
Worte. Wir machten uns auf den Weg. Der Pfarrer sprach und sprach und
sprach, wie es seine Gewohnheit ist. Ich erwiderte keine Silbe, ich
hörte nichts.

»Mark, bist du krank?« fragte mein Freund endlich, als wir eine Meile
gegangen waren. »Du siehst entsetzlich abgehärmt und angegriffen aus.
Thu' mir doch die Liebe und sprich einmal ein Wort.«

Mit trübseliger Miene versetzte ich eintönig: »Schaffner, knips' ein
das Fahrpapier -- Zahlt die Taxe der Passagier.«

Der Pfarrer starrte mich verwirrt an:

»Ich verstehe nicht recht, was das heißen soll, Mark. Mir scheint, was
du da sagst, ist weder außergewöhnlich noch besonders betrübend --
und doch -- es lag vielleicht an deinem Ton -- klangen die Worte so
sterbenstraurig, wie mir im Leben noch nichts vorgekommen ist. Was hast
du nur?«

Aber ich hörte längst nichts mehr. Ich war schon in weiter Ferne, bei
der nicht endenwollenden, unabwendbaren »Acht-Cents-Fahrt ein blau'
Papier. -- Sechs-Cents-Fahrt ein gelb' Papier -- Drei-Cents-Fahrt ein
rot' Papier -- Zahlt die Taxe der Passagier -- Knips' ein, knips' ein
das Fahrpapier.« -- Was während der übrigen neun Meilen geschehen ist,
weiß ich nicht.

Plötzlich jedoch legte mir der Pfarrer die Hand auf die Schulter und
schrie mich an:

»Wach' auf, wach' auf, ich beschwöre dich! Du schläfst ja mit offenen
Augen. Dort liegt der Turm vor uns; ich habe mich taub, blind und
stumm geredet und du giebst keine Antwort. Sieh dich doch um in der
herrlichen Herbstlandschaft. Schau' hin und weide deine Blicke daran.
Du bist weit gereist und hast die gepriesensten Naturschönheiten mit
eigenen Augen gesehen. Nun sage einmal deine Meinung -- was hältst du
von diesem Landschaftsbild?«

Ich seufzte tief und murmelte: »Sechs-Cents-Fahrt ein gelb' Papier --
Drei-Cents-Fahrt ein rot' Papier -- Zahlt die Taxe der Passagier --
Knips' ein, knips' ein das Fahrpapier.« Der Pfarrer stand still und sah
mich lange mit ernsten, teilnahmvollen Blicken an.

»Mark,« sagte er endlich, »ich kann aus der Sache nicht klug werden.
Sind das dieselben Worte wie vorhin? -- Sie klingen ganz unverfänglich
und doch bricht es mir fast das Herz, sie dich sagen zu hören. --
Knips' ein, knips' ein das Fahrpapier -- war es nicht so?«

Ich fing von vorn an und sagte Zeile für Zeile her, während mein Freund
mit wachsendem Interesse zuhörte.

»Aber, das ist ja ein wahres Reimgebimmel,« rief er vergnügt, »es
klingt einem in den Ohren wie Musik, alles paßt und klappt so hübsch.
Ich glaube, das muß sich leicht behalten lassen. Bitte, sage es noch
einmal, dann kann ich es sicher auswendig.«

Ich wiederholte die Reime und der Pfarrer sprach sie nach. Das erste
Mal machte er noch einen kleinen Fehler, den ich verbesserte, das
zweite und dritte Mal ging es aber ohne Anstoß. Mir war plötzlich eine
Zentnerlast vom Herzen gefallen; das niederträchtige Geklingel plagte
mich nicht länger, mein gemartertes Hirn kam endlich zur Ruhe und ein
wonniges Gefühl des Friedens zog in meine Brust; ich hätte jauchzen und
singen mögen. Wirklich stimmte ich auch eine halbe Stunde lang ein Lied
nach dem andern an, während wir nach Hause marschierten. Meine Zunge,
die wie gelähmt gewesen war, fand nun die Sprache wieder und der lange
eingedämmte Redefluß sprudelte und strömte mir unaufhaltsam über die
Lippen. Glückselig und jubilierend ließ ich ihm freien Lauf, bis er
endlich versiegte. Beim Abschied schüttelte ich dem Freunde herzlich
die Hand.

»Das war einmal ein schöner Spaziergang,« rief ich, »und wie herrlich
haben wir uns unterhalten! Aber, da fällt mir ein -- du hast ja seit
zwei Stunden kein Sterbenswort mehr gesagt. So sprich doch etwas.«

Der Pfarrer sah mich mit glanzlosen Augen an und murmelte eintönig und,
wie mir schien, ganz unbewußt:

»Knips' ein, knips' ein das Fahrpapier -- Zahlt die Taxe der Passagier.«

Mich überlief es siedend heiß. »Der arme Mensch,« dachte ich bei mir,
»der arme Mensch! Jetzt hat es ihn gepackt.«

Mehrere Tage vergingen, ohne daß ich mit meinem Freunde zusammentraf.
Am Dienstag-Abend kam er jedoch in mein Zimmer geschlichen, wo er matt
und trostlos auf einen Stuhl niedersank. Er war bleich und abgezehrt,
nur noch ein Schatten von seinem früheren Selbst.

»Mark,« sagte er, und hob den müden Blick zu mir empor, »das war eine
Unglücksstunde, in der ich jene heillosen Reime lernte. Sie haben mich
seitdem Tag und Nacht verfolgt, gleich bösen Geistern. Alle Qualen
der Hölle habe ich erduldet, seit wir uns zuletzt sahen. Am Sonnabend
wurde ich telegraphisch nach Boston berufen. Ein lieber, alter Freund
von mir war gestorben und ich sollte ihm die Leichenrede halten. Ich
benutzte den Nachtzug; die Predigt dachte ich mir unterwegs im Kopfe
zurechtzulegen. Aber ich kam nur bis zu den Eingangsworten; der Zug
ging ab, die Räder begannen ihr Gerassel -- klack, klack -- klack,
klack, klack -- und sofort paßten sich die abscheulichen Reime dieser
Begleitung an. Wohl eine Stunde saß ich da und sagte Silbe für Silbe
zu dem klack, klack, klack der Eisenbahn her, bis ich so abgearbeitet
und totmüde war, als hätte ich den ganzen Tag Holz gehackt. Mein Kopf
schmerzte zum Zerspringen, ich glaubte wahnsinnig werden zu müssen.
Rasch eilte ich nach dem Schlafwagen und kleidete mich aus. Kaum aber
hatte ich mich auf das Lager gestreckt, so fing die Geschichte von
neuem an: ›Klack, klack, klack -- Acht-Cents-Fahrt -- klack, klack,
klack -- Ein blau' Papier -- klack, klack, klack -- Sechs-Cents-Fahrt
-- klack, klack, klack -- Ein gelb' Papier und so weiter, und so
weiter -- Zahlt die Taxe der Passagier.‹ Schlafen? -- Ja, Prosit! Ich
war fast für das Tollhaus reif, als der Zug in Boston ankam. Frage
mich nicht nach der Leichenfeier. Ich that mir übermenschlichen Zwang
an, aber jeder einzige Satz war von innen und außen übersponnen und
durchwoben mit: ›Brüder, knipst ein das Fahrpapier -- Zahlt die Taxe
der Passagier.‹ Das allerschrecklichste dabei war jedoch, daß ich meine
Rede ganz in dem hüpfenden Rhythmus der entsetzlichen Reime hielt. Bald
sah ich thatsächlich, daß verschiedene Zuhörer wie geistesabwesend
im Takt dazu nickten. Ja, du magst mir's glauben oder nicht, Mark,
noch bevor ich zu Ende war, wiegte die ganze Trauerversammlung, der
Leichenbestatter und alle übrigen im feierlichen Verein mit dem Kopfe
hin und her. Kaum hatte ich das letzte Wort gesprochen, so floh ich,
wie vom Wahnsinn getrieben, in die Sakristei. Dort traf ich aber
zum Unglück mit einer alten unverheirateten Tante des Verstorbenen
zusammen, die zu spät gekommen war, um der kirchlichen Feier
beizuwohnen.

»›Ach, er ist tot, er ist tot,‹ schluchzte sie tiefbetrübt, ›und ich
habe ihn nicht einmal mehr gesehen vor seinem Ende!‹

»›Ja,‹ sagte ich, ›er ist tot -- er ist tot -- er ist tot -- o, wird
denn diese Qual niemals aufhören!‹

»›Sie haben ihn also auch geliebt, wie ich?‹

»›Geliebt, -- wen?‹

»›Den seligen Georg -- meinen teuern Neffen.‹

»›Ach -- _den_. Jawohl -- jawohl -- freilich, freilich. Knips' ein,
knips' ein -- ach, das Elend bringt mich noch um.‹

»›Dank, Ehrwürden, tausend Dank für die Trostesworte. Auch _mir_
schlägt der Verlust eine tiefe Wunde. Sie waren wohl bei ihm in den
letzten Augenblicken?‹

»›Letzte Augenblicke -- bei wem?‹

»›Nun bei dem geliebten Verstorbenen.‹

»›Ja so -- o ja -- ich glaube wohl -- ich weiß nicht. Gewiß -- ich war
da -- ich war da!‹

»›Wie beneide ich Sie um dieses Glück. Was sprach er denn noch -- o,
teilen Sie mir seine Abschiedsworte mit!‹

»›Er sagte -- er sagte -- o mein Kopf, mein Kopf, mein Kopf! Nichts,
gar nichts sagte er als: Knips' ein, knips' ein das Fahrpapier! --
Seien Sie barmherzig, Verehrteste; ich beschwöre Sie, dringen Sie
nicht weiter in mich, überlassen Sie mich meinem Wahnsinn, meinem
Jammer, meiner Verzweiflung. -- Sechs-Cents-Fahrt, ein gelb' Papier --
Drei-Cents-Fahrt, ein rot' Papier -- nein, länger ertrage ich es nicht
-- Zahlt die Taxe der Passagier.‹«

Mein Freund schwieg erschöpft und sah mich wohl eine Minute lang mit
stieren Blicken an.

»Mark,« stieß er endlich mühsam heraus, »bin ich denn ganz verloren?
Du erwiderst kein Wort, du giebst mir keine Hoffnung! Ach, ich sehe es
ein, mir kann niemand helfen; Worte vermögen mir keinen Trost mehr zu
geben -- mein Geschick ist unabwendbar. Eine innere Stimme sagt mir,
daß meine Zunge verdammt ist, in alle Ewigkeit nach dem unsinnigen
Reimgebimmel hin und her zu pendeln. Da -- da kommt es schon wieder:
Acht-Cents-Fahrt, ein blau' Papier -- Sechs-Cents-Fahrt, ein gelb'
Papier -- --«

Schwächer und schwächer klang seine Stimme, bis er endlich in einen
wohlthätigen Starrkrampf verfiel, der ihn auf eine kurze Frist seinen
Qualen entrückte.

Wie aber rettete ich ihn schließlich vor dem Irrenhause? Ich reiste mit
ihm nach der ersten besten Universität und ließ ihn seine Last und Pein
auf die armen, nichtsahnenden Studenten abladen, welche die Reime mit
gierigen Ohren einsogen. Fragt mich nicht, in welchem Zustand sie sich
dort jetzt befinden. Die Folgen sind zu trostlos, als daß ich sie zu
schildern vermöchte.

Was mich trieb, dies alles niederzuschreiben, war nur die edle Absicht,
dich, lieber Leser, zu warnen. Solltest du je irgendwo auf jene
unheilvollen Verse stoßen, so fliehe sie -- fliehe sie wie die Pest! --




Ein geheimnisvoller Besuch.


Der erste Mensch, welcher mich aufsuchte, nachdem ich mich in der
Stadt niedergelassen hatte, war ein Herr, der sich damit einführte,
daß er sagte, er sei Taxator und stehe mit der Abteilung für innere
Einkünfte der Vereinigten Staaten in Verbindung. Ich sagte, ich hätte
nie von diesem Geschäftszweig gehört, sei aber trotzdem sehr erfreut
ihn zu sehen und bäte ihn, Platz zu nehmen. Er setzte sich. Mir fiel
gerade nichts Besonderes ein, womit ich ihn unterhalten konnte, aber
ich bedachte, daß, wer einem Hauswesen vorstehen will, auch die
Pflicht hat, gesprächig, liebenswürdig und entgegenkommend zu sein. In
Ermangelung von etwas anderm fragte ich ihn also, ob er seinen Laden in
unserer Nachbarschaft eröffnen werde.

Er bejahte dieses, ohne jedoch, wie ich gehofft hatte, von selbst
zu erwähnen was er verkaufe, und ich wollte doch nicht neugierig
erscheinen.

Also versuchte ich es mit der Frage: »Geht das Geschäft gut?« und er
erwiderte: »Hm, so so.«

Darauf sagte ich, wir würden bei ihm vorsprechen und wenn man uns in
seinem Hause ebenso gut bediene wie in andern, so wollten wir ihm
unsere Kundschaft zuwenden.

Er antwortete, sein Etablissement würde uns unzweifelhaft genügen. Ihm
sei wenigstens noch nie jemand vorgekommen, der einen andern Vertreter
seines Faches aufgesucht hätte, nachdem er einmal mit ihm verhandelt
habe.

Das klang ziemlich selbstbewußt, aber abgesehen von der natürlichen
Schlechtigkeit, die uns allen im Gesicht geschrieben steht, sah der
Mann ganz ehrlich aus.

Ich erinnere mich nicht mehr _wie_ es zuging, aber allmählich tauten
wir auf und kamen in Fluß, das heißt unsere Unterhaltung, und nun ging
es wie ein aufgezogenes Uhrwerk.

Es wurde geredet, geredet, geredet -- wenigstens meinerseits, und
gelacht, gelacht, gelacht -- wenigstens seinerseits. Aber während
der ganzen Zeit hatte ich die Geistesgegenwart nicht verloren,
meine natürliche Schlauheit war auf ›vollen Dampf‹ gesetzt, wie die
Maschinisten sagen. Ich war entschlossen alles zu erfahren, was sein
Geschäft anging, trotz der dunkeln Antworten, die er gab, und zwar
dachte ich es aus ihm herauszubekommen, ohne daß er es selbst gewahr
wurde. Ich wollte ihn in eine tiefe, tiefe Falle locken, ihm alles
über mein eigenes Geschäft erzählen und ihn dadurch so erwärmen
und zutraulich machen, bis er nicht umhin konnte, mir ausführliche
Mitteilungen über _sein_ Geschäft zu machen, ehe er noch merkte, um was
es mir zu thun war. »Du ahnst nicht, mein Sohn,« dachte ich bei mir
selbst, »mit welchem schlauen Fuchs du es zu thun hast!«

»Können Sie wohl raten,« sagte ich, »wie viel ich im vergangenen Winter
und Frühling mit meinen Vorlesungen eingenommen habe?«

»Nein, gewiß nicht -- und wenn mein Kopf daran hinge! Erlauben Sie --
etwa zweitausend Dollars, wie? -- Aber nein, nein -- so viel können Sie
nicht verdient haben. Sagen wir siebzehnhundert.«

»Haha! das hab' ich mir gedacht! Meine Einnahmen für
Vorlesungen letzten Winter und diesen Frühling betrugen
vierzehntausendsiebenhundertundfünfzig Dollars. Was sagen Sie dazu?«

»Ja, das ist ja unglaublich, ganz unglaublich! Das werde ich mir
merken. Und Sie meinten, das sei noch nicht einmal alles?«

»Alles! -- kein Gedanke! Dazu kam noch mein Gehalt beim ›Täglichen
Kriegsruf‹ auf vier Monate, ungefähr -- ungefähr -- nun was würden Sie
sagen, wenn ich es auf achttausend Dollars angäbe?«

»Was ich sagen würde? -- Je nun -- daß ich wohl auch in solchem Meer
des Ueberflusses schwimmen möchte. Achttausend -- das will ich mir
merken! Und das ist alles noch nicht genug, Sie Glückspilz! Wenn ich
Sie recht verstehe, haben Sie noch andere Einnahmen gehabt?«

»Hahaha! natürlich. Wir stehen erst beim Anfang sozusagen. Nun kommt
noch mein Buch ›Unschuld auf Reisen‹ -- Preis drei Dollars fünfzig
Cents bis fünf Dollars, je nach dem Einband. Sehen Sie mir ins
Auge und hören Sie: Während der letzten fünftehalb Monate -- ganz
abgesehen von allem was vorher verkauft worden ist -- nur während
der letzten fünftehalb Monate haben wir fünfundneunzigtausend
Exemplare von dem Buch abgesetzt. Fünfundneunzigtausend! Denken
Sie einmal! Durchschnittlich vier Dollars das Exemplar, das macht
vierhunderttausend Dollars, mein Freund -- und ich bekomme die Hälfte!«

»Alle Wetter! Ich will das aufschreiben. Vierzehn -- sieben -- fünf --
acht -- zweihundert -- Summa sagen wir -- meiner Treu, die Gesamtsumme
macht ungefähr zweihundertdreizehn- oder vierzehntausend Dollars. Ist
das möglich?«

»Möglich? Wenn irgend ein Fehler dabei ist, so habe ich zu wenig
angegeben. Zweihundertvierzehntausend bar ist mein diesjähriges
Einkommen, wenn ich überhaupt rechnen kann.«

Jetzt stand der Herr auf um zu gehen. Mich überfiel der peinliche
Gedanke, ob ich am Ende meine Enthüllungen umsonst gemacht habe.
Noch dazu hatte ich mich durch seine laute Bewunderung verführen
lassen, die Beträge recht ansehnlich zu vergrößern. Aber, nein, im
letzten Augenblick überreichte mir der Herr ein großes Couvert mit
der Bemerkung, daß es seine Geschäftsanzeige enthalte, die mir jeden
gewünschten Aufschluß geben könne, er würde stolz sein, einen Mann von
so ungeheuerm Einkommen zum Kunden zu haben. Früher habe er gedacht,
daß es mehrere wohlhabende Herren in der Stadt gäbe, aber sobald
er geschäftlich mit ihnen in Verbindung getreten sei, habe es sich
gezeigt, daß sie kaum genug besäßen, um davon leben zu können. Es sei
wirklich eine solche Ewigkeit her, seit er einen reichen Mann von
Angesicht gesehen, mit ihm gesprochen, und ihm die Hand gereicht habe,
daß er sich kaum enthalten könne, mir um den Hals zu fallen -- ich
würde ihn unendlich glücklich machen, wenn ich ihm die Erlaubnis gäbe,
mich zu umarmen.



Das gefiel mir so gut, daß ich nicht versuchte Widerstand zu leisten,
sondern dem biedern Fremdling gestattete, die Arme um meinen Hals zu
schlingen und ein paar beruhigende Thränen zu vergießen, die mir den
Nacken herabrieselten. Dann ging er seiner Wege.

Sobald er fort war, öffnete ich das Couvert mit seiner ›Anzeige‹. Ich
studierte sie aufmerksam vier Minuten lang, dann rief ich die Köchin
herauf und sagte:

»Bitte, halten Sie mich -- ich falle in Ohnmacht -- Marie kann
unterdessen die Pfannkuchen umwenden.«

Als ich wieder zur Besinnung gekommen war, schickte ich nach dem
nächsten Schnapsladen und mietete mir um Wochenlohn einen Mann, der
sich aufs Fluchen verstand, damit er die ganze Nacht aufsitzen und
jenen Fremden verwünschen sollte, und mich am Tage manchmal dabei
ablösen, wenn ich nicht weiter wußte.

Er war aber auch ein ganz abgefeimter Schurke. Seine ganze
Geschäftsanzeige bestand aus weiter nichts als einem niederträchtigen
Steuerzettel -- einer Kette von unverschämten Fragen über meine
Privatangelegenheiten, die beinahe vier engbedruckte Folioseiten
einnahmen. Fragen, die mit so erstaunlicher Spitzfindigkeit
zusammengesetzt waren, daß die ältesten Leute nicht herausgefunden
hätten, was sie bedeuten sollten. Fragen, die so eingerichtet waren,
daß man sein Einkommen ungefähr viermal so hoch angeben mußte, als es
in Wirklichkeit war, aus lauter Angst, man könne eine Lüge beschwören.
Ich suchte nach einem Ausweg, aber es schien keinen zu geben.
Gleich die erste Frage paßte so vollkommen auf meinen Fall, wie ein
Regenschirm auf einen Ameisenhaufen, wenn man ihn aufspannt:

    »Wie hoch beliefen sich Ihre Einnahmen im vergangenen Jahr aus
    Ihrem Handel, Geschäft oder Beruf, gleichviel wo Sie denselben
    betrieben haben?«

Und diese Frage zog dreizehn andere von ebenso eindringlicher Art nach
sich, von denen die bescheidenste Aufschluß darüber verlangte, ob ich
einen Betrug oder Straßenraub verübt hätte oder durch Brandstiftung und
andere geheime Erwerbsquellen zu Vermögen gelangt sei, das bei meiner
Antwort auf Nr. 1 nicht mit angegeben wäre.

Es war klar, daß der Fremde mir Gelegenheit gegeben hatte, mich zu
blamieren. Dies lag so sehr auf der Hand, daß ich ausging und mir
noch einen Mann zum Fluchen mietete. Der Fremde hatte mich mit seinen
Schmeicheleien verführt, ein Einkommen von zweihundertvierzehntausend
Dollars anzugeben. Gesetzmäßig waren tausend davon steuerfrei, das
war der einzige Abschlag, den ich entdecken konnte, und das war doch
nur ein Tropfen im Ozean. Bei den gesetzlichen fünf Prozent mußte ich
der Regierung die Summe von zehntausendsechshundertfünfzig Dollars
Einkommensteuer bezahlen.

(Ich will hier gleich bemerken, daß ich es nicht gethan habe.)

Ich bin mit einem sehr begüterten Manne bekannt, der einen Palast
bewohnt und eine wahrhaft fürstliche Tafel hält, dessen Ausgaben ganz
enorm sind und der doch kein Einkommen hat, wie ich oft an seinen
Steuerzetteln gesehen habe. Zu diesem begab ich mich in meiner Not. Er
nahm meine schreckliche Liste von Einnahmen zur Hand, setzte sich die
Brille auf, tauchte die Feder ein, und -- ehe ich mich's versah, war
ich ein Bettler. Es geschah auf die einfachste Weise von der Welt und
ward durch die Geschicklichkeit, mit der er den Paragraphen ›Abzüge‹
benützte, ganz leicht zu stande gebracht. Er setzte meine Staats- und
meine städtischen Steuern auf so und so viel fest, meine Verluste
durch Schiffbruch, Feuer u. s. w. auf so und so viel; Verluste beim
›Verkauf von Landbesitz‹ -- ›Verkauf von Viehstand‹ -- ›Zahlungen für
Miete des Anwesens‹ -- ›Ausbesserungen, Umbauten, Zinsvergütung‹ --
›schon vorher besteuerter Gehalt als Offizier der Armee, der Flotte u.
s. w. u. s. w.‹ und dergleichen mehr. Aus jedem dieser Punkte wußte
er ganz erstaunliche Abzüge herauszuschlagen. Als er fertig war und
mir das Blatt hinreichte, sah ich auf den ersten Blick, daß während
des ganzen Jahres meine Einnahme, das heißt der Gewinn dabei, nur
zwölfhundertfünfzig Dollars vierzig Cent betragen hatte.

»Dazu kommt,« sagte er, »daß tausend Dollars steuerfrei sind. Gehen Sie
jetzt aufs Steueramt und beschwören Sie dies Dokument, dann bezahlen
Sie Steuern von zweihundertfünfzig Dollars.«

    (Während er sprach, zog sein Söhnchen, der kleine Willy, einen
    Zweidollarschein aus des Vaters Westentasche und verschwand
    damit. Ich möchte _alles_ wetten, daß der Junge _auch_ sein
    Einkommen falsch angeben würde, wenn mein fremder Herr ihn
    morgen besuchte.)

»Machen Sie die Abzüge immer auf diese Art?« fragte ich, »auch wenn Sie
Ihre eigenen Steuern berechnen?«

»Natürlich, das versteht sich von selbst. Wenn unter der Rubrik
›Abzüge‹ nicht jene elf tröstlichen Klauseln ständen, müßte ich ja
alljährlich an den Bettelstab kommen, nur um diese verhaßte, schlechte,
geldgierige und tyrannische Regierung zu unterstützen.«

Dieser Herr gehört zu den allerbesten und solidesten Männern der
Stadt, zu den Männern von moralischem Gewicht, von kaufmännischer
Ehrenhaftigkeit, von zweifelloser, unantastbarer Zuverlässigkeit --
folglich unterwarf ich mich seinem Urteil. Ich begab mich auf das
Steueramt -- und da stand ich, unter den Augen meines fremden Herrn,
die mich schwer anklagten, und beschwor eine Lüge nach der andern, eine
Schlechtigkeit nach der andern, bis meine Seele zolldick mit Meineiden
überzogen war, und ich meine Selbstachtung auf ewige Zeiten verloren
hatte.

Aber was schadet's? Thun denn nicht Tausende der reichsten und
stolzesten, der gerechtesten und gefeiertsten Männer in Amerika
alljährlich dasselbe? -- --




Redakteur und Berichterstatter.


Wie ich ein landwirtschaftliches Blatt herausgab.

Als ich aushilfsweise die Redaktion einer landwirtschaftlichen Zeitung
übernahm, that ich es nicht ohne bange Zweifel. Wenn jemand, der
gewohnt ist auf dem Lande zu leben, plötzlich ein Schiff befehligen
sollte, würde er wohl auch seine Besorgnis dabei haben. Ich befand mich
jedoch in Verhältnissen, bei denen mir der Gehalt von Wichtigkeit war.
Als daher der ständige Redakteur der Zeitung mir anbot, ihn während der
Ferien zu vertreten, ging ich auf seine Bedingungen ein und nahm seine
Stelle.

Wieder bei der Arbeit zu sein, war ein köstliches Gefühl, und ich
schrieb die ganze Woche hindurch mit unablässigem Vergnügen. Nachdem
alles in der Presse war, wartete ich einen Tag lang in großer Spannung
auf irgend ein Anzeichen, daß meine Bemühung die Aufmerksamkeit des
Publikums erregt habe. Bei Sonnenuntergang verließ ich das Bureau und
sah, daß eine Gruppe von Männern und Knaben, die sich am Fuß der Treppe
versammelt hatten, sobald ich erschien, wie auf gemeinsamen Antrieb
auseinanderstob, um mich durchzulassen. »Das ist er!« hörte ich sie zu
einander sagen. Der Vorfall war mir natürlich sehr schmeichelhaft. Am
nächsten Morgen bemerkte ich eine ähnliche Gruppe an der Treppe; auch
vereinzelt und zu zweien standen die Leute vor dem Hause und drüben auf
der andern Seite der Straße, mich mit großem Interesse beobachtend. Als
ich näher kam, zerstreuten sie sich und wichen zurück, doch hörte ich
noch, wie ein Mann sagte:

»Seht nur mal seine Augen an.« -- Ich that, als wüßte ich nicht, was
ich für Aufsehen machte, doch freute ich mich im stillen darüber und
nahm mir vor, es meiner Tante zu schreiben.

Während ich die wenigen Treppenstufen hinaufstieg und mich der Thür
näherte, vernahm ich fröhliche Stimmen und schallendes Gelächter. Beim
Eintreten gewahrte ich einen Augenblick zwei junge Männer, die wie
Landwirte aussahen; sobald sie meiner ansichtig wurden, erbleichten
sie, machten lange Gesichter und sprangen plötzlich mit einem großen
Krach zum Fenster hinaus. Darüber verwunderte ich mich sehr.

Etwa eine halbe Stunde später trat ein alter Herr mit lang
herabwallendem Bart und feinen, aber strengen Gesichtszügen bei mir
ein. Ich forderte ihn auf, Platz zu nehmen, und er setzte sich, schien
jedoch etwas auf dem Herzen zu haben. Er nahm den Hut ab, stellte ihn
auf den Boden und holte ein rotseidenes Taschentuch heraus, sowie ein
Exemplar unserer Zeitung.



Das Blatt legte er auf seine Kniee und fragte, während er sich die
Brille mit dem Taschentuch putzte: »Sind Sie der neue Redakteur?«

Ich bejahte dies.

»Haben Sie schon früher ein landwirtschaftliches Blatt redigiert?«

»Nein,« erwiderte ich, »dies ist mein erster Versuch.«

»Das dachte ich mir. Haben Sie die Landwirtschaft praktisch betrieben?«

»Nein, ich glaube nicht.«

»Ein gewisser Instinkt hat mir das gesagt,« meinte der alte Herr,
setzte seine Brille auf und maß mich über dieselbe hinweg mit strengen
Blicken, wobei er die Zeitung in ein bequemes Format zusammenfaltete.
»Ich will Ihnen vorlesen, was diesen Instinkt bei mir erweckt hat. Es
war die folgende Bemerkung. Hören Sie, ob sie aus Ihrer Feder stammt:

    »_Rüben_ sollte man niemals pflücken, weil ihnen das schadet.
    Es ist viel besser, einen Knaben auf den Baum klettern, und sie
    herunterschütteln zu lassen.«

Nun, was sagen Sie dazu -- denn ich bin fest überzeugt, Sie haben es
geschrieben!«

»Was soll ich denn sagen? Ich glaube es ist gut und verständig. Ohne
Zweifel werden alljährlich im Umkreis dieser Stadt viele Millionen
Scheffel Rüben verdorben, weil man sie in halbreifem Zustand abpflückt,
während, wenn man sie durch einen Knaben vom Baum schütteln ließe --«

»Warum nicht gar von Ihrer Großmutter? Rüben wachsen doch nicht auf
Bäumen.«

»O, wirklich thun sie das nicht! Wer hat denn schon gesagt, daß sie da
wüchsen? -- Es war ja natürlich bildlich gemeint, nur bildlich! Jeder,
der überhaupt Sinn und Verstand hat, muß doch gleich wissen, daß ich
meinte, der Knabe sollte die Ranke schütteln.«

Der alte Mann schnellte von seinem Sitze in die Höhe, zerriß die
Zeitung in kleine Stücke, stampfte mit dem Fuß darauf, zerschlug
allerlei Gegenstände mit seinem Stock und sagte, so viel wie ich, wüßte
auch eine Kuh. Dann ging er hinaus und warf die Thür hinter sich ins
Schloß. Bei diesem Benehmen kam mir der Gedanke, es müsse etwas sein
Mißfallen erregt haben. Da ich aber nicht wußte, was ihn verdrossen
habe, konnte ich ihm auch nicht helfen.

Bald nachher kam ein langer, hagerer Mensch zur Thür hereingeschossen.
Spärliche Locken hingen ihm bis auf die Schultern herab und sein
Gesicht war in allen Höhen und Tiefen mit den stacheligen Bartstoppeln
einer ganzen Woche bedeckt. Er blieb zuerst regungslos stehen und
legte den Finger auf den Mund, dann beugte er sich lauschend vor. Kein
Geräusch ließ sich hören. Noch immer horchte er. Als alles still blieb,
drehte er den Schlüssel um, schlich behutsam auf den Zehen näher zu
mir heran und stellte sich in gemessener Entfernung vor mich hin. Eine
Weile forschte er mit großem Interesse in meinen Zügen, nahm dann ein
zusammengefaltetes Exemplar unseres Blattes aus der Brusttasche und
sagte:

»Sehen Sie hier -- das haben Sie geschrieben. Lesen Sie es mir vor --
rasch! Befreien Sie mich, Herr! Ich leide entsetzlich.«

Ich las was folgt, und während meine Lippen Satz für Satz aussprachen,
schien er sich zusehends erleichtert zu fühlen; die starren Muskeln
verloren ihre Spannung, die ängstliche Besorgnis wich aus seinem
Gesicht und Friede und Ruhe verbreiteten sich über seine Züge, wie
lindes Mondlicht über eine öde Landschaft.

    »Der _Guano_ ist ein schöner Vogel, aber es bedarf großer
    Sorgfalt, wenn man ihn aufziehen will. Man darf ihn nicht
    früher als im Juni und nicht später als im September bei uns
    einführen. Im Winter muß er an einen warmen Ort gebracht
    werden, um seine Jungen ausbrüten zu können.«

    »Augenscheinlich werden wir mit unserer _Getreideernte_ dies
    Jahr im Rückstand bleiben. Der Landmann wird daher wohl daran
    thun, die Maiskolben und Buchweizenkuchen schon im Juli statt
    im August zu pflanzen.«

    »_Vom Kürbis._ Dies ist eine Lieblingsbeere der Eingeborenen
    von Neuengland. Bei der Bereitung von Obstkuchen zieht man sie
    dort zu Lande sogar der Stachelbeere vor. Sie ist vorteilhafter
    als die Himbeere zum Füttern der Kühe, da sie mehr füllt und
    stopft und ganz ebenso nahrhaft ist. Der Kürbis ist die einzige
    eßbare Abart der Familie Orangenpflanze, die im Norden gedeiht,
    ausgenommen die Melone und der Türkenbund. Man pflanzt ihn
    jedoch jetzt weniger häufig unter dem Buschwerk im Vordergarten
    an, da man allgemein die Ansicht hegt, daß der Kürbis kein Baum
    ist, welcher Schatten giebt.«

    »Jetzt, bei Eintritt des warmen Wetters, beginnt der
    _Gänserich_ zu laichen und --«

In höchster Aufregung trat der Zuhörer dicht vor mich hin, schüttelte
mir die Hand und sagte:

»Schön, schön -- das genügt. Jetzt weiß ich, daß ich bei richtigem
Verstande bin, denn Sie haben es gerade so gelesen wie ich, Wort
für Wort. Aber Fremdling, als ich es heute morgen zum erstenmal
las, sagte ich zu mir: ›Nun und nimmermehr hätte ich es für möglich
gehalten, trotzdem meine Verwandten mich so streng bewachten, aber
jetzt glaube ich selbst, daß ich verrückt bin.‹ Dabei stieß ich ein
Geheul aus, das man zwei Meilen weit hören mußte, und lief fort, um
jemand totzuschlagen. Ich wußte ja, daß es früher oder später dazu
kommen würde und wollte lieber gleich damit anfangen. Erst las ich
noch einmal einen Ihrer Paragraphen durch, dann brannte ich mein Haus
nieder und brach auf. Mehreren Leuten habe ich Arme und Beine entzwei
geschlagen, und einen Menschen auf einen Baum gejagt, wo ich ihn
kriegen kann, sobald ich will. Beim Vorbeigehen dachte ich aber erst
einmal bei Ihnen vorzusprechen, um meiner Sache auch ganz sicher zu
sein. Jetzt habe ich mir nun Gewißheit verschafft und ich sage Ihnen,
es ist ein Glück für den Burschen, der auf dem Baume sitzt. Ich hätte
ihn unfehlbar auf dem Rückwege umgebracht. Leben Sie wohl, leben Sie
wohl! Sie haben mir eine schwere Last von der Seele genommen. Da mein
Verstand Ihren landwirtschaftlichen Artikel hat aushalten können, wird
er jetzt jeden Puff vertragen. Noch einmal, bester Herr, leben Sie
wohl!«

Mir war wegen der Körperverletzungen und Brandstiftungen, mit welchen
der Mensch sich unterhalten hatte, etwas unbehaglich zu Mute, da ich
nicht umhin konnte mir einzugestehen, daß ich gewissermaßen daran
beteiligt sei. Doch konnte ich diesen Gedanken nicht lange nachhängen,
denn der ständige Redakteur trat jetzt ins Zimmer.

Er sah trübselig, verlegen und niedergeschlagen aus.

Er blickte auf die Zerstörung, welche die beiden jungen Landwirte und
der alte Tumultuant angerichtet hatten und sagte: »Das ist eine böse
Geschichte -- eine sehr böse Geschichte. Die Flasche mit dem flüssigen
Leim ist zerbrochen, sechs Fensterscheiben, ein Spucknapf und zwei
Leuchter in Stücke geschlagen. Aber das ist noch lange nicht das
Schlimmste. Der Ruf des Blattes hat gelitten -- und wie ich fürchte
für alle Zeit. Zwar ist die Nachfrage größer gewesen als jemals, noch
nie ist eine so starke Auflage verkauft worden, nie zuvor hat das
Blatt solche Berühmtheit erlangt -- aber man will doch nicht wegen
Verrücktheit berühmt sein und mit Geistesschwäche Geld erwerben! Ich
versichere Sie, Freund, so wahr ich ein ehrlicher Mann bin, drunten
sitzen die Leute auf den Zäunen und wimmeln in der Straße, um zu
warten, ob sie etwas von Ihnen zu sehen bekommen, weil sie Sie für
verrückt halten. Das können sie auch mit gutem Grund, nachdem sie
Ihre Artikel gelesen haben, die eine Schande für die ganze Presse
sind. Wie in aller Welt sind Sie nur auf den Einfall gekommen, daß
Sie imstande wären, ein solches Blatt zu redigieren? Sie scheinen ja
nicht einmal von den ersten Anfangsgründen der Landwirtschaft eine
Ahnung zu haben. Sie sprechen von einer Furche und einer Furt, als
sei es ein und dasselbe; Sie reden von einer Mauserzeit der Kühe,
und empfehlen den Iltis als Haustier, weil er voll Mutwillen sei und
ein trefflicher Rattenfänger. Ihre Bemerkung, daß die Seeschnecken
still zu liegen pflegen, wenn man ihnen Musik vormacht, war ganz und
gar überflüssig. Seeschnecken lassen sich überhaupt nicht aus ihrer
Ruhe bringen, sie liegen immer still und die Musik ist ihnen völlig
gleichgültig. Sagen Sie nur um des Himmels willen, Freund, haben Sie
etwa die Unwissenheit zu Ihrem Berufsstudium gemacht? Dann hätten Sie
sich heute den Doktorhut erworben in allen Ehren. Etwas Aehnliches
ist mir noch nicht vorgekommen. Ihre Bemerkung, daß die Roßkastanie
sich als Handelsartikel einer stets wachsenden Gunst erfreut, ist ganz
dazu angethan, das Blatt zu Grunde zu richten. Ich bitte Sie, das Amt
niederzulegen und Ihrer Wege zu gehen. Ich habe schon viel zu lange
Ferien gehabt. Einen Genuß hätte ich doch nicht mehr davon, besonders
wenn Sie meinen Platz inne haben und ich in beständiger Angst schweben
müßte, was Sie den Leuten zunächst empfehlen würden. Wenn ich daran
denke, daß Sie unter dem Titel ›Landschaftsgärtnerei‹ über Austernbänke
geschrieben haben, möchte ich aus der Haut fahren. -- Machen Sie, daß
Sie fortkommen! Für nichts in der Welt würde ich wieder in die Ferien
gehen. O, warum haben Sie mir nur nicht gesagt, daß Sie von der
Landwirtschaft nicht das mindeste wissen!«

»Was wollen Sie denn eigentlich, Sie Maiskolben, Sie Krautkopf, Sie
Rübensprößling?! Schämen Sie sich Ihrer unverständigen Worte. Seit
vierzehn Jahren arbeite ich als Redakteur und noch niemals, das
versichere ich Ihnen, habe ich gehört, daß man besondere Kenntnisse
haben müsse, um eine Zeitung zu redigieren. Wer schreibt denn die
Theaterkritiken für die Tagesblätter zweiten Ranges? Irgend ein
gelehrter Schuster oder Apothekerlehrling, der von der Schauspielkunst
nicht mehr und nicht weniger versteht, als ich von der Landwirtschaft.
Wer bespricht die Bücher? Menschen, die nie eins geschrieben haben.
Wer schreibt die größten Leitartikel über Staatsfinanzen? Diejenigen,
welche die schönste Gelegenheit gehabt haben, gar nichts davon zu
erfahren. Wer verfaßt die Berichte über den Indianerkrieg? Herren, die
ein Wigwam nicht von einem Tamtam unterscheiden können, die nie in den
Fall gekommen sind, mit einem Tomahawk um die Wette zu laufen oder
irgend einem Glied ihrer Familie Pfeile auszuziehen, um ein Lagerfeuer
anzumachen. Wer schreibt die Aufforderung zur Mäßigkeit und jammert
über die verführerische Flasche? -- Burschen, die keinen nüchternen
Atemzug mehr thun werden, bis sie im Grabe liegen. Wer redigiert meist
die landwirtschaftlichen Blätter -- Sie Runkelrübe? -- Wer anders als
verdorbene Redakteure städtischer Zeitungen, oder Menschen, die mit dem
Poetenhandwerk kein Glück haben, mit Schauerdramen schlechte Geschäfte
machen und ihre gelben Eisenbahnromane nicht anbringen können. Die
werfen sich zuletzt auf die Landwirtschaft, um noch eine Zeitlang dem
Armenhaus zu entrinnen. Wollen _Sie_ mich etwa über das Redaktionswesen
belehren? Das habe ich durchgemacht von A bis Z; und ich kann Ihnen
sagen: je weniger ein Mensch weiß, um so größer ist das Geschrei, das
er macht und der Gehalt, den er bezieht. Beim Himmel -- wäre ich nur
unwissend statt gebildet, und unverschämt statt schüchtern gewesen, ich
hätte mir einen Namen erwerben können in dieser kalten, selbstsüchtigen
Welt! Herr, ich nehme meinen Abschied. Nachdem ich so behandelt worden
bin, wie Sie mich behandelt haben, bin ich ganz bereit zu gehen.
Meiner Pflicht habe ich genügt und meinen Kontrakt erfüllt, soweit man
es mir gestattet hat. Ich versprach, Ihr Blatt interessant zu machen
für alle Klassen -- das habe ich gethan. Ich sagte, ich könne Ihren
Absatz auf zwanzigtausend Exemplare bringen -- das wäre geschehen,
wenn Sie mir noch vierzehn Tage Zeit gelassen hätten. Obendrein würde
ich Ihnen die beste Klasse von Lesern verschafft haben, die sich ein
landwirtschaftliches Blatt nur wünschen kann -- kein einziger Landmann
darunter, nicht ein Mensch, der einen Wassermelonenbaum von einer
Pfirsichranke unterscheiden könnte. _Sie_ verlieren bei diesem Bruch,
Sie Pastetengewächs -- nicht ich. Gehorsamer Diener!«

       *       *       *       *       *

Dann ging ich.


Herrn Blokes ›Eingesandt‹.



Unser verehrter Freund, Herr John William Bloke aus Virginia-City,
trat gestern abend spät in unser Bureau ein, wo ich als zweiter
Redakteur thätig war. Sein Gesicht war schmerzentstellt. Mit dem
Ausdruck herzzerreißenden Jammers, unter schweren Seufzern legte er das
nachfolgende ›Eingesandt‹ auf das Pult und wandte sich mit abgemessenem
Schritt dem Ausgang zu. An der Thür hielt er inne, schien mit Gewalt
seine Gefühle zu bemeistern, nickte dann nach seinem Manuskript hin und
hauchte, in Thränen ausbrechend, mit zitternder Stimme die Worte:

»Einer meiner Freunde! ach, entsetzlich!«

Sein Kummer rührte mich so sehr, daß ich ganz vergaß ihn zurückzurufen,
um ihm Trost zuzusprechen, bis er fort und es zu spät war. Das Blatt
befand sich schon in der Presse, aber da ich wußte, daß unser Freund
der Veröffentlichung seiner Mitteilung große Wichtigkeit beilegte und
hoffte, es würde seinem kummervollen Herzen einen traurigen Genuß
bereiten, dasselbe im Druck vor Augen zu haben, ließ ich sofort die
Maschine anhalten und den Artikel in unsere Spalten einfügen.


        »_Entsetzlicher Unglücksfall._

    Gestern abend 6 Uhr, als Herr William Schuyler, ein alter,
    ehrenhafter Bürger aus South-Park seine Wohnung verließ, um
    sich in die untere Stadt zu begeben, wie es seit Jahren seine
    Gewohnheit ist, von der er nur im Frühling 1850 für kurze
    Zeit eine Ausnahme machte, als er genötigt war, wegen einer
    Verletzung das Bett zu hüten, die er sich bei dem Versuch
    zugezogen, ein durchgegangenes Pferd aufzuhalten, indem er
    kopfloser Weise mit heftigen Geberden hinter ihm drein schrie,
    ein Verfahren, welches das Tier, selbst einen Augenblick
    früher, unfehlbar erschreckt statt aufgehalten haben würde, und
    das, obgleich für ihn unheilvoll genug, doch noch entsetzlicher
    gemacht wurde durch den Umstand, daß seine Schwiegermutter
    zur Stelle war und Augenzeugin des traurigen Ereignisses
    sein mußte, während sie doch möglicherweise, wenn auch nicht
    mit Sicherheit anzunehmen, ebenso gut anderswo Umschau nach
    Unglücksfällen hätte halten können, was übrigens gar nicht in
    ihrer Natur lag, vielmehr gerade im Gegenteil, wie ihre eigene
    Mutter gesagt haben soll -- Gott hab' sie selig, sie starb
    vor ungefähr drei Jahren im sechsundachtzigsten Jahr in der
    gewissen Hoffnung einer seligen Auferstehung, denn sie war eine
    christliche Frau, sozusagen ohne Falsch und ohne Vermögen, was
    dem großen Brand anno 1849 zuzuschreiben ist, der ihr sämtliche
    Habe einäscherte. Aber so geht es im Leben! Diese schauervolle
    Begebenheit möge uns allen zur Warnung dienen und uns
    anspornen, so gut zu leben, daß wir, wenn es einst ans Sterben
    geht, wissen, was wir zu thun haben. Die Hand aufs Herz! Wir
    wollen von heute an aufrichtig und ernst danach streben, die
    verhängnisvolle Flasche zu meiden.

            (=Morgenausgabe der California.=)«

Der Chefredakteur ist hier gewesen und hat einen wahren Höllenlärm
vollführt. Er raufte sich das Haar, stieß die Möbel in alle Ecken und
schimpfte auf mich, als wäre ich ein Taschendieb. Er sagte, jedesmal,
wenn mir auch nur auf eine halbe Stunde die Redaktion des Blattes
überlassen bliebe, ließe ich mich vom ersten besten Wickelkind oder
Tollhäusler überlisten. Er besteht darauf, daß Herrn Blokes unseliger
Artikel der tollste Mischmasch ohne Sinn und Verstand ist, aus dem der
Leser nicht das geringste erfährt. Es sei ein Unsinn gewesen, deswegen
den Satz zu ändern.

Das hat man davon, wenn man gutherzig ist. Wäre ich auch so ungefällig
und teilnahmslos wie gewisse Leute, ich hätte Herrn Bloke einfach
gesagt, zu so später Stunde würden keine Mitteilungen mehr angenommen.
Aber nein! Sein thränenreicher Schmerz rührte mein weiches Gemüt und
mit Freuden ergriff ich die Gelegenheit, seinen Kummer ein wenig zu
lindern. Schnell einige Eingangszeilen zu dem Artikel geschrieben
und fort damit in die Druckerei ohne weiter zu untersuchen! Und was
ernte ich für meine Gutthat? Nichts als Scheltworte und allerliebste
Ehrentitel.

Nun will ich aber doch den Artikel einmal selbst lesen und sehen, ob
all der Spektakel begründet ist. Sollte es der Fall sein, dann wehe dem
Verfasser! --

       *       *       *       *       *

Ich habe es gelesen und muß in der That gestehen, daß es zuerst etwas
konfus erscheint. Aber ich probiere es noch einmal.

       *       *       *       *       *

Ich habe es zum zweitenmal durchgegangen -- es scheint verwirrter denn
je.

       *       *       *       *       *

Ich habe es nun fünfmal durchgelesen, aber ich will verdammt sein,
wenn ich auch nur eine Silbe davon verstehe. Es verträgt keine nähere
Untersuchung. Man kann keine Klarheit hineinbringen. Erfahren wir etwa,
was aus William Schuyler geworden ist? Nur gerade unser Interesse
für ihn wird geweckt -- dann wird er fallen gelassen. Wer ist denn
dieser William Schuyler überhaupt? In welchem Teil von South-Park
lebt er eigentlich? Er verließ seine Wohnung um sechs Uhr -- ist er
aber auch in der unteren Stadt angekommen und ist ihm irgend etwas
zugestoßen? Ist _er_ es vielleicht, der mit dem ›entsetzlichen
Unglücksfall‹ etwas zu thun hat? Wenn man den Wust von Einzelheiten
in dem Artikel bedenkt, sollte man doch auch wirklich etwas mehr
daraus erfahren können. Aber man erfährt nichts, es macht alles nur
noch dunkler. War Herrn Schuylers Beinbruch vor fünfzehn Jahren der
›entsetzliche Unglücksfall‹, welcher Herrn Bloke in unaussprechlichen
Jammer versetzte und ihn veranlaßte zur Nachtzeit hier anzurücken
und den Betrieb zu stören, damit die Welt doch ja sogleich von dem
interessanten Umstand in Kenntnis gesetzt würde? Oder bezieht sich der
›entsetzliche Unglücksfall‹ vielleicht auf die Mutter von Schuylers
Schwiegermutter und ihr verlorenes Vermögen? Oder sollte ihr vor drei
Jahren eingetretener Tod gemeint sein? (obgleich sich keine Andeutung
findet, daß derselbe durch einen Unglücksfall herbeigeführt wurde.)
Um es kurz zu fassen: Worin bestand der ›entsetzliche Unglücksfall‹?
Warum schrie der Eselskopf von Schuyler unter heftigen Geberden hinter
dem durchgebrannten Pferde her, wenn er es aufhalten wollte? Und wie
zum Henker konnte er von einem Pferde umgeworfen werden, das schon an
ihm vorbei war? Was sollen wir uns ›zur Warnung dienen lassen‹ und wie
sollen wir uns aus diesem Schriftstück voll Unbegreiflichkeiten eine
Lehre ziehen? Was kann vor allem die ›verhängnisvolle Flasche‹ damit
zu thun haben? Es ist gar nicht gesagt, daß Schuyler ein Trunkenbold
gewesen, oder daß seine Frau oder seine Schwiegermutter oder das
Pferd sich dem Trunk ergeben hätten -- wozu also die Erwähnung der
›verhängnisvollen Flasche‹? -- Mir scheint fast, daß, wenn nur Herr
Bloke selbst die ›verhängnisvolle Flasche‹ gemieden hätte, so würde er
gar nicht in solche Aufregung über diesen widersinnigen, eingebildeten
Unglücksfall geraten sein. Ich habe dieses alberne ›Eingesandt‹ mit
seinen scheinbaren Wahrscheinlichkeiten wieder und wieder gelesen, bis
es mir ganz wirr im Kopfe war, und doch habe ich nichts herausgebracht.
Es muß allerdings ein Unglücksfall irgend welcher Art stattgefunden
haben, aber es ist unmöglich festzustellen, wen er betroffen hat oder
was geschehen ist. So schwer es mir wird, es scheint mir Pflicht,
zu verlangen, daß wenn Herrn Blokes Angehörige wieder etwas mit
Unglücksfällen zu thun haben, er seinem Bericht jedenfalls einige
aufklärende Notizen beifüge, damit man aus dem Unfall einigermaßen klug
werden kann und erfährt, wer der Betroffene ist. Lieber würde ich schon
seine sämtlichen Verwandten auf dem Totenbette sehen, als noch einmal
bis an den Rand des Wahnsinns gebracht zu werden, in dem Bestreben, ein
ähnliches Machwerk wie das obige zu entziffern.


Zeitungswesen in Tennessee.

Der Arzt riet mir zur Wiederherstellung meiner Gesundheit den
Aufenthalt in einem milderen Klima an; ich ging daher nach dem Süden
und bekam in Tennessee eine Stelle als Hilfsredakteur bei der Zeitung
›Morgenrot und Kriegsgeschrei von Johnson County.‹



Als ich mich zur Arbeit im Bureau einstellte, fand ich den
Chefredakteur auf einem dreibeinigen Stuhl hintenüber gerekelt, die
Füße auf einem Tisch von Tannenholz. Ein zweiter solcher Tisch stand
noch im Zimmer und ein ebenso wackeliger Stuhl davor; beide waren halb
begraben unter Haufen von Zeitungsblättern nebst Fetzen und Bogen von
Manuskripten. Ferner befanden sich noch daselbst ein hölzerner mit
Sand gefüllter Spucknapf, in welchem Zigarrenstummel und ausgedienter
Kautabak lagen, und ein Ofen, dessen Thür nur noch an einer Angel
hing. Der Chefredakteur trug einen langschößigen schwarzen Tuchrock,
weißleinene Beinkleider und niedere, glänzend gewichste Stiefel, ein
Hemd mit altmodischem steifem Stehkragen und gefälteltem Einsatz,
einen großen Siegelring und ein karriertes Halstuch, dessen Zipfel
herabhingen. Die Tracht stammte etwa aus dem Jahre 1848. Er rauchte
eine Zigarre, suchte nach einem Wort und fuhr sich dabei in die Haare,
daß ihm die Locken zu Berge standen. Nach seinem grimmigen Blick zu
urteilen, mußte er gerade einen besonders beißenden Leitartikel unter
der Feder haben. Er sagte mir, ich solle die Tageszeitungen durchgehen
und was mir aus ihrem Inhalt interessant scheine, kurz zusammenfassen
und zu einer ›Rundschau in der Presse von Tennessee‹ verarbeiten. Ich
schrieb nun folgenden Artikel:


            =Rundschau in der Presse von Tennessee.=

    »Was die _Eisenbahn von Ballyhack_ betrifft, so ist die
    Redaktion des Wochenblatts ›Erdbeben‹ offenbar in einem
    Irrtum befangen. Es liegt keineswegs in der Absicht der
    Gesellschaft, Buzzardville seitwärts liegen zu lassen. Der
    Ort gilt im Gegenteil für einen der wichtigsten Punkte auf der
    ganzen Strecke und man hat durchaus nicht den Wunsch, daß er
    unberücksichtigt bleibt. Die Herren vom ›Erdbeben‹ werden das
    Mißverständnis natürlich mit Vergnügen berichtigen.«

    »Der geistvolle Redakteur des ›Donnerkeil und Schlachtrufs der
    Freiheit‹, John W. _Blossom_ von Higginsville, ist gestern in
    unserer Stadt angekommen und im Van Burenhaus abgestiegen.«

    »Wir bemerken, daß unser Kollege vom ›Morgengeheul‹ in
    Mud-Spring die irrtümliche Ansicht vertritt, daß die _Wahl
    Van Werters_ keine feststehende Thatsache sei. Er wird jedoch
    höchst wahrscheinlich seinen Mißgriff schon selbst entdeckt
    haben, bevor wir ihn hierdurch auf denselben aufmerksam machen.
    Unvollständige Wahlberichte mögen ihn zu seiner falschen
    Annahme verleitet haben.«

    »Es freut uns, mitteilen zu können, daß die Stadt
    _Blathersville_ mit einigen New Yorker Herren in Verhandlung
    steht, welche es übernehmen wollen, ihre fast grundlosen
    Straßen durch ein _Nicholsonsches Pflaster_ passierbar zu
    machen. Das ›Tägliche Hurra‹ empfiehlt diese Maßregel mit
    großem Geschick und Nachdruck und scheint den schließlichen
    Erfolg zuversichtlich zu erwarten.«

Ich übergab mein Manuskript dem Chefredakteur zur Annahme, Abänderung
oder Vernichtung. Er warf einen Blick darauf und seine Stirn umwölkte
sich. Mit unheilverkündendem Gesichtsausdruck überlas er die Seite;
es mußte irgend etwas nicht in Richtigkeit sein, das ließ sich leicht
erkennen. Plötzlich sprang er auf und rief:

»Himmeldonnerwetter! Halten Sie das für die Art, wie man die
Lumpenkerle behandeln muß? Glauben Sie etwa, meine Abonnenten würden
sich solche Milchsuppe auftischen lassen? Her mit der Feder!«

Noch nie habe ich eine Feder so boshaft kratzen und streichen hören
oder so erbarmungslos durch die Haupt-, Zeit- und Eigenschaftswörter
eines Nebenmenschen fahren sehen. Während er noch so recht bei
der Arbeit war, schoß jemand nach ihm durch das offene Fenster und
verunstaltete mir das rechte Ohr.

»Aha,« rief er, »das ist der Smith, der Halunke vom ›Moralischen
Vulkan‹; den habe ich schon gestern erwartet.« Er riß einen
Seemannsrevolver aus dem Gürtel und feuerte. Sein Gegner stürzte, in
die Hüfte getroffen, zu Boden. Smith war eben daran gewesen zu zielen,
um einen zweiten Schuß abzugeben, dieser ging nun vorbei und traf einen
Unbeteiligten -- nämlich _mich_. Nur ein Finger abgeschossen.

Der Chefredakteur fuhr hierauf fort auszustreichen und
dazwischenzuschreiben. Eben war er damit zu Ende, als eine Handgranate
durch das Ofenrohr herabschoß und den Ofen in tausend Stücke
zertrümmerte. Sonst richtete sie keinen weitern Schaden an, außer daß
sich ein Splitter verirrte und mir ein paar Zähne ausschlug.

»Der Ofen wird gar nicht mehr zu gebrauchen sein,« sagte der
Chefredakteur.

Ich versetzte, das sei auch meine Meinung.

»Na, einerlei -- bei dem Wetter können wir ihn entbehren. Ich kenne den
Kerl schon, der das gethan hat. Der entgeht mir nicht. -- Hier, sehen
Sie, in diesem Ton muß man reden, wenn man solche Artikel schreibt.«

Ich nahm das Manuskript, in dem so viel ausgestrichen und eingeschaltet
war, daß seine eigene Mutter es nicht wiedererkannt haben würde, hätte
es eine gehabt. Es lautete jetzt folgendermaßen:


        =Rundschau in der Presse von Tennessee.=

    »Die ausbündigen Lügenmäuler vom ›Erdbeben‹ sind offenbar
    beflissen, dem edlen und hochherzigen Volk abermals eine ihrer
    niederträchtigen und gotteslästerlichen Unwahrheiten in betreff
    der erhabensten Erfindung des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts, der
    _Eisenbahn nach Ballyhack_, aufzubinden. Den Gedanken, man
    würde Buzzardville seitwärts liegen lassen, haben sie in ihrem
    eigenen, vermoderten Gehirn ausgeheckt. Wir raten ihnen, die
    Lüge schleunigst hinunterzuwürgen, wenn sie nicht wollen, daß
    man ihrem schlotterigen Knochengerippe die Haut durchgerbt, wie
    sie es verdienen.«

    »Der Schafskopf vom ›Donnerkeil und Schlachtruf für Freiheit‹,
    _Blossom aus Higginsville_, ist wieder hier, um sich im Van
    Buren-Haus zu mästen und vollzusaugen.«

    »Wir hören, daß der blödsinnige Schurke vom ›Morgengeheul‹
    in Mud-Spring mit seiner gewohnten Fertigkeit im Lügen
    die Nachricht verbreitet, daß _Van Werters Wahl_ nicht
    durchgegangen ist. -- Die Presse hat den heiligen Beruf, die
    Wahrheit zu verbreiten, dem Irrtum zu steuern, zu erziehen,
    zu bilden, die öffentliche Moral und Sitte zu heben und zu
    verfeinern, das Volk sanfter, tugendhafter, wohlthätiger und
    in jeder Beziehung weiser, besser und glücklicher zu machen;
    aber dieser schändliche Halunke entwürdigt sein hohes Amt
    fortgesetzt, indem er Lügen, Verleumdungen, Aufhetzungen und
    Gemeinheiten umherstreut.«

    »Blathersville beabsichtigt sich _Nicholsonsches Pflaster_
    anzuschaffen. Ein Gefängnis und ein Armenhaus thäten weit
    eher not. Welcher Wahnsinn -- ein Pflaster in einem lumpigen
    Ort mit zwei Schnapsbrennereien, einer Schmiede und dem
    ›Täglichen Hurra‹, diesem Senfpflaster von einer Zeitung! Das
    alte Kriechtier, der Buckner, welcher das ›Hurra‹ herausgiebt,
    kräht schon seinen gewöhnlichen Blödsinn über das Pflaster in
    die Welt hinaus und bildet sich ein, was er sagt hätte irgend
    welchen Menschenverstand.«

»Sehen Sie, so muß man's machen -- gepfeffert und zur Sache. Von einer
Schreiberei ohne Kraft und Saft wird mir's ganz übel.«

Währenddem flog ein Ziegelstein durchs Fenster, das krachend
zersplitterte, und traf mich mit aller Wucht in den Rücken. Ich schob
meinen Stuhl aus der Schußlinie und begann zu fühlen, daß ich im Wege
sei.

Der Chef sagte: »Das muß wohl der Oberst sein, den ich schon seit zwei
Tagen erwarte. Gleich wird er herauf kommen.«

Er irrte sich nicht. Schon im nächsten Augenblick erschien der Oberst
mit einer Dragonerpistole an der Thür.

»Mein Herr,« sagte er, »habe ich die Ehre, mit dem Prahlhans zu reden,
der diesen erbärmlichen Plunder verfaßt?«

»Jawohl, mein Herr. Nehmen Sie Platz -- aber vorsichtig, der Stuhl hat
ein Bein verloren. Ich habe wohl das Vergnügen, das Lügenmaul, Oberst
Blatherskite Tecumseh bei mir zu sehen?«

»Ganz recht, mein Herr. Wir haben noch ein Hühnchen mit einander zu
pflücken, und wenn es Ihre Zeit erlaubt, fangen wir gleich an.«

»Ich bin gerade bei einem Artikel über den erfreulichen ›Fortschritt
der geistigen und moralischen Entwicklung in Amerika‹ -- aber das eilt
nicht. Nur immer zu!«

Beide Pistolen knallten zu gleicher Zeit los. Die Kugel des Obersten
raubte dem Chef eine Haarlocke und drang dann in den fleischigen
Teil meines Schenkels. Dem Oberst war ein Stück der linken Schulter
weggeschossen. Sie feuerten zum zweitenmal, schossen aber vorbei, nur
ich erhielt meinen Anteil -- einen Schuß in den Arm. Die dritte Ladung
verwundete beide Herren leicht und mir ward ein Knöchel angeschossen.
Hierauf äußerte ich, es käme mir unzart vor, noch länger bei dieser
Privatangelegenheit zugegen zu sein; ich wolle lieber hinausgehen und
einen Spaziergang machen. Aber die Herren baten mich sitzen zu bleiben,
und versicherten, ich sei ihnen durchaus nicht im Wege.

Sie unterhielten sich nun über die Wahlen und den Ausfall der Ernte,
während sie wieder luden, und ich begab mich daran, meine Wunden zu
verbinden. Darauf fingen sie von neuem mit Eifer zu feuern an und jeder
Schuß traf -- doch muß ich bemerken, daß von sechs Kugeln fünf auf
meine Rechnung kamen. Die sechste brachte dem Obersten eine tödliche
Wunde bei, worauf er mit seinem Humor bemerkte, er wolle uns jetzt
einen Guten Morgen wünschen, da er Geschäfte in der Stadt habe. Dann
fragte er nach der Wohnung des Leichenbesorgers und entfernte sich.



Der Chefredakteur wendete sich nun zu mir und sagte: »Ich erwarte
Gäste zu Tische und muß mich jetzt zurecht machen. Sie thun mir wohl
den Gefallen, unterdessen die Korrektur zu lesen und die Besucher zu
empfangen.«

Bei dem Gedanken an die Besucher ward mir etwas bange zu Mute; aber
mir fiel nichts ein, was ich erwidern konnte, so betäubt war ich noch
von dem Knattern der Pistolenschüsse, das mir fortwährend in den Ohren
klang.

Er fuhr fort: »Jones wird um drei Uhr hier sein -- walken Sie ihn
tüchtig durch. Gillespie kommt vielleicht noch früher -- werfen Sie
ihn zum Fenster hinaus. Ferguson trifft wahrscheinlich gegen vier Uhr
ein -- schlagen Sie ihn tot. Für heute ist das alles, glaube ich. Wenn
Sie Zeit übrig haben, schreiben Sie einen fulminanten Artikel gegen
die Polizei; geben Sie dem Oberinspektor ein paar tüchtige Hiebe. --
Die Knüttel liegen unter dem Tisch, die Pistolen in der Schublade,
der Schießbedarf dort in der Ecke, Leinwand und Verbandzeug im Fach
des Schreibtisches. Wenn Ihnen etwas zustößt, gehen Sie zu Lancet,
dem Wundarzt, hinunter. Er macht Anzeigen in unserm Blatt und wir
begleichen die Rechnungen tauschweise.«

Fort war er. Mir schauderte. -- Nach Verlauf von drei Stunden hatte
ich so entsetzliche Gefahren bestanden, daß alle Seelenruhe und
Heiterkeit von mir gewichen war. Gillespie hatte sich eingefunden und
_mich_ aus dem Fenster geworfen; Jones war pünktlich gekommen, als ich
mich aber anschickte, ihn durchzuwalken, nahm er mir die Arbeit ab.
Bei dem Zusammenstoß mit einem Unbekannten, der nicht auf der Liste
stand, hatte ich mein Haar mit samt der Kopfhaut verloren. Ein anderer
Fremder, der sich Thompson nannte, ließ mich als Trümmerhaufen und
Lumpenbündel zurück. Zuletzt sah ich mich voll Verzweiflung in einen
Winkel getrieben und durch eine wütende Rotte von Zeitungsschreibern,
Gaunern, Politikern und Strolchen belagert, die alle in wilder Raserei
tobten, fluchten und ihre Waffen über meinem Haupte schwangen,
bis die ganze Luft von blitzendem Stahle flimmerte. Schon war ich
im Begriff, meine Stelle bei der Zeitung aufzugeben, als der Chef
eintrat, begleitet von einer Schar schwärmerischer Freunde und
Anhänger. Nun entstand ein Auftritt, der jeder Beschreibung spottet,
ein Blutbad und Gemetzel, das keine Federpose, keine Stahlfeder zu
schildern vermag. Die Leute wurden erschossen, erdolcht, zerstückt,
in die Luft gesprengt und aus dem Fenster geworfen. Auf einen kurzen
Wirbelsturm von entsetzlichen Flüchen folgte noch ein wahnsinniger,
wirrer Kriegstanz -- und alles war vorüber. Nach fünf Minuten herrschte
Totenstille; der grimme Chef und ich saßen allein da und überschauten
die blutigen Trümmer, welche die Diele ringsumher bedeckten.

Er sagte: »Es wird Ihnen hier schon gefallen, wenn Sie sich erst an die
Stelle gewöhnt haben.«

»Sie werden mich wohl entschuldigen müssen,« entgegnete ich.
»Vielleicht würde ich es nach einer Weile dahin bringen, daß Ihnen
meine Schreibweise gefiele; sobald ich die Sprache gelernt hätte,
könnte es mir bei einiger Uebung wohl nicht fehlen. Aber, offen
gestanden, hat eine so kräftige Ausdrucksweise auch allerhand Nachteile
und man wird bei der Arbeit zu häufig unterbrochen. Sie sehen das
selbst. Eine kernige Schreibart mag viel zur geistigen Förderung der
Leser beitragen, aber man lenkt dadurch die öffentliche Aufmerksamkeit
zu sehr auf sich, und das ist mir unbehaglich. Wenn ich so oft
gestört werde, wie heute, kann ich nicht mit Gemütsruhe schreiben.
Die Stelle wäre mir sonst ganz angenehm, aber ich mag nicht allein
im Bureau bleiben, um die Besucher zu empfangen. Ich gestehe zwar,
daß die Erfahrungen, welche man dabei macht, neu und gewissermaßen
recht unterhaltend sind, aber es geht doch nicht ganz nach Recht und
Billigkeit zu. Ein Herr feuert nach Ihnen durch das Fenster und schießt
mich zum Krüppel; eine Granate platzt zu Ihrem Vergnügen im Ofenrohr
und die Ofenthür fliegt mir an den Kopf; ein Freund besucht Sie, um
mit Ihnen Komplimente auszutauschen und sprenkelt mir die Haut mit so
vielen Kugellöchern, daß sie kaum mehr zusammenhält. Dann, während
Sie zum Mittagessen gehen, kommt Jones mit seinem Knüttel, Gillespie
wirft mich aus dem Fenster, Thompson reißt mir die Kleider vom Leibe
und ein völlig Unbekannter zieht mir mit solcher Unbefangenheit die
Kopfhaut ab, als wären wir längst mit einander vertraut. Gleich darauf
kommen noch sämtliche Schurken der Umgegend, erschrecken mich zu Tode
mit ihren gräßlichen Kriegstänzen und drohen, mir mit ihren Tomahawks
vollends den Garaus zu machen. Alles in allem habe ich in meinem ganzen
Leben noch nicht so viele Aufregungen durchgemacht wie heute. Sonst
habe ich nichts gegen Sie; im Gegenteil, die ruhige Art und Weise, mit
der Sie den Besuchern Ihre Ansicht auseinandersetzen, gefällt mir;
aber wie gesagt, mir ist sie ungewohnt. Das Herz der Südländer ist so
ungestüm, sie sind zu freigebig in ihrer Gastfreundschaft gegen den
Fremdling. Die Artikel, welche ich heute geschrieben habe und in deren
kalte Sätze Ihre Meisterhand alle Glut des Zeitungsstils von Tennessee
hineingegossen hat, werden abermals einen ganzen Hornissenschwarm
aufstören. Die Redakteure werden sich haufenweise auf uns stürzen
und vor Hunger jemand zum Frühstück verspeisen wollen. Deshalb sage
ich Ihnen Lebewohl. Ich wünsche dem Festmahl nicht beizuwohnen.
Meiner Gesundheit wegen habe ich mich in den Süden begeben -- meiner
Gesundheit wegen muß ich machen, daß ich wieder fortkomme. Das
Zeitungswesen in Tennessee ist zu aufregend für mich.«

Hierauf trennten wir uns unter beiderseitigem Bedauern und ich suchte
mir eine Wohnung im Hospital.


Ein Berichterstatterstück.

Jawohl, meine verehrten Herrschaften, zu jener Zeit gab es im Staate
Nevada betriebsame Zeitungen, das kann ich Sie versichern.

Mein Hauptnebenbuhler in der Presse war Boggs von der ›Union‹, ein ganz
vorzüglicher Berichterstatter.

Alle drei oder vier Monate betrank er sich einmal ein wenig, aber er
war im allgemeinen kein unvorsichtiger oder leidenschaftlicher Trinker,
wenn er sich auch gern dann und wann einen kleinen Spitz holte.

In einer Beziehung hatte er entschieden etwas vor mir voraus; ihm stand
nämlich stets der monatliche Schulbericht zur Verfügung und mir nicht,
weil der Direktor der Volksschule mein Blatt, den ›Fortschritt‹, nicht
leiden konnte.

Um die Zeit, da der Bericht gewöhnlich erschien, machte ich mich einmal
an einem Winterabend auf, kummervoll überlegend, wie ich ihn mir
verschaffen solle.

Ich war nur wenige Schritte gegangen, als ich in der fast
menschenleeren Straße auf Boggs stieß, den ich fragte, wohin er wolle.

»Den Schulbericht holen.«

»Dann komme ich mit.«

»Nicht doch, Verehrtester, das wäre vergebliche Mühe.«

»So -- meinen Sie?«

Eben trug der Kellner der nahen Schenkwirtschaft eine Bowle voll
dampfenden Punsches an uns vorbei und Boggs sog den Wohlgeruch mit
gierigen Zügen ein. Sehnsüchtigen Blickes folgte er dem Träger und sah
ihn die Treppe zum Bureau des ›Fortschritt‹ hinaufsteigen.

»Schade,« sagte ich, »daß Sie mir nicht zu dem Schulbericht verhelfen
können; da das aber nun einmal unmöglich ist, will ich sehen, ob ich
nicht in der Redaktion der ›Union‹ einen Abzug bekomme, nachdem der
Bericht gesetzt ist. Ich glaube es zwar nicht, aber man kann's doch
versuchen. Gute Nacht!«

»Warten Sie noch einen Augenblick. Meinetwegen will ich den Bericht
holen und dann eine Weile oben bei den Jungens sitzen bleiben, bis Sie
ihn abgeschrieben haben. Kommen Sie nur mit zum Direktor.«

»Das nenne ich einmal vernünftig gesprochen. Also vorwärts.«

Wir trabten einige Straßen weiter durch den Schnee, erhielten
den Bericht und bald war das kurze Schriftstück in unserm Bureau
abgeschrieben.

Boggs that sich derweil an dem Punsch gütlich.

Nachdem ich ihm das Manuskript zurückgegeben, gingen wir beide wieder
fort, weil es uns noch an einer Leichenschau fehlte.

Um vier Uhr morgens, als unser Blatt in der Presse war, und wir wie
gewöhnlich zur Erholung ein Konzert veranstalteten -- denn einige von
den Setzern waren gute Sänger, andere spielten hübsch die Guitarre und
das gräßliche Instrument: die Ziehharmonika, -- kam der Besitzer der
›Union‹ mit großen Schritten herein und fragte, ob wir nicht wüßten,
was aus Boggs und dem Schulbericht geworden sei.

Wir teilten ihm den Sachverhalt mit und rückten dann alle aus, um nach
dem Missethäter zu suchen.

In einer Schenkstube fanden wir ihn, mit einer alten Blechlaterne in
der einen Hand und dem Schulbericht in der andern, auf dem Tische
stehen und einem Haufen ›angeheiterter‹ Bergleute eine Rede darüber
halten, wie gottlos und ungerecht es sei, die öffentlichen Gelder für
Volksunterricht zu verschleudern, während Hunderte von Arbeitern, die
sich's redlich sauer werden ließen, buchstäblich wegen Mangels an
Whiskey verdursten müßten.

Er hatte diesen Leuten stundenlang bei einer herrlichen Kneiperei
Gesellschaft geleistet.

Wir schleppten ihn fort und brachten ihn zu Bette.



Natürlich konnte der Schulbericht in der ›Union‹ nicht erscheinen und
Boggs machte mich dafür verantwortlich, obwohl ich doch weder gewünscht
noch beabsichtigt hatte, dies zu veranlassen und es mir von Herzen leid
that, daß ihm jenes Mißgeschick zugestoßen war.

Aber wir blieben trotzdem auf ganz freundschaftlichem Fuße.

An dem Tage, als der Schulbericht abermals fällig war, schickte uns
der Eigentümer des Tennessee-Bergwerks einen Einspänner mit der Bitte,
dorthin zu fahren, sein Besitztum in Augenschein zu nehmen und es in
der Zeitung zu besprechen -- kein ungewöhnliches Verlangen und eins,
dem wir immer mit Vergnügen nachkamen, wenn uns dazu ein Einspänner
geliefert wurde, denn wir machten ebenso gern Spazierfahrten als andere
Leute.

In das ›Bergwerk‹, ein 90 Fuß tiefes Loch im Boden, konnte man nur
gelangen, wenn man sich an einem Tau festhielt und mittelst einer Winde
herabgelassen wurde.

Die Arbeiter mußten wohl gerade irgend wohin zum Essen gegangen sein.

Ich war nicht stark genug, um einen Menschen von Boggs' Körpergewicht
hinabzuwinden, so nahm ich denn eine unangezündete Kerze zwischen die
Zähne, machte in das Ende des Taues eine Schlinge für meinen Fuß, bat
Boggs die Winde festzuhalten, auch ja nicht einzuschlafen und schwang
mich hinaus über den Schacht.

Ich erreichte den Boden desselben wohlbehalten, wenn auch etwas
schmutzig und mit geschundenen Ellenbogen, zündete die Kerze an,
untersuchte die Felswand, steckte verschiedene Proben des Gesteins in
die Tasche und rief dann Boggs zu, mich wieder hinauf zu ziehen.

Keine Antwort.

Bald darauf erschien oben in der Rundung ein Kopf, vom Tageslicht
beleuchtet, und eine Stimme schallte herab:

»Sind Sie ganz fertig?«

»Jawohl -- winden Sie nur tapfer zu.«

»Ihnen ist doch nicht unbehaglich zu Mute?«

»Gar nicht.«

»Könnten Sie vielleicht ein Weilchen warten?«

»O ja -- ich habe keine besondere Eile.«

»Nun -- dann leben Sie wohl!«

»Wie so? -- wo wollen Sie hin?«

»Den Schulbericht holen.«

Das that er denn auch.

Ich blieb eine Stunde da unten und setzte die Bergleute sehr in
Erstaunen, als sie beim Aufwinden statt eines Kübels voll Steine einen
Menschen am Tau hängen fanden. Dann begab ich mich nach Hause, fünf
Meilen weit, zu Fuß und bergan.

Am nächsten Morgen fehlte bei uns der Schulbericht -- aber die ›Union‹
brachte ihn.




Allgemeine Antwort an Schriftsteller oder solche, die es werden wollen.


Wenn jemand die Redaktion einer Zeitung oder eines Journals übernimmt,
so schicken ihm allerhand Leute, die sich der Schriftstellerei
befleißigen, sofort ihre Manuskripte zu und bitten ihn um sein Urteil
über ihre Erzeugnisse. Nachdem er in acht bis zehn Fällen diesem
Verlangen entsprochen hat, nimmt er schließlich seine Zuflucht zu
einer allgemeinen Predigt, die er in sein Blatt einrückt, um allen
spätern _Briefstellern_ kund zu thun, daß dies ein für allemal seine
Antwort ist. Auf dieser Stufe meiner litterarischen Laufbahn bin ich
jetzt auch angelangt; ich höre auf, denen, die sich bei mir Rat holen
wollen, privatim zu schreiben und mache mich an die Ausarbeitung meiner
öffentlichen Predigt.

Da die betreffenden Zuschriften alle denselben Inhalt haben und
nur dem Wortlaut nach verschieden sind, so lasse ich hier als
Durchschnittsbeispiel den letzten Brief folgen, welchen ich erhalten
habe:

    »An Herrn Mark Twain, Wohlgeboren.

            Den 3. Oktober.

        Geehrter Herr!

    Ich bin ein junger Mann, der eben die Schule verlassen hat und
    im Begriff steht, ins Leben einzutreten. Wohin ich aber auch
    sehe, finde ich keine Beschäftigung, die mir so recht gefällt.
    Ist das Schriftstellerleben leicht und einträglich, oder ist
    es wirklich ein so saures Brot, wie man immer sagt? Es _muß_
    doch bequemer sein als viele, ja als die meisten Berufsarten;
    mich drängt es unwiderstehlich, mich darauf zu werfen. Mag
    es biegen oder brechen, ich will mein Glück damit versuchen,
    will schwimmen oder untersinken, triumphieren oder erliegen.
    Wie hat man es denn aber anzufangen, wenn es einem in der
    Litteratur glücken soll? -- Fürchten Sie sich ja nicht, mir
    die Sache genau so darzustellen, wie sie ist. Im schlimmsten
    Fall würde mein Vorhaben eben mißlingen, und davor ist man
    doch niemals geschützt. Ich habe an die juristische Laufbahn
    gedacht, auch an fünf oder sechs andere Berufsarten, aber
    überall fand ich die gleichen Uebelstände, -- alles überfüllt,
    vollgepfropft, immer mehr Angebot als Nachfrage, der Erfolg
    ein Ding der Unmöglichkeit, weil es viel zu viele Hände giebt
    und zu wenig Arbeit. Aber ich _muß_ etwas ergreifen, und da
    suche ich denn mein Heil bei der Litteratur. Eine innere
    Stimme sagt mir, daß dies das rechte Feld für meine Begabung
    ist, wenn ich überhaupt Talent dazu habe. Ich lege einige
    Proben bei. Bitte, lesen Sie dieselben und teilen Sie mir Ihre
    aufrichtige, unparteiische Meinung mit. Und dann noch eins --
    ich bedaure, Ihnen beschwerlich fallen zu müssen, aber erinnern
    Sie sich daran, daß Sie selbst einmal ein junger Anfänger
    gewesen sind und verschaffen Sie mir Arbeit für eine Zeitung.
    Sie stehen mit vielen Redaktionen in Verbindung und ich bin
    gänzlich unbekannt. Auch bitte ich Sie, mir möglichst günstige
    Bedingungen auszuwirken; ich weiß wohl, daß ich zuerst nicht
    auf hohe Bezahlung rechnen kann, aber, wie viel meinen Sie, daß
    man für Artikel wie die beifolgenden ungefähr fordern könnte?
    Ich habe noch eine Menge dergleichen in meiner Mappe; wenn Sie
    diese unterbringen und es mich wissen lassen, kann ich Ihnen
    andere schicken, die ganz ebenso gut, vielleicht sogar besser
    sind.

    Einer baldigen Antwort u. s. w.

        Ihr ergebener u. s. w.«

Ich will Ihnen offen und ehrlich antworten. Ob, was ich zu sagen habe,
von großem Werte für Sie sein wird, oder ob Sie finden werden, daß es
sich der Mühe lohnt, meine Ratschläge zu befolgen, sind Dinge, deren
Entscheidung ich mit Freuden Ihrem eigenen Urteil überlasse.

Zunächst enthielt Ihr Brief mehrere Fragen, die jeder nur nach eigener
Lebenserfahrung endgültig beantworten kann. Diese Fragen übergehe ich
einfach und erwidere Ihnen Folgendes:

1. Daß die Litteratur, das geistliche Amt, die Medizin, die
Jurisprudenz und alle andern Berufsarten ins Stocken geraten sind und
nicht die erwünschten Fortschritte machen, daran ist nicht Mangel an
Arbeit schuld, sondern Mangel an Arbeitskräften. Wenn jemand Ihnen
das Gegenteil versichert, so sagt er eine Unwahrheit. Wollen Sie
prüfen, ob meine Behauptung richtig ist, so versuchen Sie doch einmal,
einen Redakteur, Berichterstatter, Verwalter, Werkführer, Handwerker,
Gewerbebeflissenen oder Künstler, der in seinem Fach Hervorragendes
leistet, für irgend eine Arbeit zu gewinnen! Sie werden finden, daß
der Mann schon eine Stelle hat und überreichlich beschäftigt ist. Er
ist nüchtern, fleißig, tüchtig und zuverlässig und die Nachfrage nach
ihm hört nicht auf. Keinen Tag hat er frei, außer durch besondere
Berücksichtigung von seiten seines Arbeitgebers, der städtischen
Verwaltung oder des Publikums im allgemeinen. Können Sie aber Faulenzer
brauchen, Tagediebe, Halbgebildete, Leute ohne Ehrgeiz, leichtsinnige
oder bequeme Redakteure, Berichterstatter, Anwälte, Aerzte und
Handwerker, so wenden Sie sich wohin Sie wollen. Von _der_ Sorte sind
Millionen zu haben, man findet sie überall und braucht nur die Hand
auszustrecken.

2. Ich werde mich wohl hüten, über den litterarischen Wert Ihrer
Erzeugnisse eine Meinung abzugeben. Das Publikum ist der einzige
Kritiker, dessen Urteil überhaupt etwas gilt. Sie brauchen mir das
nicht aufs Wort zu glauben; denken Sie nur einmal einen Augenblick
darüber nach und entscheiden Sie selbst. Hätten z. B. Sylvanus Cobb
oder T. S. Arthur Ihnen ihre Erstlings-Manuskripte unterbreitet,
so würden Sie mit Thränen in den Augen gesagt haben: Nein, bitte,
schreiben Sie nichts mehr! -- Und Sie sehen doch, wie beliebt ihre
Sachen sind. Wäre es Ihnen überlassen worden, Sie hätten vielleicht
gesagt, der ›Marmorfaun‹ sei langweilig und das ›Verlorene Paradies‹
nicht erheiternd genug; aber beide haben guten Absatz, wie Sie wohl
wissen. Viele Leute, die klüger und besser waren als Sie, haben vor
kaum zwei Jahrhunderten geringschätzig von Shakespeare gesprochen,
der alte Herr hat sie indessen alle überlebt. Darum will und kann
ich nicht über Ihre Schriftstellerei zu Gericht sitzen. Wenn ich Sie
nach bestem Wissen und Gewissen lobte, könnte ich dem Publikum auf
die Dauer die entsetzlichste Langeweile aufbürden; wenn ich Sie nach
bestem Wissen und Gewissen für unbrauchbar erklärte, würde ich der Welt
möglicherweise einen noch unerkannten und unentwickelten Dickens oder
Shakespeare rauben.

3. Ich schrecke vor der Aufgabe zurück, Ihnen schriftstellerische
Arbeiten zu verschaffen, für welche Sie Honorar beanspruchen. Sobald
Ihre Leistungen selbst den Beweis geliefert haben, daß sie wirklich
wertvoll sind, werden Sie nie mehr herumzugehen brauchen, um nach
litterarischer Beschäftigung zu suchen. Sie werden alle Hände voll zu
thun bekommen und mehr Grütze im Kopf nötig haben, als Ihnen vielleicht
jemals zur Verfügung steht, um nur die Hälfte der Arbeit zu verrichten,
die man Ihnen antragen wird. Will der angehende Schriftsteller den
Beweis beibringen, daß er wirklich etwas Gutes zu leisten vermag, so
weiß ich ein ganz einfaches Mittel, ein vollkommen sicheres Verfahren,
um diesen Zweck zu erreichen: er schreibe so lange ohne Bezahlung,
bis ihm jemand Honorar anbietet. Wird ihm im Lauf von drei Jahren
kein Honorar angeboten, so darf er dies mit vollem Vertrauen als ein
Zeichen betrachten, daß ihn die Natur zum Holzhacker bestimmt hat.
Wenn er auch nur ein Körnchen Weisheit besitzt, wird er sich mit Würde
zurückziehen und den ihm vom Himmel verordneten Beruf ergreifen.

       *       *       *       *       *

Ein Verfahren, wie ich es hier schildere, haben Leute wie Charles
Dickens und andere hervorragende Schriftsteller befolgen müssen; aber
meinem Klienten wird es schwerlich zusagen. Der junge, angehende
Litterat ist ein sehr, sehr sonderbares Geschöpf. Er weiß, daß, wenn
er Klempner werden wollte, der Meister von ihm ein Zeugnis über sein
seitheriges sittliches Betragen verlangen und ihm das Versprechen
abfordern würde, wenigstens drei -- vielleicht sogar vier Jahre -- bei
ihm in der Lehre zu bleiben. Er müßte im ersten Jahre die Werkstatt
fegen, Wasser holen, Feuer anzünden und in der Pause lernen, wie
man die Oefen schwärzt. Zum Lohn für alle diese Dienste erhielte
er seine Kost und zwei billige Anzüge. Im zweiten Jahre käme die
Unterweisung im Handwerk an die Reihe, und als Wochenlohn würde ihm
ein Dollar ausgezahlt, im dritten Jahr zwei, im vierten drei Dollars.
Als ausgelernter Klempner könnte er dann wöchentlich fünfzehn bis
zwanzig, vielleicht auch dreißig Dollars verdienen; zu einem Wochenlohn
von fünfundsiebzig Dollars würde er es aber niemals bringen. Bei
jedem andern Handwerk, für das er sich entscheidet, muß er dieselbe
langwierige und schlecht bezahlte Lehrlingszeit durchmachen. Advokat
oder Doktor zu werden ist aber noch hundertmal schwerer, denn da erhält
er nicht nur während der ganzen Lehrzeit keinen Lohn, sondern er hat
noch eine große Summe für seinen Unterricht zu bezahlen und genießt das
Vorrecht, sich selbst beköstigen und kleiden zu dürfen.

Das alles weiß der angehende Litterat und hat doch die Dreistigkeit
sich zur Aufnahme in die Schriftstellergilde zu melden und seinen
Teil von ihren hohen Ehren und Einkünften zu verlangen, ohne zur
Rechtfertigung für seine Anmaßung auch nur eine zwölfmonatliche
Lehrzeit nachweisen zu können. Er würde nur unschuldsvoll lächeln,
wollte man ihm zumuten, ohne vorherige Anweisung selbst das einfachste
kleine Blechnäpfchen anzufertigen. Aber, ohne Kenntnis der Grammatik,
phrasenhaft, weitschweifig und mit den verschrobenen Begriffen von
Welt und Menschen, die er sich auf irgend einem Neste im Hinterwald
angeeignet hat, getraut sich der unwissende Gelbschnabel, die
Feder, diese gefährliche Waffe, zur Hand zu nehmen, um damit die
gewaltigen Mächte, Handel, Finanzen, Krieg und Politik aufs Geratewohl
anzugreifen. Wenn es nicht so traurig wäre, würde es einfach lächerlich
sein. Der arme Junge wagt sich ohne bestandene Lehrzeit nicht in die
Klempnerwerkstatt hinein, aber er scheut sich nicht, mit ungeübter
Hand ein Werkzeug zu ergreifen und zu führen, welches Königsthrone zu
stürzen, Religionen zu ändern und das Wohl oder Wehe ganzer Völker zu
entscheiden vermag.

Wenn der Verfasser jenes Briefes für die Zeitungen, die in der
Nachbarschaft seines Wohnorts erscheinen, unentgeltlich schreiben will,
so ist hundert gegen eins zu wetten, daß er so viele Aufträge erhält,
als er unter dieser Bedingung nur irgend übernehmen kann. -- Stellt
sich dann heraus, daß seine Schreibereien wirklich etwas wert sind, so
finden sich sicherlich eine Menge Leute, die ihm Geld dafür anbieten.

Zum Schluß will ich ihm als ernste und wohlgemeinte Ermutigung noch
einmal die Thatsache zu Gemüte führen, daß annehmbare und lesenswerte
Schriftsteller höchst selten sind. Sowohl Buchhändler als Herausgeber
von Zeitungen suchen unablässig nach ihnen und zwar mit solchem Eifer,
daß sie sich bei dem Geschäft keinen Augenblick Rast oder Ruhe gönnen.




Antworten auf Zuschriften.


I.

An einen Moral-Statistiker.

Behalten Sie Ihre statistischen Notizen ein andermal für sich! Ich habe
das ganze Bündel genommen und mir die Pfeife damit angezündet. Leute
von Ihrem Schlage sind mir verhaßt. Sie rechnen fortwährend aus, wie
sehr ein Mensch seiner Gesundheit schadet, wie sehr er seine Denkkraft
schwächt und wie viele elende Dollars und Cents er vergeudet, wenn er
sich zweiundneunzig Jahre lang den verderblichen Genuß des Rauchens
gestattet, der ebenso verderblichen Gewohnheit des Kaffeetrinkens
fröhnt, gelegentlich eine Partie Billard spielt, bei Tische ein Glas
Wein trinkt u. s. w. u. s. w. Und Sie zählen sich immer an den Fingern
her, wie viele Frauen der gefährlichen Mode, weite Reifröcke zu tragen,
zum Opfer gefallen und verbrannt sind u. s. w.

Immer sehen Sie nur die _eine_ Seite der Frage. Sie sind blind gegen
die Thatsache, daß die meisten alten Männer in Amerika rauchen und
Kaffee trinken, obgleich sie nach Ihrer Theorie alle jung gestorben
sein sollten, daß rüstige alte Engländer Wein trinken und am Leben
bleiben, daß dicke alte Holländer sowohl tüchtig trinken als rauchen
und doch die ganze Zeit über nur immer älter und wohlbeleibter
werden. Auch kümmern Sie sich nie darum, wie viel Behagen, Erholung
und Vergnügen der Mensch im Lauf seines Lebens vom Rauchen hat (was
zehnmal soviel wert ist als das Geld, welches er sparen würde, wenn er
es bleiben ließe), und fragen gar nicht danach, was für eine ungeheure
Menge von Wohlsein dem Menschen in seiner Lebenszeit verloren geht,
wenn er, -- wie Ihresgleichen -- nicht raucht.

Natürlich können Sie Geld sparen, wenn Sie sich fünfzig Jahre lang jene
kleinen lasterhaften Genüsse versagen, aber was wird Ihnen das nützen,
wozu können Sie das Geld gebrauchen? Es kann Ihre arme sündhafte
Seele doch nicht ewig selig machen. Nützlich verwendet wird das Geld
nur, wenn es uns in diesem Leben Genuß und Behagen verschafft; für
Sie, der Sie ein abgesagter Feind von Genuß und Behagen sind, hat es
daher keinerlei Zweck, Schätze aufzuhäufen. Sagen Sie nur nicht, Sie
fänden es besser, das Geld für gute, gesunde Speisen auszugeben, Werke
der Barmherzigkeit zu thun und sich an Traktätchen-Gesellschaften
zu beteiligen. Sie wissen recht gut, daß Leute von Ihrer Sorte, die
keine kleinen menschlichen Schwächen haben, nie einen Cent verschenken
und sich die Nahrung so knapp zumessen, daß sie immer hohlwangig und
hungrig aussehen. Sie getrauen sich ja bei Tage kaum zu lachen, aus
Furcht, irgend ein armer Teufel, der Sie bei guter Laune sieht, möchte
den Versuch machen, Ihnen einen Dollar abzuborgen. In der Kirche
liegen Sie auf den Knieen und vergraben Ihr Gesicht in das Kissen,
wenn der Klingelbeutel herankommt, und dem Steuerbeamten geben Sie nie
den vollen Betrag Ihres Einkommens an. Das alles wissen Sie recht gut
selber, nicht wahr? -- Nun also -- wozu sollten Sie Ihr erbärmliches
Leben bis in ein armseliges, welkes Alter ausdehnen? Was nützt es
Ihnen, Geld zusammenzuscharren, das doch völlig wertlos für Sie ist?
Kurz und gut, warum legen Sie sich nicht lieber hin und sterben,
anstatt fort und fort den Versuch zu machen, andere Leute mit Ihrer
abscheulichen Moralstatistik zu verführen, ebenso ›tugendhaft‹ und
unausstehlich zu werden wie Sie? Ich für meine Person billige die
Verschwendung nicht und treibe selbst keine; aber ich hege das größte
Mißtrauen gegen einen Menschen, der gar keine kleinen Schwächen hat und
wünsche deshalb nichts mehr von Ihnen zu hören.


II.

An einen jungen Schriftsteller.

Jawohl, Agassiz empfiehlt den Schriftstellern Fische zu essen, weil
ihr Phosphorgehalt Gehirn erzeugt. Insofern haben Sie ganz recht.
Aber zu einer Entscheidung der Frage, wieviel Sie davon essen müssen,
kann ich Ihnen nicht verhelfen -- wenigstens nicht mit Sicherheit.
Wenn der Probeaufsatz, den Sie einschicken, dem entspricht, was Sie
im Durchschnitt leisten können, so sollte ich denken, daß für jetzt
ein paar Walfische genügen würden. Es brauchten nicht gerade die
allergrößten Walfische zu sein, sondern eine gute, gesunde Mittelsorte.


III.

An einen verschmähten Liebhaber.

Herr Higgins in Los Angeles schreibt mir: »Mein Leben ist verfehlt. Ich
habe sie bis zum Wahnsinn geliebt und angebetet; sie aber hat sich kalt
von mir abgewendet und ihr Herz einem andern geschenkt. Raten Sie mir,
was soll ich thun?«

_Antwort._ Schenken Sie Ihr Herz auch einer andern -- oder mehreren,
wenn genug zu haben sind. Thun Sie auch alles, was in Ihrer Macht
steht, um Ihre frühere Flamme unglücklich zu machen. In Romanen findet
man die abgeschmackte Vorstellung verbreitet, daß ein verschmähter
Liebhaber sich um so glücklicher fühlt, je glücklicher seine Geliebte
mit einem andern ist. Glauben Sie nur ja nicht an solchen Unsinn.
Je mehr das Mädchen Ursache hat zu beklagen, daß es nicht Ihre Frau
geworden ist, um so behaglicher wird Ihnen dabei zu Mute sein. Das
klingt nicht poetisch, ist aber eine höchst vernünftige Regel.


IV.

An Arthur Augustus.

Nein, da haben Sie unrecht. Das ist wohl die Art, wie man einen
Pflasterstein oder einen Tomahawk schleudert, aber für einen
Blumenstrauß eignet sie sich weniger; Sie könnten dabei leicht einmal
jemand Schaden anthun. Einen Strauß hält man mit den Blumen nach
unten, faßt ihn bei den Stengeln und wirft ihn dann im Bogen. Haben
Sie je mit der Wurfscheibe gespielt? Gerade so muß man's machen. Die
Sitte, ungeheuere massive Bouquets von der Größe und Schwere eines
preisgekrönten Kohlkopfs aus den schwindelnden Höhen der Galerie
hinabzuwerfen, ist höchst gefährlich und tadelnswert. Wissen Sie, was
vorgestern abend in der Musikakademie geschehen ist? -- Eben hatte
die Signorina das wundervolle Lied ›Des Sommers letzte Rose‹ zu Ende
gesungen, da kam ein solcher Schmiedehammer aus dem Blumengeschlecht
durch die mit Beifallssturm erfüllte Luft herniedergesaust. Hätte sie
nicht eine schnelle Wendung nach rechts gemacht, so würde er sie wie
einen Schindelnagel in die Bretter der Bühne hineingehämmert haben.
Natürlich wurde der Strauß in guter Absicht geworfen, aber hätten Sie
etwa die Zielscheibe sein mögen? Glauben Sie mir -- eine aufrichtig
gemeinte Artigkeit wird von einer Dame stets dankbar empfunden, so
lange man nicht versucht, sie damit zu Boden zu schmettern.


V.

Einer jungen Mutter.

Sie denken also, ein kleines Kind sei allezeit ein Ausbund von
Schönheit und eine Quelle ewiger Freude? Die Idee ist zwar ansprechend,
aber wie mir scheint nicht ganz neu. Jede Kuh denkt dasselbe von ihrem
Kalbe. Vielleicht denkt es die Kuh auf weniger anmutige Art, aber
sie denkt es doch und ich rechne es der Kuh zur Ehre an. Wir alle
schätzen dieses rührende mütterliche Gefühl, wo wir es auch finden,
sei es im Hause der Pracht und des Reichtums oder im niedern Kuhstall.
Aber wirklich, verehrte Frau, genau betrachtet, finde ich, daß Ihre
Behauptung sich nicht in allen Fällen als stichhaltig erweist. Man kann
ein schmutziges Kind, dem nicht rechtzeitig die Nase geputzt wird,
nicht mit gutem Gewissen für einen Ausbund von Schönheit erklären, und
da das früheste Kindesalter höchstens drei kurze Jahre umfaßt, kann
ein kleines Kind unmöglich eine ›ewige‹ Freude sein. Es schmerzt mich,
daß ich genötigt bin, zwei Drittteile Ihres schönen Ausspruchs mit
einem einzigen Satz zu vernichten, aber bei meiner verantwortlichen
Stellung als Redakteur darf ich Ihnen nicht gestatten, das Publikum mit
wohlklingenden Redensarten zu täuschen und in die Irre zu führen.

Ich kenne ein kleines Kind weiblichen Geschlechts in dieser Stadt,
das achtzehn Monate alt ist und außer stande vierundzwanzig Stunden
hintereinander eine Quelle der Freude zu sein -- von ›ewig‹ gar nicht
zu reden! Es ergeht sich in den merkwürdigsten Absonderlichkeiten und
besitzt einen Appetit, wie er mir noch nicht vorgekommen ist. Ich will
hier aufzählen, was dieses Kind an einem einzigen Tage sich alles
ganz allein ausgedacht, vorgenommen und ausgeführt hat, ohne Anraten
und Hilfe seiner Mutter oder einer andern Person. Auch bemerke ich,
daß sich meine sämtlichen Angaben durch beschworene Zeugenaussagen
bestätigen lassen.

Das Kind begann damit, ein Dutzend große Pillen samt der Schachtel
zu verzehren, dann fiel es die Treppe hinunter und stand mit einer
dicken blauroten Beule an der Stirn wieder auf, um sich sofort
nach anderer Unterhaltung und Zerstreuung umzusehen. Es fand eine
Glasbrosche mit Messingverzierung, zerbrach erst das Glas, verspeiste
es und verschluckte dann das Messing. Hierauf trank es wohl ein
Dutzend Eßlöffel voll starken Kampferspiritus und etwa zwanzig Tropfen
Laudanum; wäre mehr dagewesen, es hätte noch mehr getrunken. Dann
legte es sich auf den Rücken und steckte sich einen Spazierstock
mit silbernem Knopf vier bis fünf Zoll weit in den Hals hinab, wo
er so fest saß, daß die Mutter die größte Mühe hatte, ihn wieder
herauszuziehen, ohne ein Stück von dem Kinde selbst mit herauszureißen.
Dann verspürte es wieder Hunger nach Glas, brach ein paar Weingläser
entzwei und begann die Scherben zu verzehren; daß es sich dabei
verschiedene Male schnitt, machte ihm nichts aus. Ferner aß es eine
Menge Butter, Salz, Pfeffer und Zündhölzchen; immer abwechselnd einen
Löffel voll Butter, einen voll Salz, einen voll Pfeffer und drei
oder vier Hölzchen. Nun wusch es sich den Kopf mit Seife und Wasser,
aß die übrige Seife auf und trank soviel von dem Seifwasser, als
es unterbringen konnte. Darauf spazierte es hinaus, faßte die Kuh
vertraulich am Schwanz und erhielt von derselben einen Schlag mit dem
Huf, daß es einen Purzelbaum schoß. Wenn diese ›Quelle der Freude‹ im
Lauf des Tages gerade nichts anderes vorhatte, vertrieb sie sich die
Zeit damit, auf Stühle und Tische zu klettern, herabzufallen und sich
regelmäßig dabei weh zu thun. Trotz ihrer Jugend kann sie einzelne
Wörter schon ganz deutlich aussprechen und da sie auch in anderer
Hinsicht nicht hinter dem Berge hält, sondern dreist auf alles losgeht,
eröffnet sie die Unterhaltung mit jedem Fremden, sei er männlichen oder
weiblichen Geschlechts mit derselben Formel: »Wie geht's Jim?«



Da ich mit den Eigenheiten der Kinder im allgemeinen nicht vertraut
bin, habe ich vielleicht Dinge als etwas Außergewöhnliches geschildert,
die jedem, der in der Kinderstube Bescheid weiß, höchst alltäglich
erscheinen. Indessen kann ich doch nicht glauben, daß dies wirklich
der Fall ist, und wiederhole daher nochmals, daß mein Bericht über die
Thaten dieses Kindes vollkommen mit der Wahrheit übereinstimmt; sollte
irgend jemand hieran zweifeln, so kann ich ihm das Mädchen vorführen.
Ich will mich auch dafür verbürgen, daß es alles verschlingen wird,
was man ihm giebt (einen Amboß möchte ich allenfalls ausnehmen), und
überall hinunterfallen, wo man es hinsetzt.

Aber ich sehe, daß ich zu weit von meinem Gegenstand abschweife,
deshalb will ich nur noch einmal die Ueberzeugung aussprechen, daß
nicht jedes kleine Kind ein Ausbund von Schönheit und eine Quelle
ewiger Freude ist.


VI.

An einen gelehrten Fragesteller.

Ein Arithmetikus aus Virginia in Nevada schreibt: »Ich studiere mit
Begeisterung Mathematik und finde es recht verdrießlich, daß mein
Fortschritt unaufhörlich durch geheimnisvolle, technische Ausdrücke der
Gelehrten gehemmt wird. Wollen Sie mir nicht gefälligst sagen, worin
der Unterschied zwischen Geometrie und Conchologie besteht?«

_Antwort_: Bleiben Sie mir vom Leibe mit Ihren arithmetischen Rätseln,
mir ist der Kopf ohnehin von einem Schnupfen eingenommen, der mich
halb tot macht. Hätten Sie den Ausdruck von Hohn sehen können, der
noch vor einem Augenblick meine Gesichtszüge verdüsterte und sofort
vom Mittelpunkt aus durch mein letztes Niesen nach allen Seiten hin
gesprengt wurde, wie ein zersplittertes Spiegelglas, Sie würden diese
schimpfliche Frage schwerlich niedergeschrieben haben.

Die Conchologie ist eine Wissenschaft, die nichts mit der Mathematik zu
thun hat; sie bezieht sich einzig und allein auf Schaltiere. Damit soll
aber nicht gesagt sein, daß ein Mann, welcher Austerschalen für ein
Gasthaus öffnet, oder sich einer Wageschale bedient, Schalen mit Milch
füllt, oder Eierschalen ausbläst, ein Student der Conchologie ist --
diese feine sarkastische Bemerkung wird an einer so hohlen Hirnschale
wie die Ihrige wohl verschwendet sein. Nun vergleichen Sie einmal
die Conchologie und die Geometrie mit einander, da werden Sie sehen,
was der Unterschied ist und die Antwort auf Ihre Frage finden. Aber
martern Sie mich nicht wieder mit Ihren arithmetischen Greueln, bis Sie
hören, daß ich meinen Schnupfen losgeworden bin. Mich erfüllt in diesem
Augenblick der bitterste Haß gegen Sie, weil Sie mich auf solche
Weise nörgeln und quälen, während ich vor Wut nur niesen und meine
Taschentücher zu Atomen zerschnauben kann. Seien Sie froh, daß Sie
nicht im Bereich meiner Nase sind. Es wäre mir eine wahre Genugthuung,
Sie mit einem kolossalen Nieser in alle Winde zu blasen.




Kandidatenfreuden.


Vor ein paar Monaten wurde ich im großen Staate New York von der Partei
der Unabhängigen als Kandidat für den Gouverneursposten aufgestellt.
Meine Gegenkandidaten waren John T. Smith und Blank J. Blank. Diesen
Herren gegenüber glaubte ich erheblich im Vorteil zu sein -- ich
erfreute mich nämlich eines guten Rufes. Wenn sie aber -- das konnte
man leicht aus den Zeitungen ersehen -- je gewußt hatten, was es heißt,
einen fleckenlosen Namen zu tragen, so war diese Zeit längst vorüber.
Offenbar hatten sie sich in den letzten Jahren mit den schändlichsten
Verbrechen ganz vertraut gemacht. Aber während ich mich noch insgeheim
an dem Bewußtsein meiner Ueberlegenheit ergötzte, lauerte schon ein
trübes Unbehagen im Hintergrunde meiner Seele und nagte an den Wurzeln
meines Glücks. Mich quälte der Gedanke, daß nun mein Name fortwährend
in Verbindung mit demjenigen solcher Menschen genannt werden würde.
Meine Unruhe darüber wuchs von Tag zu Tage. Endlich schrieb ich es
meiner Großmutter. Ihre Antwort traf ein und lautete sehr bestimmt wie
folgt:

»Du hast nie in deinem Leben das geringste gethan, dessen du dich zu
schämen brauchtest, nicht das geringste. Nun wirf einen Blick in die
Zeitungen, lies und erkenne, was für Charaktere die Herren Smith und
Blank sind und dann prüfe dich, ob du willens bist, dich so weit zu
erniedrigen, daß du mit ihnen den öffentlichen Wettbewerb um ein Amt
aufnimmst.«



Mir ganz aus der Seele gesprochen! Ich verbrachte eine schlaflose
Nacht; aber wie ich's mir auch überlegte, zurücktreten konnte ich nicht
mehr, ich war meinen Wählern gegenüber gebunden und mußte den Kampf
fortsetzen. Als ich beim Frühstück mechanisch die Zeitung überblickte,
stieß ich auf den folgenden Artikel, und, ehrlich gestanden, hat mich
noch nie im Leben etwas dermaßen verblüfft:

»_Meineid._ -- Da nun Herr M. Twain öffentlich als Kandidat für
den Gouverneursposten auftritt, wird er sich vielleicht zu einer
Erklärung herbeilassen, wie es kam, daß er im Jahre 1863 zu Wakawak
in Cochinchina von vierunddreißig Zeugen des Meineids überführt
wurde. Der Zweck dieses Meineids war, eine arme eingeborene Witwe
und ihre hilflosen Kinder der elenden kleinen Bananenpflanzung zu
berauben, welche ihnen in ihrer Not und Verlassenheit allein Nahrung
und Unterhalt gewährte. Herr Twain ist es sich selbst und dem großen
Volke schuldig, um dessen Stimmen er sich bewirbt, diese Angelegenheit
aufzuklären. Wird er es thun?« --

Ich meinte, mich rühre der Schlag vor Entsetzen. Eine so grausame und
herzlose Beschuldigung! Cochinchina hatte ich nie gesehen und von
Wakawak niemals gehört. Ich hätte eine Bananenpflanzung nicht von
einem Känguruh unterscheiden können. Ich war ratlos, von Sinnen, wußte
mir nicht zu helfen! So verging der Tag, ohne daß ich einen Entschluß
faßte. Am nächsten Morgen brachte dieselbe Zeitung folgende kurze Notiz:

»_Bezeichnend._ -- Herr Twain hüllt sich, wie man bemerkt, über den
Cochinchina-Meineid in ein vielsagendes Schweigen.«

Während des ganzen Wahlkampfes wurde ich, beiläufig gesagt, von dieser
Zeitung nie anders erwähnt, als mit dem Beifügen: »Der schändliche,
meineidige Twain.«

       *       *       *       *       *

Die ›Gazette‹ brachte nun zunächst folgendes:

»_Anfrage._ -- Wird der neue Gouverneurskandidat die Güte haben, einige
seiner Mitbürger, die ihre Stimmen nicht leichtsinnig abgeben wollen,
über einen geringfügigen Umstand aufzuklären? Wie kam es, daß seine
Schlafgenossen in Montana dann und wann kleine Wertsachen verloren,
die jedesmal an Herrn Twains Person oder in seinem ›Koffer‹ (einem
Zeitungsblatt, in welches er seine Habseligkeiten einzuwickeln pflegte)
vorgefunden wurden, bis man sich endlich veranlaßt fühlte, ihm zu
seinem eigenen Besten eine freundliche Verwarnung zu erteilen? Man
theerte und federte ihn, ließ ihn auf einem Balken reiten und gab ihm
schließlich den Rat, an dem Platz, den er gewöhnlich im Lager einnahm,
eine bleibende Lücke zu lassen. Wird er dem Rate folgen?« --

Konnte man sich etwas ausgeklügelt Boshafteres vorstellen, zumal ich
zu keiner Zeit meines Lebens in Montana gewesen bin?

Von da ab nannte mich dieses Journal nie anders als den ›Montana-Dieb
Twain.‹

Ich kam so weit, daß ich mich fast fürchtete, eine Zeitung in die Hand
zu nehmen; ungefähr wie jemand, der eine wollene Decke, die er nötig
braucht, aufheben möchte, aber eine Klapperschlange darunter vermutet.
Eines Tages las ich folgendes:

»_Der Lügner ist entlarvt!_ -- Durch die beschworenen Aussagen der
Herren Michael O'Flanagan, Snub Rafferty und Catty Mulligan aus
Five-Points und Water-Street[1] wurde festgestellt, daß Herrn Mark
Twains schändliche Behauptung, als wäre der verstorbene Großvater
unseres edlen Bannerträgers Blank J. Blank wegen Straßenraubs gehängt
worden, eine gemeine, aus der Luft gegriffene Lüge ist. Für tugendhafte
Männer ist es eine niederschmetternde Erfahrung, daß man zu solchen
unehrenhaften Mitteln greifen kann, um einen politischen Erfolg zu
erringen, daß man sich nicht scheut, die Toten noch im Grabe zu
beschimpfen und auf ihren geachteten Namen Verleumdungen zu häufen.
Wenn wir an den Schmerz denken, den diese elende Lüge den unschuldigen
Verwandten und Freunden des Verewigten bereitet haben muß, sind wir
fast versucht, das betrogene und beleidigte Publikum zu schneller, wenn
auch ungesetzmäßiger Rache gegen den Verleumder aufzustacheln. Aber
nein -- überlassen wir ihn den Qualen eines gepeinigten Gewissens! --
Sollte jedoch der Fall eintreten, daß das Publikum, von Leidenschaft
übermannt, in blinder Wut dem Verleumder körperliche Mißhandlungen
zufügte, so liegt es auf der Hand, daß kein Schwurgericht die Thäter
für schuldig erklären, kein Richter sie strafen könnte.«

    [1] Eine berüchtigte Gegend New Yorks, wo viel irisches
        Gesindel wohnt.

Der geschickt abgefaßte Schlußsatz bewirkte, daß ich noch in derselben
Nacht in größter Eile aus dem Bette und zur Hinterthür hinausflüchten
mußte, während das ›betrogene und beleidigte‹ Publikum vor dem Hause
wütete und tobte wie brandende Meereswogen, in seiner gerechten
Entrüstung beim Kommen Möbel und Fenster zerschlug und beim Gehen so
viel von meinem Eigentum mitnahm, als es tragen konnte. Und doch kann
ich meine Hand auf die Bibel legen und versichern, daß ich Herrn Blanks
Großvater niemals verleumdet habe. Ja noch mehr -- ich hatte bis zu
jener Stunde seinen Namen nicht einmal nennen hören.

Gelegentlich will ich nur erwähnen, daß das Journal, welchem
obige Mitteilung entstammt, mich von nun an immer als ›Twain, den
Leichenschänder‹ bezeichnete.

       *       *       *       *       *

Der nächste Zeitungsartikel, der meine Aufmerksamkeit erregte, lautete
wie folgt:

»_Ein netter Kandidat!_ -- Herr Mark Twain, der gestern abend bei der
Volksversammlung der Unabhängigen eine donnernde Rede halten sollte,
glänzte durch Abwesenheit. Ein Telegramm seines Arztes meldete, daß
er von einem durchgegangenen Gespann zu Boden geworfen worden sei
und an einem doppelten Beinbruch in großen Schmerzen darniederliege,
und so weiter, und so weiter, noch ein ganzer Haufen ähnlichen
Unsinns. Die Unabhängigen gaben sich alle Mühe, die elende Notlüge
hinunterzuschlucken und zu thun, als ahnten sie den eigentlichen Grund
der Abwesenheit jenes Verworfenen nicht, den sie zu ihrem Bannerträger
erkoren haben. _Gestern abend sah man einen gewissen Menschen im
Zustand viehischer Betrunkenheit_ in Herrn Twains Hotel hineintaumeln!
Es ist unbedingt Pflicht für die Unabhängigen, zu beweisen, daß dieses
zum Tier entwürdigte Geschöpf nicht Mark Twain selbst gewesen ist.
Jetzt endlich sind sie gefangen -- hier giebt es kein Entrinnen! Im
Donnerton ruft die Volksstimme: _Wer war der Mensch?_« --

       *       *       *       *       *

Unglaublich, völlig unglaublich, daß es wirklich mein Name war, den man
mit diesem schmachvollen Verdacht in Verbindung brachte! Waren doch
drei Jahre über mein Haupt dahingegangen, seit ich einen Tropfen Ale,
Bier, Wein oder überhaupt ein geistiges Getränk angerührt hatte.

Es zeigt, wie abgestumpft ich schon mit der Zeit geworden war, daß ich
es ohne Schmerz ertragen konnte, mich in der nächsten Nummer dieses
Journals ganz selbstverständlich als Herr ›~Delirium Tremens Twain~‹
erwähnt zu finden, obgleich ich sicher sein konnte, daß das Blatt mit
unwandelbarer Eintönigkeit fortfahren werde, mich bis ans Ende so zu
bezeichnen.

Unter den Postsachen, welche ich täglich erhielt, begannen jetzt
anonyme Briefe eine große Rolle zu spielen. Die Form derselben war
meistens folgende:

    »Wie war's denn mit die alte Bettelfrau, die Sie von Ihrer
    Dürschwölle mit Fußdritte wegjachten?

            Pol Pry.«

Dann weiter: --

    »Sie haben Dahten gethan, welche niemand bewußt sind wie mir.
    Rücken Sie nur ein bar Batzen raus an Ihren Ergebenen oder Sie
    sollen durch die Zeitungen was hören von

            Handy Andy.«

So ungefähr lauteten sie. Auf Wunsch könnte ich damit fortfahren, bis
der Leser übergenug hat.

Bald darauf ›überführte‹ mich das bedeutendste republikanische
Journal einer großartigen Bestechung und das demokratische Hauptblatt
bezüchtigte mich eines niederträchtigen Erpressungsversuches. Auf diese
Weise erwarb ich zwei neue Titel: ›Twain, der elende Verführer‹ und
›Twain, der schändliche Räuber.‹

Inzwischen verlangte man mit solchem Toben eine ›Antwort‹ auf alle die
entsetzlichen Beschuldigungen, die gegen mich laut geworden waren, daß
die Redakteure und die Führer meiner Partei behaupteten, es wäre mein
politischer Ruin, wollte ich länger bei meinem Schweigen verharren. Wie
um ihr Verlangen noch dringender zu machen, erschien schon am nächsten
Tage folgendes in einer Zeitung:

»_Seht einmal den Menschen an!_ -- Der Kandidat der Unabhängigen
schweigt noch immer, weil er nicht zu reden wagt. Alle gegen ihn
erhobenen Anschuldigungen sind vollauf bewiesen worden und sein
fortgesetztes, beredtes Schweigen hat deren Wahrheit genug bestätigt,
so daß er nunmehr für alle Zeit überführt dasteht. -- Ihr Unabhängigen,
seht ihn euch einmal an, euern Kandidaten! Seht den verruchten
Meineidigen, den Montana-Dieb, den Leichenschänder! Betrachtet euch
euern ~Delirium Tremens~, den elenden Verführer, den schändlichen
Räuber! Schaut ihn an -- genau und gründlich -- und dann sagt, ob ihr
mit gutem Gewissen einem Schurken eure Stimme geben könnt, der sich
durch seine entsetzlichen Verbrechen eine so grauenvolle Auswahl von
Ehrentiteln erworben hat und es nicht wagt, den Mund aufzuthun, um auch
nur einen einzigen von sich zu weisen.«



Ich sah keine Möglichkeit, mir die Sache zu ersparen, und so machte
ich mich denn tief gedemütigt daran, eine ›Antwort‹ auf den Wust von
grundlosen Beschuldigungen und boshaften Lügen vorzubereiten. Aber
ich brachte diese Aufgabe nicht zu stande. Schon am folgenden Morgen
erschien nämlich eine neue gräßliche Geschichte in einem Blatt; mit
abscheulicher Erfindungsgabe beschuldigte man mich allen Ernstes, ein
Irrenhaus nebst sämtlichen Insassen niedergebrannt zu haben, weil
es die Aussicht vor meinem Hause versperre. Dies versetzte mich in
Todesschrecken. -- Ferner sollte ich noch meinen Onkel vergiftet haben,
um sein Vermögen an mich zu bringen, und man bestand heftig darauf, das
Grab müsse geöffnet werden. Es trieb mich an den Rand der Verzweiflung.
Als nun noch die Anklage folgte, ich hätte als Pfleger des Findelhauses
meine zahnlosen, altersschwachen Verwandten angestellt, um die Kost
zu bereiten -- da begann ich zu wanken, und die Sinne schwanden mir.
Schließlich setzte man der empörenden Verunglimpfung, die der Parteihaß
mir angethan, noch die Krone auf, indem man neun zerlumpte Kinder, in
allen Farbenschattierungen, die kaum laufen gelernt hatten, abrichtete,
bei einer öffentlichen Versammlung auf die Rednertribüne zu stürzen,
sich an mich zu drängen und mich Papa zu nennen.

Das gab den Ausschlag. Ich strich die Flagge und ergab mich. Zum
Wahlkampf im Staate New York bei Besetzung des Gouverneurpostens
reichten meine Kräfte nicht aus. Ich sandte meinen Verzicht auf die
Kandidatur ein und unterzeichnete mich in der Bitterkeit meines Herzens

    Ihr ergebener

        ehemaliger Ehrenmann,

        aber jetzt S.M. -- M.D. -- L.Sch. -- D.T. -- E.V. u. S.R.

        _Mark Twain_.




Der große Rindfleisch-Kontrakt.


Mit so wenig Worten wie möglich will ich der Nation über meine
Beteiligung an einer Sache berichten, welche die öffentliche Meinung in
hohem Grade beschäftigt und viel böses Blut erregt hat.

Die traurige Angelegenheit ist von den Zeitungen der alten und der
neuen Welt mit den schrecklichsten Uebertreibungen und Verzerrungen
dargestellt worden; für alle Thatsachen, welche ich anführe, finden
sich aber -- das kann ich versichern -- mehr als genügende urkundliche
Beweise in den Staatsarchiven der Union vor. Der Verlauf der Sache war
ursprünglich folgender:

John Wilson Mackenzie aus Rotterdam in der Grafschaft Chemung im Staate
New Jersey, jetzt verstorben, schloß etwa am 10. Oktober 1861 mit der
Regierung der Vereinigten Staaten einen Kontrakt ab, nach welchem er
dem General Sherman dreißig Faß eingepökeltes Rindfleisch zu liefern
hatte.

Nun gut.



Er machte sich auf, um Sherman das Rindfleisch zu bringen, aber als er
in Washington ankam, war der General nach Manassas unterwegs; er zog
ihm daher mit dem Rindfleisch nach, kam aber zu spät. Nun folgte er
ihm nach Nashville, von Nashville nach Chatanooga, von Chatanooga nach
Atlanta -- einholen konnte er ihn jedoch nicht. In Atlanta nahm er
einen neuen Anlauf und zog auf dem ganzen Marsch nach der Meeresküste
hinter Sherman drein. Wieder kam er um einige Tage zu spät; da er aber
erfuhr, der General habe sich in der ›Quaker-City‹ nach dem Heiligen
Lande eingeschifft, ging er nach Beirut unter Segel, überzeugt, er
werde das andere Schiff einholen können. In Jerusalem angekommen,
erhielt er die Nachricht, der General sei nicht mit der ›Quaker-City‹
abgesegelt, sondern nach der Prairie aufgebrochen, um gegen die
Indianer zu kämpfen. Er kehrte daher nach Amerika zurück und zog in
das Felsengebirge. Nach achtundsechzigtägiger, mühseliger Wanderung
durch die Prairie, nur noch vier Meilen von Shermans Hauptquartier
entfernt, fiel er den Indianern in die Hände, die ihn mit dem Tomahawk
erschlugen, ihm die Kopfhaut abzogen und sich des Rindfleischs
bemächtigten. Sie nahmen das ganze, bis auf ein Faß, welches Shermans
Armee eroberte. Der kühne Reisende erfüllte also sogar im Tode noch
seinen Kontrakt, wenigstens zum Teil. In seinem Testament, das er wie
ein Tagebuch führte, vermachte er den Kontrakt seinem Sohn Bartholomäus
W. Dieser schrieb die folgende Rechnung auf -- dann starb er:


        _Rechnung für die Ver. Staaten._

    _In Rechnung für _John Wilson Mackenzie_ von New Jersey, jetzt
    verstorben, 30 Fass_

  _eingepökeltes Rindfleisch für General _Sherman_
  à 100 Dollars_                            _3000 Doll._
  _Reisespesen und Transport des
  Fleisches_                               _14000 Doll._
                                        -------------
                                     _Summa 17000 Doll._

        _Den Betrag empfangen zu haben bescheinigt_

        .................................

Bei seinem Ableben hinterließ er den Kontrakt dem Wm. J. Martin,
welcher sich bemühte, die Summe zu erheben, aber darüber starb und
seine Forderung an Barker J. Allen vermachte. Auch dieser erhielt bei
seinen Lebzeiten keine Bezahlung und hinterließ die Schriftstücke Anson
G. Rogers, der bei seinem Versuch, den Betrag einzukassieren, eben bis
zum neunten Rechnungsführer gelangt war, als der Tod, der alles zum
Abschluß bringt, ungerufen erschien und ihm die ferneren Verhandlungen
abschnitt. Die Papiere hinterließ er einem Verwandten in Connecticut,
Namens Vengeance Hopkins, welcher es vier Wochen und zwei Tage aushielt
und unerhörten Erfolg hatte, denn fast wäre er bis zum zwölften
Rechnungsführer gelangt. Er vermachte den Kontrakt testamentarisch
seinem Onkel, der Freudenreich Johnson hieß. Aber Freudenreich ertrug
es nicht lange. Seine letzten Worte waren: »Ich sterbe gern -- weinet
nicht über mich!« Und er starb wirklich gern, der arme Mann. Nach
seinem Tode erbten noch sieben andere Leute Kontrakt und Rechnung,
die alle bald starben. So kamen die Papiere zuletzt in meinen Besitz.
Ich erhielt sie von meinem Verwandten Betlehem Hubbard aus Indiana,
der schon lange einen Groll gegen mich hegte. Auf seinem Totenbette
schickte er aber nach mir, verzieh mir alles, und übergab mir mit
Thränen in den Augen den Rindfleisch-Kontrakt.

Dies ist die Vorgeschichte desselben, bis zu der Zeit, da er mein
Eigentum wurde. Jetzt will ich den Versuch machen, mich angesichts
der ganzen Nation wegen meines Anteils an der Sache zu rechtfertigen.
Mit dem Kontrakt und der Rechnung über Reisespesen und Transport der
gelieferten Ware begab ich mich zu dem Präsidenten der Vereinigten
Staaten.

»Was wünschen Sie, mein Herr,« fragte er mich. Ich erwiderte:
»Majestät, etwa am 10. Oktober des Jahres 1861 schloß John Wilson
Mackenzie aus Rotterdam in der Grafschaft Chemung im Staate New
Jersey, jetzt verstorben, mit der Regierung der Vereinigten Staaten
einen Kontrakt ab, nach welchem er dem General Sherman dreißig Faß
eingepökeltes Rindfleisch -- --«

Hier fiel er mir ins Wort, freundlich, aber mit fester Stimme, und
entließ mich. Am nächsten Tage machte ich dem Staatssekretär meine
Aufwartung.

»Ihr Begehr, mein Herr?« fragte dieser.

»Königliche Hoheit,« begann ich, »etwa am 10. Oktober des Jahres 1861
schloß John Wilson Mackenzie aus Rotterdam in der Grafschaft Chemung im
Staate New Jersey, jetzt verstorben, mit der Regierung der Vereinigten
Staaten einen Kontrakt ab, nach welchem er dem General Sherman dreißig
Faß eingepökeltes Rindfleisch -- --«

»Genug, mein Herr -- genug, sage ich! Wir haben in diesem Ministerium
nichts mit Kontrakten über Rindfleisch zu schaffen.« Ich wurde
hinauskomplimentiert. Nachdem ich mir die Sache reiflich überlegt
hatte, stattete ich tags darauf dem Marineminister einen Besuch ab. Der
sagte: »Rasch, mein Herr, bringen Sie Ihr Anliegen vor; lassen Sie mich
nicht warten!«

»Königliche Hoheit,« sagte ich, »etwa am 10. Oktober des Jahres 1861
schloß John Wilson Mackenzie aus Rotterdam in der Grafschaft Chemung im
Staate New Jersey, jetzt verstorben, mit der Regierung der Vereinigten
Staaten einen Kontrakt ab, nach welchem er dem General Sherman dreißig
Faß eingepökeltes Rindfleisch -- --«

Weiter kam ich nicht. Auch ihn gingen die Rindfleischlieferungen für
General Sherman nichts an. Ich dachte, das sei doch eine recht kuriose
Regierung! Es hatte ja fast den Anschein, als habe sie überhaupt keine
Lust, das Rindfleisch zu bezahlen. Am nächsten Tage ging ich zum
Minister des Innern.

»Kaiserliche Hoheit,« sagte ich, »etwa am 10. Oktober des --«

»Sparen Sie sich die Mühe, mein Herr,« fuhr er auf; »ich habe schon von
Ihnen gehört. Machen Sie, daß Sie mit Ihrem niederträchtigen Kontrakt
aus dem Hause kommen. Mit der Verproviantierung der Armeen hat das
Ministerium des Innern durchaus nichts zu thun.«

Ich entfernte mich; aber jetzt war ich wirklich aufgebracht. So
leichten Kaufs sollten sie mich nicht los werden; ich nahm mir vor,
jedes Departement dieser gottlosen Regierung heimzusuchen, bis das
Geschäft mit dem Kontrakt geordnet sei. Entweder wollte ich das Geld
einkassieren oder das Leben lassen bei dem Versuch, wie alle meine
Vorgänger. Ich ging dem Generalpostmeister zu Leibe, ich belagerte das
Ackerbauministerium, ich lauerte dem Sprecher des Repräsentantenhauses
auf. Sie alle hatten nichts mit den Armeelieferungen von Rindfleisch zu
schaffen. Darauf wandte ich mich an den Vorsitzenden des Patentamts.

»Hochwohlgeborene Excellenz,« sagte ich, »etwa am -- --«

»Zum Henker, sind Sie mit Ihrem verfluchten Rindfleisch-Kontrakt
endlich auch hierher gelangt! Ich versichere Sie, werter Herr, uns
gehen weder die Armeelieferungen etwas an, noch Ihr Kontrakt.«

»O, das kann jeder sagen -- -- _irgend jemand_ muß das Fleisch doch
bezahlen! Die Sache wird jetzt auf der Stelle ins reine gebracht,
sonst lege ich Beschlag auf dies alte Patentamt, mit allem was darin
ist.«

»Aber bester Herr! --«

»Es ist mir alles einerlei. Das Patentamt ist verpflichtet, das
Rindfleisch zu bezahlen. Darauf bestehe ich. Alle Ausreden sind
umsonst; ich wanke und weiche nicht vom Platze, bis das Patentamt
bezahlt hat.«



Die weiteren Einzelheiten thun nichts zu der Sache. Sie endete in einer
Prügelei und das Patentamt behielt die Oberhand. Aber etwas hatte ich
bei der Gelegenheit doch erfahren, was mir Vorteil brachte, nämlich,
daß, wenn ich zur richtigen Behörde gehen wolle, ich mich an das
Schatzamt wenden müsse. Ich begab mich dorthin und wartete drittehalb
Stunden, dann ward ich beim ersten Lord der Schatzkammer vorgelassen.

»Alleredelster, würdigster und hochgeschätztester Signor,« sagte ich,
»etwa am 10. Oktober des Jahres 1861 schloß John Wilson Macken -- --«

»Nicht weiter, mein Herr -- ich weiß, ich weiß! Gehen Sie zum ersten
Rechnungsführer.«

Das that ich und er schickte mich zum zweiten Rechnungsführer. Der
schickte mich zum Oberregistrator der Abteilung für Pökelfleisch. Das
fing doch an geschäftsmäßig auszusehen! Er ging die Bücher durch,
auch alle noch ungehefteten Akten, fand aber den Rindfleisch-Kontrakt
nirgends eingetragen und schickte mich zum zweiten Registrator. Auch
dieser sah seine Bücher und Papiere durch, aber ohne Erfolg. Jetzt
schöpfte ich neuen Mut und kam im Lauf der Woche bis zum sechsten
Registrator der Pökelfleisch-Abteilung. In der zweiten Woche machte ich
die Abteilung für Schuldforderungen durch, in der dritten erledigte ich
die Abteilung für unerfüllte Kontrakte und faßte Fuß in der Abteilung
für unbezahlte Rechnungen. Dort waren meine Erkundigungen schon nach
drei Tagen zu Ende.

Es gab jetzt nur noch einen Ort, wo ich nachfragen konnte. Ich
belagerte den Kommissionär für Bagatellsachen. Das heißt, er selbst war
nicht da, ich hielt mich an einen Schreiber. In dem Zimmer befanden
sich sechzehn wunderhübsche Damen, welche die Bücher führten, und
sieben Schreiber von wohlgefälligem Aeußern, die ihnen zeigten, wie sie
es machen müßten. Die jungen Damen wandten den Kopf und lächelten über
ihre Schultern nach oben, die Schreiber lächelten zu ihnen hinab und
es ging so lustig her, wie wenn die Glocke zur Hochzeit läutet. Zwei
oder drei andere Schreiber, welche die Zeitung lasen, sahen mich mit
scharfen Blicken an, fuhren aber fort zu lesen und niemand sprach ein
Wort. An solche Zuvorkommenheit und bereitwillige Bedienung war ich
aber in meiner ereignisreichen Laufbahn schon gewöhnt, da ich sie seit
dem Tage, als ich das erste Bureau der Pökelfleisch-Abteilung betrat,
bis ich das letzte verließ, um mich in die Abteilung für Bagatellsachen
zu begeben, bei allen Schreibergehilfen der Registratoren angetroffen
hatte. Durch viele Uebung war ich schon so weit gekommen, daß ich, von
meinem Eintritt ins Bureau an, bis zu dem Augenblick, daß der Schreiber
mich anredete, auf einem Bein stehen konnte, ohne dasselbe mehr als
zwei- oder höchstens dreimal zu wechseln.

Jetzt stand ich hier, bis ich das Bein viermal gewechselt hatte. Dann
sagte ich zu einem der Schreiber, welche lasen:

»Erlauchter Bummler, wo ist der Großtürke?«

»Was meinen Sie, mein Herr? Wen meinen Sie? -- Wenn Sie den Bureauchef
meinen -- der ist ausgegangen.«

»Wird er heute noch den Harem besuchen?«

Der junge Mann sah mich eine Weile grimmig an und vertiefte sich dann
wieder in seine Zeitung. Aber das kümmerte mich nicht, ich kannte
die Art dieser Schreiber und wußte, daß Hoffnung für mich vorhanden
sei, wenn er eher fertig wurde, als die neuen Zeitungen aus New
York eintrafen. Er war jetzt schon bei dem vorvorletzten Tageblatt
angekommen. Nach einer Weile hatte er alles durchgelesen, dann gähnte
er und fragte nach meinem Begehr.

»Weltberühmter und hochverehrter Staatsmann, etwa am 10. --«

»Ah, Sie sind der Mann mit dem Rindfleisch-Kontrakt. Geben Sie mir Ihre
Papiere.«

Er nahm sie in Empfang und wühlte dann lange Zeit in seinen
Bagatellsachen herum. Endlich fand er die Nordwestpassage, oder
was für mich dasselbe bedeutete, den lange verlorenen Vermerk über
den Rindfleisch-Kontrakt -- die Klippe, an welcher so viele meiner
Vorgänger gescheitert waren, ohne sie je zu erreichen. Meine Rührung
war groß und doch frohlockte ich im Herzen -- denn ich lebte ja noch.
Ich sagte mit bewegter Stimme:

»Geben Sie mir das Dokument! Die Regierung wird jetzt sicherlich die
Schuld abtragen.«

Er bedeutete mir jedoch, ich solle mich gedulden, es sei vorher noch
etwas zu erledigen.

»Wo ist jener John Wilson Mackenzie?« fragte er.

»Tot.«

»Wann ist er gestorben?«

»Gestorben ist er überhaupt nicht -- man hat ihn totgeschlagen.«

»Wie das?«

»Mit einem Tomahawk erschlagen.«

»Wer hat ihn mit dem Tomahawk erschlagen?«

»Natürlich doch ein Indianer. Sie glaubten doch nicht, der
Superintendent einer Sonntagsschule hätte es gethan?«

»Nein. Also ein Indianer war es?«

»Jawohl.«

»Sein Name?«

»Sein Name? -- Ich werde doch nicht seinen Namen wissen sollen!«

»_Name_ unbedingt erforderlich. Wer hat denn gesehen, daß er mit dem
Tomahawk erschlagen wurde?«

»Das weiß ich nicht.«

»Sie selbst waren also nicht zugegen?«

»Nein -- wie Sie an meinen Haaren sehen können.«

»Woher wissen Sie denn, daß Mackenzie tot ist?«

»Weil er zu jener Zeit wirklich gestorben und seitdem auch tot
geblieben ist, wie ich allen Grund habe zu glauben. Ja, ich weiß es
ganz bestimmt.«

»Wir müssen Beweise haben. Ist der Indianer zur Stelle?«

»Natürlich nicht.«

»Den müssen Sie herbeischaffen. Haben Sie den Tomahawk hier?«

»Bewahre, ich denke gar nicht daran.«

»Sie müssen den Tomahawk beibringen und ihn uns zusamt dem Indianer
vorführen. Wenn sich hierdurch Mackenzies Tod beweisen läßt, haben Sie
sich an die Kommission zu wenden, welche eingesetzt ist, um schwebende
Forderungen zu prüfen. Vielleicht kommt dann Ihre Sache so in den Zug,
daß Ihre Kinder die Bezahlung der Rechnung noch erleben und das Geld
verzehren können. Aber vor allem muß der Tod jenes Mannes bewiesen
werden. Uebrigens kann ich Ihnen gleich noch sagen, daß die Regierung
die Transport- und Reisespesen des seligen Mackenzie nimmermehr
bezahlen wird. _Möglicherweise_ wird sie das Faß Pökelfleisch
bezahlen, welches Shermans Soldaten erobert haben, wenn Sie auf
Schadenersatz klagen und der Kongreß Ihre Forderung anerkennt; aber die
neunundzwanzig Faß, welche die Indianer aufgegessen haben, wird sie
Ihnen nicht bezahlen.«

»Demnach hätte ich nur hundert Dollars zu beanspruchen und selbst
diese sind mir nicht sicher! Und das nach Mackenzies endlosem Hin- und
Herreisen mit dem Pökelfleisch in Europa, Asien und Amerika, nach allen
Beschwerden, Prüfungen und Plackereien, die er erduldet hat, nach dem
Hinsterben so vieler Unschuldiger, die bei dem Versuch, die Rechnung
einzukassieren, ums Leben gekommen sind! Junger Mann, warum hat mir der
Oberregistrator der Pökelfleisch-Abteilung das nicht gleich gesagt?«

»Er wußte nicht, daß Ihr Anspruch begründet war.«

»Warum hat es mir der zweite, der dritte nicht gesagt -- warum erfuhr
ich es in keiner einzigen der Abteilungen und Unterabteilungen?«

»Weil man nirgends etwas davon wußte. Bei uns geschieht alles nach dem
Geschäftsgang. Dem sind Sie gefolgt und haben in Erfahrung gebracht,
was Sie zu wissen wünschten. Es ist das der beste Weg. Er ist ganz
ordnungsmäßig, man kommt dabei sehr langsam, aber sehr sicher zum Ziel.«

»Jawohl, zum sichern Tode. Dahin hat er die meisten der Unsrigen
geführt. Ich fühle, daß es auch mit mir zu Ende geht. -- Junger Mann,
Sie lieben jenes fröhliche Geschöpf da drüben mit den sanften,
blauen Augen und dem Federhalter hinter dem Ohr -- ich sehe das
an Ihren schmachtenden Blicken. Sie wünschen sie zu heiraten --
aber Sie sind arm. Hier -- strecken Sie die Hand aus, hier ist der
Rindfleisch-Kontrakt! Wohlan, nehmt euch, seid glücklich! Gott segne
euch, meine Kinder!«

       *       *       *       *       *

Das ist alles, was ich von dem großen Rindfleisch-Kontrakt weiß, der
so viel Aufsehen in der Welt gemacht hat. Der Schreiber, dem ich ihn
abgetreten habe, ist gestorben. Was weiter aus dem Kontrakte und
seinen spätern Besitzern geworden ist, vermag ich nicht zu sagen. Nur
soviel weiß ich, daß, wenn jemand lange genug am Leben bleibt, um
seine Sache durch das ganze Umständlichkeitsamt in Washington hindurch
zu verfolgen, er zuletzt, nach vieler Mühe, Arbeit und Verzögerung,
das herausfinden wird, was er am ersten Tage hätte erfahren können,
wenn der Geschäftsgang im Umständlichkeitsamt so geschickt und
zweckentsprechend geregelt wäre, wie in jedem großen kaufmännischen
Institut.




Der gestohlene weiße Elefant.


I.

Die folgende merkwürdige Geschichte wurde mir von einem Manne erzählt,
den ich zufällig auf der Eisenbahn kennen lernte. Er war ein alter Herr
von mehr als siebzig Jahren, dessen gutmütiges Gesicht und aufrichtiges
Wesen jedem seiner Worte den unverkennbaren Stempel der Wahrhaftigkeit
aufdrückte. Er sagte:

Sie wissen, welche Verehrung der königliche weiße Elefant von Siam
bei der Bevölkerung jenes Landes genießt. Sie wissen, daß er den
Königen geweiht ist, daß nur Könige ihn besitzen dürfen und daß er in
einer Hinsicht selbst den Königen überlegen ist, indem er nicht bloß
geehrt, sondern auch angebetet wird. Nun gut; als sich vor fünf Jahren
Streitigkeiten über die Grenzlinie zwischen Britisch-Indien und Siam
erhoben, stellte sich alsbald heraus, daß Siam unrecht hatte. So wurde
denn die Sache rasch und zur Zufriedenheit des Vertreters von England
geregelt. Teils zum Zeichen seiner Dankbarkeit, teils auch wohl, um
jede noch etwa vorhandene Spur von Mißstimmung auf englischer Seite zu
verwischen, beabsichtigte der König von Siam der Königin Viktoria ein
Geschenk zu senden -- nach orientalischen Begriffen der einzig sichere
Weg, einen Feind zu beschwichtigen. Dieses Geschenk sollte nicht nur
ein königliches, sondern auch in jeder Beziehung einzig sein. Was
konnte sich dazu besser eignen, als ein weißer Elefant? Da ich eine
angesehene Stellung im indischen Zivildienst einnahm, ward ich der Ehre
gewürdigt, Ihrer Majestät das Geschenk zu überbringen. Man rüstete
für mich und meine Dienerschaft nebst den Wärtern des Elefanten ein
Schiff aus. Ich gelangte zur gehörigen Zeit im Hafen von New York an
und brachte meinen königlichen Schutzbefohlenen in einem prächtigen
Quartiere zu Jersey City unter. Wir mußten notgedrungen einige Zeit
rasten, bevor wir die Reise fortsetzten, denn die Kräfte des Tieres
verlangten Schonung.

Vierzehn Tage lang ging alles gut -- dann begannen meine Nöte. Der
weiße Elefant war gestohlen worden! Man hatte mich mitten in der Nacht
aufgeweckt und von dem entsetzlichen Verlust benachrichtigt. Ich war
einige Augenblicke außer mir vor Schreck und Angst; dann wurde ich
ruhiger und sammelte meine fünf Sinne. Ich sah bald, welchen Weg ich
einzuschlagen hatte -- für einen vernünftigen Menschen konnte es in
der That nur einen geben. Trotz der späten Stunde eilte ich sogleich
nach New York und ließ mich von einem Schutzmann nach dem Hauptquartier
der Geheimpolizei führen. Ich langte noch zur rechten Zeit an, gerade
als der Chef, der berühmte Inspektor Blunt, im Begriff war, nach
Hause zu gehen. Er war ein Mann von mittlerer Größe und gedrungenem
Körperbau. Schon sein Anblick flößte mir Hoffnung und Vertrauen ein.
Wenn er in tiefes Nachdenken versunken war, hatte er eine Art, die
Brauen zusammenzuziehen und sich mit dem Zeigefinger nachdenklich
auf die Stirn zu klopfen, die mich sofort überzeugte, es mit keiner
gewöhnlichen Persönlichkeit zu thun zu haben. Ich trug ihm meine Sache
vor: sie brachte ihn nicht im geringsten aus der Fassung; ja -- machte
sichtlich nicht mehr Eindruck auf seine eherne Selbstbeherrschung, als
wenn es sich um einen gestohlenen Hund handelte. Er wies mir einen Sitz
an und sagte ruhig:

»Bitte, lassen Sie mich ein wenig nachdenken.«

Indem er das sagte, setzte er sich an seinen Schreibtisch und stützte
den Kopf auf die Hand. Einige Schreiber arbeiteten am andern Ende des
Zimmers; das Kratzen ihrer Federn war das einzige Geräusch, das ich
während der nächsten sechs oder sieben Minuten hörte. Mittlerweile
blieb der Inspektor in tiefe Gedanken versunken; endlich erhob er
das Haupt, und in den festen Zügen seines Gesichts lag etwas, was
mir anzeigte, daß sein Gehirn seine Schuldigkeit gethan habe und
daß sein Plan fertig sei. Er sprach -- seine Stimme war leise und
eindringlich --:

»Kein gewöhnlicher Fall das! Jeder Schritt muß vorsichtig geschehen;
jeder Schritt muß sicher gemacht werden, bevor der nächste gewagt wird.
Und die Sache muß verschwiegen bleiben -- tiefes, unverbrüchliches
Geheimnis. Sprechen Sie mit niemand darüber, nicht einmal mit den
Reportern; ich will dafür sorgen, daß sie nur erfahren und berichten,
was meinen Zwecken dient.« Er schellte; ein Jüngling erschien.
»Alarich, sagen Sie den Reportern, sie sollen vorläufig dableiben.«
Der Jüngling verschwand. »Und nun zur Sache -- und das systematisch.
In meinem Beruf kann man es zu nichts bringen, ohne strenge und genaue
Methode.«

Er ergriff eine Feder und legte sich einen Bogen Papier zurecht. »Nun!
-- der Name des Elefanten?«

»Hassan Ben Ali Ben Selim Abdallah Mohamed Moisé Alhammal
Jamtsetjejeebhoy Dhulepp Sultan Ebu Bhudpoor.«

»Sehr gut. Rufname?«

»Jumbo.«

»Sehr gut. Geburtsort?«

»Die Hauptstadt von Siam.«

»Eltern lebend?«

»Nein -- tot.«

»Hatten sie noch andere Nachkommenschaft?«

»Nein, er war der einzige Sohn.«

»Gut! diese Personalien genügen für diese Rubrik. Und nun, bitte,
beschreiben Sie den Elefanten und lassen Sie keine Einzelheit
aus, sei sie auch noch so unbedeutend -- d. h. unbedeutend von
_Ihrem_ Gesichtspunkt aus. Für Leute meines Berufs _giebt_ es keine
unbedeutenden Einzelheiten.«

Ich _beschrieb_ und er schrieb _nieder_; als ich zu Ende war, sagte er:

»Hören Sie zu und berichtigen Sie mich, wenn ich einen Fehler gemacht
habe.«

Er las wie folgt:

»Höhe 19 Fuß; Länge von der Stirn bis zum Schwanzansatz 26 Fuß;
Länge des Rüssels 16 Fuß; Länge des Schwanzes 6 Fuß; Totallänge
einschließlich Rüssel und Schwanz 48 Fuß; Länge der Stoßzähne 9½ Fuß;
Ohren, im Verhältnis zu diesen Dimensionen; Fußspur gleicht der Spur
eines Fasses, das man im Schnee aufrecht stellt; Farbe des Elefanten
ein schmutziges Weiß; hat in jedem Ohr ein Loch von der Größe eines
Tellers zum Einhängen von Schmucksachen; besitzt in hohem Grade die
Gewohnheit, Gaffer mit Wasser zu bespritzen und mit seinem Rüssel
nicht nur Leute, mit denen er bekannt ist, sondern selbst Fremde zu
mißhandeln; hat eine Narbe unter der Achselhöhle, hinkt ein wenig auf
dem rechten Hinterbein und hatte, als er gestohlen wurde, auf dem
Rücken einen Turm mit Sitzen für fünfzehn Personen und eine Satteldecke
aus Goldbrokat von der Größe eines gewöhnlichen Teppichs.«

Das Signalement war tadellos; der Inspektor schellte, händigte Alarich
die Beschreibung ein und sagte:

»Lassen Sie sogleich fünfzigtausend Exemplare von diesem Signalement
drucken und per Bahn an alle Polizeiämter und Pfandleiher in
Nordamerika versenden.« Alarich zog sich zurück. »So, damit wären wir
fertig. Nun muß ich eine Photographie des gestohlenen Eigentums haben.«

Ich gab ihm eine; er betrachtete sie kritisch und sagte:

»Sie muß genügen, da wir keine bessere haben; aber er hat den Rüssel
aufgerollt und in den Mund gesteckt. Das ist schade, denn es kann
leicht irre führen, weil er natürlich den Rüssel für gewöhnlich nicht
so trägt.« Er schellte.

»Alarich, lassen Sie sogleich fünfzigtausend Abdrücke dieser
Photographie anfertigen und mit dem Signalement versenden.«

Alarich ging, um seine Befehle zu vollziehen. Der Inspektor sagte:

»Man wird natürlich eine Belohnung aussetzen müssen. Wie hoch meinen
Sie?«

»Welche Summe würden Sie mir raten?«

»Vorerst würde ich sagen -- nun, fünfundzwanzigtausend Dollars. Es ist
eine verwickelte und schwierige Arbeit; es giebt tausend Gelegenheiten
zum Entkommen und zum Verbergen. Diese Diebe haben überall Freunde und
Helfershelfer.« -- --

»Lieber Himmel, wissen Sie denn, wer sie sind?«

Das kluge Gesicht, geübt im Verbergen der Gedanken und Gefühle, verriet
mir nicht das mindeste, ebensowenig die vollkommen ruhig geäußerte
Erwiderung:

»Lassen Sie's gut sein! Vielleicht weiß ich's, vielleicht auch nicht.
Wir gewinnen gewöhnlich einen ziemlich deutlichen Hinweis auf die
Thäter aus der Art und Weise, wie sie zu Werk gehen und aus der Größe
ihres Raubes. Wir haben es hier nicht mit einem Taschendieb oder
Uhrenabzwicker zu thun, darauf können Sie Gift nehmen -- dieser
Gegenstand wurde von keinem Anfänger ›aufgehoben‹. Aber, was ich sagen
wollte, in Anbetracht der vielen Reisen, die gemacht werden müssen,
und des Eifers, mit dem die Diebe ihre Spuren verwischen werden,
mögen fünfundzwanzigtausend Dollars fast zu wenig sein; doch kann man
immerhin damit anfangen.«

So einigten wir uns denn über diese Summe für den Anfang. Dann sagte
der Inspektor, dem nichts entging, was nur irgendwie als Fingerzeig
dienen konnte:

»Es giebt in der Polizeigeschichte Fälle, die beweisen, daß Verbrecher
durch Eigentümlichkeiten in ihrer Geschmacksrichtung entdeckt worden
sind. Sagen Sie, was frißt Ihr Elefant, und wieviel?«

»_Was_ er frißt? -- einfach alles! Er frißt einen Menschen, er frißt
eine Bibel -- er frißt alles, was zwischen Mensch und Bibel liegt.«

»Gut, wirklich sehr gut, aber zu allgemein. Ich brauche Details --
Details haben in unserem Berufe allein Wert. Also, die Menschen
betreffend: wie viele davon wird er, wenn sie frisch sind, zu einer
Mahlzeit oder -- sagen wir -- während eines Tages verzehren?«

»Er wird keinen großen Unterschied machen, ob frisch oder nicht; und
ich denke, daß fünf Menschen eine gewöhnliche Mahlzeit für ihn sind.«

»Sehr gut -- fünf Menschen; wir wollen das notieren. Welche Rassen hat
er am liebsten?«

»In dieser Beziehung ist er nicht sehr wählerisch. Er zieht Bekannte
vor, hat aber keinerlei Voreingenommenheit gegen Fremde.«

»Sehr gut -- nun zu den Bibeln. Wie viele Bibeln würde er zu einer
Mahlzeit brauchen?«

»Eine ganze Auflage.«

»Das ist kaum genau genug. Meinen Sie die gewöhnliche Oktavbibel oder
die illustrierte Familienbibel?«

»Ich glaube nicht, daß ihm an den Illustrationen viel liegen würde --
d. h. er wird sie nicht höher schätzen als einfachen Druck.«

»Sie haben mich nicht recht verstanden. Es kommt auf das Gewicht an.
Die gewöhnliche Oktavbibel wiegt etwa zwei und ein halbes Pfund,
während die Großquartbibel mit den Illustrationen von Doré zehn
bis zwölf Pfund wiegt. Wieviel Dorébibeln würde er wohl auf einmal
verzehren?«

»Man sieht, daß Sie den Elefanten nicht kennen, sonst würden Sie nicht
fragen. Er frißt ganz einfach soviel, als man ihm giebt.«

»Gut, drücken Sie es in Dollars und Cents aus; wir müssen uns bestimmt
fassen. Die Dorébibel kostet hundert Dollars pro Exemplar, in
Juchtenleder gebunden ...«

»Er würde für etwa fünfzigtausend Dollars brauchen -- sagen wir, eine
Auflage von fünfhundert Exemplaren.«

»So, das ist genauer; ich will's notieren. Also, er frißt gerne
Menschen und Bibeln -- das hätten wir! Was frißt er sonst? Ich brauche
Details.«

»Hat er keine Bibeln, so frißt er Backsteine; hat er keine Backsteine,
so frißt er Flaschen; hat er keine Flaschen, so frißt er Kleider; hat
er keine Kleider, so frißt er Katzen; hat er keine Katzen, so frißt
er Austern; er frißt ferner Schinken, Zucker, Pasteten, Kartoffeln,
Kleie, Heu, Hafer und besonders Reis, denn damit wurde er hauptsächlich
aufgezogen, kurzum er frißt alles, was er kriegen kann.«

»Sehr gut. Gewöhnliche Menge zu einer Mahlzeit?«

»Nun, so zwischen sieben und acht Zentner.«

»Und er säuft -- --«

»Alles was flüssig ist: Milch, Wasser, Schnaps, Syrup, Kastoröl,
Kamphergeist, Karbolsäure -- es ist unnütz, auf Einzelheiten
einzugehen; was Ihnen Flüssiges einfällt, notieren Sie getrost.«

»Sehr gut. Quantität?«

»Notieren Sie acht bis fünfundzwanzig Hektoliter -- sein Durst
schwankt, sein Appetit wenig.«

»Das sind alles sehr bemerkenswerte Anhaltspunkte, und sehr dienlich zu
seiner Aufspürung.«



Er schellte.

»Alarich, senden Sie Kapitän Burns herein.«

Burns erschien; Inspektor Blunt enthüllte ihm die ganze Angelegenheit
Punkt für Punkt. Dann sagte er in der klaren, entschiedenen Weise eines
Mannes, der sich seinen Plan genau vorgezeichnet hat und ans Befehlen
gewöhnt ist:

»Kapitän Burns, weisen Sie die Detektivpolizisten Jones, Davis, Halsey,
Bates und Hackett an, den Elefanten aufzuspüren.«

»Sehr wohl, Sir.«

»Weisen Sie die Detektivpolizisten Moses, Dakin, Murphy, Rogers,
Tupper, Higgins und Bartholomey an, die Diebe aufzuspüren.«

»Sehr wohl, Sir.«

»Senden Sie eine starke Wache -- eine Wache von dreißig auserlesenen
Leuten mit einer Ablösung von dreißig Mann -- an den Ort, wo der
Elefant gestohlen wurde; sie sollen dort scharfe Wache halten Tag
und Nacht und niemand -- Reporter ausgenommen -- ohne schriftliche
Ermächtigung von mir in die Nähe kommen lassen.«

»Sehr wohl, Sir.«

»Verteilen Sie Detektivs in gewöhnlicher Kleidung auf den Bahnhöfen,
Dampfschiffen und Landungsdepots und auf allen Wegen, die aus
Jersey City führen, mit dem Befehle, alle verdächtigen Personen zu
durchsuchen.«

»Sehr wohl, Sir.«

»Versehen Sie alle diese Leute mit der Photographie und dem Signalement
des Elefanten und instruieren Sie dieselben, alle Züge und abgehenden
Fahrzeuge genau zu visitieren.«

»Sehr wohl, Sir.«

»Wenn der Elefant gefunden werden sollte, so ergreife man ihn und
benachrichtige mich telegraphisch.«

»Sehr wohl, Sir.«

»Lassen Sie mich sogleich benachrichtigen, wenn eine Spur gefunden
werden sollte -- Fußspuren oder dergleichen.«

»Sehr wohl, Sir.«

»Erlassen Sie einen Befehl an die Hafenpolizei, fleißig am Ufer zu
patroullieren.«

»Sehr wohl, Sir.«

»Senden Sie Detektivs in gewöhnlicher Kleidung mit allen Bahnzügen ab
-- nördlich bis Kanada, westlich bis Ohio, südlich bis Washington.«

»Sehr wohl, Sir.«

»Stellen Sie Sachverständige in allen Telegraphenämtern auf; dieselben
sollen auf alle Telegramme achten und sich die chiffrierten Depeschen
entziffern lassen.«

»Sehr wohl, Sir.«

»Lassen Sie dieses alles mit der äußersten Heimlichkeit ausführen --
hören Sie, mit der undurchdringlichsten Heimlichkeit.«

»Sehr wohl, Sir.«

»Rapportieren Sie mir pünktlich zur gewöhnlichen Stunde.«

»Sehr wohl, Sir.«

»Nun können Sie gehen!«

»Sehr wohl, Sir« -- und fort war er.

Inspektor Blunt war einen Augenblick still und nachdenklich, dann ließ
das Feuer in seinen Augen nach und verlosch. Hierauf wandte er sich zu
mir und sagte in ruhigem Ton:

»Ich rühme mich nicht gern, es ist das nicht meine Sache; aber wir
werden den Elefanten finden.«

Ich schüttelte ihm warm die Hand und dankte ihm -- der Dank kam von
Herzen. Je mehr ich von dem Manne gesehen hatte, desto mehr schätzte
und bewunderte ich ihn, desto mehr staunte ich über die mysteriösen
Wunder seines Berufs. Dann trennten wir uns für die Nacht und ich ging
nach Hause -- mit viel leichterem Herzen als ich gekommen war.


II.

Am nächsten Morgen stand alles haarklein in den Zeitungen, sogar mit
Zusätzen -- bestehend aus Detektiv A.'s, Detektiv B.'s und Detektiv
N. N.'s ›Theorie‹ in Bezug auf die Ausführung des Diebstahls, auf die
Person der Diebe und auf die Richtung, in der sie mit ihrer Beute
entflohen waren. Es waren elf solcher Theorien zu lesen, welche alle
Möglichkeiten erschöpften, ein Beweis, was für verständige Denker
die Geheimpolizisten sind. Nicht zwei von den elf Theorien stimmten
überein oder glichen sich auch nur halbwegs, außer in einem einzigen
auffallenden Punkt, in dem alle elf Theorien einander gleich waren.
Obgleich nämlich die Rückwand des Gebäudes herausgerissen und die
einzige Thüre verschlossen geblieben war, stellten alle elf Theorien
die Behauptung auf, daß der Elefant nicht durch jene Bresche, sondern
auf irgend einem andern (noch unentdeckten) Wege entfernt worden sei,
und daß die Diebe jene Oeffnung nur gemacht hätten, um die Polizei irre
zu führen. Daran würde ich oder irgend ein anderer Laie vielleicht nie
gedacht haben, die Detektivs aber hatten den Umstand auch nicht einen
Augenblick verkannt. So war das einzige Moment, hinter dem ich kein
Geheimnis vermutet hatte, gerade dasjenige, worin ich am weitesten
fehlgegangen war. Alle elf Theorien nannten die vermutlichen Diebe,
keine zwei aber dieselben; die Totalsumme der verdächtigen Personen war
siebenunddreißig. Die verschiedenen Zeitungen schlossen alle mit der
wichtigsten Ansicht von allen -- der des Inspektors Blunt. Dieselbe
lautete im Auszug wie folgt:

»Der Chef weiß, wer die zwei Hauptthäter sind -- nämlich Brick Duffy
und der ›rote‹ McFadden. Zehn Tage vor der Ausführung des Diebstahls
wußte er bereits, daß derselbe versucht werden würde, und hat sich
in aller Stille daran gemacht, diese zwei notorischen Spitzbuben zu
verfolgen; unglücklicherweise aber ging in der fraglichen Nacht ihre
Spur verloren, und ehe man sie wieder auffinden konnte, war der Vogel
-- das heißt der Elefant -- ausgeflogen.

»Duffy und McFadden sind die verwegensten Schurken in der ganzen
Verbrecherzunft; der Chef hat Grund zu der Annahme, daß sie die Männer
sind, die letzten Winter in einer bitterkalten Nacht den Ofen aus der
Polizeiwache stahlen, infolgedessen sich vor Tagesanbruch der Chef und
sämtliche Geheimpolizisten in ärztlicher Behandlung befanden; -- einige
wegen erfrorener Füße, andere wegen erfrorener Hände, Ohren, Nasen und
anderer Körperteile.«

Als ich die erste Hälfte dieser Theorie las, war ich mehr als je
erstaunt über den wunderbaren Scharfsinn des seltenen Mannes: er sah
nicht nur alles Gegenwärtige mit klaren Augen, auch das Zukünftige
entschleierte sich vor seinem Blicke. Ich begab mich alsbald in sein
Bureau und sagte ihm, ich bedauere nur, daß er jene Spitzbuben nicht
habe festnehmen lassen, wodurch das ganze Unheil verhütet worden wäre;
aber seine Antwort war kurz und bündig:

»Es ist nicht unseres Amtes, das Verbrechen zu verhindern, sondern es
zu bestrafen. Das können wir aber erst, nachdem es begangen worden ist.«

Ich bemerkte, daß die Heimlichkeit, mit der wir zu Werk gegangen, durch
die Zeitungen verletzt worden sei, nicht nur alle Thatsächlichkeiten,
sondern auch alle unsere Anhaltspunkte und Absichten seien enthüllt
und selbst alle verdächtigen Personen namhaft gemacht worden --
letztere würden sich jetzt ohne Zweifel maskieren oder ihre geheimen
Schlupfwinkel aufsuchen.

»Sie sollen's nur!« sagte der Inspektor. »Sie werden bald merken, daß,
wenn ich es auf sie abgesehen habe, meine Hand auf sie niederfallen
wird, so unfehlbar wie die Hand des Schicksals. Was die Zeitungen
anbelangt, so müssen wir mit ihnen rechnen: Ruhm, Reputation,
fortwährende öffentliche Erwähnung -- sind des Geheimpolizisten
täglich Brot. Er muß seine Entdeckungen veröffentlichen, sonst glaubt
man, daß er keine macht; er muß seine Theorie veröffentlichen, es
giebt nichts Seltsameres und Ueberraschenderes, als die Theorie eines
Polizisten, und nichts trägt ihm so viel Bewunderung und Hochachtung
ein; wir müssen unsere Pläne veröffentlichen, denn die Zeitungen
bestehen darauf, und wir können es ihnen nicht abschlagen, ohne sie
zu beleidigen. Wir müssen dem Publikum zeigen, was wir thun, damit es
nicht glaubt, daß wir nichts thun. Es ist viel angenehmer, wenn eine
Zeitung schreibt: ›Inspektor Blunts geniale und ungewöhnliche Theorie
lautet wie folgt,‹ als wenn sie einen unfreundlichen oder -- was noch
schlimmer -- sarkastischen Artikel bringt.«

»Ich verkenne das Zwingende dieser Gründe nicht. -- In einem Teil Ihrer
Bemerkungen in den Morgenzeitungen fiel mir auf, daß Sie mit Ihrer
Ansicht über einen gewissen untergeordneten Punkt zurückhielten.«

»Ja, das thun wir stets; es macht immer Effekt. Uebrigens hatte ich mir
über jenen Punkt eine Ansicht noch gar nicht gebildet.«

Ich deponierte bei dem Inspektor eine beträchtliche Geldsumme zur
Bestreitung der laufenden Ausgaben und setzte mich dann nieder, um auf
Nachrichten zu warten; jeden Augenblick konnten Telegramme einlaufen.
Inzwischen blätterte ich die Zeitungen und unser Zirkularsignalement
nochmals durch und entdeckte, daß anscheinend unsere 25000 Doll.
Belohnung nur für Detektivpolizisten ausgesetzt waren. Ich war der
Meinung gewesen, jeder solle sie bekommen, der den Elefanten auffinden
würde. Der Inspektor klärte mich auf:

»Meine Geheimen werden den Elefanten auffinden, die Belohnung _muß_
daher an die rechte Adresse gelangen. Wenn andere Leute das Tier
fänden, so wäre das nur dadurch möglich, daß sie die Polizisten
ausspionieren und aus Kenntnissen und Beobachtungen der Polizisten,
welche sie sich zu eigen gemacht, Vorteil ziehen; an der Berechtigung
der Polizei zu der Belohnung könnte das nichts ändern. Eine solche
Belohnung ist dazu da, die Männer, welche dieser Art von Arbeit ihre
Zeit und ihren ausgebildeten Scharfsinn widmen, anzuspornen, nicht
aber dem ersten besten in den Schoß zu fallen, der zufällig einen Fang
gemacht hat.«

Das war sicher nur recht und billig. Auf einmal begann der
Telegraphenapparat in der Ecke zu ticken, das Resultat war folgende
Depesche:

            »=Flower-Station=, New York: 7.30 Vorm.

    Habe eine Spur. Fand eine Reihe tiefer Spuren, die über eine
    benachbarte Farm führen. Folgte ihnen eine halbe Stunde
    östlich ohne Resultat; der Elefant ging wahrscheinlich
    westlich. Werde ihm jetzt in jener Richtung nachspüren.

            Darley, Detektiv.«

»Darley ist einer unserer tüchtigsten Polizisten,« sagte der Inspektor.
»Wir werden bald mehr von ihm hören.«



Telegramm Nr. 2 kam.

            »=Barkers=, New Jersey: 7.40 Vorm.

    Eben angekommen. Glasfabrik hier während der Nacht erbrochen
    und 800 Flaschen entwendet. Wasser in größerer Menge erst fünf
    Meilen von hier zu haben. Werde dahin aufbrechen. Elefant
    wahrscheinlich durstig. Flaschen waren leer.

            Baker, Detektiv.«

»Auch das ist vielversprechend,« sagte der Inspektor. »Ich sagte Ihnen,
seine Begierden würden keine schlechten Fingerzeige sein.«

Weitere Telegramme:

            »=Taylorville=, Long Island: 8.15 Vorm.

    Ein Heuschober in der Nähe verschwand während der Nacht --
    wahrscheinlich aufgefressen. Fand eine Spur und verfolge sie
    eilig.

            Hubbard, Detektiv.«

»Was er für Sprünge macht!« sagte der Inspektor. »Ich wußte, daß wir
ein schwieriges Stück Arbeit vor uns hätten; aber wir werden ihn
deshalb doch kriegen.«

            »=Flower-Station=, New York: 9 Vorm.

    Verfolgte die Spuren über eine Stunde westlich -- sind groß,
    tief und ausgezackt. Bin eben einem Farmer begegnet, der sagte,
    es seien keine Elefantenfußstapfen; sagt, es seien Löcher von
    den Bäumchen, die er letzten Winter aus dem gefrorenen Grunde
    ausgrub. Ich bitte um Verhaltungsbefehle bezüglich weiterer
    Schritte.

            Darley, Detektiv.«

»Aha, ein Helfershelfer der Diebe! Die Sache wird ernst!« sagte der
Inspektor und diktierte folgendes Telegramm an Darley:

    »Verhaften Sie den Mann und zwingen Sie ihn, seine Komplizen
    zu nennen. Verfolgen Sie die Spuren weiter -- bis zum Stillen
    Ozean, wenn's sein muß.

            Inspektor Blunt.«

Nächstes Telegramm:

            »=Coney-Point=, Pennsylvania: 8.45 Vorm.

    Bureau der Gasanstalt hier während der Nacht erbrochen und die
    unbezahlten Gasrechnungen von drei Monaten gestohlen. Fand eine
    Spur und verfolge sie.

            Murphy, Detektiv.«

»Himmel!« rief der Inspektor; »sollte er Gasrechnungen verzehren?«

»Wahrscheinlich aus Dummheit.« --

Darauf kam nachstehendes aufregendes Telegramm:

            »=Ironville=, New York: 9.30 Vorm.

    Soeben angekommen. Stadt in Aufregung. Elefant kam hier durch,
    früh 5 Uhr. Einige sagen, er ging östlich, andere sagen
    westlich, einige nördlich, andere südlich -- keiner aber
    weiß etwas Genaueres zu berichten. Er tötete ein Pferd; ich
    verschaffte mir ein Stück davon -- für alle Fälle. Tötete es
    mit seinem Rüssel; schließe aus der Wunde, daß er von links
    schlug. Aus der Lage des Pferdes schließe, daß der Elefant
    nordwärts, die Berkley-Bahn entlang, reiste. Hat 4½ Stunden
    Vorsprung; folge aber sogleich seiner Spur.

            Hawes, Detektiv.«

Ich konnte meine Freude nicht zurückhalten. Der Inspektor blieb so
ruhig wie eine Statue. Er schellte gelassen.

»Alarich, senden Sie Kapitän Burns zu mir.«

Burns erschien.

»Wieviel Mann sind reisefertig?«

»Sechsundneunzig, Sir.«

»Senden Sie dieselben sogleich nach Norden; sie sollen sich längs der
Berkley-Bahnlinie nördlich von Ironville konzentrieren.«

»Sehr wohl, Sir.«

»Sie sollen ihre Bewegungen mit der äußersten Heimlichkeit ausführen.
Sobald andere von den Leuten frei werden, sollen sie sich fertig
machen!«

»Sehr wohl, Sir.«

»Sie können gehen.«

»Sehr wohl, Sir.«

Gleich darauf kam ein weiteres Telegramm:

            »=Sage-Corners=, New York: 10.30 Vorm.

    Eben angelangt. Elefant kam 8.15 hier durch. Alle bis auf einen
    Polizisten entkamen aus der Stadt. Elefant wollte anscheinend
    nicht nach dem Polizisten, sondern nach einem Laternenpfahl
    schlagen, traf aber beide. Verschaffte mir ein Stück von dem
    Polizisten, um es für alle Fälle zu behalten.

            Stumm, Detektiv.«

»Der Elefant hat sich also gegen Westen gewendet,« sagte der Inspektor.
»Es wird ihm aber nichts helfen, denn meine Leute sind über die ganze
Gegend zerstreut.«

Das nächste Telegramm besagte:

            »=Glovers=: 11.15.

    Eben angelangt. Stadt verlassen, ausgenommen von Kranken
    und Greisen. Elefant kam durch vor dreiviertel Stunden.
    Die Anti-Mäßigkeits-Massen-Versammlung tagte; er steckte
    seinen Rüssel durchs Fenster hinein und spritzte alles voll
    Zisternenwasser. Einige schluckten das Wasser -- starben
    seitdem; mehrere ertranken. Detektivs Croß und O'Shaugnessy
    passierten die Stadt, gingen aber südlich und verfehlten so
    den Elefanten. Ganze Gegend auf viele Stunden im Umkreis voll
    Entsetzen -- Leute fliehen aus ihrer Heimat. Allenthalben
    stoßen sie auf den Elefanten; viele werden getötet.

            Brant, Detektiv.«

Ich hielt kaum meine Thränen zurück, so traurig stimmte mich dieses
Gemetzel, der Inspektor aber sagte nur:

»Sie sehen, wir umringen ihn. Er fühlt unsere Nähe; er hat sich wieder
gegen Osten gewendet.«

Es harrten unserer bereits neue beängstigende Nachrichten. Der
Telegraph meldete:

            »=Hoganport=: 12.19 Nachm.

    Eben angelangt. Elefant kam vor einer halben Stunde hier durch,
    jähen Schrecken verbreitend; wütete durch die Straßen; zwei
    Arbeiter gingen vorüber -- tötete den einen, der andere entkam.
    Bedauern allgemein.

            O'Flaherty, Detektiv.«

»Nun ist er mitten unter meinen Leuten,« sagte der Inspektor. »Jetzt
ist kein Entrinnen für ihn möglich!«

Eine Anzahl anderer Telegramme lief dazwischen ein von Detektivs, die
über New Jersey und Pennsylvanien zerstreut waren. Aus zerstörten
Fabriken, Scheunen und Sonntagsschulbibliotheken wiesen sie die Spur
des Elefanten mit an Sicherheit grenzenden Ausdrücken nach.

Der Inspektor sagte:

»Ich wollte, ich könnte mit ihnen verkehren und sie nach Norden
dirigieren, aber das ist unmöglich. Ein ›Geheimer‹ geht nur dann zum
Telegraphenamt, wenn er seinen Bericht absendet; man weiß nie, wo man
ihn fassen kann.«

Nun kam folgende Depesche:

            »=Bridgeport=, Connecticut: 12.15 Nachm.

    Barnum[2] bietet Doll. 4000 jährlich für ausschließliches
    Recht, Elefant als wandernde Reklame zu benützen, von jetzt an
    bis ihn Detektivs auffinden. Will Zirkusplakate auf ihn kleben.
    Verlangt umgehende Antwort.

            Boggs, Detektiv.«

    [2] Barnum, der bekannte Schaubudenbesitzer und Meister in der
        Kunst der Reklame.

»Das ist doch zu lächerlich!« rief ich aus.

»Ja freilich,« sagte der Inspektor. »Herr Barnum, der sich für so
gewitzigt hält, kennt mich offenbar nicht -- aber ich kenne ihn.«

Dann diktierte er folgende Antwortdepesche:

    »Herrn Barnums Anerbieten abgelehnt. Entweder Doll. 7000 oder
    nichts.

            Inspektor Blunt.«

»So. Wir werden nicht lange auf Antwort zu warten brauchen. Herr Barnum
ist nicht zu Hause; er ist gewöhnlich auf dem Telegraphenamt, wenn es
einen Handel gilt. Vor drei Uhr --«

    »Abgemacht. -- P. T. Barnum.«

So unterbrach der tickende Telegraphenapparat. Ehe ich mir einen Vers
machen konnte auf diesen ungewöhnlichen Zwischenfall, leitete folgende
Depesche meine Gedanken in ein anderes und sehr betrübendes Fahrwasser:

            »=Bolivia=, New York: 12.50 Nachm.

    Elefant kam hier an aus dem Süden und passierte den Wald um
    11.50, er sprengte einen daherkommenden Leichenzug auseinander
    und verminderte die Leidtragenden um zwei. Bürger feuerten
    einige Schüsse aus einem kleinen Böller auf ihn ab und flohen
    dann. Detektiv Burke und ich langten zehn Minuten später aus
    dem Norden an, hielten aber ein paar Vertiefungen fälschlich
    für Fußstapfen und verloren so ziemlich viel Zeit; endlich
    aber kamen wir auf die rechte Spur und verfolgten sie bis zu
    den Wäldern. Wir krochen nun auf Händen und Knieen vorwärts,
    verfolgten die Spur mit scharfem Auge und gelangten so ins
    Gebüsch. Burke war voraus. Unglücklicherweise hatte das Tier
    angehalten, um auszuruhen; Burke, der, auf die Spur erpicht,
    die Augen auf den Boden geheftet hatte, stieß plötzlich, ehe er
    die Nähe des Elefanten gewahr wurde, gegen dessen Hinterbeine.
    Burke sprang sogleich auf die Füße, ergriff den Schwanz und
    rief freudig aus: ›ich beanspruche die Be -- --‹, kam aber
    nicht weiter, denn ein einziger Schlag mit dem mächtigen Rüssel
    streckte den braven Burschen tot nieder. Ich floh zurück,
    aber der Elefant wandte sich um und verfolgte mich bis an den
    Rand des Gehölzes in schrecklicher Eile; ich wäre unrettbar
    verloren gewesen, wenn nicht zufällig der Rest des Leichenzuges
    dem Tiere in den Weg gekommen wäre und seine Aufmerksamkeit
    abgelenkt hätte. Erfahre soeben, daß von jenem Leichenzug
    nichts mehr vorhanden ist; schadet nichts, Stoff genug für
    andere vorhanden. Elefant mittlerweile wieder verschwunden.

            Mulrooney, Detektiv.«

Wir hörten keine weiteren Neuigkeiten außer von den eifrigen und
zuversichtlichen Detektivs, die über New Jersey, Pennsylvanien,
Delaware und Virginia zerstreut waren -- sie folgten alle frischen und
vielversprechenden Spuren -- bis kurz nach 2 Uhr nachmittags folgendes
Telegramm ankam:

            »=Baxter-Centre=: 2.15 Nachm.

    Elefant hier gewesen, über und über mit Zirkusplakaten beklebt;
    zerstreute ein Methodisten-Revivalmeeting[3] und erschlug und
    verletzte viele, die eben im Begriffe waren, ein besseres
    Leben anzufangen. Bürger pferchten ihn ein und stellten eine
    Wache auf. Als Detektiv Brown und ich ankamen, betraten wir
    die Umzäunung und schritten zur Feststellung der Identität des
    Elefanten an der Hand der Photographie und des Signalements.
    Alle Zeichen stimmten genau, ausgenommen eines, das wir nicht
    sehen konnten -- die Narbe unter der Achselhöhle. Um sich
    darüber zu vergewissern, kroch Brown unter das Tier, -- er
    lag im nächsten Augenblick mit zerschmetterter Hirnschale am
    Boden. Alle flohen, so auch der Elefant, der mit viel Effekt
    nach rechts und links um sich schlug. Entkam, ließ aber starke
    Blutspuren von Böllerschußwunden zurück. Wiederauffindung
    gewiß. Brach südwärts durch einen dichten Wald; ich ihm
    unverzüglich nach.

            Brent, Detektiv.«

    [3] Religiöse Versammlung von Wanderpredigern, meist auf
        offenem Felde abgehalten.



Dies war das letzte Telegramm. Gegen Abend sank ein Nebel auf alles
herab -- so dicht, daß man auf drei Schritte Entfernung nicht das
geringste unterscheiden konnte. Er hielt die ganze Nacht über an. Die
Dampfboote und selbst die Omnibusse mußten ihre Fahrt einstellen.


III.

Am nächsten Morgen waren die Zeitungen ebenso voll von Theorien wie am
vorhergehenden; sie brachten ausführlich alle uns bekannten tragischen
Ereignisse, dazu noch eine Menge weiterer telegraphischer Berichte,
die sie von ihren Korrespondenten erhalten hatten. Spalte auf Spalte
begegnete ich herzzerreißenden Artikelüberschriften. Der Grundton
derselben war stets derselbe; etwa wie folgt:

»_Der weiße Elefant ist los! Er schreitet weiter auf seinem
verhängnisvollen Marsche! Ganze Ortschaften verlassen von den
entsetzten Einwohnern! Furcht und Schrecken gehen vor ihm her, Tod und
Verwüstung folgen ihm. Diesen nach die Detektivs. Scheunen verwüstet.
Werkstätten beraubt. Ernten verzehrt. Oeffentliche Versammlungen
gesprengt, begleitet von Blutscenen, die nicht zu beschreiben sind!
Berichte von vierunddreißig der ausgezeichnetsten Detektivpolizisten!
Bericht des Inspektors Blunt!_«

»Ah!« rief Inspektor Blunt, der Erregung nahe; »das ist prächtig!
Das ist die größte Leistung, die je eine polizeiliche Organisation
vollbracht hat. Die Welt wird davon sprechen.«

Für mich aber gab es keine Freude; mir war zu Mute, als ob ich
alle diese blutigen Verbrechen begangen hätte und der Elefant mein
unverantwortliches Werkzeug wäre. Und wie die Unfallliste angewachsen
war! In einem Orte hatte er sich in »eine Wahl gemischt und fünf
Agitatoren getötet.« Er hatte dieser That die Vernichtung zweier
armer Teufel folgen lassen -- armer O'Donohue, armer Mc Flannigan! --
die »erst am Tage vorher in der Heimat der Unterdrückten aller Länder
eine Zuflucht gefunden hatten und im Begriffe waren, zum erstenmale
das kostbare Recht amerikanischer Bürger an der Urne auszuüben,
als sie niedergeschmettert wurden von der mitleidslosen Hand der
Geißel Siams.« An einem anderen Orte hatte er »einen verrückten
Sensationsprediger niedergerannt, der eben für die nächste Saison
seine heroischen Angriffe auf den Tanz, das Theater und ähnliches
Teufelswerk vorbereitete.« In einem dritten Orte hatte er »einen
Blitzableiteragenten erschlagen.« Und so ging die Liste weiter und
wurde immer blutiger und herzzerreißender. Sechzig Personen hatte
er getötet, zweihundertundvierzig verwundet. Alle Berichte legten
vollgültiges Zeugnis ab von der Thätigkeit und dem hingebenden
Eifer der Detektivs, und alle schlossen mit der Bemerkung, daß
»dreimalhunderttausend Bürger und vier Detektivs das schreckliche Wesen
sahen, sowie daß er zwei von letzteren ums Leben brachte.«

Nur mit Angst hörte ich von neuem das Ticken des Telegraphenapparates;
es regnete förmlich Depeschen, aber glücklicherweise rechtfertigte ihr
Inhalt meine Befürchtungen nicht. Es stellte sich bald heraus, daß jede
Spur des Elefanten verloren war: der Nebel hatte es ihm ermöglicht,
sich unbemerkt ein gutes Versteck zu suchen. Telegramme von Punkten,
die lächerlich weit entfernt waren, berichteten, daß man zu der und
der Stunde eine ungeheure trübe Masse durch den Nebel habe schimmern
sehen! es sei das »unzweifelhaft der Elefant gewesen!« Diese trübe
ungeheure Masse hatte man in New Haven, in New Jersey, in Pennsylvania,
im Staate New York, in Brooklyn und sogar in der City von New York
selbst gesehen! Immer aber war die trübe ungeheure Masse rasch wieder
verschwunden, ohne eine Spur zu hinterlassen. Jeder von den Hunderten
über diese ungeheure Landstrecke zerstreuten Detektivs sandte
stündlich seinen Rapport, und jeder hatte eine Spur, verfolgte sie und
war dem Elefanten dicht auf den Fersen.

Aber der Tag verging ohne weiteres Resultat. Ebenso der nächste Tag.
Der dritte desgleichen.

Die Zeitungsberichte mit ihren nichtssagenden Thatsachen, ihren Spuren,
die zu nichts führten, und ihren blendenden, sinnverwirrenden Theorien
fingen an langweilig zu werden.

Auf den Rat des Inspektors verdoppelte ich die Belohnung.

Vier weitere eintönige Tage folgten; dann kam ein schwerer Schlag für
die armen geplagten Detektivs -- die Zeitungen lehnten es ab, ihre
Konjekturen zu drucken, und sagten kühl: Laßt uns in Ruhe.

Vierzehn Tage nach dem Verschwinden des Elefanten erhöhte ich auf des
Inspektors Rat die Belohnung auf 75000 Dollars. Es war das eine große
Summe; aber ich wollte lieber mein ganzes Vermögen opfern, als mein
Ansehen bei der Regierung einbüßen. Jetzt, da die Detektivs in Nöten
waren, begannen die Zeitungen über sie herzufallen und die beißendsten
Sarkasmen gegen sie zu schleudern. Das war Futter für die Bänkelsänger!
Sie kostümierten sich als Detektivs, und führten auf der Bühne die Jagd
nach dem verlorenen Elefanten auf. Die Karikaturenzeichner entwarfen
Skizzen von Detektivs, die das Land mit Feldstechern absuchten, während
der Elefant hinter ihrem Rücken ihnen Aepfel aus den Taschen holte, und
machten das Wappenzeichen der Detektivs -- ein weitgeöffnetes Auge mit
der Devise: »_Wir schlafen nie_« -- auf alle mögliche Weise lächerlich.
Die Luft war geschwängert mit Sarkasmen.

Aber einen Mann gab es, der bei alledem ruhig, gelassen und
unerschüttert blieb -- es war jenes eichenfeste Herz, der Inspektor
Blunt. Sein kühnes Auge senkte sich nie, seine heitere Zuversicht
wankte nie; er wiederholte nur:

»Laßt sie spotten; wer zuletzt lacht, lacht am besten.«

Meine Bewunderung für den Mann grenzte an Vergötterung. Ich war
stets an seiner Seite. Sein Bureau war ein qualvoller Aufenthalt für
mich geworden und wurde es täglich mehr; doch solange er es dort
aushalten konnte, war auch ich entschlossen zu bleiben -- solang als
irgend möglich. So kam ich denn regelmäßig und blieb -- zu jedermanns
Verwunderung. Es war mir oft, als müsse ich davonlaufen; wenn ich dann
aber in jenes ruhige und anscheinend leidenschaftslose Antlitz blickte,
hielt ich wieder stand.

Etwa drei Wochen nach dem Verschwinden des Elefanten war ich eines
Morgens eben im Begriff zu sagen: ich werde die Segel streichen und
mich zurückziehen müssen, als der große Detektiv diesen feigen Gedanken
wieder zurückscheuchte, indem er einen neuen meisterhaften Schachzug
vorschlug -- nämlich, mit den Dieben einen Kompromiß zu schließen.
Die Fruchtbarkeit der Erfindungsgabe dieses Mannes überstiegen alles,
was ich je erlebt, und das will etwas sagen, war ich doch mit den
auserlesensten Geistern der Welt in Berührung gekommen. Er sagte, er
sei der besten Zuversicht, daß er für 100000 Dollars einen Kompromiß
schließen und den Elefanten wieder erlangen könne. Ich sagte, ich würde
am Ende die Summe auftreiben können; aber was sollte mit den armen
Detektivs werden, die so wacker gearbeitet hatten?

Er entgegnete:

»Bei Kompromissen bekommen sie stets die Hälfte.«

Das beseitigte meinen einzigen Einwand, und so schrieb denn der
Inspektor zwei Noten wie folgt:

    »Werte Frau, -- Ihr Gatte kann sich viel Geld machen (und das
    ganz ohne Gefahr vor dem Strafgesetz), wenn er sich sogleich
    bei mir einfinden will.

            Chef Blunt.«

Von diesen beiden Noten sandte er die eine durch seinen vertrauten
Boten an die ›wohlgeborene Frau‹ Brick Duffys, die andere an die
›wohlgeborene Frau‹ des roten McFadden.

Innerhalb einer Stunde kamen folgende beiliegende Antworten zurück.

    »Sie alter Narr! Brick Duffy ist gestorben, schon vor zwei
    Jahren.

            Bridget Mahoney.«

    »Chef-Nachteule, -- der rote McFadden ist gehangen und im
    Himmel seit achtzehn Monaten. Jeder Esel außer einem Detektiv
    weiß das.

            Mary O'Hooligan.«

»Ich hatte das lange vermutet,« sagte der Inspektor; »es beweist mir
nur die nie irrende Schärfe meines Instinkts.«

Sobald ein Mittel sich als erfolglos erwies, war er nie um ein anderes
verlegen. Er schrieb sogleich ein Inserat für die Morgenblätter, von
dem ich eine Abschrift aufbewahre --

»A. -- xwblv. 142 N. Tjnd -- fz 328 wmlg. Ozpo, --; 2 m! ogw. Mum.«

»Lebt der Dieb noch,« erklärte mir der Inspektor, »so wird ihn das
sicher an den gewöhnlichen Rendezvousplatz bringen.« Es sei dies ein
Platz, wo alle geschäftlichen Angelegenheiten zwischen Detektivs und
Verbrechern abgemacht werden. Die gesuchte Begegnung solle in der
nächsten Nacht um zwölf Uhr stattfinden. Bis dahin war nichts zu thun;
ich verließ also ohne Verzug und dankbaren Herzens das Bureau.

Um elf Uhr in der nächsten Nacht legte ich 100000 Dollars in die
Hände des Inspektors, und gleich darauf verabschiedete er sich,
die heldenmütige alte ungetrübte Zuversicht in seinen Augen. Eine
fast unerträglich lange Stunde schlich zu Ende, da hörte ich seinen
willkommenen Tritt, erhob mich keuchend und wankte ihm entgegen. Wie
seine schönen Augen im Triumph glänzten! Er sagte --:

»Wir haben einen Vergleich geschlossen! Die Spötter werden morgen ein
anderes Lied singen! Folgen Sie mir!«

Er ergriff eine brennende Kerze und schritt voran, hinab in das
ungeheure gewölbte Erdgeschoß, wo fortwährend sechzig Detektivs
schliefen und wo jetzt etwa zwanzig Karten spielten, um sich die Zeit
zu vertreiben. Ich folgte ihm auf den Fersen. Er schritt rasch hinab an
das düstere, ferne Ende des Platzes, und in dem Augenblick, da ich in
der dicken Stickluft ohnmächtig umsank, strauchelte und fiel er über
die ausgestreckten Gliedmaßen eines mächtigen Körpers, und ich hörte
ihn gerade noch beim Hinfallen ausrufen:

»Unser edler Beruf ist gerechtfertigt. Hier ist Ihr Elefant!«

Ich wurde in das Bureau hinaufgetragen und mit Karbolsäure wieder
zum Bewußtsein gebracht. Die ganze Detektivmannschaft schwärmte
herein, und es folgte eine Siegesfeier, wie ich noch keine erlebt
hatte. Die Reporter wurden geholt, der Champagner floß in Strömen,
Toaste wurden ausgebracht, die Händedrücke und Beglückwünschungen
waren enthusiastisch und wollten kein Ende nehmen. Der Chef war
natürlich der Held des Tages, und sein Glück war so vollständig und
es war mit so viel Ausdauer, Würde und Bravour verdient worden, daß
es mich beglückte, Zeuge desselben zu sein, obgleich ich dastand als
ein heimatloser Bettler; -- denn mein unschätzbarer Schutzbefohlener
war _tot_ und ich meiner Stellung im Dienste meines Vaterlandes
verlustig, weil ich unmöglich den übeln Schein, als habe ich das in
mich gesetzte hohe Vertrauen durch eine sorglose Ausführung meines
Auftrags getäuscht, von mir abzuwenden vermochte. Manches beredte Auge
bezeugte seine hohe Bewunderung für den Chef, und manches Detektivs
Stimme murmelte: »Seht ihn an, den König der Profession -- gebt ihm nur
die Spur von einer Spur, -- und es bleibt nichts vor ihm verborgen.«
Die Teilung der 50000 Dollars machte viel Vergnügen; als sie vollzogen
war, hielt der Chef, während er seinen Anteil in die Tasche steckte,
eine kleine Rede, in der er sagte: »Genießt das Geld, denn ihr habt
es verdient; und mehr als das -- ihr habt unserem schönen Berufe
unsterblichen Ruhm erworben.«

Ein Telegramm langte an, folgenden Inhalts: --

            »=Monroe, Michigan=: 10. -- Nachm.

    Zum erstenmal seit drei Wochen erreichte ich eben ein
    Telegraphenamt. Folgte jenen Fußstapfen zu Pferde durch die
    Wälder, etwa zweihundert Meilen bis hieher; sie werden täglich
    stärker, größer und frischer. Quälen Sie sich nicht unnötig ab
    -- ehe acht Tage verflossen sind, habe ich den Elefanten -- auf
    mein Wort!

            Darley, Detektiv.«

Der Chef brachte drei Hochrufe aus auf »Darley, einen der feinsten
Köpfe unter der Mannschaft,« in welche sämtliche Anwesende begeistert
einstimmten; dann ließ er an Darley telegraphieren, er möge heimkehren
und seinen Anteil an der Belohnung in Empfang nehmen.

       *       *       *       *       *

So endete jene wunderbare Episode von dem gestohlenen Elefanten.
Die Zeitungen waren am nächsten Tage wieder voll Anerkennung -- mit
einer nichtssagenden Ausnahme. Ein Blatt schrieb nämlich: »Groß ist
der Detektiv! Er mag im Auffinden eines kleinen Gegenstandes, wie
es ein verlorener Elefant ist, ein wenig langsam sein -- er mag ihn
drei Wochen lang den ganzen Tag verfolgen und des Nachts neben seinem
verwesenden Kadaver schlafen, aber er wird ihn endlich finden, --
sobald er nur den Mann, der den Elefanten verloren hat, dahin bringt,
ihm den Platz zu zeigen.«

Der arme Hassan war auf ewig für mich verloren. Die Böllerschüsse
hatten ihn tödlich verwundet. Er war im Nebel an jenen düsteren Platz
gekrochen; und dort, umgeben von seinen Feinden und fortwährend in
Gefahr entdeckt zu werden, war er dahingeschwunden vor Hunger und
Leiden, bis der Tod ihn erlöste.

Der Kompromiß kostete mich 100000 Dollars; meine Auslagen für die
Detektivs betrugen weitere 42000 Dollars; ich bewarb mich nie wieder
um eine Anstellung im Dienste meiner Regierung; ich bin ein ruinierter
Mann und ein unstäter Wanderer auf Erden -- aber meine Bewunderung für
jenen Mann, den ich für den größten Geheimpolizisten halte, welchen die
Welt hervorgebracht hat, bleibt unvermindert bis auf diesen Tag und
wird so bleiben bis an mein seliges Ende.

       *       *       *       *       *

    [Der Verleger kann nicht umhin, zur Ehrenrettung der
    Geheimpolizisten auf die genialen Thaten derselben, wie sie in
    den _Kriminal- und Detektivromanen_ von _Green_, _Hawthorne_,
    _Lynch_ und _Doyle_ zum glänzenden Ausdruck kommen, zu
    verweisen.]




Die Geschichte des Hausierers.


Der arme, melancholisch blickende Fremde! Es lag etwas in seiner
demütigen Miene, seinem müden Blick, seinen abgeschabten, ehemals
feinen Kleidern, das mein Mitleid erregte. Ich bemerkte eine Mappe
unter seinem Arm, wie sie Kolporteure und Hausierer zu tragen pflegen.

Nun, diese Leute flößen einem stets Interesse ein. Bevor ich mich
dessen versah, war ich -- ganz Ohr und Teilnahme -- im Anhören seiner
Lebensgeschichte versunken. Sie lautete ungefähr wie folgt:

»Meine Eltern starben, als ich noch ein kleines, unschuldiges Kind war.
Mein Onkel Ithuriel gewann mich lieb und nahm mich an Kindesstatt an.
Er war mein einziger Verwandter in der weiten Welt; er war so gut und
großmütig und dabei reich. Er erzog mich im Schoß des Ueberflusses.
Alle meine Wünsche, die mit Geld zu befriedigen waren, wurden erfüllt.

»Nachdem ich auf der Universität studiert, ging ich mit zweien meiner
Diener -- meinem Kammerdiener und meinem Lakai -- auf Reisen in fremde
Länder. Vier Jahre lang flatterte ich auf sorglosen Schwingen in den
prächtigen Gefilden der Fremde umher, -- wenn Sie diese Sprache ihrem
ergebenen Diener gestatten wollen, dessen Zunge stets poetisch gestimmt
war; ja ich darf kühnlich also zu Ihnen sprechen, denn Ihre Augen
verraten mir, daß auch in Ihren Adern das Feuer der holden Poesie
glüht. In jenen fernen Landen schwelgte ich in der ambrosischen Speise,
welche der Seele, dem Geiste, dem Herzen frommt. Was aber vor allen
Dingen und am kräftigsten an meinen angeborenen ästhetischen Geschmack
appellierte, war der dort unter den Reichen herrschende Brauch,
Sammlungen von eleganten und kostbaren Seltenheiten und hübschen
Liebhabereien anzulegen; und in einer verhängnisvollen Stunde versuchte
ich es, in meinem Onkel Ithuriel Gefallen an dieser ausgezeichneten
Beschäftigung zu erwecken.



»Ich schrieb und erzählte ihm von der äußerst umfangreichen
Muschelsammlung eines Herrn, von eines andern ausgezeichneter Sammlung
von Meerschaumpfeifen, von eines dritten wunderbarer Sammlung von
unentzifferbaren Autographen, eines vierten unschätzbarer Sammlung von
chinesischem Porzellan, eines fünften bezaubernder Briefmarkensammlung
-- und so weiter und so weiter. Bald trugen meine Briefe Frucht: mein
Onkel begann sich nach dem Gegenstand für eine Sammlung umzusehen. Sie
wissen wohl, wie leidenschaftlich bald die Pflege einer Liebhaberei
wird; die seinige wurde bald ein rasendes Fieber. Er begann sein großes
Schweinegeschäft zu vernachlässigen; bald darauf zog er sich ganz von
demselben zurück, und aus einem bequemen Lebemann wurde ein toller
Raritätenjäger. Sein Reichtum war ungeheuer, und er sparte ihn nicht.
Zuerst versuchte er es mit Kuhglocken. Er legte eine Sammlung an, die
fünf große Säle füllte und alle Arten von solchen Glocken, von der
Urzeit bis zur Gegenwart, in sich schloß -- bis auf _eine_. Diese eine
-- eine Antike und das einzige noch vorhandene Exemplar dieser Art
-- war im Besitz eines andern Sammlers, dem mein Onkel enorme Summen
dafür bot -- vergebens. Sie können sich denken, was notwendigerweise
folgte. Ein wahrer Sammler legt bekanntlich einer Sammlung, die nicht
vollständig ist, nicht den mindesten Wert bei: sein glühendes Herz
erkaltet, er verkauft seinen Schatz und wendet seinen Sinn einem andern
Gebiet zu, das unausgebeutet zu sein scheint.

»So machte es auch mein Onkel. Er versuchte es dann mit Ziegelsteinen.
Nachdem er eine umfangreiche und äußerst interessante Sammlung davon
angelegt hatte, stellte sich die alte Schwierigkeit ein. Mit blutendem
Herzen verkaufte er seine abgöttisch geliebte Sammlung an einen
früheren Bierbrauer, der den fehlenden Ziegel besaß. Dann versuchte
er es mit steinernen Aexten und anderen Geräten des urweltlichen
Menschen, entdeckte aber bald, daß die Fabrik, wo sie gemacht wurden,
andere Sammler ebensowohl versorgte wie ihn selbst. Er versuchte es
mit aztekischen Inschriften und ausgestopften Walfischen -- wieder
ein Mißerfolg, nach unglücklichen Mühen und Kosten. Denn als seine
Sammlung endlich vollständig schien, kam ein ausgestopfter Walfisch
aus Grönland und eine aztekische Inschrift aus der Cundurangogegend in
Mittelamerika an, die alle früheren Exemplare gänzlich in den Schatten
stellten. Mein Onkel beeilte sich, diese edlen Kleinodien für sich zu
gewinnen: er bekam den ausgestopften Walfisch, ein anderer Sammler
aber die Inschrift. Eine echte Cundurango aber ist, wie Sie vielleicht
wissen, ein Besitz von so köstlichem Wert, daß ein Sammler, wenn er sie
einmal erlangt hat, eher von seiner Familie sich trennt, als von ihr.
So verkaufte denn mein Onkel aus; er sah seine Lieblinge scheiden auf
Nimmerwiedersehen und sein kohlschwarzes Haar wurde weiß wie Schnee in
einer einzigen Nacht.

»Nun wartete er und überlegte; er wußte, daß eine weitere Enttäuschung
ihm das Leben kosten könnte. Er war entschlossen, das nächstemal Dinge
zu wählen, bei welchen die Konkurrenz weniger zu fürchten war. Er
überlegte lange und reiflich; dann machte er sich noch einmal ans Werk
-- diesmal, um eine Sammlung von Echos zu gewinnen.«

»Von was?« rief ich erstaunt.

»Von Echos, mein Herr. Sein erster Kauf war ein Echo in Georgia,
das viermal wiederhallte, sein nächster ein sechsfaches Echo in
Maryland, sein nächster ein dreizehnfaches in Maine, sein nächster ein
neunfaches in Kansas, sein nächster ein zwölffaches Echo in Tennessee,
das er billig bekam, weil es sozusagen baufällig war, denn ein Teil
des Felsens, der es zurückwarf, war herabgefallen. Er glaubte es
mit einem Aufwand von einigen Tausend Dollars reparieren lassen und
durch Aufmauerung des Felsens die Repetierfähigkeit verdreifachen
zu können; aber der Architekt, der die Arbeit übernahm, hatte nie
zuvor ein Echo gebaut, und so verdarb er es denn gänzlich. Bevor er
es verpfuschte, antwortete es wie ein keifendes Marktweib, nachher
aber taugte es höchstens noch für ein Taubstummenasyl. Nun, nächstdem
kaufte er eine Partie kleiner doppelläufiger Echos in verschiedenen
Staaten und Territorien; man gewährte ihm 20% Rabatt, weil er die ganze
Partie nahm. Dann kaufte er ein Echo, das wie eine Kruppsche Kanone
knallte; es kostete ein Heidengeld, das kann ich Ihnen sagen. Sie
müssen nämlich wissen, daß auf dem Echomarkt die Preisskala ansteigt
wie die Karatskala bei den Diamanten; im Handel gelten auch dieselben
Ausdrücke für das eine wie das andere. Ein einkarätiges Echo ist nur
zehn Dollars über den Preis des Grundes und Bodens, auf dem es ruht,
wert, ein zweikarätiges oder doppelläufiges Echo ist dreißig Dollars
darüber wert, ein fünfkarätiges über neunhundert, ein zehnkarätiges
dreizehntausend Dollars. Meines Onkels Echo in Oregon, welches er das
›Echo des großen Pitt‹ nannte, war ein Kleinod von zweiundzwanzig
Karaten und kostete zweihundertsechzehntausend Dollars -- man gab ihm
das Land drein, denn es war zweihundert Stunden von einer Niederlassung
entfernt.

»Nun, während dieser Zeit war mein Lebensweg ein Rosenpfad. Ich bewarb
mich um die einzige und liebliche Tochter eines englischen Grafen und
wurde geliebt bis zur Raserei. In ihrer teuren Nähe schwamm ich in
einem Meer der Wonne. Da man wußte, daß ich der alleinige Erbe meines
Onkels sei, den man auf fünf Millionen Dollars schätzte, gaben die
Eltern um so bereitwilliger ihre Zustimmung. Sowohl ihnen wie mir war
es unbekannt geblieben, daß mein Onkel unter die Sammler gegangen war
-- wenigstens wußten wir nicht, daß er anders als ganz nebenbei sammle.

»Die Wolken zogen sich indes über meinem unschuldigen Haupt zusammen.
Jenes göttliche Echo, das seitdem durch die ganze Welt als der große
Koh--i--noor oder Berg der Wiederholungen bekannt wurde, war entdeckt
worden: es war ein fünfundsechzigkarätiger Edelstein. Aeußerte man
nur ein Wort, so antwortete es einem fünfzehn Minuten lang, wenn das
Wetter windstill war. Aber siehe da, zu gleicher Zeit machte mein
Onkel die Entdeckung, daß ein zweiter Echosammler vorhanden war. Die
beiden beeilten sich, den unvergleichlichen Kauf abzuschließen. Das
Grundstück bestand aus zwei kleinen Hügeln mit einem seichten Thal
dazwischen, hinten in den Ansiedelungen des Staates New York. Beide
Männer kamen zu gleicher Zeit an Ort und Stelle an, doch wußte keiner,
daß der andere auch da war. Das Grundstück mit dem Echo gehörte nicht
einem Manne allein; ein gewisser Williamson Bolivar Jarvis besaß den
einen Hügel, den anderen ein gewisser Harbison J. Bledso; das Thal
bildete die Grenzlinie. Während nun mein Onkel Jarvis' Hügel für drei
Millionen zweihundertundfünfundachtzigtausend Dollars kaufte, erwarb
sein Konkurrent Bledsos Hügel für etwas über drei Millionen.

»Keiner von den beiden Männern war mit diesem geteilten Eigentumsrecht
zufrieden, doch wollte keiner seinen Anteil an den andern verkaufen und
schließlich schritt jener andere Sammler -- mit einer Böswilligkeit,
wie sie nur ein Sammler gegen einen Mitmenschen und Kollegen fühlen
kann -- dazu, seinen Hügel abzutragen!

»Also, da er das Echo selbst nicht erlangen konnte, wollte er es auch
keinem andern gönnen. Alle Vorstellungen meines Onkels waren vergeblich.

»Es gelang ihm zwar einen Aufschubsbefehl gegen seinen Konkurrenten zu
erwirken, der letztere appellierte jedoch und brachte die Sache vor
eine höhere Instanz. Sie führten den Prozeß weiter bis zum obersten
Gerichtshof der Vereinigten Staaten. Es entstand ein heilloser
Wirrwarr. Zwei von den Richtern waren der Ansicht, ein Echo sei
persönliches Eigentum. Obwohl nicht greifbar, sei es doch käuflich
und verkäuflich und daher ein besteuerbarer Gegenstand; zwei andere
Richter meinten, ein Echo sei ein Liegenschaftsobjekt, weil es offenbar
am Grund und Boden hafte und nicht beweglich sei; andere Richter
behaupteten, ein Echo sei überhaupt kein Eigentum.

»Es wurde schließlich entschieden, daß ein Echo ein Eigentumsobjekt
sei; daß die beiden Prozessierenden getrennte und unabhängige
Eigentümer der beiden Hügel, aber gemeinsame Inhaber des Echos
seien: es stehe deshalb dem Beklagten vollkommen frei, seinen Hügel
abzutragen, da er ihm allein gehöre, aber er müsse eine Kaution von
drei Millionen Dollars stellen als Ersatz für den Schaden, den meines
Onkels halber Anteil an dem Echo erleiden könnte. Im weiteren verbot
das Urteil meinem Onkel, ohne die Erlaubnis des Gegners, dessen Hügel
zur Weckung des Echos zu benützen; er dürfe dazu nur seines eigenen
Hügels sich bedienen; könne er unter diesen Umständen seinen Zweck
nicht erreichen, so sei das sehr bedauerlich, aber der Gerichtshof
könne daran nichts ändern. In derselben Weise wurde der Gegner in Bezug
auf diesen Punkt beschieden. Sie können sich denken, was nun geschah.
Keiner von beiden wollte dem andern die Einwilligung zur Benützung
seines Eigentums geben, und so mußte das berühmte und erhabene Echo auf
seine Bethätigung verzichten; seit jenem Tage gleicht das wertvolle
Besitztum einer verzauberten Prinzessin, die auf Erlösung harrt.

»Eine Woche vor meinem Hochzeitstage, während ich noch in einem Meer
der Wonne schwamm und der hohe Adel von Fern und Nah zur Verherrlichung
des Ereignisses sich versammelte, traf die Nachricht von dem Tode
meines Onkels und zugleich die Abschrift seines Testaments, das mich
zu seinem alleinigen Erben einsetzte, ein. Er war dahin -- ach! mein
teurer Wohlthäter war nicht mehr: der Gedanke daran belastet mein
Herz noch heute, nach so langer Zeit. Ich händigte das Testament dem
Grafen, meinem Schwiegervater, ein, da ich es meiner Thränen wegen
nicht lesen konnte. Der Graf las es und sagte dann finster: ›Nennen Sie
das Reichtum, Sir? Das kann man nur in Ihrem schwindelhaften Amerika.
Sie sind nichts weiter als der alleinige Erbe einer umfangreichen
Sammlung von Echos, wenn man das eine Sammlung nennen kann, was weit
und breit über das ganze amerikanische Festland zerstreut ist. Und
das ist nicht alles, Sir; Sie stecken bis über die Ohren in Schulden;
nicht ein Echo unter der ganzen Partie, auf dem keine Hypothek ruhte.
Ich bin nicht hartherzig, Sir, aber ich muß das Interesse meines
Kindes wahren. Wenn Sie nur _ein_ Echo hätten, das Sie mit Recht Ihr
Eigentum nennen könnten, wenn Sie nur ein Echo hätten, das frei wäre
von Lasten, so daß Sie sich mit meinem Kinde dorthin zurückziehen und
es durch unverdrossenen Fleiß kultivieren und verbessern könnten, so
würde ich nicht nein sagen; aber ich kann mein Kind an keinen Bettler
verheiraten. Verlasse ihn, mein Liebling! Und Sie, Sir, nehmen Sie Ihre
hypothekenbelasteten Echos und gehen Sie mir für immer aus den Augen.‹

»Meine edle Cölestine klammerte sich in Thränen, mit liebenden Armen
an mich und schwor, sie wolle gerne, ja mit tausend Freuden die Meine
werden, auch wenn ich nicht _ein_ Echo in der Welt hätte. Aber es
durfte nicht sein; wir wurden auseinander gerissen -- sie, um innerhalb
eines Jahres sich langsam zu Tode zu härmen -- ich, um allein mich
hinzuschleppen auf des Lebens langem, beschwerlichem Pfad, täglich,
stündlich betend um die Erlösung, die uns wieder vereinen soll in einem
himmlischen Reich. Und nun, mein Herr, wenn Sie so freundlich sein
wollen, die Karten und Pläne in meiner Mappe anzusehen; ich kann Ihnen
gewiß ein Echo billiger ablassen, als irgend jemand. Dieses hier zum
Beispiel, welches meinen Onkel vor dreißig Jahren zehn Dollars kostete
und eines der entzückendsten in Texas ist, will ich Ihnen für -- --«

»Einen Augenblick, bitte!« sagte ich. »Mein Freund, ich habe heute
vor lauter Hausierern noch keine Minute Ruhe gehabt. Ich habe eine
Nähmaschine gekauft, die ich nicht brauchte; ich habe eine Landkarte
gekauft, die voller Fehler ist; ich habe eine Uhr gekauft, die nicht
gehen will; ich habe Mottengift gekauft, das die Motten jeder andern
Nahrung vorziehen; ich habe eine endlose Menge nutzloser Erfindungen
gekauft, und jetzt bin ich dieser Thorheit satt. Ich möchte keines
von Ihren Echos auch nur geschenkt. Ich bin auf jeden wütend, der mir
Echos zum Verkauf anbietet. Sehen Sie dieses Gewehr? Nun packen Sie
Ihre Sammlung zusammen und sputen Sie sich; lassen Sie es nicht zum
Blutvergießen kommen.«

Aber er lächelte nur -- ein melancholisches, sanftes Lächeln -- und zog
weitere Pläne heraus. Sie kennen die Geschichte; hat man einmal einem
Hausierer die Thür geöffnet, so zieht man immer den kürzeren.

Nach Verfluß einer unerträglichen Stunde waren wir handelseinig. Ich
kaufte zwei doppelläufige Echos in gutem Zustand, ein drittes bekam
ich drein, das, wie er sagte, unverkäuflich sei, weil es nur Deutsch
spräche. »Es war einst vollkommen polyglott,« sagte er, »hat aber
irgendwie den größten Teil seiner Sprachfertigkeit eingebüßt.«




Eine wahre Geschichte.

(Gerade so wiedererzählt wie ich sie gehört habe.)


Es war im Sommer, zur Dämmerstunde. Wir saßen alle unter dem Vordach
des Landhauses, Tante Rahel in bescheidener Ehrerbietung etwas tiefer
wie wir auf den Stufen, denn sie war unsere Magd und eine Farbige. Von
hohem Wuchs und gewaltigem Körperbau, hatte sie trotz ihrer sechzig
Jahre ihre alte Kraft bewahrt und ihr Augenlicht war noch ungeschwächt.
Der braven, lustigen Seele war das Lachen so natürlich wie einem Vogel
das Singen. Wie gewöhnlich nach beendetem Tagewerk stand sie auch jetzt
wieder im Feuer, das heißt, sie wurde unbarmherzig geneckt, und das
machte ihr großes Vergnügen. Sie brach wieder und wieder in schallendes
Gelächter aus und wenn sie keinen Atem mehr hatte, hielt sie ihren Kopf
mit beiden Händen fest und schüttelte sich im Uebermaß der Wonne und
des Entzückens.

»Tante Rahel,« sagte ich zu ihr, als sie dies wieder einmal that,
»wie kommt es, daß du sechzig Jahre alt geworden bist und gar nichts
Trauriges erlebt hast?«

Da war ihr Lachkrampf vorüber; sie schwieg einen Augenblick, sah über
die Schulter nach mir hin und alle Fröhlichkeit war von ihr gewichen.

»Ist das Ihr Ernst, Mista Charles?« fragte sie.

Das überraschte mich sehr und mir verging die scherzhafte Stimmung.



»Je nun,« entgegnete ich betroffen, »ich dachte -- das heißt, ich
meinte nur, -- du könntest doch unmöglich jemals Kummer gehabt haben.
Noch nie habe ich einen Seufzer von dir gehört, und wenn ich dich sehe,
lachst du immer übers ganze Gesicht.« Sie drehte sich jetzt vollends
herum und sah mich mit großer Ernsthaftigkeit an.

»Ich -- keinen Kummer? -- Hören Sie Mista Charles, ich erzählen will
alles und dann sagen Sie sich's selber. Ich bin geboren unter Sklaven,
ganz da unten und weiß alle Dinge von die Sklaverei, weil ich selbst
gewesen eine. Nun also, mein Alter -- das heißt mein Mann -- der war
lieb und gut zu mir, wie Mista zu seiner eigenen Frau. Sieben Kinder
wir haben gehabt und sie geliebt haben wie Mista liebt seine Kinder.
Sie schwarz gewesen, aber uns' Herrgott können nicht machen Kinder so
schwarz, daß ihre eigene Mutter sie nicht liebt und für nichts in der
ganzen Welt hergeben will.

»Nun, Mista Charles, groß geworden ich bin im alten Virginien, aber
meine Mutter, sie stammte aus Maryland. -- Mein' Seel', wenn die in
Zorn geriet, das schrecklich war; sie konnte den Leuten die Pelz
waschen, daß die Haare flogen. Wenn sie so recht im Harnisch war, dann
sie hatte immer bloß eine Wort, die sie sagte. Sie reckte hoch sich in
der Höhe, stemmte die Fäuste in die Seite und sagte: ›Na, wartet, ich
das werd' euch lehren! Ihr denkt wohl, ich stamm' aus 'nem Bettelsack
und wollt mich narren, ihr Lumpenpack? Ich bin von die alte blaue Henne
ihr Hühnchen, daß ihr's wißt!‹ -- Sehen Sie, so Leute sich nennen,
die in Maryland sind geboren und sind stolz darauf. Ja, ja, sie sagte
das immer, und ich vergeß' es mein Lebtag nicht, weil sie sagte es so
oft und auch einmal, als mein kleiner Henry sich hatte einer Loch in
die Kopf gefallen, gerade auf der Stirn und seine Handgelenk blutig
gerissen -- o schrecklich! Und die Nigger, sie kamen nicht gleich
herbeigeflogen, das Kind zu helfen. Da war meine Mutter furchtbar böse
und sie trat vor sie hin und sagte: ›Na wartet, ihr Nigger, ich das
werd' euch lehren! Ihr denkt wohl, ich stamm' aus 'nem Bettelsack und
wollt mich narren, ihr Lumpenpack? Ich bin von die alte blaue Henne ihr
Hühnchen, daß ihr's wißt!‹ Dann trieb sie sie alle aus die Küche 'raus
und verband die Kind selbst. Da hab' ich mich das angewöhnt, und wenn
der Aerger über mich kommt, sag' ich auch das Wort von meine Mutter.

»Nun also, mit der Zeit, meine alte Missis[4] sagt einmal, mit ihr wär'
alles aus, sie muß verkaufen ihre Platz und alle Nigger. Wie ich aber
höre, daß sie uns wollte verkaufen auf dem Markt in Richmond -- o du
meine Güte, das Schrecken! Ich wußte ja, was der Glocke hat geschlagen.«

    [4] Herrin.

    (Tante Rahel war allmählich im Eifer ihrer Erzählung
    aufgestanden; ihre große Gestalt ragte jetzt über uns hinaus
    und hob sich schwarz und deutlich ab vom Sternenhimmel.)

»Sie legten uns in Ketten und stellten uns auf eine Tritt so hoch wie
der Vordach. Und die Leute standen herum, viele Haufen. Sie kamen da
'rauf und besahen uns von vorn und von hinten, sie drückten unser Arme,
machten uns stehen und gehen und sagten dann: der ist zu alt, der taugt
nichts mehr. Der ist lahm. Der ist nicht viel wert. Und sie verkauften
mein alter Mann und führten ihn weg. Dann fangen sie an und verkaufen
meine Kinder und nehmen sie fort. Ich laut heule, aber die Mann sagt:
Laß deine verdammte Gewinsel, und schlägt mich mit sein Hand auf meine
Mund. Wenn alle fort sind bis auf mein kleiner Henry, ich presse ihn
ganz fest an meine Brust und trete hin und schrei: ›den ihr dürft nicht
nehmen mit, nein, nein, wer ihn anrührt, den schlagen ich tot.‹ Aber
mein kleiner Henry, er spricht mir ins Ohr: ›Ich thu weglaufen, und
dann arbeiten ich und kaufen dich los.‹ Gott segne die Kind, es war
immer so gut! -- Und das Kerle, sie kommen und nehmen ihn, aber ich sie
packen und reißen sie die Kleider vom Leibe und schlage sie mit meine
Kette über die Kopf. Sie haben's tüchtig wiedergegeben mir, freilich --
aber was kümmerten mich das!

»Na also, mein Alter war fort und meine Kinder -- meine ganzen sieben
Kinder -- und sechs davon habe ich nie wieder mit Augen gesehen bis
zum heutigen Tag -- zweiundzwanzig Jahr letzte Ostern. Mich kaufte
ein Mann aus Newbern und hat gebracht mich dorthin. Dann vergehen
die Jahre und der Krieg kommt. Mein Massa[5] war ein Oberst von die
Konförderierte und ich Köchin in seine Familie. Wie aber die Unioner
kommen und einnehmen die Stadt, sind sie alle fortgelaufen und mich
allein gelassen haben mit die andern Nigger in Massas großes Haus. Nun
die großen Offiziers von die Unioner sind eingezogen und haben mich
gefragt, will ich kochen vor ihnen. ›Na Herrje, freilich,‹ sage ich,
›zu was wär' ich sonst da?‹

    [5] Herr.

»Das sind keine so kleine Offiziers gewesen, nein, von die
allergrößten, und wie die ihre Soldaten 'rumschwenken ließen! Der
General zu mir sagt, ich soll die Kommando haben über das Küche und
alle rausjagen, die sich mengen wollen in meinen Sachen. ›Nur nicht
fürchten dich,‹ sagte er, ›du bist jetzt unter guten Freunden.‹

»Na, ich denken bei mir, wenn mein kleiner Henry Gelegenheit gefunden
zum Fortlaufen, so ist er natürlich nach das Norden. Und eine Tag ich
gehe ins Wohnzimmer, wo die großen Offiziers sind, mache eine Knix
und fange an zu erzählen von mein kleiner Henry, und sie hörten meine
traurige Geschichte zu, gerade als ob ich eins von die weiße Leut'
wär'. Und ich sage: ›Weswegen ich komme, das ist, weil, wenn er ist
fortgelaufen und nach das Norden, wo die Herrens herauskommen, sie
ihn haben vielleicht gesehen und können mir sagen, wo ich ihn finden
wieder. Er ganz klein ist und hat eine Narben am linken Handgelenk und
oben auf die Stirn.‹ Dann machten sie betrübte Gesicht und der General
fragt: ›Wie lange ist es her, seit man dir dein Kind genommen hat?‹
Und ich sage: ›Dreizehn Jahr.‹ ›Dann ist er jetzt nicht mehr klein,‹
antwortet der General, ›er ist ein Mann.‹

»Daran ich hatt' vorher nie noch gedacht, er war für mich noch immer
die kleine Junge, mir war nie eingefallen, daß er gewachsen und groß
geworden sein muß. Aber nun ich es verstand. Keiner von den Offiziers
war ihm begegnet und sie konnten mir nicht helfen. Aber die ganze Zeit,
ohne daß ich's wußte, vor vieler Jahr, war mein Henry schon fort nach
das Norden und war ein Barbier, der für eigener Rechnung arbeiten that.
Wie aber der Krieg kam, da hat er gesagt: ›Jetzt ich laß das scheren
und gehe meine alte Mutter zu suchen, wenn es nicht schon tot ist.‹
So verkauft er sein Sach' und geht hin, wo sie Soldaten werben und
verdingt sich als Bursche bei die Oberst. Nun er marschiert überall
mit durch allen Schlachten, sein alte Mutter zu finden, erst er war bei
eine Offizier, dann bei eine andere, bis er ist gezogen durch das ganze
Süden. Aber von das alles wußt' ich nicht ein Sterbenswort. Wie ich's
sollt' auch wissen?

»Nun, eine Abend hatten wir großer Soldatenball. Die Soldaten in
Newbern immerzu wollten tanzen und jubeln, und sie tanzten oft und oft
in meine Küche, weil die ist so arg groß. Nun wissen Sie, mir gar nicht
das gefiel, weil ich diente die Offiziers, und es ärgerte mich zu sehen
die gemeine Soldaten ihre Sprünge machen in meine Küche. Aber ich blieb
immer dabei und sah nach das Rechte und wenn sie trieben es zu arg und
ich einen Zorn kriegte, dann 'raus mit sie aus meine Küche -- hast du
nicht gesehen!

»Also einemal -- Freitag abend -- da kam eine ganze Bataillon von das
Nigger-Regiment, das die Wache hatte beim Haus -- die Haus war der
Hauptquartier, wissen Sie. Da kocht alles inwendig bei mir. Ich bin
im hellen Zorn und nur warte drauf, daß sie was thun, daß ich könnte
drunter hineinfahren. Und sie walzten und sprangen herum, heisahopsasa
-- und ich schwoll und schwoll vor Wut. Nicht lange, so kommt da ein
junger Springinsfeld von Nigger gesegelt daher, den Arm um seine gelbe
Tänzerin; die drehen und schwingen sich im Kreise, rund, rund, rund,
daß einem ganz wirbelig wird, sie anzusehen. Und als sie dicht vor mir
sind, da hopsen sie erst auf eine Fuß, dann auf die andere und lachen
über meine große rote Kopftuch und treiben ihren Spaß. Da ich fahre
auf sie los und sage: ›Macht, daß ihr fortkommt ihr, ihr Gesindel!‹ Da
wird das Gesicht von der junge Nigger auf einmal ernst, aber nur eine
Augenblick, dann war er wieder lustig und lachte wie zuvor. Indem kommt
eine ganze Bande Nigger herein, die wo die Musik machen und immer so
vornehm thun. Aber sobald sie das an die Abend versuchen, fahre ich
auf sie ein. Sie lachten und da es wurde noch ärger. Die andern Nigger
fangen auch an lachen und nun ich war wie ein Feuerbrand. Ich reckte
mich in der Höhe, so -- gerade wie jetzt -- fast bis an die Decke,
stemmte die Fäuste in die Seite und sagte: ›Na, wartet, ihr Nigger, ich
das werd' euch lehren. Ihr denkt wohl, ich stamm' aus 'nem Bettelsack
und wollt mich narren, ihr Lumpenpack? Ich bin von die alte blaue Henne
ihr Hühnchen, daß ihr's wißt!‹ Da stand die junge Mann stocksteif da,
die Augen nach das Decke, als ob er was vergessen hätt' und sich nicht
mehr erinnern könnt'. Ich aber gehe den Niggers zu Leibe, wie eine
richtige General, und sie nehmen Reißaus und drängen nach die Thür. Und
wie die junge Mann rausgeht, hör' ich, wie er zu einen andern Nigger
sagt: ›Jim‹, sagt er, ›geh' mal hin und sag' die Hauptmann, ich würd'
morgen früh um acht zur Hand sein; aber ich hab' was auf dem Herzen,
schlafen ich kann heute nacht nicht mehr, geh, laß mich allein.‹

»Das war um 1 Uhr in die Nacht, und wie es sieben Uhr schlug, war ich
auf und hantierte herum, den Offiziers zu machen das Frühstück. Wie
ich mich nun zu die Ofen bücke -- grade als wär' Ihr Fuß die Ofen --
und die Thüre aufmache mit meine Hand und zurückstoße sie -- wie jetzt
Ihre Fuß -- und die Pfanne mit das heiße Backwerk in die Hand halte und
aufstehen will -- da sehe ich ein schwarzes Gesicht sich vor meines
hinschieben und mir in die Augen schauen -- grade wie ich jetzt ansehe
Sie -- ich rühre mich nicht und gucke und gucke nur in einem fort --
so -- bis die Pfanne zu zittern anfängt -- und auf einmal -- da wußt'
ich's. Die Pfanne liegt am Boden und ich packe ihn an der linken Hand,
schiebe den Aermel zurück -- grade so, wie ich's mache mit Sie, und
dann kommt das Stirn an die Reihe und ich streiche seine Haar zurück,
so -- und ›Junge,‹ sag ich, ›wenn du nicht mein Henry bist, wie du
kommst zu die Narbe am Handgelenk und die Schramme auf die Stirn?
-- Der Herrgott im Himmel gepriesen sei, ich habe meine Herzensjunge
wieder!‹

       *       *       *       *       *

»Ja, ja, ich hab' Kummer gehabt -- aber auch Freude, Mista Charles --
auch Freude!«




Die Liebe des schönen Alonzo Fitz Clarence und der schönen Rosannah
Ethelton.


I.

Es war am Morgen eines bitterkalten Wintertages. Die Stadt Eastport im
Staate Maine lag unter tiefem, frisch gefallenem Schnee begraben. Das
gewöhnliche geschäftige Treiben auf den Straßen fehlte; weit und breit
auf denselben nichts als eine weiße Decke und entsprechende Stille. Die
Trottoirs waren nur noch lange, tiefe Gräben mit steilen Schneehügeln
zu beiden Seiten. Hie und da konnte man das schwache, ferne Kratzen
einer hölzernen Schaufel vernehmen und ein flüchtiges Bild von einer
entfernten, schwarzen Gestalt erhaschen, die sich bückte und in einem
jener Gräben verschwand, um im nächsten Augenblick wieder aufzutauchen,
mit einer Bewegung, die das Herausschaufeln von Schnee verriet. Aber
man mußte rasch blicken, denn jene schwarze Gestalt verweilte nicht,
sondern ließ bald die Schaufel fallen und lief auf das Haus zu, wobei
sie mit den Armen um sich warf, um sich zu wärmen. Ja, es war zu bitter
kalt, als daß ein Schneeschaufler oder sonst jemand lange draußen
bleiben konnte.

Bald darauf verdüsterte sich der Himmel: der Wind hatte sich erhoben
und wirbelte in heftigen ungleichen Stößen ganze Wolken pulverigen
Schnees in die Höhe und nach allen Seiten. Unter der Wucht dieser
Windstöße legten sich große weiße Schneehügel wie Gräber quer über die
Straßen; einen Augenblick später bettete sie ein anderer Windstoß in
anderer Richtung, wobei er einen feinen Sprühregen Schnees von ihren
spitzen Kämmen fegte, wie eine frische Brise den Schaum von den Wogen
spritzt; einem dritten Stoß gefiel es, den Platz so glatt zu fegen wie
einen Tisch. Das war Tändelei, das war Spiel; aber daß es keiner von
diesen Windstößen unterließ, einen Haufen Schnee in die Trottoirgräben
zu werfen, das gehörte offenbar zum Geschäft.

Alonzo Fitz Clarence saß in seinem behaglichen und eleganten kleinen
Empfangszimmer, in einem blauseidenen, mit Aufschlägen und Säumen von
karmoisinrotem Sammet besetzten Schlafrock. Die Ueberreste seines
Frühstücks standen vor ihm, und das zierliche und kostbare Tischzeug
fügte der Anmut, Schönheit und dem Reichtum der Ausstattung des Zimmers
noch einen weiteren harmonischen Reiz bei. Ein lustiges Feuer prasselte
im Kamin.

Ein wütender Windstoß ließ die Fenster erzittern, und eine große
Schneewoge rollte gegen sie, wenn man so sagen darf. Der hübsche junge
Mann murmelte:

»Das bedeutet -- keinen Ausgang heute! Nun meinetwegen. Aber wie
steht's mit der Unterhaltung? Mutter ist ja ganz recht, Tante Susanne
ebenso; aber diese beiden kann ich immer haben. An einem so bösen Tag
bedarf es eines neuen Interesses, eines frischen Elements, um die
stumpfe Schneide der Gefangenschaft zu schärfen. Eine hübsche Phrase --
hat aber keinen Sinn! Man will ja die Schneide der Gefangenschaft nicht
geschärft haben, sondern gerade das Gegenteil.«

Er blickte auf seine hübsche französische Stutzuhr.

»Die Uhr geht wieder falsch; sie weiß kaum je, was die Zeit ist, und
wenn sie es weiß, lügt sie mich an, was auf dasselbe hinausläuft. --
Alfred!«

Keine Antwort.



»Alfred! Ein guter Diener, aber ebenso unzuverlässig wie die Uhr.«

Alonzo berührte den Knopf einer elektrischen Leitung in der Wand,
wartete ein Weilchen und berührte ihn dann nochmals; hierauf wartete er
wieder einige Augenblicke und sagte endlich:

»Ohne Zweifel ist die Batterie nicht in Ordnung; nun ich aber einmal
darauf aus bin, will ich auch herauskriegen, wie viel Uhr es ist.«
Er schritt zu einem Sprachrohr in der Ecke und rief ›Mutter!‹ mit
zweimaliger Wiederholung.

»Es hilft nichts. Auch der Mutter Batterie geht nicht. Kann niemand
drunten auf die Beine bringen -- das ist klar.«

Er setzte sich vor einem Pult aus Rosenholz nieder, lehnte sein Kinn
gegen dessen linke Kante und sprach, gleichsam gegen den Fußboden
gewendet: »Tante Susanne!«

Eine leise, angenehme Stimme antwortet: »Bist du's, Alonzo?«

»Ja. Ich bin zu faul und fühle mich zu behaglich, um die Stiege
hinabzugehen; ich bin in größter Not und kann scheints, keine Hilfe
herbeirufen.«

»Du lieber Himmel, was giebt's?«

»Genug, -- das kann ich dir sagen!«

»O, lasse mich nicht in Ungewißheit, Lieber. Was ist's denn?«

»Ich möchte wissen, wie viel Uhr es ist.«

»Du unartiger Junge; du hast mich recht in Schrecken gejagt! Ist das
alles?«

»Alles -- auf Ehre. Beruhige dich; sage mir die Zeit und empfange
meinen Segen.«

»Gerade fünf Minuten nach neun Uhr. Keine Ursache zum Danken -- behalte
deinen Segen.«

»Danke schön, Tantchen. Er würde mich nicht gerade ärmer gemacht haben,
und dich nicht so reich, daß du ohne andere Mittel leben könntest.«
Er stand auf und murmelte: »Gerade fünf Minuten nach neun Uhr,« und
stellte sich seiner Uhr gegenüber. »Ah,« sagte er, »du machst deine
Sache besser wie gewöhnlich. Du gehst nur um vierunddreißig Minuten
falsch. Warte ... Warte ... Dreiunddreißig und einundzwanzig ist
vierundfünfzig; viermal vierundfünfzig ist zweihundertsechsunddreißig;
eins ab, bleibt zweihundertfünfunddreißig. So ist's recht.«[6]

    [6] Tante und Neffe, welche also per Telephon verkehren, sind
        weit auseinander: _sie_ in San Francisco, er in einer Stadt
        des Ostens, daher die Zeitdifferenz.

            Der Uebers.


Er drehte die Uhrzeiger vorwärts, bis sie fünfundzwanzig Minuten auf
Eins zeigten und sagte: »Nun sieh, ob du nicht eine Zeit lang richtig
gehen kannst ... sonst werde ich dir kommen!«

Er setzte sich wieder vor das Pult und sagte: »Tante Susanne!«

»Ja, Lieber.«

»Gefrühstückt?«

»Gewiß, vor einer Stunde schon.«

»Sehr beschäftigt?«

»Nein -- nähe bloß ein wenig. Warum?«

»Gesellschaft bei dir?«

»Nein, aber ich erwarte solche um halb zehn Uhr.«

»Wollte, ich auch. Ich fühle mich einsam und möchte mit jemand
plaudern.«

»Nun gut, so plaudere mit mir.«

»Ja, aber ich hab' 'was ganz Privates!«

»Sei unbesorgt! -- plaudre frisch drauf los; es ist außer mir niemand
da.«

»Ich weiß fast nicht, ob ich es wagen soll, aber --«

»Aber was? Sprich nur! Du weißt, Alonzo, daß du mir vertrauen kannst --
du weißt es.«

»Bin überzeugt, Tante; aber die Sache ist sehr ernst; sie berührt mich
sehr nahe -- mich und die ganze Familie -- selbst die ganze Gemeinde.«

»O, Alonzo, sage mir's! Ich werde nie ein Wort davon laut werden
lassen. Um was handelt es sich?«

»Soll ich's wagen ...«

»O bitte, thu's! Ich habe dich so lieb und kann dir ganz nachfühlen.
Sage mir alles -- vertraue mir! Was hast du auf dem Herzen?«

»Das Wetter!«

»Zum Kuckuck mit dem Wetter! Ich weiß nicht, wie du's übers Herz
bringen kannst, mir so mitzuspielen, Lon.«

»Nun, nun, lieb' Tantchen, es thut mir leid -- wirklich, bei meiner
Treu, ich will's nicht wieder thun. Vergiebst du mir?«

»Meinetwegen, ich sollte es freilich nicht thun; denn du hältst mich
doch wieder zum Besten, sobald ich diesen Streich vergessen habe.«

»Nein, gewiß nicht -- mein Wort darauf. Aber solch ein Wetter, o, solch
ein Wetter! Man muß seine Lebensgeister künstlich aufrecht erhalten.
Schneeig, windig, stürmisch und bitterkalt, alles auf einmal! Wie ist
das Wetter bei euch?«

»Warm, regnerisch und trübselig. Es wimmelt auf den Straßen von
Regenschirmen, und von dem Ende jedes Fischbeins ergießt sich ein
Strom. Der Behaglichkeit wegen brennt ein Feuer in meinem Kamin,
und damit es nicht so warm wird, sind die Fenster offen. Aber es
ist umsonst: nichts kommt herein als der linde Hauch des Dezember,
geschwängert von den Düften der Blumen, welchen die Außenwelt gehört
und die sich ihres wonnigen Lebens freuen, während der Geist des
Menschen niedergeschlagen ist, die ihm entgegenleuchten in bunter
Pracht, während seine Seele in Sack und Asche gekleidet ist und sein
Herz brechen möchte.«

Alonzo öffnete die Lippen, um zu sagen: »Du solltest das drucken und
einrahmen lassen,« unterließ es aber, als er seine Tante mit einer
andern Person sprechen hörte. Er trat ans Fenster und schaute hinaus
auf das winterliche Straßenbild. Der Sturmwind trieb den Schnee
wütender als je vor sich her; die Fensterläden wurden lärmend hin- und
hergeworfen; ein verirrter Hund mit gesenktem Kopf und eingezogenem
Schweif drängte seinen zitternden Körper gegen eine windgeschützte
Mauer, Obdach und Schutz suchend; ein junges Mädchen watete knietief
durch die Schneehaufen; sie hatte das Gesicht vom Winde abgewandt, und
die Kaputze ihres Regenmantels flatterte von hinten über ihren Kopf.
Alonzo schauderte und er sagte mit einem Seufzer: »Lieber Kotpfützen
und schwüler Regen, und aufdringliche Blumen, als das!«

Er wandte sich vom Fenster ab, machte einen Schritt und blieb dann
in lauschender Haltung stehen. Die schwachen, sanften Töne eines
wohlbekannten Liedes schlugen an sein Ohr. Er blieb mit vorwärts
gebeugtem Kopf stehen und sog die Melodie ein, -- weder Hand noch Fuß
rührte sich, er atmete kaum. Dem Vortrag des Liedes fehlte etwas;
unserem Alonzo aber schien das kein Fehler, sondern eher ein weiterer
Reiz zu sein. Dieser Fehler bestand in einem auffallenden Sinken der
Stimme bei der dritten bis siebenten Note des Refrains oder Chors des
Liedes. Als der Gesang zu Ende war, holte Alonzo tief Atem und sagte:
»Ah, nie zuvor habe ich ›~In the Sweet By-and-By~‹ so schön singen
hören!«

Er schritt rasch zum Pult, horchte einen Augenblick und sagte dann
leise und vertraulich: »Tantchen, wer ist denn diese göttliche
Sängerin?«

»Es ist der Besuch, den ich erwartete. Bleibt einen bis zwei Monate bei
mir. Will dich ihr vorstellen, -- Fräulein ...«

»Um Gottes willen, warte einen Augenblick, Tante Susanne! Du überlegst
doch auch gar nicht.«

Er flog in sein Schlafzimmer und kehrte einen Augenblick später,
merklich in seiner äußeren Erscheinung verändert, wieder, indem er
schnippisch bemerkte: »Bei Gott, sie würde mich diesem Engel in meinem
himmelblauen Schlafrock da, mit den feuerroten Aufschlägen, vorgestellt
haben. Die Weiber denken doch nie, wenn sie einmal im Eifer sind.«

Er eilte zu dem Pult, blieb stehen und rief halblaut: »Nun, Tante, bin
ich fertig,« worauf er sich mit all der einschmeichelnden Eleganz, die
ihm zu Gebote stand, lächelnd verbeugte.

»Sogleich! -- Fräulein Rosannah Ethelton, darf ich Ihnen meinen
liebsten Neffen, Herrn Alonzo Fitz Clarence vorstellen? So! Ihr seid
beide artige Kinder, und so will ich euch denn vertrauen und allein
beisammen lassen, derweil ich einiges fürs Haus besorge. Setzen Sie
sich, Rosannah; setze dich, Alonzo. Adieu; ich werde bald wieder da
sein.«

Alonzo hatte sich währenddessen immerzu verbeugt und unsichtbaren
jungen Damen unsichtbare Sitze angewiesen, jetzt aber setzte er sich
selbst, indem er zu sich sagte: »Na, das nenn' ich Glück! Nun mögen die
Winde sausen und der Schnee wehen und die Himmel finster drein blicken!
Was ficht's mich an!«

Während die jungen Leute sich nun in die Bekanntschaft hineinplaudern,
nehmen wir uns die Freiheit, das Schönere und Holdere der beiden
genauer zu betrachten. Sie saß allein, in anmutiger Ungezwungenheit,
in einem reich möblierten Gemach, welches offenbar das Empfangszimmer
einer feinen und reichen Dame war. Neben einem niederen, bequemen
Sessel stand ein zierliches Arbeitstischchen, auf dem sich ein
phantastisch gestickter flacher Korb erhob, aus dessen offenem
Deckel sich Stickgarn von verschiedenen Farben, Litzen und Bänder
hervordrängten und in nachlässiger Fülle herabhingen. Auf einem üppigen
Sofa, das mit einem weichen indischen, aus schwarzen und goldenen Fäden
gewebten, und von anderen Fäden in gedämpfteren Farben durchschossenen
Stoffe überzogen war, lag eine noch unfertige Straminarbeit, einen
in reichen Farben prangenden Blumenstrauß darstellend. Die Hauskatze
schlief gerade auf diesem Kunstwerk. In einem Bogenfenster stand eine
Staffelei mit einem unvollendeten Gemälde, Palette und Pinsel lagen
auf einem Stuhle daneben. Bücher, wohin man sah: Robertsons Predigten,
Tennyson, Moody und Sankey, Hawthorne, Longfellow, Kochbücher,
Gebetbücher, Stickmusterbücher, nicht zu vergessen alle Arten von
Büchern über Renaissancemöbel und Majolikas. Auch ein Piano war da mit
einem Stoß Musikalien daneben. An den Wänden hing eine Menge Bilder,
andere standen auf Kaminsims und Eckbrettern, und wo sich ein Plätzchen
dazu fand, waren plastische Figuren, altmodischer Nippsachen-Krimskrams
und besonders viel seltenes und kostbares chinesisches Porzellan
aufgestellt. Das Bogenfenster ging auf einen Garten, aus dem fremde und
einheimische Blumen und blühende Sträucher hervorstrahlten.



Aber das holde junge Mädchen war das reizendste, was dieser Wohnsitz
drinnen und draußen dem Auge bieten konnte: zartgeformte Züge von
griechischem Schnitte, ihre Gesichtsfarbe der reine Schnee einer Lilie,
auf die von einem scharlachfarbenen Gartennachbar ein schwacher Abglanz
fällt; große, sanfte blaue Augen, mit langen, geschweiften Wimpern
befranst; im Gesicht die Treuherzigkeit eines Kindes und die Sanftmut
eines Rehes; der hübsche Kopf mit goldglänzendem Haar verschwenderisch
reich gekrönt; eine geschmeidige und doch wohlgerundete Gestalt, die in
jeder Haltung und Bewegung von natürlicher Anmut erfüllt war.

Ihr Anzug und Schmuck zeigte jene ausgesuchte Harmonie, die nur von
einem feinen natürlichen, durch Kultur vervollkommneten Geschmack
kommen kann. Ihr Kleid war von einfachem, magentafarbenen Tüll,
der Quere nach geschnitten und gekreuzt von drei Reihen hellblauer
Falbeln; der Ueberwurf von dunkelrotbraunem Tarlatan, mit Stickereien
von scharlachfarbenem Atlas; kornfarbige Polonaise ~en panier~, mit
Perlmutterknöpfen und Silberschnüren besetzt, nach hinten aufgenommen
und mit Litzen von lederfarbenem Sammet befestigt; Schöße von
lavendelfarbenem Rips, mit Valenzienner Spitzen ausgeputzt; Krawatte
von kastanienfarbenem Sammet, mit zarter Rosaseide eingefaßt; Halstuch
von einem einfachen dreifaltigen, in der Wolle gefärbten Gewebe von
gedämpftem Safrangelb; Korallenarmbänder und Halskette mit Medaillon;
Haarschmuck von Vergißmeinnicht und Maiblümchen, die sich zahlreich um
eine edle Calla drängten.

Das war alles; doch selbst in diesem schlichten Anzug war sie göttlich
schön; was müßte sie erst gewesen sein, wenn geschmückt zum Fest oder
Ball?

Ahnungslos, daß wir sie dieser Besichtigung unterzogen, hatte sie
mittlerweile eifrig mit Alonzo geplaudert. Rasch enteilten die Minuten,
und noch immer plauderten sie. Endlich aber blickte sie zufällig empor
und sah auf die Uhr. Ein tiefes Erröten durchschoß ihre Wangen und sie
rief aus:

»Und nun adieu, Herr Fitz Clarence; ich muß jetzt gehen!«

Sie sprang mit solcher Hast von ihrem Stuhl empor, daß sie kaum des
jungen Mannes Abschiedsgruß hörte. Strahlend von Anmut und Schönheit
stand sie da und schaute verwundert auf die anklagende Uhr; dann
öffneten sich ihre vollen Lippen und sie sagte zu sich:

»Fünf Minuten über elf! Fast zwei Stunden, und es schienen keine
zwanzig Minuten zu sein. Du lieber Himmel, was wird er von mir denken!«

In demselben Augenblicke starrte Alonzo auf seine Uhr und sagte dann zu
sich:

»Fünfunddreißig Minuten über zwei Uhr! Fast zwei Stunden, und ich
glaubte, es wären keine zwei Minuten! Am Ende schwindelt die Uhr
wieder? Fräulein Ethelton! Nur einen Augenblick, bitte. Sind Sie noch
hier?«

»Ja, aber bitte schnell! muß sogleich gehen.«

»Möchten Sie so freundlich sein, mir zu sagen, wie viel Uhr es ist?«

Das Mädchen errötete wieder und sagte leise für sich: »Es ist geradezu
grausam, mich zu fragen!« und gab dann laut und mit bewundernswert
gespielter Gleichgültigkeit zur Antwort: »Fünf Minuten über elf.«

»So? ich danke Ihnen! Sie müssen also jetzt wirklich gehen?«

»Ja.«

»Das thut mir leid.«

Keine Antwort.

»Fräulein Ethelton!«

»Nun?«

»Sie -- Sie sind noch da, nicht wahr?«

»Ja; aber bitte, beeilen Sie sich. Was wollten Sie sagen?«

»Nun, ich -- nun, nichts Besonderes. Es ist so einsam hier. Es ist
viel verlangt, ich weiß es; aber möchten Sie wohl bald wieder mit mir
plaudern -- das heißt, wenn es Ihnen nicht unangenehm ist?«

»Ich weiß nicht -- aber ich will mich besinnen -- ich denke, ja.«

»O, tausend Dank! Fräulein Ethelton? ... O weh, sie ist fort, und da
sind die schwarzen Wolken und der wirbelnde Schnee und die stürmischen
Winde wieder! Aber sie sagte _adieu_! Sie sagte nicht Guten Morgen,
sie sagte adieu! ... Die Uhr ging also doch recht. Wie blitzbeschwingt
diese zwei Stunden waren!«

Er setzte sich nieder, blickte eine Weile träumerisch in das Feuer,
seufzte dann tief auf und sagte:

»Wie wunderbar! Vor zwei Stündchen noch war ich ein freier Mann, und
jetzt ist mein Herz in San Francisco!«

Um dieselbe Zeit saß Rosannah Ethelton, mit einem Buche in der Hand,
in der Fensternische ihres Schlafzimmers und blickte zerstreut hinaus
über die regnerischen Seen, die das ›goldene Thor‹ (Hafen von San
Francisco) wuschen, und flüsterte für sich: »Wie ganz anders er doch
ist als der arme Burley mit seinem leeren Kopf und seinem einzigen
komödiantenhaften Talent der Nachäffung.«


II.

Vier Wochen später unterhielt Herr Sidney Algernon Burley eine
fröhliche Frühstücksgesellschaft in einem prächtigen Salon auf
Telegraph Hill mit einigen köstlichen Nachahmungen der Stimmen und
Gebärden gewisser beliebter Schauspieler, gewisser Litteraten aus San
Francisco und Bonanzaer Granden.[7] Er war eine elegante Erscheinung,
und -- abgesehen von einem unbedeutenden Schielen -- ein hübscher
Mensch. Er schien sehr guter Stimmung zu sein, trotzdem blickte er von
Zeit zu Zeit voll unruhiger Erwartung nach der Thüre. Endlich erschien
ein Lakai, welcher der Frau vom Hause eine Botschaft brachte, worauf
die Dame verständnisvoll mit dem Kopf nickte. Das schien Burleys
Erwartung ein Ende zu machen; seine Lebhaftigkeit nahm nach und nach ab
und sein Gesicht einen niedergeschlagenen Ausdruck an.

    [7] Besitzer von großen Farmen, sogenannten ›Bonanzafarmen‹.

            Anm. des Uebers.


Die Gesellschaft entfernte sich, als es an der Zeit war, und er blieb
allein mit der Hausfrau, zu der er sagte:

»Es kann kein Zweifel mehr sein: sie weicht mir aus, sie entschuldigt
sich fortwährend. Wenn ich sie nur sehen, nur einen Augenblick mit ihr
sprechen könnte -- aber diese Ungewißheit --«

»Vielleicht ist ihr scheinbares Ausweichen bloßer Zufall. Gehen Sie in
das kleine Empfangszimmer droben und warten Sie einen Augenblick. Ich
muß rasch einen häuslichen Auftrag geben, der mir eben einfällt, und
will dann auf ihr Zimmer gehen. Sie wird sich gewiß bestimmen lassen,
Sie zu empfangen.«

Herr Burley ging die Stiege hinauf in der Absicht, das kleine
Empfangszimmer aufzusuchen; als er aber an ›Tante Susannes‹ Boudoir
vorüberging, dessen Thüre ein wenig offen stand, hörte er ein ihm
wohlbekanntes fröhliches Lachen; so ging er denn ohne anzuklopfen
und unangemeldet hinein. Ehe er aber seine Nähe bemerklich machen
konnte, hörte er Worte, die ihm schwer auf die Seele fielen und sein
Blut erkalten machten. Er hörte vor dem Telephon eine Stimme sagen:
»Liebste, es ist angekommen, es ist da.«

Dann hörte er Rosannah Ethelton, die mit dem Rücken gegen ihn stand,
antworten: »Das deinige auch, Teuerster!«

Er sah ihre vorgebeugte Gestalt sich noch tiefer herabbeugen; er hörte
sie etwas küssen -- nicht bloß einmal, sondern wieder und wieder! Seine
Galle kochte in ihm. Die herzbrechende Unterredung wurde fortgesetzt:

»Rosannah, ich wußte, daß du schön sein müßtest; aber dein Bild
übertrifft meine Ahnung: ich bin völlig geblendet!«

»Alonzo, es macht mich überglücklich, daß du das sagst. Ich weiß
zwar, daß es nicht wahr ist; aber ich bin trotzdem dankbar, daß du es
glaubst! Ich wußte, daß du edle Züge haben müßtest, aber die Anmut und
Majestät der Wirklichkeit machen die Schöpfung meiner Phantasie zu
einem armseligen Schattenbild.«

Burley hörte wieder jenen prasselnden Schauer von Küssen.

»Ich danke dir, meine Rosannah! Die Photographie schmeichelt mir, aber
daran mußt du nicht denken. -- Mein Schätzchen?«

»Ja, Alonzo?«

»Ich bin so glücklich, Rosannah.«

»O, Alonzo. Jetzt weiß ich, was Liebe ist. Ich schwebe in einem
prächtigen Wolkenland, in einem grenzenlosen Himmel zauberhaften und
sinnberauschenden Entzückens.«

»O, meine Rosannah! -- denn du bist ja mein, nicht wahr?«



»Ganz, o, ganz dein, Alonzo, jetzt und immerdar! Den ganzen Tag
hindurch und in meinen nächtlichen Träumen höre ich immer ein Lied,
dessen holder Refrain lautet: Alonzo Fitz Clarence, Alonzo Fitz
Clarence zu Eastport im Staate Maine!«

»Verwünscht sei er! -- ich habe jetzt wenigstens seine Adresse!«
brüllte Burley innerlich und eilte fort.

Hinter dem ahnungslosen Alonzo aber stand plötzlich seine Mutter, ein
Bild des Staunens. Sie war vom Kopf bis zu den Füßen in Pelze gehüllt,
so daß außer Augen und Nase nichts von ihr zu sehen war. Sie stand
da, wie eine gute Allegorie des Winters, über und über mit feinen
Schneeflocken bestreut.

Hinter der ahnungslosen Rosannah stand Tante Susanne, ein zweites Bild
des Staunens. Sie war eine gute Allegorie des Sommers, denn sie war
leicht gekleidet und kühlte sich mit einem Fächer das heiße Gesicht.

Beiden Frauen standen Freudenthränen in den Augen.

»Haha!« rief Frau Fitz Clarence aus, »das erklärt, weshalb dich seit
sechs Wochen niemand aus deinem Zimmer zu bringen vermochte, Alonzo!«

»Aha!« rief Tante Susanne aus, »jetzt weiß ich, weshalb Sie in den
letzten sechs Wochen eine Einsiedlerin waren, Rosannah!«



Die jungen Leute waren im Nu auf den Füßen, und standen betreten da,
wie Schmuggler von Gold und Juwelen, die man beim Handwerk ertappt hat.

»Sei gesegnet, mein Sohn! Ich bin glücklich in eurem Glück. Komm' in
deiner Mutter Arme, Alonzo!«

»Sei gesegnet, Rosannah, um meines lieben Neffens willen. Komm' in
meine Arme!«

Die Herzen schwammen in Wonne auf Telegraph Hill und in Eastport Square.

An beiden Orten wurden Diener gerufen. Dem einen wurde der Befehl
gegeben: »Wirf noch mehr Walnußbaumholz ins Feuer und bringe mir ein
siedheißes Glas Glühwein.« Dem andern wurde der Auftrag erteilt:
»Lösche das Feuer und bringe mir zwei Palmblattfächer und eine Flasche
Eiswasser.«

Dann wurden die jungen Leute weggeschickt, und die beiden älteren
setzten sich nieder, um die angenehme Ueberraschung zu besprechen und
Heiratspläne zu entwerfen.

Einige Minuten vorher stürzte Herr Burley aus dem Hause auf Telegraph
Hill, ohne jemandem zu begegnen oder von jemand förmlichen Abschied
zu nehmen. In unbewußter Nachahmung einer bekannten Stelle in einem
Melodrama zischte er zwischen den Zähnen hervor: »Sein soll sie niemals
werden! Ich hab's geschworen! Ehe die Natur ihren Winterhermelin
abgelegt haben wird, um den Smaragdschmuck des Frühlings anzulegen,
soll sie mein sein!«


III.

Ein paar Wochen später. -- Drei oder vier Tage lang empfing Alonzo
alle paar Stunden den Besuch eines sehr schmuck und gottesfürchtig
aussehenden Geistlichen, der auf einem Auge schielte; nach seiner
Visitenkarte war er der hochwürdige Melton Hargrave aus Cincinnati.
Er sagte, er habe sich ›seiner Gesundheit wegen‹ von der Seelsorge
zurückgezogen; wenn er gesagt hätte: ›wegen seiner Kränklichkeit‹,
würde ihn sein gesundes Aussehen und sein kräftiger Körperbau stark
Lügen gestraft haben. Er stellte sich als Erfinder einer Verbesserung
an Telephonen vor, der durch Verkauf des bezüglichen Patents sich
seinen Lebensunterhalt zu verdienen hoffte. »Heutzutage,« sagte er,
»kann jeder, der Lust hat, einen Telegraphendraht anzapfen, welcher ein
Lied oder ein Konzert aus einem Staate in einen andern leitet, sein
eigenes Telephon daranhängen und diebisch jene Musik anhören, während
sie vorübergleitet. Meine Erfindung wird dem ein Ende machen.«

»Nun,« antwortete Alonzo, »was kann dem Eigentümer der Musik daran
liegen, wenn ihm der Diebstahl nichts schadet?«

»Nichts,« sagte der Hochwürdige.

»Nun, also?« sagte Alonzo fragend.

»Angenommen aber,« antwortete der Hochwürdige, -- »angenommen, daß
statt der Musik, die im Vorübergleiten gestohlen werden kann, der Draht
Liebeszärtlichkeiten geheimster und heiligster Natur aussendet?«

Alonzo schauderte vom Scheitel bis zur Zehe. »Mein Herr, ich verstehe,
Ihre Erfindung ist unbezahlbar; ich muß sie haben -- um jeden Preis.«

Aber die Erfindung, welche aus Cincinnati bestellt war, wollte nicht
eintreffen. Alonzo verging vor Ungeduld: der Gedanke, daß Rosannahs
liebe Worte von irgend einem elenden Neugierigen geteilt würden,
war ihm eine Folter. Der Hochwürdige kam häufig und beklagte den
Verzug und sprach von Maßregeln, die er getroffen, um die Ankunft zu
beschleunigen. Das war ein kleiner Trost für Alonzo.

Eines Vormittags stieg der Hochwürdige die Treppe hinan und klopfte
an Alonzos Thür: es erfolgte keine Antwort. Er trat ein, blickte
forschend umher und eilte dann zum Telephon. Die ausnehmend sanften
fernen Töne des ›~Sweet By-and-By~‹ fluteten durch das Instrument. Die
Sängerin nahm wie gewöhnlich die fünf Noten, die den beiden ersten im
Chor folgten, um einen halben Ton zu tief, als der Hochwürdige sie --
in einer Stimme, welche diejenige Alonzos täuschend, nur mit einem
entfernten Anflug von Ungeduld, nachahmte -- plötzlich unterbrach:

»Mein Schatz?«

»Ja, Alonzo?«

»Bitte, singe das in dieser Woche nicht mehr, -- probiere etwas
Modernes.«

Ein leichter Schritt, wie er zu einem glücklichen Herzen paßt, wurde
jetzt auf der Treppe hörbar, worauf der Hochwürdige teuflisch lächelnd
rasch Zuflucht hinter den schweren Falten der sammetnen Fenstervorhänge
suchte. Alonzo trat ein, flog zum Telephon und sagte:

»Liebste Rosannah, wollen wir zusammen singen?«

»Etwas _Modernes_?« gab sie mit sarkastischer Bitterkeit zurück.

»Ja, wenn dir's recht ist!«

»Singen Sie's selbst, wenn es Ihnen beliebt!«

Dieses schnippische Wesen verblüffte und verletzte den jungen Mann. Er
sagte: --

»Rosannah, das sah dir nicht ähnlich.«

»Ich denke, es steht mir ebenso wohl an, als Ihre höfliche Rede Ihnen
anstand, Herr Fitz Clarence.«

»Herr Fitz Clarence! Rosannah, es lag nichts Unhöfliches in meinen
Worten.«

»O, wirklich! Dann habe ich Sie natürlich falsch verstanden und muß Sie
demütig um Verzeihung bitten, ha -- ha -- ha! Ohne Zweifel sagten Sie:
›Singe es _heute_ nicht mehr.‹«

»Singe heute -- _was_ nicht mehr?«

»Natürlich das Lied, das Sie erwähnten. Wie begriffsstutzig wir
plötzlich sind!«

»Ich erwähnte gar kein Lied.«

»O, wirklich nicht?«

»Nein, wirklich nicht!«

»Ich sehe mich zu der Bemerkung gezwungen, daß Sie es _thaten_!«

»Und ich sehe mich nochmals zu der Erklärung gezwungen, daß ich's
_nicht_ that.«

»Eine zweite Grobheit! Das genügt, mein Herr. Ich werde Ihnen nie
vergeben: alles ist aus zwischen uns.«

Dann hörte man ein verhaltenes Schluchzen. Alonzo sagte hastig:

»O, Rosannah, nimm diese Worte zurück! Dahinter steckt ein
schreckliches Geheimnis, irgend ein entsetzliches Mißverständnis. Im
vollen Ernst und ganz aufrichtig gesagt, ich habe nichts von einem
Lied erwähnt. Ich möchte dich um alles in der Welt nicht verletzen ...
Rosannah, Liebste? ... O, sprich mit mir, ich bitte dich!«

Es folgte eine Pause; dann hörte Alonzo des Mädchens Schluchzen wie
aus weiter Ferne; sie hatte sich vom Telephon zurückgezogen. Er erhob
sich mit einem schweren Seufzer und eilte aus dem Zimmer, vor sich
hinmurmelnd: »Ich muß meine Mutter aufsuchen. Sie wird ihr hoffentlich
die Ueberzeugung beibringen, daß ich sie nicht verletzen wollte.«

Eine Minute später krümmte sich der Ehrwürdige über das Telephon, wie
eine Katze, welche die Wege ihrer Beute kennt. Er brauchte nicht lange
zu warten; nach einigen Minuten hörte man eine sanfte, bereuende, von
Thränen zitternde Stimme sagen:

»Lieber Alonzo, ich hatte unrecht; du kannst etwas so Grausames nicht
gesagt haben. Es muß jemand gewesen sein, der deine Stimme im Scherz
oder aus Bosheit nachahmte.«

Der Hochwürdige antwortete kalt in Alonzos Stimme:

»Sie haben gesagt, daß alles zwischen uns vorüber ist; und so sei es.
Ich verschmähe Ihre angebotene Reue und verachte Sie!«

Dann entfernte er sich, strahlend vor Triumph, um nie mehr mit seiner
vorgeblichen Telephonverbesserung zurückzukehren.

Vier Stunden später kam Alonzo, der seine Mutter bei Bekannten hatte
suchen müssen, zurück. Sie riefen ihre Angehörigen in San Francisco
an, aber es erfolgte keine Antwort. Sie warteten und warteten am
sprachlosen Telephon.

Endlich, als in San Francisco die Sonne unterging, drei und eine halbe
Stunde nach der Dämmerung in Eastport, erfolgte eine Antwort auf den
oft wiederholten Ruf: ›Rosannah!‹

Aber ach! es war Tante Susannes Stimme, die sprach:

»War den ganzen Tag nicht zu Hause; bin eben heimgekehrt. Will sie
sogleich aufsuchen.«

Die Harrenden warteten zwei -- fünf -- zehn Minuten; dann kamen in
erschrockenem Ton folgende verhängnisvolle Worte: --

»Sie ist fort, und ihr Gepäck mit ihr, um eine auswärtige Freundin
zu besuchen, wie sie den Dienstboten sagte. Auf dem Tisch in ihrem
Zimmer aber fand ich eine Notiz mit den Worten: ›Ich bin gegangen;
forscht mir nicht nach; mein Herz ist gebrochen; ihr werdet mich nimmer
wiedersehen. Sagt ihm, ich werde immer an ihn denken, wenn ich mein
armes ›~Sweet By-and-By~‹ singe, nie aber an die unfreundlichen Worte,
die er darüber gesprochen.‹ So lautet ihre Mitteilung. Alonzo, Alonzo,
was hat das zu bedeuten? Was ist geschehen?«

Alonzo aber saß blaß und starr da wie eine Leiche. Seine Mutter zog
die sammetnen Vorhänge zurück und öffnete ein Fenster. Die kalte Luft
erfrischte den Leidenden, und er erzählte seiner Tante seine trübselige
Geschichte. Mittlerweile besichtigte seine Mutter eine Visitenkarte,
die auf dem Fußboden zum Vorschein gekommen war, als sie die Vorhänge
zurückzog. Auf der Karte stand: Sidney Algernon Burley, San Francisco.

»Der Schurke!« rief Alonzo und stürzte hinaus, um den falschen
Hochwürdigen zu suchen und zu vernichten. Die Karte erklärte alles,
denn die Liebenden hatten im Verlaufe ihrer gegenseitigen Bekenntnisse
einander alles erzählt von den Liebsten, die sie je gehabt, und
all ihre Mängel und Schwächen unbarmherzig verdammt -- das ist bei
Liebenden so Brauch: es hat einen eigenen Reiz für sie, und er kommt
gleich nach dem des Girrens und Schnäbelns.


IV.

Während der nächsten zwei Monate ereignete sich viel. Es war bald
kund geworden, daß Rosannah (die arme duldende Waise!) weder zu
ihrer Großmutter zu Portland in Oregon zurückgekehrt war, noch
ihr irgendwelche Nachricht gesandt hatte, außer einer Abschrift
der leidvollen Notiz, die sie in dem Hause auf Telegraph Hill
zurückgelassen hatte. Wer ihr auch ein Obdach gewährte, -- wenn
sie noch lebte, -- war ohne Zweifel von ihr beredet worden, ihren
Aufenthalt nicht zu verraten, denn alle Versuche, sie aufzufinden,
waren mißlungen.



Gab Alonzo sie auf? Keineswegs. Er sagte bei sich: »Sie wird jenes
holde Lied singen, wenn sie schwermütig ist; ich werde sie finden.« Und
so nahm er seinen Reisesack und ein tragbares Telephon und schüttelte
den Schnee seiner Vaterstadt von seinen Füßen und ging hinaus in die
Welt. Er wanderte weit und breit hin und her und durch viele Staaten;
wieder und wieder blickten Fremde erstaunt auf einen abgezehrten,
blassen, melancholischen Mann, der mühevoll an winterlichen und
einsamen Orten eine Telegraphenstange erklomm, dort traurig eine Stunde
saß mit dem Ohr an einem kleinen Kästchen, dann seufzend herabkam und
müde weiterwanderte. Manchmal wurde auf ihn geschossen, weil man ihn
für verrückt und gefährlich hielt. Seine Kleider wurden von Kugeln
zerfetzt und er selber am Ende schwer verletzt; aber er ertrug alles
geduldig.

So verflossen langsam sieben Wochen, und endlich ergriffen ihn einige
Menschenfreunde und brachten ihn in eine Privatirrenanstalt zu New
York. Er wehklagte nicht, denn alle seine Kraft war dahin, und mit ihr
aller Mut und alle Hoffnung. Der Oberaufseher trat ihm mitleidig seine
eigenen behaglichen Gemächer, Wohn- und Schlafzimmer ab und pflegte ihn
mit liebender Hingebung.

Nach Verlauf einer Woche war der Patient imstande, zum erstenmale das
Bett zu verlassen. Er lag, auf Kissen gestützt, bequem auf dem Sofa
und lauschte den Klagelauten der frostigen Märzwinde und dem dumpfen
Ton der Fußtritte auf der Straße drunten, -- denn es war etwa sechs
Uhr abends, und New York ging von der Arbeit heim. Er hatte ein helles
Feuer und zur Erhöhung der Behaglichkeit zwei Studierlampen, und so war
es warm und behaglich drinnen, wenn auch draußen frostig und rauh.

Ein schwaches Lächeln glitt über Alonzos Antlitz bei dem Gedanken,
daß seine Streifereien aus Liebe ihn in den Augen der Welt zu einem
Verrückten gemacht hatten, und er wollte eben seinen Gedankengang
weiter verfolgen, als eine schwache, holde Melodie -- sozusagen ein
Tonschatten, so fern und dünn schien sie -- an sein Ohr schlug. Seine
Pulse hörten auf zu schlagen; er lauschte mit offenen Lippen und
verhaltenem Atem. Das Lied tönte weiter -- er harrte, lauschte, erhob
sich langsam und unbewußt aus seiner Rückenlage und rief endlich
frohlockend aus:

»Sie ist's! sie ist's! O, die göttlichen, um einen halben Ton zu tiefen
Noten!«

Er schleppte sich begierig zu der Ecke, aus der die Töne kamen, riß
einen Vorhang auf die Seite und entdeckte ein Telephon. Er beugte sich
darüber, und als die letzte Note erstarb, brach er in den lauten Ausruf
aus:

»O, dem Himmel sei Dank, endlich gefunden! Sprich mit mir, teuerste
Rosannah! Das qualvolle Geheimnis ist enthüllt; es war der schurkische
Burley, der meine Stimme nachahmte und dich mit unverschämter Rede
beleidigte!«

Es folgte eine atemlose Pause, für den wartenden Alonzo ein
Menschenalter; dann kam ein schwacher Laut, der sich zur Rede formte:

»O, sage diese köstlichen Worte nochmals, Alonzo!«

»Sie sind die Wahrheit, die reinste Wahrheit, meine Rosannah, und du
sollst den Beweis haben, glänzenden und vollen Beweis!«

»O, Alonzo, bleibe bei mir! Verlasse mich keinen Augenblick! Laß mich
fühlen, daß du mir nahe bist! Sage mir, daß wir nie wieder getrennt
sein sollen! O, diese glückliche Stunde, diese gesegnete, denkwürdige
Stunde!«

»Wir wollen sie uns ins Gedächtnis einprägen, meine Rosannah; jedes
Jahr, wenn die Uhr diese Stunde schlägt, werden wir sie mit Dankgebeten
feiern, unser ganzes Leben lang.«

»Das wollen wir, Alonzo, -- ja, das wollen wir!«

»Vier Minuten nach sechs Uhr abends, meine Rosannah, soll hinfort -- --«

»Zwölf Uhr dreiundzwanzig Minuten nachmittags -- --«

»Ei, Rosannah, mein Schatz, wo bist du denn?«

»In Honolulu auf den Sandwichsinseln. Und wo bist du? Bleibe bei mir;
verlasse mich keinen Augenblick! Ich könnt' es nicht ertragen. Bist du
daheim?«

»Nein, Teure, ich bin in New York -- ein Patient in ärztlicher
Behandlung.«

Ein qualvoller Schrei drang in Alonzos Ohr, es klang wie das scharfe
Summen einer verletzten Fliege: die Reise von ein paar tausend Meilen
hatte die Kraft des Lautes abgeschwächt. Alonzo sagte rasch:

»Beruhige dich, mein Kind. Es ist nichts; ich werde bereits wieder
gesund durch die Heilkraft deiner holden Nähe. -- Meine Rosannah!«

»Ja, Alonzo? O, wie du mich erschreckt hast! Fahre fort.«

»Bestimme den Hochzeitstag, Rosannah!«

Es folgte eine kleine Pause; dann antwortete eine schüchterne, leise
Stimme: »Ich erröte -- aber vor Freude, vor Glück. Möchtest du es gerne
bald haben?«

»Noch in dieser Nacht, Rosannah! nur nicht das Wagnis eines weiteren
Verzuges! Warum nicht gleich? -- noch in dieser Nacht, in diesem
Augenblick!«

»O, du ungeduldiger Mann! Ich habe niemand hier als meinen guten alten
Onkel, einen früheren Missionar -- niemand als ihn und seine Frau. Es
würde mir so von Herzen lieb sein, wenn deine Mutter und deine Tante
Susanne -- --«

»_Unsere_ Mutter und _unsere_ Tante Susanne, meine Rosannah!«

»Ja, _unsere_ Mutter und _unsere_ Tante Susanne -- ich will gerne so
sagen, wenn es dir recht ist; es wäre mir so lieb, wenn sie bei der
Trauung zugegen wären.«

»Ich möchte es auch. Wie wär's, wenn du an Tante Susanne
telegraphiertest? Wie lange würde es dauern, bis sie käme?«

»Der Dampfer geht übermorgen von San Francisco ab und ist acht Tage
unterwegs; sie würde also am 31. März hier sein.«

»Dann bestimme den 1. April, teuerste Rosannah!«

»Ums Himmels willen, Alonzo, da würden wir ja zu Aprilnarren!«

»Wir würden dann jedenfalls die glücklichsten, welche die Sonne jenes
Tages auf dem ganzen weiten Erdenrund bescheint; was ficht's uns also
an? Sage am 1. April, Teure.«

»Nun denn, von Herzen gern, der 1. April soll es sein.«

»Wie herrlich! Bestimme auch die Stunde, Rosannah.«

»Ich liebe den Morgen mit seiner Frische und Heiterkeit. Paßt es dir um
acht Uhr morgens, Alonzo?«

»Die schönste Stunde des Tages -- da sie dich zu der meinigen macht.«

Es folgte eine Pause, während welcher ein Ton hörbar war, als
ob körperlose Geister Küsse austauschten; dann sagte Rosannah:
»Entschuldige mich nur für einen Augenblick, Lieber; ich muß einen
Besuch erwarten, drüben im andern Zimmer.«

Das junge Mädchen eilte in das Besuchszimmer und nahm an einem Fenster
Platz, das die Aussicht auf eine schöne Landschaft gewährte. Zur
Linken konnte man das hübsche Nuuanathal, eingesäumt von einer üppigen
Fülle tropischer Blumen und graziöser Kokospalmen, überschauen;
die anstoßenden niederen Hügel waren in das leuchtende Grün von
Zitronen- und Orangenbäumen gekleidet; die geschichtlich berühmte
Schlucht drüben, in welche der erste Kamehameha seine dem Untergange
geweihten Feinde hineintrieb, hatte wahrscheinlich ihre grausige
Geschichte vergessen, denn wie gewöhnlich am Mittag wölbte sich eine
Anzahl von Regenbogen über ihr. Gerade vor dem Fenster sah man die
wunderlich gebaute Stadt und hie und da eine Gruppe von dunkelfarbenen
Eingeborenen, die sich des fast unerträglich heißen Wetters freuten;
und weitab zur Rechten lag der ruhelose Ozean, der seine weiße Mähne im
Sonnenscheine schüttelte.

Rosannah saß wartend da, in ihrem leichten weißen Gewand, und fächelte
ihr erregtes und erhitztes Gesicht; endlich steckte ein halbnackter,
mit einem Cylinderhut bedeckter Kanakenknabe den Kopf zur Thür herein
und meldete: »Herr aus 'Friesko!«[8]

    [8] Abkürzung für San Francisco.

»Weise ihn herein,« sagte das Mädchen, indem sie sich aufrichtete und
eine entschiedene Haltung annahm. Herr Sidney Algernon Burley trat
ein, von Kopf bis zu Fuß in blendendes Weiß, d. h. in die leichteste
und weißeste irische Leinwand gekleidet. Er trat rasch heran, aber das
Mädchen machte eine Bewegung mit der Hand und warf ihm einen Blick
zu, der ihn plötzlich stehen bleiben ließ. Sie sagte kalt: »Ich bin
hier, wie ich versprach. Ich glaubte Ihren Versicherungen, gab ihrem
ungestümen Drängen nach und sagte, ich würde den Tag bestimmen. Ich
bestimme den 1. April um acht Uhr des morgens. Und nun gehen Sie.«

»O, meine Teuerste, wenn die Dankbarkeit einer Lebenszeit -- --«

»Kein Wort mehr. Erlassen Sie mir Ihren Anblick und jeden Verkehr mit
Ihnen bis zu jener Stunde. Nein -- keine Bitten; ich will es so haben.«

Als er fort war, sank sie erschöpft in einen Stuhl, denn die lange
Belagerung des Kummers, die sie ausgehalten, hatte ihre Kraft
geschwächt. Gleich darauf sagte sie: »Mit knapper Not entkommen! Wenn
er eine Stunde früher gekommen wäre, -- -- es schaudert mich, wenn ich
daran denke! Denken zu müssen, daß es mit mir dahin gekommen wäre,
daß ich mir einbildete, dieses betrügerische, dieses falsche, dieses
verräterische Ungeheuer zu lieben! O, er soll seine Schurkerei bereuen!«

Wir wollen diese Geschichte jetzt rasch zu Ende führen, denn es ist nur
weniges noch zu sagen. Am 2. April enthielt der Honoluluer ›Anzeiger‹
folgende Notiz:

»_Verheiratet._ -- Dahier, per Telephon, gestern früh um acht
Uhr, durch den hochwürdigen Herrn Nathan Hays, unter Assistenz des
hochwürdigen Herrn Nathaniel Davis zu New York, Herr Alonzo Fitz
Clarence von Eastport in Maine, mit Fräulein Ethelton von Portland
in Oregon. Zugegen war Frau Susanne Howland von San Francisco, eine
Freundin der Braut, gegenwärtig zu Gast bei Herrn und Frau Hays,
dem Onkel und der Tante der Braut. Auch Herr Sidney Algernon Burley
von San Francisco war zugegen, blieb aber nicht bis zum Schluß der
Trauungsfeierlichkeit. Kapitän Hawthornes hübsche und geschmackvoll
dekorierte Yacht wartete im Hafen, und die glückliche Braut und ihre
Freunde brachen gleich darauf zu einem Ausflug nach Lahaina und
Haleakala auf.«



Die New Yorker Zeitungen vom selben Datum enthielten folgende Notiz:

»_Verheiratet._ -- Dahier, gestern, per Telephon, um halb drei Uhr in
der Frühe, durch den hochw. Herrn Nathaniel Davis, unter Assistenz
des hochw. Herrn Nathan Hays zu Honolulu, Herr Alonzo Fitz Clarence
von Eastport in Maine und Fräulein Rosannah Ethelton von Portland in
Oregon. Die Eltern und mehrere Freunde des Bräutigams waren zugegen.
Nachdem die Gesellschaft ein festliches Frühstück genossen und sich bis
gegen Sonnenaufgang vergnügt unterhalten, brach sie zu einem Ausflug
nach dem Aquarium auf, da des Bräutigams Gesundheitszustand keine
ausgedehntere Reise zuläßt.«

Gegen das Ende jenes denkwürdigen Tages waren Herr und Frau Alonzo
Fitz Clarence in ein zärtliches Gespräch über die Vergnügungen ihrer
beiderseitigen Hochzeitsausflüge vertieft, als plötzlich die junge Frau
ausrief: »O Lonny, ich vergaß ganz! Ich that, was ich mir vorgenommen.«

»Was, Geliebte?«

»Ich machte _ihn_ zum Aprilnarren! Und ich sagte es ihm auch! O, es
war eine reizende Ueberraschung! Da stand er, schmorend in einem
schwarzen Anzug, während das Thermometer oben zur Röhre hinauswollte,
in Erwartung der Trauung. Du hättest die Miene sehen sollen, die er
machte, als ich es ihm ins Ohr flüsterte! Ach, seine Verruchtheit hatte
mir viel Herzeleid gebracht und manche Thräne erpreßt; aber in jenem
Augenblick war alles quitt. Das Gefühl der Rache wich gänzlich aus
meinem Herzen und ich lud ihn ein zu bleiben und sagte, ich habe ihm
alles vergeben; aber er wollte nicht. Er schwur, sich grimmig zu rächen
und unser Leben zu einem Fluch für uns zu machen. Aber das _kann_ er
nicht, mein Teuerster, nicht wahr?«

»Niemals in dieser Welt, meine Rosannah,« antwortete Alonzo innig. --

       *       *       *       *       *

Tante Susanne, die Großmutter in Oregon, das junge Paar und ihre
Mutter zu Eastport sind alle glücklich, während ich dies schreibe, und
werden es wohl auch bleiben. Tante Susanne holte die Braut von den
Sandwichsinseln ab, begleitete sie über den amerikanischen Kontinent
und hatte das Glück, die entzückte Begegnung zweier sich anbetender
Ehegatten mitanzusehen, die bis dahin einander nie gesehen hatten.

Ein Wort über den nichtswürdigen Burley, dessen verruchte Ränke
beinahe die Herzen unseres lieben jungen Paares gebrochen und ihr
Leben elend gemacht hätten, wird genügen. Bei einem Anfall auf einen
verkrüppelten und hilflosen Arbeiter, der ihm, wie er sich einbildete,
eine geringfügige Beleidigung angethan hatte, zersprang sein Revolver
und tötete ihn auf der Stelle.




Die kapitolinische Venus.


Erstes Kapitel.

(Ort der Handlung: das Atelier eines Künstlers in Rom.)

»O George, wie liebe ich dich!«

»Meine Mary, mein geliebtes Herz, ich weiß es. Warum ist dein Vater so
unerbittlich?«

»George, er meint es gut, aber ihm ist die Kunst eine Thorheit;
er versteht nur den Spezereihandel. Er meint, ich würde bei dir
verhungern.«

»Verwünscht sei seine Klugheit! Warum bin ich nicht ein geldmachender,
herzloser Gewürzkrämer, statt eines gottbegabten Bildhauers -- der
nichts zu essen hat!«

»Verzage nur nicht, mein George! -- Alle seine Vorurteile werden
schwinden, sobald du erst einmal fünfzigtausend Dollars erworb -- --«

»Fünfzigtausend Teufel! -- Kind, ich bin mein Kostgeld noch
schuldig!« --


Zweites Kapitel.

(Ort der Handlung: eine Wohnung in Rom.)

»Geehrter Herr, alles Reden ist unnütz. Ich habe nichts gegen Sie; aber
ich kann meine Tochter nicht an ein Ragout von Liebe, Kunst und Hunger
verheiraten -- und sonst haben Sie, glaube ich, nichts zu bieten.«

»Mein Herr, ich bin arm, ich leugne es nicht. Aber hat denn der Ruhm
keinen Wert? Der Senator Belem Fyoodle von Arkansas sagt, daß meine
neue Statue der Amerika ein treffliches Werk der Bildhauerkunst ist und
er die Ueberzeugung hegt, mein Name werde noch einmal berühmt werden.«

»Leeres Geschwätz! Was versteht der Esel aus Arkansas davon? -- Auf
den Marktpreis Ihrer marmornen Vogelscheuche kommt es an. Sechs Monate
haben Sie daran herumgemeißelt und jetzt giebt Ihnen keiner hundert
Dollars dafür. Nein, mein Herr. Weisen Sie mir fünfzigtausend Dollars
vor und Sie können meine Tochter haben -- andernfalls heiratet sie den
jungen Simper. Sie haben sechs Monate Zeit, die Summe herbeizuschaffen.
-- Guten Morgen, mein Herr.« --

       *       *       *       *       *

»Ach, ich Unglücklicher!«


Drittes Kapitel.

(Ort der Handlung: das Atelier.)

»O John, Freund meiner Knabenjahre! Ich bin der unseligste der
Menschen.«

»Ein Einfaltspinsel bist du!«

»Nichts bleibt mir, das ich lieben könnte, als meine Statue der Amerika
-- und ach! selbst sie zeigt kein Mitgefühl für mich in ihren kalten
Gesichtszügen -- so schön und so herzlos!«

»Du bist ein Narr!«

»O John!«

»O Unsinn! -- Hast du nicht gesagt, du hättest sechs Monate Zeit, um
das Geld zusammen zu bringen?«

»Spotte nicht meiner Qual, John. Wenn ich sechs Jahrhunderte hätte, was
würde es mir nützen? Was könnte es einem armen Schlucker ohne Namen,
ohne Kapital, ohne Freunde helfen?«

»Hasenfuß, Kindskopf, Feigling, der du bist! Sechs Monate, um die Summe
herbeizuschaffen, und fünf sind genug!«

»Bist du von Sinnen?«

»Sechs Monate -- Zeit die Fülle! überlasse mir's -- ich verschaffe sie
dir.« --

»Was sprichst du, John? Wie in aller Welt willst du eine so ungeheure
Summe für mich auftreiben?« --

»Das laß meine Sorge sein, du darfst dich gar nicht hineinmischen!
Willst du die ganze Sache in meine Hände legen? Willst du geloben, dich
allem zu unterwerfen, was ich thue? Willst du mir schwören, alle meine
Handlungen gut zu heißen?«

»Mir schwindelt -- es wird mir schwarz vor den Augen -- aber -- ich
schwöre!«

Hierauf ergreift John einen Hammer und schlägt der Amerika mit der
größten Ruhe die Nase ab. Er holt noch einmal aus und zwei ihrer
Finger liegen auf dem Boden; noch ein Streich und von dem einen Ohr
fliegt ein Stück ab; noch einer und eine Reihe Zehen sind zertrümmert
und abgehauen; ein letzter Hammerschlag und das linke Bein, vom Knie
abwärts, liegt als Trümmerhaufen da.

John nimmt seinen Hut und geht.

       *       *       *       *       *

George starrt dreißig Sekunden lang sprachlos auf die verstümmelte
Greuelgestalt, die vor ihm steht, dann wälzt er sich in Krämpfen am
Boden.



Bald darauf kehrt John mit einem Wagen zurück, ladet den Künstler mit
dem gebrochenen Herzen, sowie die Statue mit dem gebrochenen Bein
auf und fährt in aller Gemütsruhe leise pfeifend davon. Den Künstler
schafft er nach dessen Wohnung, fährt mit der Statue weiter und
verschwindet mit ihr die ~Via Quirinalis~ hinunter.


Viertes Kapitel.

(Ort der Handlung: das Atelier.)

»Heute um zwei Uhr sind die sechs Monate um. O Höllenqual! Mein Leben
ist vernichtet! Ich wollte, ich wäre tot! Gestern nicht zu Nacht
gegessen -- heute kein Frühstück! Ich wage mich in kein Speisehaus
hinein. Aber hungrig bin ich -- o, still davon! -- Mein Schuster
plagt mich bis aufs Blut -- mein Schneider liegt mir in den Ohren --
mein Hauswirt mahnt mich zu zahlen. Wie elend bin ich! John habe ich
seit jenem entsetzlichen Tage nicht wieder gesehen. _Sie_ lächelt mir
zärtlich zu, wenn wir uns auf einer der Hauptstraßen begegnen, aber auf
den grausamen Wink ihres Vaters mit dem Kieselherzen muß sie gleich
nach der andern Seite sehen. -- Horch! Wer klopft an der Thür? Wer
verfolgt mich schon wieder? Gewiß dieser boshafte Halunke, der Schuster
-- Herein!«

       *       *       *       *       *

»Ach -- Glück und Segen über Ew. Hoheit! Der Himmel beschütze Ew.
Gnaden. Ich habe Dero neue Stiefel gebracht. -- Bitte -- von Bezahlung
ist gar nicht die Rede -- damit hat es keine Eile -- nicht die
allergeringste; ich werde stolz sein, wenn der gnädige Herr mich auch
fernerhin mit seiner Kundschaft beehren will -- ergebenster Diener --
empfehle mich unterthänigst.«

»Er bringt die Stiefel selbst! Braucht keine Bezahlung! Empfiehlt
sich mit einem Kratzfuß wie für eine Majestät. Wünscht meine fernere
Kundschaft! Steht denn das Ende der Welt bevor? Was bei allen --
Herein!«

»Verzeihung, Signore, aber ich bringe Ihren neuen Anzug zum --«

»Herein!!«

»Bitte tausendmal um Entschuldigung, wenn ich störe, gnädiger
Herr. Ich habe die Reihe schöner Zimmer im unteren Stock für Sie
hergerichtet. Dieses elende Loch paßt ja durchaus nicht für --«

»Herein!!!«

»Ich komme Ihnen zu melden, daß Ihr Kredit in unserem Bankhause, der
leider seit einiger Zeit unterbrochen war, in durchaus befriedigender
Weise aufs neue wieder eröffnet ist. Wir stehen mit Vergnügen zu Ihren
Diensten, welchen Betrag Sie auch zu entnehmen wünschen --«

»Herein!!!!«

»Mein wackerer Junge! Sie ist die Deinige! Sogleich wird sie hier sein.
Nimm sie, heirate sie, liebe sie, seid glücklich! Gott segne euch
beide. Hurra! Hoch!«

»Herein!!!!!«

»O George, mein Geliebter, wir sind gerettet!«

»O Mary, mein teures Herz, wir sind gerettet! Aber, bei meiner Seele --
ich weiß weder warum noch wie!« --


Fünftes Kapitel.

(Ort der Handlung: ein Kaffeehaus in Rom.)

    Mehrere amerikanische Herren sitzen beisammen. Einer derselben
    liest und übersetzt aus dem Wochenblatt: ~Il Slangwhanger di
    Roma~ den folgenden Artikel:

    _Wunderbare Entdeckung._

    »Vor etwa sechs Monaten kaufte Herr John Smith, ein Amerikaner,
    seit einigen Jahren in Rom wohnhaft, für eine unbedeutende
    Summe ein kleines Stück Land in der Campagna, gerade hinter
    dem Grabmal der Familie Scipio, von dem Eigentümer, einem
    bankerotten Verwandten der Prinzessin Borghese. Hierauf begab
    sich Herr Smith zum Minister der öffentlichen Angelegenheiten
    und ließ das Grundstück auf einen armen amerikanischen Künstler
    Namens George Arnold übertragen, indem er erklärte, er thäte
    das als Vergütung und Ersatz für einen baren Schaden,
    welchen er vor langer Zeit zufällig an Herrn Arnolds Eigentum
    angerichtet habe. Auch fügte er hinzu, er wolle, um den Herrn
    völlig zufrieden zu stellen, verschiedene Verbesserungen auf
    dem Grundstück für eigene Rechnung ausführen lassen.

    Vor vier Wochen nun, bei Gelegenheit einer notwendigen
    Umgrabung auf dem Grundstück, förderte Herr Smith die
    herrlichste antike Statue zu Tage, welche jemals den reichen
    Kunstschätzen Roms hinzugefügt worden ist. Es war eine
    wundervolle Frauengestalt, die, obgleich auf traurige Weise im
    Erdboden von dem Moder der Jahrhunderte beschädigt, dennoch
    jedes Auge durch ihre hinreißende Schönheit entzücken muß.
    Die Nase, das linke Bein vom Knie an, ein Ohr, zwei Finger
    einer Hand, sowie die Zehen des rechten Fußes fehlen; im
    übrigen ist die edle Gestalt aber wunderbar gut erhalten. Die
    Regierung sandte sofort eine Wache ab, um Beschlag auf die
    Statue zu legen und setzte eine Kommission von Kunstkennern,
    Altertumsforschern und Kirchenfürsten ein, um ihren Wert
    abzuschätzen und die Höhe der Entschädigung zu bestimmen,
    welche dem Besitzer des Grund und Bodens gebühre, auf dem sie
    gefunden worden. Bis zum gestrigen Abend herrschte über die
    ganze Angelegenheit das tiefste Geheimnis und die Kommission
    hielt ihre Sitzungen bei verschlossenen Thüren. Schließlich war
    einstimmig festgestellt, daß die Statue eine Venus sei und von
    einem unbekannten aber hochbegabten Künstler aus dem dritten
    Jahrhundert vor Christo herrühre. Sie ward für das tadelloseste
    Kunstwerk erklärt, das die Welt je gesehen hat.

    Um Mitternacht erfolgte die Schlußberatung, in welcher die
    Venus auf die ungeheure Summe von zehn Millionen Franken
    geschätzt ward. Da nach römischem Gesetz und Brauch der
    Staat zur Hälfte Eigentümer aller in der Campagna gefundenen
    Kunstschätze ist, so hat die Regierung weiter nichts zu thun,
    als Herrn Arnold fünf Millionen Franken zu zahlen und dauernden
    Besitz von der schönen Statue zu nehmen. Heute morgen wird die
    Venus auf das Kapitol geschafft und dort bleibend aufgestellt
    werden. Am Nachmittag begiebt sich darauf die Kommission
    zu Herrn Arnold, um ihm eine Anweisung für die päpstliche
    Schatzkammer zu übergeben, welche auf die fürstliche Summe von
    fünf Millionen Franken in Gold lautet.«

_Chor von Stimmen_: »Ein unerhörtes Glück. So etwas ist noch gar nie
dagewesen!«

_Eine Stimme_: »Meine Herren, ich schlage vor, daß wir sofort eine
amerikanische Aktiengesellschaft gründen zur Erwerbung von Landbesitz
und Ausgrabung von Bildwerken. Für rechtzeitiges Steigen und Fallen der
Papiere sollen unsere New Yorker Börsenagenten Sorge tragen.«

_Alle_: »Einverstanden!«




Sechstes Kapitel.

(Ort der Handlung: das römische Kapitol.)

(Zehn Jahre später.)

»Teure Mary, dies ist die berühmteste Statue der Welt, die gefeierte
›kapitolinische Venus‹, von der du so viel gehört hast. Da steht sie --
ihre kleinen Schäden sind restauriert, (das heißt ausgeflickt) durch
die angesehensten römischen Künstler. Die bloße Thatsache, daß sie an
einer so edlen Schöpfung jene bescheidenen Ausbesserungen vorgenommen
haben, wird ihrem Namen Glanz verleihen, so lange die Erde steht. Wie
sonderbar kommt er mir doch vor -- dieser Ort! Einen Tag vor dem, wo
ich zuletzt, vor zehn glücklichen Jahren, hier stand, -- war ich kein
reicher Mann. Gott bewahre! Ich besaß nicht einen roten Heller. Und
doch hatte ich mein redlich Thun dabei, daß Rom in den Besitz dieses
größten Werkes antiker Kunst gelangt ist, welches die Welt kennt.«

»Die angebetete, die gefeierte kapitolinische Venus! Und wie hoch
schätzte man ihren Wert -- auf zehn Millionen Franken, nicht wahr?«

»Ja -- _jetzt_.«

»Aber, George, sie ist auch göttlich schön!«

»Jawohl -- doch nichts gegen das, was sie war, ehe der treffliche John
Smith ihr das Bein zerbrach und die Nase abschlug. Erfindungsreicher
Smith! -- erleuchteter Smith! -- edler Smith! Urheber all unseres
Glücks! -- -- -- Aber Mary, um des Himmels willen, horch! -- Weißt du,
was das Röcheln bedeutet? -- Das Kleine hat den Keuchhusten und du
bringst es hierher! Wirst du denn niemals lernen auf Kinder acht geben?«


Schluß.

Die kapitolinische Venus steht noch auf dem Kapitol zu Rom und ist
immer noch das bezauberndste und berühmteste antike Kunstwerk,
dessen die Welt sich rühmen kann. Wenn der Leser jemals das Glück
haben sollte, davor zu stehen und in das übliche Entzücken darüber
auszubrechen, so möge ihn diese wahre und geheime Geschichte ihres
Ursprungs bei dem Genuß nicht stören.

Wer aber von dem ›Versteinerten Menschen‹ liest, der bei Syracuse im
Staate New York oder anderswo ausgegraben worden ist, der sei auf
seiner Hut. Will der Barnum, der ihn dort eingegraben hat, ihn für eine
Unsumme verkaufen, so soll er sich damit an den Papst wenden.

       *       *       *       *       *

    _Anmerkung._ Obige Skizze wurde zu einer Zeit geschrieben,
    als der Schwindel mit dem ›Versteinerten Menschen‹ in Amerika
    Aufsehen erregte.




Mehr Glück als Verstand.

    (Anm. Dies ist keine erfundene Geschichte. Ein Geistlicher,
    der vor vierzig Jahren Lehrer an der englischen Kriegsschule
    in Woolwich war, hat sie mir erzählt und sich für die Wahrheit
    verbürgt. -- M. T.)


Es war in London bei dem Festmahl, das zu Ehren einer der wenigen
großen militärischen Berühmtheiten der Gegenwart gegeben wurde, welche
England besitzt. Den wahren Namen und Titel dieses Kriegshelden und
Inhabers der höchsten Orden verschweige ich aus Gründen, welche jedem
sofort einleuchten werden. Ich will ihn Generallieutenant Arthur
Scoresby nennen.

Welcher Reiz doch in einem berühmten Namen liegt! Dort saß der Mann in
Fleisch und Blut, von dem ich viel tausendmal gehört hatte, seit jenem
Tage vor über dreißig Jahren, als der Glanz seines Ruhmes plötzlich
von einem Schlachtfeld der Krim bis zu den Sternen emporstieg, um nie
wieder zu verblassen! Ich verwandte kein Auge von dem Halbgott; sein
Anblick war mir wie eine wahre Herzenserquickung, ich konnte mich nicht
satt an ihm sehen. Nichts entging meiner scharfen Beobachtung: ich sah
die Ruhe, die Zurückhaltung, den edlen Ernst seines Antlitzes, die
biedere Redlichkeit, die sich in seinem ganzen Wesen ausprägte. Dabei
schien er weder ein Bewußtsein von seiner eigenen Größe zu haben, noch
zu bemerken, wie viele bewundernde Blicke auf ihn gerichtet waren,
mit wie tiefer, aufrichtiger, liebevoller Verehrung die Herzen der
Versammelten ihm entgegenschlugen.



Zu meiner Rechten saß ein alter Bekannter von mir. Er war jetzt
Pfarrer, hatte jedoch nicht immer ein geistliches Amt bekleidet,
sondern sein halbes Leben als Lehrer in der Militärschule zu Woolwich
und im Feldlager zugebracht. In seinen Augen schimmerte ein seltsam
verschleierter Glanz, als er sich jetzt zu mir herabbog und auf den
Helden deutend, dem die Feier galt, mir verstohlen zuflüsterte:

»Im Vertrauen gesagt -- er ist ein Dummkopf, wie es keinen zweiten
giebt.«

Dieses Urteil überraschte mich aufs höchste. Wäre es über Napoleon,
Sokrates oder Salomo gefällt worden, mein Staunen hätte nicht größer
sein können. An der Wahrheitsliebe des Pfarrers zweifelte ich keinen
Augenblick, auch wußte ich, daß er große Menschenkenntnis besaß. Daher
stand es für mich sofort mit unumstößlicher Sicherheit fest, daß sich
die Welt in betreff dieses Helden im Irrtum befinden müsse: er war
wirklich ein Dummkopf. Mich interessierte nur noch, zu wissen, wie der
Pfarrer ganz allein und auf eigene Hand dies Geheimnis entdeckt habe.
Ich beschloß, mich bei nächster Gelegenheit danach zu erkundigen.

Einige Tage später that ich das und der Pfarrer erzählte folgendes:

»Vor vierzig Jahren war ich als Lehrer an der Militärschule zu Woolwich
und hörte in der Abteilung, bei welcher sich der junge Scoresby befand,
dem Probeexamen zu. Mit aufrichtigem Mitleid bemerkte ich, daß,
während seine Klassengefährten kluge und richtige Antworten gaben,
er sozusagen _gar nichts_ wußte. Er machte den Eindruck eines guten,
freundlichen, harmlosen und liebenswürdigen jungen Menschen und es war
mir höchst peinlich, ihn mit der größten Unbefangenheit Antworten geben
zu hören, die eine wahrhaft beispiellose Unwissenheit und Dummheit
verrieten. Voll innigem Mitgefühl sagte ich mir, daß er zwar beim
Examen bestimmt durchfallen müsse, es aber doch menschenfreundlich
wäre ihm beizustehen, damit seine Niederlage ihn nicht völlig zu Boden
schmettere.

»So nahm ich ihn denn besonders vor und entdeckte, daß er mit Cäsars
Geschichte einigermaßen vertraut war; da er im übrigen gar nichts
wußte, machte ich mich ans Werk und trichterte ihm, im Schweiße meines
Angesichts, ein Dutzend Antworten auf die herkömmlichen Fragen über
Cäsar ein. Und mit Hilfe dieser ganz oberflächlichen Einpaukerei --
sollte man sich so etwas vorstellen -- bestand er nicht nur sein Examen
glänzend, sondern erntete noch Lobsprüche obendrein, während andere,
die tausendmal mehr wußten als er, einfach durchfielen. Ein merkwürdig
glücklicher Zufall, wie er vielleicht im Laufe eines Jahrhunderts
nicht zum zweitenmal vorkommt, hatte nämlich gewollt, daß keine Frage
an ihn gerichtet wurde, auf welche ich ihm die Antwort nicht eingepaukt
hatte.

»So ging es auch mit den übrigen Fächern; ich lieh ihm meine
Hilfe, denn ich hatte Erbarmen mit ihm, wie eine Mutter mit ihrem
schwächlichen Kinde -- und siehe da -- jedesmal rettete er sich wie
durch ein Wunder vor dem Untergang.

»An der Mathematik mußte er jedoch schließlich Schiffbruch leiden, das
war klar. Ich beschloß, ihm den Sturz so erträglich zu machen, wie es
ging. Ich richtete ihn ab und stopfte in ihn hinein so viel ich konnte,
paukte ihm die Antwort ein, die der Examinator aller Wahrscheinlichkeit
nach verlangen würde, und überließ ihn dann seinem Schicksal. Nun
denken Sie sich meine Verwunderung und Bestürzung, als er den Preis
erhielt und alle Anwesenden seines Lobes voll waren.

»Mein Gewissen ließ mir Tag und Nacht keine Ruhe. Mir lag eine Last
auf der Seele als hätte ich ein Verbrechen begangen. Eine Woche lang
that ich kein Auge zu -- und doch hatte ich nur aus reinstem Mitleid
dem armen Jungen beigestanden, damit seine Niederlage nicht gar zu
kläglich werden möchte. Der Gedanke an ein so unerhörtes Ergebnis, wie
das vorliegende, wäre mir auch nicht im Traume gekommen. Es konnte die
verhängnisvollsten Folgen nach sich ziehen. Ich hatte einem völlig
vernagelten Menschen den Weg zur glänzendsten Laufbahn eröffnet,
vielleicht zu einer Stellung von der höchsten Verantwortlichkeit.
Vertraute man ihm aber einen solchen Posten an, so war er und seine
Sache bei dem ersten besten Anlaß unrettbar verloren.

»Der Krimkrieg war gerade ausgebrochen. Natürlich -- dachte ich bei
mir -- muß ein Krieg kommen, um jenem Dummkopf Gelegenheit zu geben,
sich totschießen zu lassen, bevor seine Unfähigkeit ans Licht kam. Ich
zitterte vor einem großen Krach -- und er blieb nicht aus. In der
Zeitung las ich, daß der Mensch zum Hauptmann ernannt worden war und
mit seinem Regiment ausrücken sollte. Andere Leute können alt und grau
werden, ehe sie zu solcher Höhe emporklimmen. Wie war es nur möglich,
daß man einer so unerfahrenen und ungeprüften Kraft eine derartige
Verantwortung auflud? -- Hätte man ihn zum Fähnrich gemacht, ich
würde mich vielleicht beruhigt haben -- aber zum Hauptmann -- das war
unerhört. Ich glaubte, mich solle der Schlag rühren.

»Nun hören Sie, was ich that -- ich, der ich Ruhe und Beschaulichkeit
über alles liebe. Ich sagte mir, daß _ich_ mein Vaterland in diese
Gefahr gebracht habe und es daher meine Pflicht sei, es, soweit es in
meiner Macht stehe, vor Scoresby zu schützen. So beschloß ich denn,
ihm nicht von der Seite zu weichen; ich nahm seufzend mein kleines
Kapital zur Hand, das ich mit jahrelanger harter Arbeit und strengster
Sparsamkeit erworben hatte, kaufte mir ein Fähnrichpatent in seiner
Kompagnie und fort ging es auf den Kriegsschauplatz.

»Aber dort -- du lieber Himmel -- was mußte ich erleben! Daß er einen
Mißgriff nach dem andern begehen würde, verstand sich von selbst.
Allein, niemand wußte um sein Geheimnis; man umgab ihn mit einem
falschen Nimbus und beurteilte alle seine Thaten von einem verkehrten
Gesichtspunkt aus -- die größten Dummheiten die er machte, galten für
geniale Eingebungen. Es war entsetzlich! Er ließ sich Versehen zu
Schulden kommen, von denen das geringste der Art war, daß wer nur den
gewöhnlichsten Menschenverstand besaß, darüber hätte weinen mögen. Das
that ich denn auch im geheimen; ja, ich weinte nicht nur, ich raste und
schäumte vor Wut.

»Was mich aber in förmlichen Angstschweiß versetzte, war die
Beobachtung, daß jeder neue Irrtum, in den er geriet, den Glanz
seines Namens nur vermehrte. ›Er wird so hoch steigen,‹ sagte ich
mir, ›daß man meint, die Sonne falle vom Himmel herunter, wenn die
unausbleibliche Entdeckung schließlich erfolgt.‹

»Ueber die Leichen seiner Vorgesetzten hinweg ward er von einer Stufe
zur andern befördert, bis endlich, im wildesten Gewühl der Schlacht bei
* * * unser Oberst vom Pferde sank. Alles Blut strömte mir zum Herzen
-- denn Scoresby war ihm im Rang der nächste. ›Jetzt ist der Augenblick
da,‹ dachte ich, ›noch zehn Minuten und wir sind alle zum Teufel.‹

»Die Schlacht tobte fürchterlich, überall gerieten die Verbündeten ins
Wanken. Unser Regiment nahm eine der wichtigsten Stellungen ein --
geschah jetzt ein Mißgriff, so waren wir vernichtet.

»Was aber that der Narr aller Narren in diesem entscheidungsvollen
Augenblick? -- Er ließ das Regiment ausrücken, um einen benachbarten
Hügel zu besetzen, auf welchem auch nicht die geringste Spur
feindlicher Truppen zu entdecken war.

»›Nur immer zu,‹ dachte ich bei mir, ›jetzt läufst du sicher in dein
Verderben!‹

»Fort stürmten wir und hatten schon den Gipfel des Hügels erreicht,
bevor noch das wahnwitzige Unternehmen entdeckt und verhindert werden
konnte. Was aber fanden wir? -- Eine ganze russische Reservearmee, von
der kein Mensch etwas ahnte. Und was geschah? -- Wurden wir in Stücke
gehauen? Das wäre in neunundneunzig Fällen unter hundert unfehlbar
geschehen. Doch nein -- die Russen sagten sich, daß, wie die Sachen
standen, unmöglich ein einziges Regiment den Angriff wagen könne,
die ganze englische Armee müsse im Anzug -- die geplante Kriegslist
entdeckt und vereitelt sein. Sie machten rechtsumkehrt und stürzten
sich über Hals und Kopf in wildem Durcheinander den Hügel hinab auf das
Schlachtfeld -- wir immer hinter ihnen drein. Sie selbst durchbrachen
die feste, russische Schlachtordnung und richteten die heilloseste
Verwirrung an. Die Niederlage der Verbündeten verwandelte sich in
einen entscheidenden, glänzenden Sieg.

»Marschall Canrobert, welcher, überwältigt von Staunen, Bewunderung und
Entzücken, den Angriff beobachtet hatte, sandte sofort nach Scoresby,
schloß ihn gerührt in die Arme und schmückte ihm eigenhändig, im
Angesicht sämtlicher Heere, die Brust mit dem höchsten Orden.

»Was aber war die eigentliche Veranlassung zu Scoresbys Mißgriff
gewesen? Diesmal weiter nichts, als daß er rechts und links verwechselt
hatte. Ihm war Befehl erteilt worden, sich zurückzuziehen, um den
rechten Flügel zu verstärken; statt dessen rückte er vor und zog sich
nach links den Hügel hinauf. Der Ruhm seines wunderbaren militärischen
Genies aber ist seit jenem Tage in alle Welt hinaus geflogen und wird
für ewige Zeiten in den Büchern der Geschichte leuchten.

»Liebenswürdig ist er, freundlich, gut und anspruchslos, wie nur ein
Mensch sein kann, aber er versteht gar nichts, in keiner Lage weiß er
sich zu helfen und würde sich ruhig naß regnen lassen, statt unter
Dach zu gehen. Ich versichere Sie, es ist die reinste Wahrheit: einen
größeren Dummkopf wie ihn giebt es nicht auf der Welt. Noch vor einer
halben Stunde aber war ich, außer ihm selbst, der einzige Mensch der
das wußte. Jahraus, jahrein und Tag für Tag ist er von einem ganz
unerhörten und beispiellosen Glück förmlich verfolgt worden. Er hat
sich ein Menschenalter hindurch in allen unsern Kriegen mit Glanz
hervorgethan. Seine militärische Laufbahn wimmelt von Mißgriffen
aller Art, aber für jeden Fehler, den er beging, hat er entweder ein
Ehrenzeichen erhalten, oder er ist zum Lord, zum Baron oder zu sonst
etwas gemacht worden. Sie haben ja neulich bei dem Festmahl gesehen,
wie seine Brust mit fremden und einheimischen Orden über und über
bedeckt war; jeden einzigen, das können Sie mir glauben, trägt er
zum Andenken an irgend einen haarsträubenden Irrtum, alle zusammen
genommen aber bilden den schlagendsten Beweis, _daß Glück_ das beste
Angebinde ist, welches einem Menschenkinde in die Wiege gelegt werden
kann.« --

    Bald nach Erscheinen dieser Satire in Harpers Monatsschrift
    kam Mark Twain nach England. Seine Freunde dort gaben ihm den
    dringenden Rat, dem _General Wolseley_ aus dem Wege zu gehen
    und es entspann sich darob folgendes Gespräch:

    _Mark Twain_: Warum denn? Ich bin ihm nichts schuldig.

    _Seine Freunde_: Das mag sein, aber vielleicht er Ihnen!

    _Mark Twain_: Wieso? Ich verstehe nicht.

    _Seine Freunde_: Nun, -- für Ihre Geschichte im letzten
        Harperschen Monatsheft.

    _Mark Twain_: Ach was! Für die bin ich längst bezahlt! Was geht
        ihn das an? --

    _Seine Freunde_: O nichts -- nur insofern, als er der Held
        dieser Geschichte ist.

    Es scheint, daß diese Gründe auf Mark Twain doch einen gewissen
    Eindruck gemacht haben, denn es heißt, daß er auf seiner Reise
    in England sich angelegen sein ließ, dem berühmten General aus
    dem Wege zu gehen.




Wie der Verfasser in Newark angeführt wurde.


Es ist nicht gerade angenehm, etwas Ungünstiges von sich selbst zu
erzählen, aber der Mensch hat hin und wieder einmal das Bedürfnis, eine
Beichte abzulegen. Ich fühle mich gedrungen mein Gemüt zu erleichtern,
aber ich glaube fast, daß ich es mehr thue, um meinem Unmut über
einen andern Luft zu machen, als um Balsam auf mein verwundetes
Herz zu träufeln. (Was Balsam ist, weiß ich nicht; ich habe niemals
Balsam gesehen, aber mich dünkt, das ist bei solcher Veranlassung der
herkömmliche Ausdruck.)

       *       *       *       *       *

Bekanntlich habe ich kürzlich in Newark vor den jungen Herren der
Museums-Gesellschaft eine Vorlesung gehalten. Vorher sprach ich mit
einem der jungen Herren, welcher sagte, er habe einen Onkel, der aus
irgend einer Ursache dauernd der Fähigkeit beraubt zu sein scheine, in
Gemütsbewegung zu geraten. Mit Thränen in den Augen rief der junge Mann:

»O, könnte ich ihn nur lachen hören, könnte ich ihn nur einmal weinen
sehen!«

Ich war gerührt. Bei Schmerz und Kummer wird mir immer weich ums Herz;
deshalb sagte ich: »Bringen Sie ihn nur mit in die Vorlesung, da will
ich ihm schon zusetzen, bis wieder Leben in ihn kommt.«

»O, wenn Sie das thun könnten -- wenn Ihnen das möglich wäre! Unsere
ganze Familie würde Sie in alle Ewigkeit dafür segnen -- er liegt uns
allen so sehr am Herzen! Können Sie ihn wirklich zum Lachen bringen,
mein Wohlthäter? Können Sie die trockenen Augensterne zu lindernden
Thränen rühren?«

Ich war tief ergriffen und sagte: »Mein Sohn, bringen Sie den guten
Alten nur mit. Es kommen in meinem Vortrag ein paar Späße vor, über die
er lachen wird, wenn er überhaupt noch ein Zwerchfell hat. Thun diese
keine Wirkung, so habe ich ein paar andere, die ihn weinen machen oder
ihn umbringen -- entweder -- oder.« Da schluchzte der junge Mann an
meinem Halse, wünschte mir Gottes Segen und suchte seinen Onkel auf.
Er setzte ihn am Abend mir gegenüber auf die zweite Bank und -- ich
ging ans Werk. Ich versuchte es zuerst mit feinen Scherzen und dann mit
gröberen; ich nahm ihn mit schlechten Witzen in die Kur und hielt ihn
mit guten Witzen zum Besten; ich bombardierte ihn mit abgedroschenen
Späßen und beschoß ihn von allen Seiten mit gepfefferten,
funkelnagelneuen. Ich wurde warm bei meiner Arbeit und stürmte von
rechts und links, von vorn und hinten auf ihn ein; ich dampfte und
schwitzte, eiferte und tobte, bis ich heiser und krank, toll und
rasend war, aber -- ich konnte kein Leben in ihn bringen -- weder ein
Lächeln noch eine Thräne preßte ich ihm ab. Nicht den Schatten eines
Lächelns und keine Spur von Feuchtigkeit. Ich war starr vor Staunen.
Endlich schloß ich den Vortrag mit einem verzweifelten Aufschrei, in
einem wilden Ausbruch von Humor, und schleuderte ihm einen Witz von
übernatürlicher Ungeheuerlichkeit an den Kopf. Dann setzte ich mich
verwirrt und erschöpft nieder.

Der Vorstand der Gesellschaft trat zu mir, kühlte mir die Stirn mit
frischem Wasser und fragte: »Was hat Sie nur gegen das Ende so in
Aufregung gebracht?«

»Ich wollte den verdammten alten Narren in der zweiten Reihe durchaus
zum Lachen bringen,« rief ich.

»Ah so -- ja, da haben Sie sich umsonst bemüht,« erwiderte er; »_der_
Mann ist taub und stumm und so blind wie ein Maulwurf.«

Nun frage ich -- war es von dem Neffen des alten Mannes nicht
unverantwortlich, einem Fremden und Waisenknaben wie mir, so
mitzuspielen? Ich frage den Leser als Mitmenschen und Bruder, ob das
rechtschaffen von ihm gehandelt war?




Schonend beigebracht.


Als der selige Richter Bagley damals im Gerichtshause stolperte, die
Treppe hinabstürzte und den Hals brach, entstand die große Frage, wie
man seiner armen Frau die Trauernachricht mitteilen solle. Endlich war
die Leiche auf den Wagen unseres alten, braven Fuhrmanns geladen und
diesem die Weisung erteilt, den Verunglückten nach Frau Bagleys Wohnung
zu schaffen, aber dabei mit der größten Rücksicht und Behutsamkeit zu
Werke zu gehen, insbesondere die Unglücksbotschaft ja nicht plötzlich
und auf einmal auszurichten, sondern Frau Bagley erst gehörig darauf
vorzubereiten.

Nachdem der Fuhrmann mit seiner traurigen Last angelangt war, schrie er
laut, bis die Frau des Richters an der Thüre erschien.

Alsdann fragte er: »Wohnt hier nicht die Witwe Bagley?«

»Die _Witwe_ Bagley? -- Nein, die wohnt nicht hier!«

»Ich will doch gleich drauf wetten, daß sie hier wohnt! -- Aber, nichts
für ungut -- wohnt der Richter Bagley vielleicht hier?«

»Jawohl, der Richter Bagley wohnt hier.«

»Ich will doch gleich drauf wetten, daß er nicht hier wohnt! Aber, wie
Sie wollen; ich bin nicht rechthaberisch. Ist der Richter zu Hause?«

»Nein, im Augenblick nicht.«

»Dacht' ich mir's doch! -- Weil nämlich -- lehnen Sie sich an die Wand,
Madame -- die Kleinigkeit, die ich Ihnen anzukündigen habe, bringt Sie
vielleicht etwas aus dem Gleichgewicht. Es ist ein Unglück geschehen
-- draußen auf meinem Wagen liegt der alte Richter. Wenn Sie ihn näher
ansehen, werden Sie sich überzeugen, daß hier nichts mehr zu machen
ist, als die Totenschau über ihn zu halten.«




Trinksprüche.


Auf die Weiber.

    Bei dem Jahresfest der Schottischen Gesellschaft in London, am
    Montag-Abend, brachte Mark Twain den Toast auf die ›Damen‹ aus;
    dieser lautete nach dem ›Observer‹ wie folgt:

»Es erfüllt mich mit aufrichtigem Stolz, daß ich gewählt worden bin, um
gerade den Toast auf die ›Damen‹ auszubringen oder -- wenn Sie nichts
dagegen haben -- auf die Weiber, denn diese Bezeichnung scheint mir
doch besser; sie ist jedenfalls die ältere und daher die ehrwürdigere.
(Gelächter.) Ich habe bemerkt, daß die Bibel, mit der den heiligen
Schriften so eigentümlichen Einfachheit und Offenheit, sogar von der
erhabenen Mutter des ganzen Menschengeschlechts nie den Ausdruck ›Dame‹
gebraucht, sondern sie stets ein Weib nennt. (Gelächter.) Das mag
seltsam erscheinen, aber es ist eine Thatsache. -- Ich bin besonders
stolz auf diese Ehre, weil ich finde, daß der Trinkspruch auf die
Weiber, sowohl von Rechts wegen als nach den Regeln der Höflichkeit
allen andern vorausgehen sollte -- dem Toast auf das Heer, auf
die Flotte, ja vielleicht selbst auf die Träger der Königswürde,
obgleich letzteres heutzutage in diesem Lande nicht nötig ist, weil
man stillschweigend die Gesundheit aller guten Frauen im allgemeinen
ausbringt, wenn man die Königin von England und die Prinzessin von
Wales leben läßt. (Laute Hochrufe.) Mir fällt dabei ein Gedicht ein,
das Ihnen wohlbekannt ist; jedermann kennt es ja. Der gegenwärtige
Trinkspruch ruft es aber uns allen so recht ins Gedächtnis und wir
stimmen begeistert mit ein in die Worte des edelsten, reinsten,
anmutigsten und lieblichsten unserer Dichter, wenn er sagt:

    ›Weib -- o Weib! -- Hm --
    Weib --‹

(Gelächter.) Ohne Zweifel entsinnen Sie sich der Verse, die uns mit
so vielem Gefühl und so anmutiger Zartheit, fast ohne daß wir's
gewahr werden, Zug für Zug das Ideal des echten und vollkommenen
Weibes vorführen. Wir schauen im Geist das vollendete Meisterwerk
und preisen bewundernd den Genius, der ein so holdes Wesen durch den
Hauch seines Mundes, durch bloße Worte zu schaffen vermocht hat. Sie
werden sich ferner erinnern, wie der Dichter in treuer Uebereinstimmung
mit der Geschichte des ganzen Menschengeschlechts dies schöne Kind
seines Herzens und Verstandes den Prüfungen und Sorgen dahingiebt,
welche früher oder später allen Erdenbewohnern beschieden sind, bis
die traurige Geschichte zuletzt in der wilden, leidvollen Ansprache
gipfelt, die allen vergangenen Kummer aufs neue wach ruft. Der Wortlaut
der Zeilen ist folgender:

    -- Ach! -- o weh! -- ach! --

und so weiter. (Gelächter.) Mir ist das übrige nicht gegenwärtig;
aber alles in allem halte ich diese Verse für die schönste Huldigung,
welche der Genius des Dichters den Frauen je gewidmet hat. (Gelächter.)
Ich weiß, ich könnte stundenlang sprechen, ohne meinem großen Thema
auf anmutigere oder vollendetere Weise Gerechtigkeit widerfahren zu
lassen, als ich es gethan habe, indem ich einfach die unvergleichlichen
Dichterworte anführte. (Erneutes Gelächter.)

Die Entwicklungsformen des weiblichen Geschlechts sind von unendlicher
Mannigfaltigkeit. Man betrachte welchen Typus des Weibes man will,
immer wird man daran etwas zu achten, zu bewundern, zu lieben finden,
etwas, das Herz und Hand beglückt. Wer besaß mehr Vaterlandsliebe als
die Jungfrau von Orleans? Wer war tapferer? Wer hat uns ein erhabeneres
Beispiel opferfreudiger Hingabe gezeigt? Wie deutlich, wie lebendig
erinnern wir uns alle an die Nachricht, welche wie eine große Woge des
Kummers zu uns heranflutete, daß Jeanne d'Arc bei Waterloo gefallen
sei. (Stürmisches Gelächter.) Wer trauert nicht um den Tod der Sappho,
der holden Sängerin Israels? (Gelächter.) Wer unter uns vermißt nicht
die liebreichen Dienste, den sanften Einfluß, die demütige Frömmigkeit
der Lucrezia Borgia? (Gelächter.) Wer kann in die herzlose Verleumdung
einstimmen, welche sagt, das Weib sei verschwenderisch in Putz und
Kleidung, wenn er zurückblickt und sich den einfachen Anzug unserer
Mutter Eva ins Gedächtnis ruft, welcher der Hochlandstracht glich
-- mit geringen Abänderungen. (Schallendes Gelächter.) Verehrte
Anwesende, die Weiber sind Kriegerinnen gewesen, sie waren Malerinnen,
Dichterinnen. So lange es eine Sprache giebt, wird der Name Cleopatra
in aller Munde leben. Nicht etwa, weil sie Georg den Dritten eroberte
-- (Gelächter) -- sondern weil sie die klassischen Zeilen schrieb:

    »Es beißt der Hund und bellt voll Lust;
    Gott schuf den Trieb ihm in der Brust!«

(Lautes Gelächter.) Auf den weiten Gefilden der Geschichte ragen ganze
Bergzüge erhabener Weiber empor -- die Königin von Saba, Josephine
Semiramis -- die Liste ist endlos. (Gelächter.) Aber ich will nicht
Heerschau über sie alle halten; schon bei der bloßen Andeutung steigen
die Namen in Ihrem Gedächtnis auf, leuchtend von dem Ruhm unsterblicher
Thaten, geheiligt durch die Liebe und Verehrung aller Guten und Edlen
jeden Zeitalters und jeden Weltteils (Hochrufe.) Möge es unserem Stolz
und unserer Ehrliebe genügen, daß unsere Zeit dieser Liste Namen wie
Grace Darling und Florence Nightingale hinzugefügt hat. (Hochrufe.)

Das Weib ist ganz wie es sein sollte -- sanft, geduldig, langmütig,
vertrauensvoll, selbstlos, voll edler, hochherziger Triebe. Es ist des
Weibes heiliger Beruf, die Traurigen zu trösten, für die Irrenden zu
bitten, die Gefallenen aufzurichten, den Freundlosen Liebe zu erzeigen.
Mit einem Wort, die Frau schenkt allen mißhandelten und verfolgten
Kindern des Unglücks, die an ihre Thüre klopfen, den heilenden Balsam
ihres Mitgefühls und gewährt ihnen eine Freistätte in ihrem Herzen.
Jeder, der die veredelnde Gemeinschaft einer Gattin, die nie ermüdende
Hingebung einer Mutter kennt, wird von Herzen einstimmen, wenn ich
sage: Gott segne das Weib!« -- (Laute und andauernde Beifallsrufe.)


Auf die Säuglinge.

    Als fünfzehnter programmgemäßer Toast, gehalten bei dem
    Festessen, das im November 1879 von der Tennessee-Armee ihrem
    ersten Kommandeur, General Grant, zu Ehren veranstaltet wurde.

»Das lob ich mir! Wir sind nicht alle so glücklich, zum schönen
Geschlecht zu gehören; wir können nicht alle Generale, Dichter oder
Staatsmänner sein; aber wenn die Trinksprüche herabsteigen bis zu den
Säuglingen, da stehen wir alle auf gemeinsamem Boden. Es ist eine
Schande, daß Jahrtausende lang auf allen Festessen der Welt der
Säugling ganz übergangen wurde, als wenn er gar nichts bedeutete. Wenn
Sie einen Augenblick nachdenken und so ein, fünfzig bis hundert Jahre
zurückblicken mögen auf die erste Zeit Ihrer Ehe, um in Gedanken wieder
Ihren ersten Säugling zu betrachten, so werden Sie sich erinnern,
daß er etwas zu bedeuten hatte, und mehr noch als das. Ihr Soldaten
wißt wohl, daß, als dieser kleine Bursche im Familienhauptquartier
sich meldete, es Zeit für euch war, euren Abschied zu nehmen; denn er
kommandierte von nun an unumschränkt. Ihr hattet ihm als Kammerdiener
aufzuwarten und er war kein Vorgesetzter, der Rücksicht nahm auf Zeit,
Wetter oder sonstige Umstände. Ihr habt seinem Befehl folgen müssen,
ob es möglich war oder nicht; und da gab es nur eine einzige Gangart
in seinem Handbuche der Taktik und das war der -- Laufschritt. Er
behandelte euch mit aller erdenkbaren Impertinenz und Mißachtung und
selbst der Tapferste von euch durfte kein Wörtlein dagegen sagen. Ihr
habt dem Tod bei Donelson und Vicksburg ins Antlitz gesehen und Hieb
um Hieb zurückgegeben, aber wenn _er_ euch am Schnurrbart zupfte und
euer Haar zauste und eure Nase zwickte, da habt ihr es euch ruhig
gefallen lassen. Als die Donner der Schlacht in eure Ohren posaunten,
da seid ihr den Batterien aufrecht gegenüber gestanden und mit stetem
Schritt vorgerückt; aber wenn _er_ sein Schlachtgeschrei ertönen ließ,
dann ging es bei euch an ein Avancieren in verkehrter Richtung. Wenn
_er_ nach dem Schlotzer verlangte, wagtet ihr etwa Bemerkungen fallen
zu lassen, daß gewisse Dienstleistungen sich für einen Offizier und
Gentleman nicht schicken? Nein! Ihr seid einfach aufgestanden und habt
den Schlotzer geholt. Wenn _er_ seine Trinkflasche verlangte und sie
war nicht warm -- habt ihr Einwendungen gemacht? Ihr und Einwendungen!
Ihr habt euch daran gemacht und sie gewärmt! Ja, ihr habt euch so
weit herabgelassen in eurem Knechtsdienst, daß ihr diesen dummen,
faden Stoff darin selber versucht habt, um zu wissen, ob er auch
recht gemischt sei: drei Teile Wasser mit einem Teil Milch und eine
Prise Zucker von wegen der Kolik, und ein Tropfen Pfeffermünze gegen
den ewigen Schlucker. Ich habe den Geschmack noch auf der Zunge --
puh! Poetisch gestimmte Seelen glauben immer noch an das schöne, alte
Märchen, daß, wenn das Wiegenkind im Schlummer lächelt, ihm die Englein
was ins Ohr flüstern. Klingt hübsch, ist aber sehr schwach -- 's kam
einfach von einer Blähung her, meine Freunde. Wenn der Säugling einen
Spaziergang vorschlug zu seiner beliebten Stunde, zwei Uhr morgens,
seid ihr da nicht schnell aufgestanden mit der Bemerkung, die eurem
Wahrheitssinn keine sonderliche Ehre macht, daß ihr denselben Vorschlag
gerade eben hättet machen wollen. O, ihr habt euch unter guter Zucht
befunden! Und wie ihr so im Zimmer in eurer Nachtuniform auf- und
abgetänzelt seid, da habt ihr nicht nur angefangen, unwürdig zu lallen,
sondern habt mit eurer Bärenstimme den Versuch gemacht, Liedchen zu
singen, z. B.: Schlaf, Kindchen, schlaf! Was für ein Schauspiel für
eine Armee von Tennessee! Und wenn das so weiter ging, so zwei bis drei
Stunden lang, und euer kleiner Flaumkopf zu verstehen gab, daß ihm
nichts lieber sei, als diese musikalische Marschübung, was habt ihr
dann gemacht? (Seid nur ruhig!) Ihr seid einfach weiter spaziert, bis
ihr nicht mehr konntet. Eine lächerliche Idee das: ein Säugling habe
nichts zu sagen und zu bedeuten!!



Ja, es war höchste Zeit für den Vorsitzenden eines Banketts, die
Bedeutung der Säuglinge zu erkennen. Bedenkt, was kann aus der jungen
Brut noch alles werden. Fünfzig Jahre von heute werden wir alle tot
sein, denke ich, und dann wird dieses Sternenbanner, wenn es noch
existiert und ich hoffe, das wird es -- über einer Republik flattern,
die 200 Millionen Seelen zählt, gemäß den natürlichen Gesetzen
unserer Volksvermehrung. Aus unserem gegenwärtigen Staatsschooner
wird ein politischer Leviathan, ein Great Eastern geworden sein. Die
Wiegenkinder von heute werden auf Deck sein. Sorgt für eine gute
Erziehung; denn wir werden in ihren Händen ein schweres Stück Arbeit
hinterlassen. Unter den drei bis vier Millionen Wiegen, die jetzt im
Lande geschaukelt werden, befinden sich einige, die unsere Nation als
Heiligtümer aufbewahren würde, wenn man nur schon wüßte, welche. In
einer dieser Wiegen zahnt in diesem Augenblick, sich selber unbewußt,
der Farragut[9] der Zukunft; in einer andern blinzelt der künftige
berühmte Astronom noch ohne sonderliches Interesse die Milchstraße
an -- der arme Kleine sehnt sich nach einer andern Milchstraße,
nämlich seiner Amme. In einer andern liegt der zukünftige große
Geschichtsschreiber und wird zweifelsohne dereinst fortfahren zu lügen,
bis seine irdische Sendung vollendet ist. In einer andern beschäftigt
sich der zukünftige Präsident mit keinem wichtigeren Staatsproblem
als mit dem, warum er so früh keine Haare mehr hat, und in einer
mächtigen Reihe von Wiegen liegen 60000 zukünftige Stellenjäger,
bereit, den Präsidenten späterhin Gelegenheit zu geben, sich mit
demselben alten Problem zum zweiten Male zu beschäftigen,[10] und in
einer weitern Wiege irgendwo unter der Flagge liegt der zukünftige
berühmte Feldmarschall der amerikanischen Armee, so wenig beschwert
von seiner herannahenden Größe und Verantwortung, daß er seinen ganzen
strategischen Scharfsinn in diesem Augenblick darauf gerichtet hat, wie
er seinen großen Zehen in den Mund kriegen kann, ein Bestreben, das --
mit allem Respekt gesagt -- vor 56 Jahren auch die ganze Aufmerksamkeit
unseres heute abend gefeierten Helden in Anspruch genommen hat. Wenn
aber das Kind nur die Vorahnung des künftigen Mannes ist, so werden
wenige zweifeln, daß sein Bestreben von damals mit Erfolg gekrönt war.«

    [9] Größter Admiral der Vereinigten Staaten.

        Befriedigung der Aemterjäger seiner Partei macht.




Der selige Benjamin Franklin.

        Spare nie auf morgen, was du übermorgen gerade so
        gut thun kannst. --

            Benjamin Franklin.


Dieser Mensch war eins von den Individuen, welche man Philosophen
nennt. Er kam als Doppelwesen oder als ein paar Zwillinge zur Welt,
gleichzeitig in zwei verschiedenen Häusern von Boston. Die Häuser
stehen noch heutigen Tages und tragen Tafeln, deren Inschriften die
obige Thatsache bezeugen. Die Tafeln nehmen sich ganz gut aus, aber
notwendig sind sie gerade nicht, da die Einwohner dem Fremden so wie so
die beiden Geburtsstätten zeigen, zuweilen sogar mehrmals an einem Tage.

Der Mann, von welchem diese Denkschrift handelt, war heimtückischer
Gemütsart und mißbrauchte seine Gaben schon frühzeitig zur Erfindung
von allerlei Lebensregeln und Denksprüchen, die darauf berechnet waren,
dem heranwachsenden Geschlecht aller folgenden Zeitalter Schmerzen
zu bereiten. Sogar seine alltäglichsten Handlungen verrichtete er im
Hinblick darauf, daß sie den Knaben fort und fort zur Nacheiferung
vorgehalten werden sollten -- den Knaben, die sich sonst hätten
glücklich fühlen können. Aus gleicher Absicht wurde er der Sohn eines
Seifensieders, wahrscheinlich nur, damit die Bestrebungen aller
zukünftigen Knaben, die es zu irgend etwas bringen wollten, von
vornherein mit Mißtrauen betrachtet werden möchten, wenn sie nicht
Söhne von Seifensiedern wären. Mit einer Böswilligkeit, die in der
Geschichte ohne gleichen dasteht, pflegte er den Tag über zu arbeiten
und dann die Nacht hindurch aufzubleiben, unter dem Vorwand, daß er
beim Schein eines glimmenden Feuers Algebra studiere -- damit alle
andern Knaben genötigt wären das auch zu thun, weil man ihnen sonst
Benjamin Franklin vorrückte. Ja noch mehr: es war seine Gewohnheit,
sich nur von Wasser und Brot zu nähren und während der Mahlzeit
Astronomie zu treiben -- das hat seitdem Millionen von Knaben, deren
Väter Franklins verderbliche Biographie gelesen hatten, in große
Trübsal gebracht.

Seine Lebensregeln waren voll Feindseligkeit gegen die Jugend.
Heutzutage kann kein Knabe irgend einer natürlichen Regung folgen, ohne
daß er auf der Stelle über einen jener unvermeidlichen Denksprüche
stolpert und von Franklin zu hören bekommt. Kauft er sich für zwei
Cents Pfeffernüsse, so sagt sein Vater: »Weißt du nicht, mein Sohn, daß
Franklin spricht: ›Einen Heller den Tag, einen Groschen das Jahr‹!«
-- und mit der Freude an den Pfeffernüssen ist's vorbei. Will der
Knabe nach gethaner Arbeit Kreisel spielen, gleich mahnt der Vater:
»Aufschub ist ein Tagedieb.« Wenn er eine gute That thut, bekommt er
nie etwas dafür, denn »die Tugend trägt ihren Lohn in sich.« Er wird
zu Tode gehetzt und der nötigsten Ruhe beraubt, weil Franklin in einem
begeisterten Anflug von Bosheit einmal gereimt hat:

    »Früh zu Bett und früh wieder auf,
    Macht klug, gesund und reich im Kauf.«

Als ob einem Knaben etwas daran läge, um solchen Preis klug, gesund
und reich zu werden! Was _mir_ dieser Denkspruch für Leiden gebracht
hat, als mein Vater damit Versuche bei mir anstellte, spricht keines
Menschen Zunge aus. Das naturgemäße Ergebnis derselben ist meine
jetzige körperliche Hinfälligkeit, Armut und Geistesschwäche. Als ich
ein Knabe war, pflegten mich meine Eltern bisweilen schon vor neun Uhr
des Morgens zu wecken. Hätten sie mich schlafen lassen wie es meine
Natur verlangte -- was würde nicht aus mir geworden sein? Vielleicht
wäre ich jetzt Ladenbesitzer und allgemein geachtet ...



Benjamin Franklin hat viel Anerkennenswertes für sein Vaterland
gethan und dessen jungen Namen bei andern Völkern zu hohen Ehren
gebracht, weil es solchen Sohn erzeugt hat. Das will diese Denkschrift
durchaus nicht bestreiten, oder mit Stillschweigen übergehen. Ihr
Zweck ist nur, Einspruch gegen seine anmaßlichen Lebensregeln zu
erheben, die er unter dem Schein, als wären sie von ihm erdacht, aus
selbstverständlichen Wahrheiten zusammengestoppelt hat, welche schon
abgedroschene Gemeinplätze waren, noch ehe sich die Völker beim Turmbau
zu Babel zerstreuten. Mein Wunsch war lediglich, gegen die unter den
Familienhäuptern herrschende unselige Idee zu Felde zu ziehen, als
habe Franklin seine angeborene Geistesgröße eigens dadurch erworben,
daß er umsonst arbeitete, bei Mondlicht studierte und in der Nacht
aufstand, statt wie ein guter Christ bis zum Morgen zu warten -- und
als könne dieses Programm, wenn es nur streng durchgeführt würde, aus
jedes Vaters dummem Jungen einen Franklin machen. Es ist Zeit, daß die
Herren Väter sich endlich klar machen, daß jenes abscheuliche Thun und
Treiben nur die Wirkung des Genius war und nicht seine Ursache. Ich
wollte, ich wäre lange genug der Vater meiner Eltern gewesen, um ihnen
diese Wahrheit zu Gemüte zu führen, damit sie versuchten ihrem Sohne
das Leben leichter zu machen. Als Kind mußte ich Seife sieden, obgleich
mein Vater ein wohlhabender Mann war, ich mußte zeitig aufstehen, beim
Frühstück Geometrie studieren, mit meinen eigenen Gedichten hausieren
gehen und alles ganz so thun wie es Franklin gethan hatte. Man war der
festen Hoffnung, ich würde auf solche Weise einst ein Franklin werden.
Und was bin ich nun?! --




Wohlthun trägt Zinsen.

(In Beispielen.)


Von Kindheit auf habe ich mit besonderer Vorliebe eine gewisse Sammlung
moralischer Erzählungen gelesen, aus denen ich Vergnügen und Belehrung
schöpfte. Das Buch lag mir stets bequem zur Hand und sobald mein Glaube
an menschliche Tugend zu wanken drohte, griff ich danach und vertrieb
mir alle Zweifel. Auch wenn mich ein Gefühl meiner eigenen Schwäche und
unedlen Gesinnung niederdrückte, wies mich das Buch zurecht und zeigte
mir den Weg, wie ich die verlorene Selbstachtung wiedergewinnen könne.

Nur _eines_ vermißte ich: Die schönen Geschichten brachen alle ab,
sobald der Höhepunkt erreicht, die glückliche Lösung erfolgt war,
und ich hätte doch so gern von dem weitern Ergehen der großmütigen
Wohlthäter und ihrer Schützlinge noch etwas erfahren. Mein Verlangen
hiernach ward zuletzt so dringend, daß ich beschloß, mir über den
ferneren Verlauf der Geschichten selbst Klarheit zu verschaffen. Ich
unternahm zu diesem Zweck lange und mühevolle Forschungen und kam dabei
zu merkwürdigen Ergebnissen. Ich will nachstehend nur zwei Proben davon
zum allgemeinen Besten mitteilen. Zuerst werde ich die Geschichte,
wie sie in den ›Beispielen des Guten‹ steht, erzählen und dann die
Fortsetzung beifügen, wie es mir gelungen ist, sie zu ermitteln.


Der wohlwollende Schriftsteller.

Ein armer, angehender Literat hatte sich vergeblich bemüht, für seine
Manuskripte einen Verleger zu finden. Endlich, als er schon nahe am
Verhungern war, klagte er einem berühmten Schriftsteller seine traurige
Lage und bat ihn um Rat und Hilfe.

Der hochherzige Mann legte sogleich seine eigenen Sachen beiseite und
begann eins der verschmähten Manuskripte durchzulesen. Als er dies
menschenfreundliche Werk beendet hatte, schüttelte er dem jungen Manne
herzlich die Hand und sagte: »Ihre Arbeit ist nicht schlecht; kommen
Sie am nächsten Montag wieder.«

Zur verabredeten Zeit erschien der junge Autor; der berühmte
Schriftsteller aber öffnete, ohne ein Wort zu sagen, ein Journal, das
soeben erst aus der Presse kam und zeigte dem Staunenden seinen eigenen
Artikel, der in den Spalten des Blattes abgedruckt war. Der junge Mann
sank auf die Kniee und brach in Thränen aus: »Wie kann ich mich Ihnen
für solchen Edelmut je dankbar genug erweisen!« rief er.

Der Schriftsteller, welcher dieses gethan, war der große Snodgraß und
der junge Literat, den er aus dem Dunkel hervorzog und vom Hungertode
errettete, kein anderer als der später nicht minder berühmte Snagsby.

Möchten wir uns an diesem erfreulichen Vorgang ein Beispiel nehmen und
bereitwillig allen Anfängern beistehen, welche der Hilfe bedürfen.


Fortsetzung.

In der folgenden Woche stellte sich Snagsby wieder ein und brachte
fünf zurückgewiesene Manuskripte mit. Dies überraschte den
berühmten Snodgraß einigermaßen, weil die jungen Leute, von denen
das Buch erzählt, nie mehr als einmal der Handreichung bedurften
um emporzukommen. Indessen arbeitete er die Schriftstücke durch,
schnitt hier und da viele unnötige Blumen fort und rodete die
Eigenschaftswörter scheffelweise aus. Es gelang ihm darauf wirklich
zwei der Artikel bei Zeitschriften unterzubringen.

Nach Ablauf einer Woche erschien der dankbare Snagsby mit einer neuen
Ladung von Manuskripten. Wohl hatte es dem berühmten Autor zuerst
eine hohe innere Befriedigung gewährt, dem strebsamen jungen Manne
mit Erfolg helfen zu können und sich mit den großmütigen Leuten zu
vergleichen, von denen das Geschichtenbuch berichtet; jetzt aber
begann sich in ihm der Argwohn zu regen, daß vielleicht nicht alles in
Richtigkeit sei. Trotzdem sich sein Enthusiasmus plötzlich abgekühlt
hatte, gewann er es aber nicht über sich, den jungen Menschen
zurückzustoßen, der sich in seiner vertrauensvollen Herzenseinfalt so
fest an ihn klammerte.

Das Ende vom Liede war denn auch, daß der berühmte Schriftsteller
den armen, jungen Anfänger fortdauernd auf dem Halse behielt. Die
schwachen Versuche, welche er anstellte, sich der Last zu entledigen,
waren vergebens. Immer wieder mußte er Snagsby Rat erteilen und ihm
Mut einsprechen, mußte sich bemühen die Annahme seiner Manuskripte bei
den Zeitschriften durchzusetzen und sie vorher gehörig zustutzen, weil
sie sonst unbrauchbar waren. Als der junge Streber endlich im Sattel
saß, schwang er sich plötzlich mit einem kühnen Sprung auf den Gipfel
des Ruhms. Er beschrieb nämlich das Privatleben des berühmten Autors
bis in die kleinsten Einzelheiten mit so beißendem Witz, daß sein Buch
einen fabelhaften Absatz fand, dem gefeierten Schriftsteller aber vor
Kränkung darüber das Herz brach. Noch mit dem letzten Atemzug seufzte
er: »Ach, jenes verlockende Buch hat mich betrogen; es verschweigt die
letzte Hälfte der Geschichte. Hütet euch, meine Freunde, vor strebsamen
jungen Literaten! Kein Mensch soll sich vermessen, jemand vom Tode zu
retten, den Gott verhungern lassen will -- er läuft nur in sein eigenes
Verderben.«


Der dankbare Gatte.

Eine Dame fuhr einmal mit ihrem Söhnchen durch die Hauptstraße einer
großen Stadt, als plötzlich die Pferde scheu wurden und in wildem Laufe
davonjagten. Der Kutscher ward vom Bock geschleudert und die Insassen
des Wagens bebten vor Todesangst. Aber ein wackerer Jüngling, der
gerade mit seinem Gemüsewagen des Weges fuhr, fiel den durchgehenden
Pferden in die Zügel und es gelang ihm mit Gefahr seines eigenen
Lebens, sie in ihrer Flucht aufzuhalten. Die gerettete Dame ließ sich
seine Adresse sagen und erzählte daheim die Heldenthat ihrem Gatten
(der das Buch mit den moralischen Erzählungen gelesen hatte). Dieser
vergoß Thränen der Rührung bei dem erschütternden Bericht und dankte
im Verein mit seinen ihm wiedergeschenkten Lieben dem Allgütigen, ohne
dessen Willen kein Sperling vom Dache fällt, für die wunderbare Hilfe.
Dann sandte er nach dem wackern, jungen Mann, überreichte ihm einen
Wechsel auf 500 Dollars und sagte: »Nimm dies zum Lohn für deine edle
That, William Ferguson, und wenn du je eines Freundes bedarfst, so
erinnere dich, daß Thomas Spadden ein dankbares Herz hat.«

Laßt uns hieraus lernen, daß jede gute That dem der sie thut, nützt und
frommt und wenn er auch aus dem niedrigsten Stande wäre.


Fortsetzung.

In der folgenden Woche fand sich William Ferguson bei Herrn Spadden
mit der Bitte ein, er möge ihm durch seinen Einfluß eine bessere
Beschäftigung verschaffen, da er Größeres leisten könne, als den
Gemüsewagen zu fahren. Herr Spadden verhalf ihm denn auch zu einer
Bureaustelle mit gutem Gehalt.

Bald darauf wurde Williams Mutter krank und er -- doch ich will
mich möglichst kurz fassen: Spadden willigte ein, sie zu sich ins
Haus zu nehmen. Nicht lange, so fühlte sie Sehnsucht nach ihren
jüngern Kindern, worauf Marie, Julie und Jaköbchen gleichfalls
bei Spadden Aufnahme fanden. Jaköbchen hatte ein Taschenmesser,
mit dem er sich eines Tages allein ins Wohnzimmer begab, und ehe
noch Dreiviertelstunden vergingen, war das Mobiliar, welches etwa
zehntausend Dollars gekostet hatte, so von ihm bearbeitet worden,
daß sein Wert sich nicht mehr schätzen ließ. Einige Tage später fiel
Jaköbchen die Treppe hinunter und brach den Hals. Siebzehn Anverwandte
kamen in das Haus, um seiner Leiche zu folgen. Bei der Gelegenheit
wurden sie dort bekannt und fanden sich seitdem häufig in der Küche
ein. Auch bekamen die Spaddens vollauf zu thun, um ihnen nicht nur
einmal Stellen zu verschaffen, sondern auch immer von neuem wieder,
wenn sie Abwechslung brauchten.

Die alte Frau Ferguson war trunksüchtig und führte oft gottlose Reden:
da hielten es denn die Spaddens, aus Erkenntlichkeit gegen den Sohn,
für ihre Pflicht, sie von diesen Lastern zu bekehren und widmeten sich
der Aufgabe mit hohem Edelsinn. William kam häufig, erhielt immer
kleinere Geldbeträge und forderte immer höhere und einträglichere
Beschäftigung, zu welcher ihm die dankbaren Spaddens mehr oder weniger
rasch verhalfen. Nach verschiedenen Einwendungen verstand sich Spadden
sogar dazu, William auf die Universität zu schicken; als aber der
Held vor den ersten Ferien das Verlangen stellte, man möge ihn aus
Gesundheitsrücksichten nach Europa reisen lassen, da empörte sich der
bedrängte Spadden endlich gegen seinen Tyrannen. Er schlug ihm die
Forderung rundweg ab.

William Fergusons Mutter war darüber so verblüfft, daß sie die
Schnapsflasche fallen ließ und eine Verwünschung ihr in der Kehle
stecken blieb. Als sie sich vom ersten Schrecken erholt hatte, stieß
sie keuchend hervor: »So also beweisen Sie Ihre Dankbarkeit? Wo wäre
Ihre Frau und Ihr Junge jetzt ohne meinen Sohn?«



William sagte: »So also beweisen Sie Ihre Dankbarkeit? Sagen Sie einmal
-- habe ich Ihrer Frau das Leben gerettet oder nicht?«

Sieben Anverwandte liefen aus der Küche herbei und sagten einer nach
dem andern: »So also beweisen Sie Ihre Dankbarkeit?«

Williams Schwestern standen starr vor Verwunderung. »So also beweisen
Sie -- --« fingen sie an, kamen jedoch nicht weiter, da ihre Mutter
sie mit vor Schluchzen erstickter Stimme unterbrach und rief: »Und im
Dienst eines solchen Ungeheuers hat mein seliger kleiner Jakob sein
teueres Leben geopfert!«

Da schwoll dem empörten Spadden der Mut und in der Erregung des
Augenblicks rief er voll edlen Zornes:

»Hinaus aus meinem Hause, ihr Bettlerpack! Ich weiß es jetzt, jenes
Geschichtenbuch hat mich bethört, aber es soll mich nie wieder zum
Narren halten. -- Ja, du hast meiner Frau das Leben gerettet,« donnerte
er William an, »und dem nächsten, welcher das thut, mache ich auf der
Stelle den Garaus!« --

       *       *       *       *       *

Zum Schluß bemerke ich noch, daß sich die Geschichte mit William
Ferguson in meiner persönlichen Bekanntschaft wirklich zugetragen hat;
doch sind von mir alle Einzelheiten dergestalt verändert worden, daß
William sein Spiegelbild nicht wiedererkennen wird.

Jeder Leser dieser Skizze ist wohl einmal den ›Beispielen des Guten‹
gefolgt, von welchen die Bücher berichten, und hat in irgend einer
schönen, begeisterungsvollen Stunde seines Lebens eine edelmütige That
vollbracht. Es wäre mir lieb zu erfahren, wie viele dieser Großmütigen
Lust haben, über jenes Erlebnis nachträglich zu reden und sich gern an
die Folgen erinnern lassen, welche aus demselben entstanden sind!? --




Ueber Tagebücher.


Zu gewissen Zeiten wird es der liebste Ehrgeiz eines Menschen, einen
getreuen Bericht über sein Thun in einem Buche aufzubewahren, und
er stürzt sich in diese Arbeit mit einer Begeisterung, als ob ein
Tagebuch zu führen die heiligste Pflicht und der größte Genuß in der
Welt sei. Aber wenn er nur einundzwanzig Tage verlebt hat, so wird er
finden, daß nur jene seltenen Naturen voll Ausdauer, Hingebung an die
Pflicht und unbesiegbarer Entschlossenheit sich an ein so gewaltiges
Unternehmen, wie es das Führen eines Tagebuchs ist, wagen können, ohne
eine schmachvolle Niederlage zu erleiden.

Als ich auf der Quaker-City meine erste Reise nach Europa machte,
hatten wir an Bord einen jungen Mann, Namens Jack. Dieser prächtige
junge Bursche hatte ein Tagebuch angefangen und pflegte über seine
Fortschritte jeden Morgen in der glühendsten und aufgewecktesten Weise
zu berichten. Eines Tages fing er an:

»O, ich komme höllisch gut fort damit. Ich schrieb letzte Nacht zehn
Seiten in mein Tagebuch -- und wissen Sie, ich hatte die Nacht vorher
neun und die Nacht vor dieser zwölf geschrieben. Je nun, das ist reiner
Spaß.«

»Was finden Sie denn Aufzeichnenswertes, Jack?«

»O, alles! Längen- und Breitengrade, Mittagszeit, und wie viele Meilen
wir in den letzten vierundzwanzig Stunden gemacht haben, und alle die
Spiele Domino und Pferdebillard, die ich gewonnen habe, und Walfische
und Haie und Schweinfische und Sonntags den Text der Predigt (wissen
Sie, weil das zu Hause was gelten wird), und die Schiffe, die wir
salutierten, und welcher Nation sie angehörten, und was für Wind war,
und ob es eine schwere See gab, und was für Segel wir führten, obwohl
wir eigentlich niemals welche führen, da wir immer den Wind von vorn
haben -- möchte wissen, was der Grund davon ist -- und wie viele Lügen
Moult uns erzählt hat. O, alles! Ich habe alles schwarz auf weiß.
Mein Vater hieß mich dieses Tagebuch führen. Vater würde es nicht für
tausend Dollars hergeben, wenn ich's fertig kriegte.«

»Nein, Jack, es wird mehr als tausend Dollars wert sein -- wenn Sie es
fertig kriegen.«

»Meinen Sie? Aber Sie denken wohl, ich kriege es nicht fertig?«

»Ja, es wird wenigstens tausend Dollars wert sein, wenn Sie es
vollenden. Vielleicht mehr noch.«

»Na, ich denke halb und halb ebenso. Ich bin nicht ungeschickt im
Führen eines Tagebuches.«

Eines Abends sagte ich später in Paris, nachdem wir uns mit der
Besichtigung von Sehenswürdigkeiten abgearbeitet hatten, zu ihm:

»Nun, ich will gehen und ein Weilchen um die Cafés herumstrolchen,
Jack, und Ihnen Gelegenheit geben, Ihr Tagebuch weiterzuführen, alter
Junge.«

Sein Gesicht verlor sein Feuer. Er sagte:

»Na, das braucht Sie nicht zu kümmern. Ich denke, ich werde dieses
Tagebuch nicht weiter fortsetzen. Es ist furchtbar langweilig. Wissen
Sie wohl, daß ich viertausend Seiten noch nachzureiten hätte? Ich habe
noch gar nichts über Frankreich drin. Erst dachte ich, ich wollte
Frankreich weglassen und von Frischem anfangen. Aber nicht wahr, das
ginge nicht an. Der Alte würde sagen: Hallo, was ist das -- nichts von
Frankreich gesehen? Dann dachte ich, ich wollte Frankreich aus dem
Reiseführer abschreiben, wie der alte Badger in der Vorderkajüte, der
ein Buch schreibt, aber es sind mehr als dreihundert Seiten darüber. O,
mir scheint, ein Tagebuch hat gar keinen Nutzen, nicht wahr? Nichts als
Plack und Langeweile, nicht wahr?«

»Ja, ein unvollständiges Tagebuch hat gar keinen Nutzen, aber ein
gehörig geführtes Tagebuch ist seine tausend Dollars wert -- wenn man
es fertig hat.«

»Tausend -- nun ja, das sollt' ich meinen. Ich aber möchte es für eine
Million nicht fertig machen.«

Seine Erfahrung war nur die Erfahrung der Mehrzahl derjenigen unserer
Reisegesellschaft, welche gleich ihm ein Tagebuch führten. Wenn
man einem jungen Menschen eine unbarmherzige und bösartige Strafe
auferlegen will, so verpflichte man ihn, ein Jahr lang ein Tagebuch zu
führen.




Ueber das Briefschreiben.


Ich glaube, es giebt kaum etwas auf der Welt, was uns allen so
widerwärtig ist, als die Pflicht einen Brief zu schreiben -- besonders
einen Privatbrief. Geschäftsbriefe sind übrigens nur wenig angenehmer.
Fast alle Freude über einen Brief, den ich erhalte, wird mir durch den
Gedanken vergällt, daß er beantwortet werden muß. Ja, ich fürchte mich
so sehr vor der Qual, solche Antworten auf der Seele zu haben, daß mich
häufig die Lust anwandelt, meine ganze Post ins Feuer zu werfen, statt
sie zu öffnen.

Zehn Jahre lang ist mir diese Furcht erspart geblieben, weil ich
fortwährend umherzog, von Stadt zu Stadt, von Staat zu Staat und von
Land zu Land. Da konnte ich, ganz nach Gefallen, sämtliche Briefe
unbeantwortet lassen, die Absender derselben nahmen natürlich an,
daß ich meinen Aufenthaltsort gewechselt habe und ihre Zuschriften
fehlgegangen seien.

Jetzt kann ich aber leider diese Form der Täuschung nicht mehr
anwenden. Ich bin vor Anker gegangen, bin festgefahren -- und nun
kommen die tödlichen Geschosse, die Briefe aller Art, schnurgerade auf
mich losgeflogen.

Es sind Briefe der verschiedensten Gattung und sie behandeln die
mannigfaltigsten Gegenstände. Ich lese sie meist beim Frühstück und
sehr oft verderben sie mir mein ganzes Tagewerk; sie leiten meinen
Gedankengang in neue Kanäle, das Arbeitsprogramm, welches ich mir für
meine Schreiberei aufgestellt habe, gerät in Verwirrung, ja es wird
wohl auch gänzlich umgestoßen.

Nach dem Frühstück werfe ich mich gewöhnlich ins Geschirr und versuche
eine Stunde lang fleißig zu schreiben, aber ich komme nur mühsam
vorwärts, da die Briefe immer wieder in meine Gedanken eingreifen. Die
Sache hat keinen rechten Fluß, ich gebe sie zuletzt auf und verschiebe
alle weiteren Bemühungen auf den nächsten Tag.

Man sollte meinen, ich würde mich nun schleunigst daran machen die
Briefe zu beantworten und aus dem Wege zu schaffen. Alle Musterknaben,
von denen wir lesen, daß sie barfuß nach New York gewandert kommen und
im Laufe der Zeit zu unverschämten Millionären werden, hätten damit
sicherlich keinen Augenblick gezögert -- aber, ich bin nicht wie sie.

Es fällt mir gar nicht ein, die Gewohnheiten jener Leute anzunehmen,
denn ich werde nie ein Millionär werden. Wäre ich darauf ausgegangen,
so hätte ich nicht gleich von vornherein den verhängnisvollen Mißgriff
begehen dürfen, Stiefel an den Füßen zu tragen und mehr als vierzig
Cents in der Tasche zu haben, als ich in New York einzog.

Wie hätte ich nach einem so verkehrten Beginn meiner Laufbahn noch den
Versuch machen sollen mir Reichtümer zu erwerben? Man würde mich nur
mit größtem Mißtrauen betrachtet haben und mich einfach zum Betrüger
stempeln.

Deshalb verzichte ich also darauf in die Fußstapfen dieser Krösusse
zu treten und meine Briefe mit kaufmännischer Pünktlichkeit und
Schnelligkeit zu beantworten. Ich setze meine Arbeiten einen Tag lang
aus, und die aufgeschichteten Briefe von heute bleiben bei denen
liegen, welche gestern, vorgestern und von allen früheren Daten
angekommen sind.

Erst wenn der Haufen so angewachsen ist, daß mir angst und bange
davon wird, blase ich zum Angriff und laufe Sturm, manchmal fünf volle
Stunden lang, zuweilen sogar sechs.

Und wie viele Briefe beantworte ich in dieser Zeit? Nie mehr als
neun, oft auch nur fünf und sechs. Der Korrespondent in einem großen
kaufmännischen Geschäft würde in einer solchen Reihe von Stunden
wenigstens hundert Antworten zu Papier bringen.



Einem Mann, der Jahre damit zugebracht hat, für die Presse zu
schreiben, kann man aber eine solche Federgewandtheit unmöglich
zutrauen.

Aus alter Gewohnheit knüpft er dabei einen Gedanken an den andern;
geduldig zerbricht er sich minutenlang den Kopf, um auf eine unwichtige
Zuschrift die passende Erwiderung zusammen zu drechseln, und so
verfließt ihm unversehens die kostbare Zeit.

Mir ist es in den letzten Jahren förmlich zur andern Natur geworden,
Schriftstücke jeder Art -- selbst Privatbriefe nicht ausgeschlossen
-- mit Sorgfalt und reiflicher Ueberlegung abzufassen. Die Folge
davon ist, daß ich das Briefschreiben hasse, und ich habe noch bei
allen meinen Bekannten, die für Zeitungen und Journale arbeiten, eine
ähnliche Abneigung dagegen gefunden.

Obige Bemerkungen sollen nur zur Erklärung und zu meiner Entschuldigung
bei allen den Leuten dienen, welche mir über allerlei Angelegenheiten
geschrieben haben, ohne eine Antwort zu erhalten.

Einmal übers andere habe ich, im guten Glauben, daß es mir gelingen
würde, wirklich versucht ihnen zu antworten. Einiges konnte ich wohl
erledigen, aber unwiderruflich blieb doch die Mehrzahl der in der
letzten Woche eingegangenen Briefe bis zur nächsten liegen.

Die Folge war dann jedesmal, daß die sich aufhäufenden Briefe zuerst
eine vorwurfsvolle Miene annahmen, dann mir grimmige Blicke zuwarfen,
als wollten sie mir eine Strafpredigt halten, und zuletzt ein so
beleidigendes, unverschämtes Gesicht machten, daß mir die Geduld
ausging. Wenn das geschah, öffnete ich die Ofenthür und statuierte ein
Exempel an ihnen.

Und siehe da -- sofort war jedes bedrückende Gefühl über
vernachlässigte Pflichten verschwunden und alle meine verlorene
Seelenheiterkeit kehrte zurück.




Gedankentelegraphie.


Es giebt gewisse Begebenheiten im Menschenleben, welche man seit
Anbeginn der Welt für ein Spiel des Zufalls gehalten hat. Erst in
unsern Tagen ist es der Psychologischen Gesellschaft in England
gelungen, der Menschheit klar zu machen, daß, was wir gewöhnlich als
›merkwürdiges Zusammentreffen‹ bezeichnen, keineswegs auf blindem
Zufall beruht, sondern einfach die Wirkung der Botschaft ist, welche
ein Geist dem andern, oft weit über Land und Meer zuschickt. Beispiele
von Gedankentelegraphie kommen viel häufiger vor als man gemeinhin
glaubt und entstehen so wenig aus bloßem Zufall wie Abgang und Ankunft
einer telegraphischen Depesche.

Ich hatte die Entdeckung schon längst gemacht und meine Erfahrungen
niedergeschrieben; doch konnte ich mich nicht entschließen, sie zu
veröffentlichen, aus Furcht, man möchte für Scherz halten, was im
vollen Ernst gemeint war. Jetzt aber erscheint die Frage in einem ganz
neuen Licht, dank der verdienstlichen und einflußreichen Thätigkeit der
Psychologischen Gesellschaft, und ich brauche mein altes Manuskript,
das aus dem Jahre 1878 stammt, nicht länger im Schreibtisch zu
verwahren: -- -- --

       *       *       *       *       *

Schon wieder habe ich eins jener kleinen merkwürdigen Erlebnisse
zu verzeichnen, wie sie hie und da jedem Menschen zustoßen. Man
denkt stundenlang darüber nach und bleibt so klug wie zuvor, denn
eine Erklärung sucht man vergebens. Die Sache, welche an sich ganz
unbedeutend aussieht, verhielt sich wie folgt:

Vor einigen Tagen sagte ich: »Es scheint, Frank Millet weiß gar nicht,
daß wir in Deutschland sind, sonst würde er längst geschrieben haben.
In den letzten sechs Wochen bin ich wohl ein Dutzendmal drauf und dran
gewesen, ein paar Zeilen an ihn zu spedieren, habe aber immer wieder
beschlossen zu warten, da er doch endlich etwas von sich hören lassen
muß. Jetzt schreibe ich aber sofort.« Ich that es, schickte den Brief
nach Paris und dachte bei mir: »Ehe dieser Brief fünfzig Meilen über
Heidelberg hinaus ist, haben wir bereits Nachricht von Frank -- so geht
es ja immer.«

Und richtig, was ich gesagt hatte traf ein. Es geschieht ja
wunderbarerweise nichts häufiger im Leben, als daß sich Briefe kreuzen;
ob das aber auf einem Zufall beruht, möchte ich bezweifeln. Unser
Vorgefühl, daß sich der Brief, den wir eben an eine Person schreiben,
mit einem von derselben Person an uns gerichteten kreuzen wird, ist oft
schon stark genug gewesen, um uns zu veranlassen, den schriftlichen
Erguß merkwürdig kurz zu fassen, da man seine Zeit nicht unnütz
verschwenden will -- die Briefe kreuzen sich ja doch. Ich habe die
Erfahrung gemacht, daß mich dieses Vorgefühl meistens ergriff, wenn ich
meinen Brief eine ganze Weile verschoben hatte, in der Hoffnung, der
andere würde zuerst schreiben.

Ich erhielt Millets Brief, der an demselben Tage abgeschickt war
wie der meinige, in Berlin, durch Vermittlung des amerikanischen
Gesandten. Millet schrieb, er habe sich sechs Wochen lang vergeblich
bemüht, jemand aufzutreiben, der ihm meine deutsche Adresse mitteilen
könne, zuletzt sei er auf den Gedanken gekommen, daß man wohl auf
der Gesandtschaft in Berlin wissen würde, wo ich zu finden sei. --
Vielleicht war es ein Zufall, aber ich glaube es nicht, daß er endlich
in demselben Augenblick zur Feder griff, in welchem ich mich entschloß
an ihn zu schreiben.

Es giebt für mich nichts Aergerlicheres, als wenn ich in einer
einfachen Geschäftsangelegenheit gewartet und gewartet habe, in der
Hoffnung, der andere werde die Mühe des Schreibens übernehmen und mich
zuletzt doch selbst daran machen muß, noch dazu mit der Ueberzeugung,
daß jener sich mit mir zugleich hinsetzt, um einen Brief zu schreiben,
der sich mit dem meinigen kreuzen wird. Wollte ich die Arbeit aber
verschieben und vom Schreibtisch aufstehen, so würde der andere Mensch
unfehlbar dasselbe thun, genau als wären wir zusammengespannt wie die
siamesischen Zwillinge und genötigt die nämlichen Bewegungen zu machen.

Einige Monate bevor ich mich auf Reisen begab, hatten Techniker eines
New Yorker Geschäfts eine Arbeit in meinem Hause vorgenommen, die
nicht zu meiner Zufriedenheit ausgefallen war. Ich benachrichtigte
daher die Firma, daß ich die Rechnung erst bezahlen würde, nachdem
die Sache ganz in Ordnung gebracht sei. In der Antwort bat man
mich wegen Geschäftsüberhäufung etwas Geduld zu haben; sobald der
Sachverständige entbehrt werden könne, solle er alles nach Wunsch
erledigen. Ueber zwei Monate wartete ich und ertrug mit Ergebung die
Hausgenossenschaft elektrischer Klingeln, die urplötzlich von selbst
und wie rasend Sturm läuteten, ohne daß jemand sie berührte, und dann
wieder keinen Ton von sich geben wollten, wenn man auch den Knopf wie
mit einem Schmiedehammer bearbeitete. Unzähligemale nahm ich mir vor
zu schreiben, aber immer wieder verschob ich es. Eines Abends endlich
setzte ich mich hin und ergoß meinen Aerger ungefähr eine Seite lang;
plötzlich aber brach ich den Brief kurz ab, denn ein deutliches Gefühl
sagte mir, daß die Firma jetzt auch ein Lebenszeichen von sich geben
werde. Als ich am nächsten Morgen zum Frühstück erschien, war mein
Brief noch nicht abgegangen, aber der ›elektrische Klingelmann‹ hatte
bereits alles Nötige besorgt und war wieder verschwunden. Am Abend
vorher hatte er von seinem Prinzipal den Auftrag erhalten und war
sogleich mit dem Nachtzug zu uns gefahren. Wenn das auch ein ›Zufall‹
war, so gehörten ungefähr drei Monate dazu, bis er zustande kam.

       *       *       *       *       *

Letzten Sommer langte ich eines Abends in Washington an, stieg im
Orlington-Hotel ab und ging auf mein Zimmer. Ich las und rauchte
ungefähr bis zehn Uhr und da ich nicht schläfrig war, wollte ich noch
ein wenig frische Luft schnappen. So ging ich denn im Regen hinaus und
wanderte vergnüglich und ziellos umher. Mein Freund O. befand sich
auch gerade in der Stadt und es hätte mich gefreut, wenn wir zufällig
aufeinandergestoßen wären, doch ihn um Mitternacht aufzustöbern, zumal
ich seine Wohnung nicht wußte, lag mir gänzlich fern. Da ich mich in
den öden Straßen verlassen zu fühlen begann, trat ich gegen zwölf Uhr
in einen Zigarrenladen, hielt mich dort eine Viertelstunde auf und
hörte den nationalpolitischen Gesprächen einiger Kunden zu. Plötzlich
ergriff mich der prophetische Geist und ich sprach zu mir selbst: »Wenn
ich jetzt zu dieser Thür hinausgehe, mich links wende und zehn Schritte
mache, werde ich O. gegenüberstehen.«

Genau so traf es ein. Zwar konnte ich sein Gesicht unter dem
Regenschirm nicht sehen, zumal es ziemlich dunkel war, aber ich
erkannte ihn an der Stimme, als er seinem Begleiter in die Rede fiel,
und rief ihn an.

Daß ich den Laden verließ und O. begegnete war nichts, aber daß ich
es vorher wußte, war sehr viel. Bei näherer Betrachtung ist es doch
ein höchst merkwürdiges Erlebnis. Ich stand ganz hinten in dem
Zigarrenladen als der Geist der Weissagung über mich kam. Fünf Schritte
bis zur Thür, drei Stufen zum Bürgersteig hinunter, Wendung nach links,
einige weitere Schritte und richtig -- da war mein Mann. Ist es nicht
wunderbar, wie alles zutraf?

Oft reden wir von einem Abwesenden und kaum haben wir es gethan,
so sehen wir ihn vor uns. Wir lachen dann und sagen: »Wenn man den
Teufel an die Wand malt u. s. w.«; dann denken wir nicht mehr an den
sogenannten ›Zufall‹. Das ist eine recht billige und bequeme Art, über
ein ernstes und schwieriges Rätsel hinwegzukommen, das zu lösen wohl
der Mühe verlohnte.

Nun komme ich aber auf das Sonderbarste zu sprechen, was ich je erlebt
habe: Vor zwei oder drei Jahren lag ich eines Morgens im Bett und
dachte an nichts Besonderes -- es war am zweiten März -- als plötzlich
eine funkelnagelneue Idee wie eine Bombe auf mich hereingesaust kam
und mit solcher Gewalt explodierte, daß aus der ganzen Umgegend alle
müßigen Betrachtungen zerfetzt und zersplittert davonflogen. Diese Idee
bestand, kurz gesagt, darin, daß jetzt der günstige Augenblick gekommen
sei, ein gewisses Buch, dem das allgemeine Interesse nicht fehlen
konnte, sofort zu schreiben und auf den Markt zu bringen -- ein Buch
über die Silbergruben in Nevada. Die ›Große Bonanza-Mine‹ war damals
ein neues Weltwunder und bildete das Tagesgespräch.

Die geeignetste Person für diese Arbeit schien mir William Wright,
ein Journalist aus Virginia in Nevada, an dessen Seite ich dort, vor
zwölf Jahren, monatelang als Reporter Zeitungsartikel gekritzelt
hatte. Vielleicht war er noch am Leben, vielleicht war er tot, wer
konnte es wissen, aber jedenfalls wollte ich ihm schreiben. Ich begann
damit, ihm bescheidentlich den Vorschlag zu machen, das bewußte Buch
zu verfassen; im weitern Verlauf wuchs jedoch mein Eifer und ich
ließ mich hinreißen, nach eigenem Ermessen den ganzen Plan des Werkes
zu entwerfen, überzeugt, daß Wright, als guter Freund, meine Absicht
nicht mißdeuten werde. Ich ging sogar auf Einzelheiten ein und besprach
deren Anordnung und Reihenfolge. Eben wollte ich das Manuskript in
einen Umschlag stecken, da fiel mir ein, wie unangenehm es wäre,
wenn das Buch auf meine Veranlassung geschrieben würde und sich dann
kein Verleger fände. Ich behielt daher den Brief einstweilen zurück,
warf ihn in ein Fach und richtete ein paar Zeilen an meinen eigenen
Verleger, den ich um eine geschäftliche Besprechung bat. Der Herr war
jedoch gerade verreist, meine Zuschrift blieb unbeantwortet und nach
einigen Tagen hatte ich die ganze Angelegenheit vergessen. Am neunten
März brachte der Postbote verschiedene Briefe, darunter einen besonders
dicken, dessen Aufschrift eine halbschlummernde Erinnerung in mir zu
wecken schien. Zuerst wußte ich nicht wohin damit, aber bald ging mir
ein Licht auf und ich sagte zu einem Verwandten, der gerade anwesend
war:



»Gieb acht, jetzt will ich ein Wunder thun. Ich werde dir aufs genauste
Inhalt, Datum und Unterschrift dieses Briefes sagen, ohne ihn zu
erbrechen. Er kommt von einem Herrn Wright aus Virginia in Nevada,
und ist vom zweiten März datiert. Wright teilt mir darin sein Vorhaben
mit, ein Buch über die Silberminen zu schreiben und fragt, was ich
als Freund davon denke. Ferner setzt er mir alles Einzelne des Nähern
auseinander und sagt, daß er zum Schluß die Geschichte des ›Großen
Bonanza‹ erzählen wolle.«

Ich öffnete nun den Brief und bewies, daß meine sämtlichen Angaben
richtig waren. Wrights Brief enthielt in der That genau dasselbe wie
der meinige, der, am nämlichen Datum geschrieben, seit sieben Tagen im
Fach meines Schreibtisches lag.

Mit Hellseherei, wenigstens wie _ich_ dieselbe verstehe, hatte
dieser Vorfall, glaube ich, nichts zu thun. Ein Hellseher behauptet,
verborgene Schrift wirklich Wort für Wort ablesen zu können. Das war
bei mir nicht der Fall. Ich glaubte nur den Inhalt des Briefes im
einzelnen mit vollkommener Sicherheit zu kennen, aber die Worte mußte
ich selbst finden und gewissermaßen Wrights Ausdrucksweise in die
meinige übersetzen.

Dies Zusammentreffen aller Umstände konnte doch unmöglich auf Zufall
beruhen. Bei einem Zufall hätte vielleicht einiges gestimmt, aber alles
übrige wäre wesentlich abgewichen. Für mich unterlag es keinem Zweifel
-- Wrights Geist hatte am zweiten März über Gebirge und Wüste hinweg,
trotz der Entfernung von dreitausend Meilen, mit dem meinigen in
engster und krystallklarster Verbindung gestanden. Meiner Meinung nach
waren wir nicht beide zugleich auf die ursprüngliche Idee gekommen,
sondern der Geist des einen hatte sie erdacht und sie dem andern
telegraphiert.

Es reizte mich doch zu wissen, wessen Gehirn das Telegraphieren
übernommen hatte und wer der Empfänger der Depesche gewesen war, so
schrieb ich denn an Wright, um mich darnach zu erkundigen. Seine
Antwort bewies mir, daß Gedanke und Botschaft von _seinem_ Geist
ausgegangen waren und der meinige beides nur aufgenommen hatte. Sein
Buch steckte ihm schon lange im Kopfe; es liegt daher auf der Hand, daß
die erste Idee von ihm und nicht von mir herrührt; der Stoff lag mir
ganz fern und ich war obendrein von andern Dingen vollauf in Anspruch
genommen. Trotzdem vermochte es dieser Freund, an den ich seit elf
Jahren nicht mehr gedacht hatte, mir seine Gedanken aus weiter Ferne in
den Kopf zu blitzen, und zwar mit solchem Nachdruck, daß ich für den
Augenblick kein anderes Interesse mehr kannte. Er hatte den Brief an
mich geschrieben, nachdem seine Arbeit für das Morgenblatt beendet war,
etwas nach drei Uhr. Drei Uhr morgens in Nevada ist ungefähr 6 Uhr in
Hartford, zu welcher Zeit ich, wie erwähnt, im Bette lag und an nichts
Besonderes dachte. Gerade um diese Zeit ergoß sich der Strom seiner
Gedanken über den Kontinent hinweg in mein Gehirn, ich stand auf und
schrieb sie nieder unter dem Eindruck, daß sie ausschließlich von mir
selbst stammten.

Das ist sehr bedeutungsvoll und kann von der höchsten Wichtigkeit
werden. Man bedenke nur, wie mancher herrliche Originalgedanke einem
so mir nichts dir nichts von einem dreitausend Meilen weit entfernten
Menschen weggestohlen werden kann. Sollte jemand versucht sein,
diese Thatsache anzuzweifeln, so bitte ich nur, einen Blick in das
Konversationslexikon zu werfen und wieder einmal über den sonderbaren
Umstand in der Geschichte der Erfindungen nachzugrübeln, der einem
jeden schon zu denken gegeben hat -- darüber nämlich, daß so häufig
dieselben Maschinen und Apparate gleichzeitig von mehreren Personen in
verschiedenen Weltteilen erfunden worden sind. Es liegt nicht außer
dem Bereich der Möglichkeit, daß die Erfinder sich, ohne es zu wollen,
gegenseitig ihre Ideen fortstehlen, obgleich sie viel tausend Meilen
von einander getrennt sind.

Gewöhnlich erklärt man zwar dies Gedankenzusammentreffen daraus, daß
große und bedeutsame Entdeckungen sich immer auf Fragen beziehen, mit
welchen die hervorragendsten Geister sich bereits lange und eingehend
beschäftigt haben. Als Beispiele solcher zugleich von verschiedenen
Seiten gewonnener Errungenschaften auf wissenschaftlichem Gebiet
führt man unter andern die Erfindung der Differentialrechnung an,
die Entdeckung des Planeten Neptun, die Entzifferung der egyptischen
Hieroglyphen, die Aufstellung der Vibrationstheorie des Lichts, die
Erfindung des elektrischen Telegraphen und der Spektralanalyse.
Aber vielleicht ist in jedem der angegebenen Fälle die Idee in
dem Geist eines _einzigen_ Gelehrten entsprungen, der sie weiter
telegraphiert hat. Schon seit einem Jahrhundert hatten die Astronomen
jene Aberrationen beobachtet, die endlich Leverrier auf die Vermutung
brachten, daß sich im unermeßlichen Raum ein Planet verbergen müsse,
welcher der Urheber jener Störungen sei. Wie ging es nun aber zu,
daß drei durch weite Entfernung von einander getrennte Menschen,
Leverrier, Mrs. Somerville und Adams auf einmal zu gleicher Zeit
anfingen, sich mit den Aberrationen abzuquälen und alles daran zu
setzen, um ausfindig zu machen, was wohl die Ursache derselben sein
könne? -- Das sonderbare Unternehmen, einen unsichtbaren Planeten zu
messen, zu wägen, seine Bahn zu berechnen, ihm förmlich nachzujagen
und ihn endlich einzufangen, an das noch niemand zuvor gedacht hatte,
konnte nur in dem Kopf eines einzigen Astronomen entsprungen und durch
Gedankentelegraphie den andern Geistern übermittelt worden sein.

       *       *       *       *       *

Letzten Frühling kam ein litterarischer Freund von fern her, um
mich zu besuchen. Im Lauf des Gesprächs erzählte er mir, es sei ihm
eine vollständig neue Idee aufgegangen, wie sie sicherlich in der
Litteratur noch nicht dagewesen wäre, und teilte mir dieselbe mit.
Darauf überreichte ich ihm ein Manuskript, welches ich vor acht
Tagen geschrieben hatte, mit dem Bedeuten, daß er darin seine Idee
der Hauptsache nach getreulich wiedergegeben finden würde. Schon seit
dem vergangenen November beschäftigte dieser Gedanke mein Gehirn --
in das seinige geriet er aber erst vor acht Tagen, während ich das
Schriftstück abfaßte. Da er seine Idee noch nicht zu Papier gebracht
hatte, überließ er mir nun liebenswürdigerweise alle Rechte und Titel
des Erfinders.

Mich haben die spiritistischen Vorstellungen und Geisterkundgebungen,
bei denen ich zugegen war, nie im geringsten überzeugen können, was
jedoch nicht viel sagen will, da meine Erfahrungen auf diesem Felde
nur oberflächlich sind. Daß aber der Geist eines noch -- im Fleisch
wandelnden -- Menschen mit einem andern Menschengeist verkehren kann,
selbst wenn beide durch große Entfernungen getrennt sind, glaube ich
fest. Ja, es ist nicht einmal erforderlich, vorher auf künstliche
Weise einen ›sympathetischen Zustand‹ zu erzeugen, durch welchen
die Gedankentelegraphie vermittelt würde. Nach meiner Ueberzeugung
findet die geistige Wechselwirkung überhaupt nur statt, wenn ein
sympathetischer Zustand vorhanden ist; ich halte es aber nicht für
unmöglich, daß bei ununterbrochenem sympathetischem Zustand auch der
Gedankenverkehr ins Unbegrenzte fortgesetzt werden könnte.

Wir alle haben es wohl schon erlebt, daß plötzlich eine Reihe von
Gedanken und Empfindungen auf uns einstürmten, die wir ganz auf
dieselbe Weise bereits in einem frühern Dasein durchgemacht zu haben
glauben. Ein unheimliches Gefühl! -- Zwar ist ein früheres Dasein nicht
unmöglich, aber dadurch wird dieses spukhafte Geheimnis keineswegs
erklärt. Seine Erklärung liegt vielmehr darin, daß ein Fremder aus
weiter Ferne uns seine Gedanken ins Bewußtsein telegraphiert, bis ein
Gegenstrom oder irgend ein anderes Hindernis plötzlich die Verbindung
unterbricht. Vielleicht scheint es uns etwas früher Erlebtes, weil
es das schon Erlebte eines andern ist, das wir nur aus zweiter Hand
übernehmen. Ob Herr Brown, der berühmte Gedankenleser, wirklich die
Gedanken anderer liest, weiß ich nicht, -- aber _das_ weiß ich, daß
_ich_ sie schon gelesen habe, und warum sollte es da Herr Brown nicht
auch thun können!

       *       *       *       *       *

Vorstehendes schrieb ich vor drei Jahren in Heidelberg und legte das
Manuskript beiseite mit der Absicht, bei Gelegenheit neue Beispiele der
Gedankentelegraphie, die mir vorkommen würden, hinzuzufügen. Inzwischen
hat sich das ›Briefkreuzen‹ so unzähligemale wiederholt, daß es anfängt
eintönig zu werden. Ich habe mir aber eine Lehre daraus gezogen: wenn
ich jetzt die Lust verliere zu warten, ob es jemand, von dem ich gern
Nachricht hätte, endlich gefällig sein wird zur Feder zu greifen,
so zwinge ich ihn dazu, indem ich mich hinsetze und meinerseits an
_ihn_ schreibe. Dann zerreiße ich meinen Brief in guter Ruhe; ihn
abzuschicken ist unnötig, das _Schreiben_ allein genügt vollständig, um
den säumigen Freund zum Entschluß zu bringen.

Nachdem wir Heidelberg verlassen hatten, hielten wir uns eine Zeitlang
in Venedig auf. Eines Tages fuhr ich in einer Gondel den großen Kanal
hinab, als ich einen lauten Zuruf hinter mir hörte und mich umblickte;
eine Gondel folgte der meinigen und der Gondelier machte heftige
Zeichen, ich solle anhalten. Als das Boot herankam, erblickte ich
darin eine amerikanische Dame, die sich seit längerer Zeit in Venedig
aufhielt.

»Sie müssen mir helfen,« sagte sie in großer Aufregung, als ihre Gondel
neben der meinigen angelegt hatte. »Im Britannia-Hotel ist vor einer
Woche ein Herr aus New York mit seiner Frau abgestiegen. Sie erwarteten
Nachrichten von ihrem Sohn vorzufinden, von dem sie seit acht Monaten
nichts gehört haben. Leider war ihre Hoffnung vergebens, die Dame
liegt nun krank, sie ist in Verzweiflung und ihr Mann kann weder
essen noch schlafen. Der Sohn ist vor acht Monaten in San Francisco
angekommen und hat seine Ankunft den Eltern sofort brieflich angezeigt.
Das ist die letzte Spur von ihm. Die Eltern sind inzwischen in Europa
ruhelos von Ort zu Ort gezogen, die ganze Reise ist ihnen verdorben
und sie haben Briefe nach allen Himmelsgegenden geschrieben in der
Hoffnung, Nachrichten über das Verbleiben ihres Sohnes zu erhalten,
dessen Schweigen noch immer unaufgeklärt ist.

»Nun will der Herr es mit einem Kabeltelegramm versuchen. Er will nach
San Francisco telegraphieren, hat sich aber bis jetzt noch nicht dazu
entschließen können, aus Furcht vor was? -- ohne Zweifel aus Furcht,
die Todesnachricht seines Sohnes zu erhalten. Er verlangt jetzt von
mir, daß ich die Depesche abschicke, aber das _kann_ ich nicht, denn,
wenn keine Rückantwort erfolgte -- es wäre der Tod der armen Mutter. In
meiner Angst bin ich Ihnen nachgefahren. Sie müssen mir beistehen, den
Mann zu überreden noch einige Wochen geduldig zu warten, der Aufschub
ist vielleicht die Rettung seiner Frau. Kommen Sie, wir dürfen keine
Zeit verlieren.«

Ich that ihr den Willen, aber auf _meine_ Weise. Als ich dem Herrn
vorgestellt war, sagte ich: »In dergleichen Dingen habe ich meinen
besonderen Aberglauben, der aber wohl beachtet zu werden verdient.
Wenn Sie sofort nach San Francisco telegraphieren, werden Sie binnen
vierundzwanzig Stunden Nachricht erhalten, vielleicht nicht gerade von
dort, aber jedenfalls irgendwoher. Telegraphieren Sie nur schnell, das
ist alles was nötig ist. Die Nachricht wird in vierundzwanzig Stunden
eintreffen, einerlei, ob Sie das Telegramm nach Peking schicken oder
sonstwohin. Die Verzögerung ist nur dadurch entstanden, daß Sie Ihr
Telegramm nicht sofort abgehen ließen, als Sie zuerst Neigung dazu
verspürten.«

Wie thöricht es auch erscheinen mag, der Mann ließ sich wahrhaftig
von dem Unsinn beeinflussen; er erheiterte sich sichtlich, schickte
die Depesche ab und als am nächsten Tage ein langer Brief von dem
verlorenen Sohn ankam, war er mir so dankbar, als hätte mein Rat
wirklich die Ankunft des Briefes beschleunigt. Der Sohn hatte von
San Francisco aus eine Reise im Segelschiff angetreten und erst nach
Monaten in dem ersten Hafen, den er berührte, Gelegenheit gefunden, den
Eltern Nachricht zu geben.

Dies Beispiel hat wenig Bedeutung und beweist nichts; _ich_ erwähne es
nur um zu zeigen, wie sehr das ewige Briefkreuzen meinen Aberglauben
inzwischen verstärkt hatte. Ich war so fest davon überzeugt, daß
ein irgendwohin gerichtetes Kabeltelegramm sich mit den ersehnten
Nachrichten kreuzen würde, daß meine Zuversicht sogar einen
Hoffnungslosen aufzurichten und zu ermutigen vermochte.

Ich lasse hier einige Beispiele von absoluter Gedankentelegraphie
folgen:

An einem Montagmorgen, als die Postsachen hereingebracht wurden, sagte
ich, auf einen der Briefe deutend, zu meinem Freunde: »Ich will dir
angeben, was dieser Brief enthält, ohne ihn zu öffnen. Er kommt von
Frau X., welche schreibt, daß sie letzten Sonnabend in New York gewesen
ist und die Absicht gehabt hat, mit dem Nachmittagszug einen Abstecher
zu machen, um uns zu überraschen, im letzten Augenblick sich aber
anders besonnen habe und nach Hause gefahren sei.«

Alle Einzelheiten stimmten genau. Und doch hatten wir vorher nicht
im mindesten daran gedacht, daß Frau X. nach New York kommen und
beabsichtigen würde, uns zu besuchen.

       *       *       *       *       *

Ich rauche ziemlich stark, ja -- ich gestehe es -- fast ohne
Unterbrechung. Daher versuche ich seit sieben Jahren, eine Schachtel
mit Streichhölzchen hinter einem Bild auf dem Kaminsims immer bereit
zu haben. Leider blieb es aber bei dem Versuch, denn George, mein
schwarzer Diener, der Feuer und Gas anzuzünden hat, brauchte dazu
immer _meine_ Streichhölzchen, ohne daß ihm je einfiel, sie wieder an
ihren Platz zu stellen. Sieben Jahre lang gingen Befehle und Bitten
spurlos an ihm vorüber. Letzten Sommer nun kehrten wir nach einer
mehrmonatlichen Abwesenheit nach Hause zurück und beim Eintreten sage
ich zu einem Familiengliede:

»Nach so langen Ferien und gänzlichem Mangel an Unterbrechungen -- --«

»Ich kann den Satz für dich beenden,« fiel mein Hausgenosse ein.

»Nun, so thue es,« antwortete ich.

»Sollte doch George endlich gelernt haben, meine Streichhölzchen in
Ruhe zu lassen!«



Es stimmte ganz genau. Gerade das hatte ich sagen wollen. Und doch
hatte ich seit drei Monaten nicht an George und die Streichhölzchen
gedacht, auch gab der Anfang meines Satzes sicherlich nicht den
geringsten Aufschluß über das, was folgen sollte.

Dergleichen Vorkommnisse würden mich vor einigen Jahren noch in
Erstaunen gesetzt haben, aber jetzt überraschen sie mich nicht mehr.
Ich weiß ja nun, daß _ein_ Geist auf das innigste mit dem _andern_
verkehren kann, ohne das unbeholfene und beschwerliche Medium der
Sprache.

Unser Zeitalter scheint sich in Erfindungen beinahe erschöpft zu
haben, aber _eine_ wichtige Frage bleibt ihm noch zu lösen: -- die
Erfindung des Phrenophons, das heißt, einer Methode, nach welcher
die Gedankenwechselwirkung mit Sicherheit geleitet und in ein System
gebracht werden kann. Der Telegraph und das Telephon fangen an für
unsere Bedürfnisse zu langsam und wortreich zu arbeiten. Uns genügt
nur, daß der Gedanke selbst, aus beliebiger Entfernung, unmittelbar
mit Blitzesschnelle in unser Gehirn verpflanzt wird; wenn wir ihn
dann durchaus noch in Worte kleiden müssen, so kann ja dieses leidige
Geschäft später mit Muße geschehen. Das gewisse Etwas, welches den
Gedanken durch die Luft von Gehirn zu Gehirn leitet, ist ohne Zweifel
eine zartere und empfindlichere Form der Elektrizität, und es handelt
sich nur darum, auf welche Weise man sie binden und dienstbar machen
kann, ähnlich wie dies mit dem elektrischen Strom geschehen ist. Vor
Erfindung des Telegraphen hätte man alle mit diesem verwandten Wunder
für unausführbar gehalten, eins so gut wie das andere.

Ich möchte darauf wetten, daß, während ich diese Gedanken zu Papier
bringe, irgend jemand auf der andern Hälfte der Erdkugel dasselbe
schreibt. Ob aber _ich_ den Betreffenden anrege oder _er_ mich, läßt
sich nicht bestimmen.




Prinzenverehrung.


Bei meinem Besuche des Bayreuther Theaters bemerkte ich mit
Verwunderung, daß, während die Menge hereinströmte, jeder einzelne
sich umwandte und begierig nach einer Art offenen Galerie hinblickte,
auf welcher die fürstlichen Personen Platz genommen hatten. Viele von
den Zuschauern schienen dabei förmlich vor Entzücken zu erstarren und
konnten sich nicht wieder losreißen.

Ob bei diesem Wohlgefallen an einem Prinzen Neid oder Verehrung
vorherrscht, weiß ich nicht, jedenfalls ist es eine Mischung von
beiden. Auch wird der Hunger und Durst nach dem Anblick eines Fürsten
nicht durch einmalige Betrachtung gestillt, nein, er bleibt unwandelbar
derselbe. Vielleicht erklärt sich diese Erscheinung aus der Freude,
welche der Mensch an einem Wertgegenstand hat, den er gewinnt, ohne
ihn zu erwerben. Der Thaler, den du zufällig findest, freut dich
mehr als die neunundneunzig, die dir Mühe und Arbeit gekostet haben,
und der Gewinn im Pharo oder an der Börse thut deinem Herzen ganz
besonders wohl. -- Ein Prinz findet umsonst, schon in der Wiege, Macht,
Ansehen, freie Zeit, unentgeltliche Verpflegung, aus reinem Zufall,
weil er als Prinz geboren ist; deshalb schaut die kummervolle Armut
und Niedrigkeit zu ihm auf, wie zu einer monumentalen Verkörperung
des Glücks. Und dann -- o größter Vorzug -- kein anderes Glück auf
Erden ist so fest gegründet wie das seine. Der Millionär kann über
Nacht zum Bettler werden, der große Staatsmann einen Fehler begehen,
man läßt ihn fallen und er wird vergessen. Der berühmte General kann
eine entscheidende Schlacht verlieren und verliert dabei zugleich sein
Ansehen bei den Menschen. Aber _bist_ du ein Prinz, so _bleibst_ du ein
Prinz, das heißt ein Halbgott; weder Unglück noch Niederträchtigkeit,
weder ein hohler Kopf noch sonstige Eseleien können dich deiner Hoheit
entkleiden. In der Huldigung der Menschen, mag sie verdient sein oder
unverdient, besteht nach einmütigem Beschluß aller Nationen und aller
Zeiten das höchste Gut auf Erden; folglich ist die Stellung eines
Prinzen die wünschenswerteste unter der Sonne.

Natürlich sind in _unsern_ Augen Fürstlichkeiten nicht das, was
sie dem Europäer gelten. Wir sind nicht dazu erzogen einen Prinzen
zu vergöttern; es würde uns genügen, ihn _einmal_ recht gründlich
anzuschauen, dann wäre unsere Neugier befriedigt; das nächstemal würden
wir ihm schon gleichgültiger begegnen und trachten, einen neuen zu
Gesicht zu bekommen. Nicht so der Europäer; ihm bleibt derselbe Prinz
immer neu und interessant, er veraltet nie.

       *       *       *       *       *

An einem häßlichen, nebligen, naßkalten Dezembertag vor achtzehn
Jahren war ich einmal in London und begab mich in das Haus eines
Engländers, um, wie verabredet, seiner Frau und der verheirateten
Tochter einen Besuch abzustatten. Ich mußte eine halbe Stunde warten,
dann kamen die Damen halb erfroren angegangen und erzählten, daß ein
unerwarteter Umstand sie aufgehalten habe. Während sie am Marlborough
House vorübergingen, sahen sie, wie sich eine Volksmenge versammelte,
und man sagte ihnen, der Prinz von Wales sei im Begriff auszufahren;
sie blieben also stehen und warteten. Nachdem sie eine halbe Stunde auf
dem Bürgersteig gestanden hatten und vom Frost ganz erstarrt waren,
erfuhren sie, daß der Prinz von Wales sich anders besonnen habe, und
gingen betrübt nach Hause. Das überraschte mich sehr.

»Ist es denn möglich,« fragte ich ganz erstaunt, »daß Sie alle die
Jahre in London leben und den Prinzen von Wales noch nicht gesehen
haben?«

Aber siehe, nun war das Erstaunen auf _ihrer_ Seite.

»Was für eine Idee!« riefen sie. »Natürlich haben wir ihn schon
hundertmal gesehen!«

Sie hatten ihn schon hundertmal gesehen und doch eine halbe Stunde in
bitterer Kälte und Dunkelheit auf ihn gewartet, eingekeilt in einem
Haufen ebensolcher Narren, um ihn _noch_ einmal zu sehen! -- Ich traute
meinen Ohren kaum, aber was eine Engländerin sagt, muß man glauben, mag
es noch so unwahrscheinlich klingen. Es wurde mir schwer eine passende
Erwiderung zu finden, endlich verfiel ich auf folgende:

»Mir ist das ganz unbegreiflich. Selbst wenn ich den General Grant
_nie_ gesehen hätte, würde ich schwerlich solche Opfer bringen, um mir
seinen Anblick zu verschaffen.«

Die verständnislosen Gesichter der Damen verrieten mir, daß der Sinn
des Vergleichs ihnen gänzlich dunkel war. Endlich sagten sie gelassen:

»Das versteht sich von selbst -- er ist ja nur ein Präsident!«

Es steht also unumstößlich fest, daß nur ein Prinz von unvergänglichem,
unerschöpflichem Interesse ist. Der General, den kein Feind besiegt
hat, der General, der nie einen Kriegsrat brauchte, der einzige
General, der eine Schlachtlinie befehligte, welche ununterbrochen
zwölfhundert Meilen lang war, der Schmied, der die getrennten Teile
unserer Republik zusammengeschweißt hat und sie so fest gefügt, daß
sie voraussichtlich alle Monarchieen der Welt überdauern wird -- der
war in ihren Augen schließlich nur ein Mensch. Ihr Prinz dagegen war
weit mehr, nämlich ein Wesen aus ganz anderm Stoff, hoch erhaben
über dem gewöhnlichen Sterblichen, den er überstrahlt wie die ewigen
Sterne am Firmament unsere armseligen Talglichter, welche qualmen und
verlöschen, von denen nichts zurückbleibt, als ein Häufchen Asche und
ein schlechter Geruch.






Die 1000000 Pfund-Note.


Mit siebenundzwanzig Jahren nahm ich in San Francisco eine Stellung auf
dem Kontor eines Minenmaklers ein und hatte mir dabei eine gründliche
Kenntnis dieses Geschäftszweiges erworben. Ich stand allein auf der
Welt, nichts nannte ich mein eigen als meinen gesunden Verstand und
einen fleckenlosen Ruf, und diese beiden Güter hatten sich mir bisher
als kräftige Stützen auf meinem Wege zum Glück erwiesen, frohen Mutes
schaute ich also in die Zukunft.

Sonnabends hatte ich den Nachmittag für mich und brachte diese freie
Zeit meist auf dem Wasser zu, indem ich mich in einem kleinen Segelboot
in der Bucht herum tummelte. Eines Tages wagte ich mich zu weit hinaus
und wurde in die offene See getrieben. Schon brach die Nacht herein,
meine letzte Hoffnung begann zu schwinden, da nahm mich eine kleine
Brigg, die auf ihrem Weg nach London vorüber segelte, an Bord.

Sie hatte eine lange, stürmische Fahrt, und ich mußte das Reisegeld als
gemeiner Matrose abdienen. In zerlumpten, abgeschabten Kleidern stieg
ich in London ans Land, einen einzigen Dollar in der Tasche. Dafür
verschaffte ich mir Nahrung und Obdach für die ersten vierundzwanzig
Stunden. Die folgenden vierundzwanzig dagegen verbrachte ich ohne diese
schätzenswerten irdischen Güter.

Am folgenden Morgen schleppte ich mich, müde und hungrig, -- es mochte
etwa zehn Uhr sein -- an Portland-Place vorüber, als ein Kind, das an
der Hand seiner Wärterin des Weges kam, eine köstliche große Birne,
die es eben erst angebissen hatte, in den Rinnstein fallen ließ. Ich
machte natürlich sofort Halt und heftete meinen begehrlichen Blick auf
diesen schmutztriefenden Schatz. Der Mund wässerte mir, mein Magen
bäumte sich, jede Faser an mir lechzte darnach. Aber so oft ich Miene
machte nach der Birne zu greifen, bemerkte jedesmal das Auge eines
Vorübergehenden mein Vorhaben; natürlich richtete ich mich dann stets
wieder kerzengerade auf und nahm eine gleichgiltige Miene an, als hätte
ich überhaupt niemals im entferntesten an diese Birne gedacht. So ging
es immer und immer wieder, und ich konnte ihrer nicht habhaft werden.
Meine Verzweiflung hatte bereits einen solchen Grad erreicht, daß ich
allem Schamgefühl zum Trotz im Begriffe war, die Birne aufzuheben. Da
ging hinter mir ein Fenster auf und ein Herr richtete die Worte an mich:

»Bitte, kommen Sie hier herein.«



Ein reich galonnierter Lakai ließ mich ein und führte mich in ein
kostbar eingerichtetes Zimmer, in welchem zwei ältliche Herren saßen.
Nachdem sie den Diener weggeschickt, forderten sie mich auf, Platz
zu nehmen. Sie waren eben erst mit ihrem Frühstück fertig geworden,
und der Anblick seiner Ueberreste ging fast über meine Kräfte. Ich
vermochte kaum meine fünf Sinne zusammenzuhalten, während ich diese
Herrlichkeiten da vor mir stehen sah; da man mich jedoch nicht
aufforderte, davon zu kosten, so mußte ich mich in meine Lage fügen so
gut es ging.

Der Vorgang, der sich hier kurz zuvor abgespielt hatte, blieb mir
selbst zwar noch geraume Zeit völlig unbekannt, dem Leser dagegen will
ich ihn gleich jetzt mitteilen. Die beiden Brüder hatten am Tage vorher
einen ziemlich heftigen Disput gehabt, den sie ganz nach Landessitte
schließlich in Form einer Wette beilegten.

Die Bank von England hatte seinerzeit einmal bei Gelegenheit eines
Geschäftes, das die Regierung mit einer auswärtigen Macht abschloß,
eigens nur zu diesem Zwecke zwei Noten von je einer Million Pfund
Sterling ausgegeben. Aus irgend einem Grunde war nur die eine der
beiden Noten hiebei gebraucht und dann entwertet worden, während die
andere noch in den Gewölben der Bank lag. Nun waren die beiden Brüder
im Laufe des Gesprächs ganz zufällig auf die Erörterung der Frage
gekommen: wie es wohl einem durchaus ehrlichen und gescheiten Fremden
ergehen würde, der in London auftauchte, ohne dort einen Menschen
zu kennen, zugleich ohne allen weiteren Geldbesitz außer dieser
Millionenbanknote und endlich ohne die Möglichkeit, sich über deren
Erwerb auszuweisen? Bruder A. behauptete, der Betreffende müsse einfach
Hungers sterben, während Bruder B. durchaus entgegengesetzter Meinung
war. Bruder A. machte geltend, der Besitzer der Note könnte ja die
Note weder bei der Bank noch sonst wo anbringen, ohne auf der Stelle
festgenommen zu werden. In dieser Weise stritten sie so lange hin und
her, bis Bruder B. sich schließlich bereit erklärte, zwanzigtausend
Pfund darauf zu wetten, daß der Fremde dreißig Tage lang _unfehlbar_
von der Millionennote leben könne und zwar ohne ins Gefängnis zu
kommen. Bruder A. nahm die Wette an, worauf Bruder B. sich ohne Verzug
nach der Bank begab und die Note kaufte. Echt englisch, wie man sieht:
geradeswegs forsch aufs Ziel los! Er ließ sodann von einem seiner
Angestellten einen Brief in schöner Rundschrift dazu ausfertigen,
und nun warteten die beiden Brüder am Fenster einen ganzen Tag lang
auf einen Vorübergehenden, der darnach aussähe, als käme bei ihm das
inhaltschwere Schriftstück in die richtigen Hände.

Es kamen viele ehrliche Gesichter vorüber, die aber nicht gescheit
genug aussahen; ebensoviele, bei denen das Umgekehrte der Fall war,
viele wiederum, bei denen beides zutraf; aber diese waren dann entweder
nicht arm genug oder, wenn auch dieses stimmte, doch keine Fremden.
Stets hatte die Sache irgend einen Haken, bis ich auftauchte. Bei
mir hatten beide sofort den Eindruck, daß sämtliche Erfordernisse in
vollem Umfang erfüllt seien; die Wahl war demnach einstimmig auf mich
gefallen, und da saß ich nun und harrte der Eröffnung, wozu man mich
eigentlich hereingerufen habe. Zuvörderst hatte ich ein eingehendes
Examen über meine persönlichen Verhältnisse zu bestehen, infolgedessen
sie bald genug mit meiner ganzen Geschichte bekannt waren; das Ergebnis
war: ich sei ganz der richtige Mann für ihr Vorhaben. Ich erwiderte,
das sei mir höchst erfreulich, ich bäte nur, mir sagen zu wollen,
worin dieses bestehe. Hierauf behändigte mir der eine der Beiden einen
verschlossenen Briefumschlag mit dem Bemerken, darin sei die Erklärung
enthalten. Ich wollte den Umschlag ohne weiteres öffnen, allein er
ließ dies nicht zu; ich solle denselben nur mit nach Hause nehmen,
den Inhalt aufmerksam ansehen und dann mit vollem Bedacht und ruhiger
Ueberlegung handeln. Einigermaßen verdutzt meinte ich, es wäre mir
doch lieber, wenn die Sache etwas genauer erörtert werden könnte, sie
ließen sich jedoch nicht darauf ein; so verabschiedete ich mich denn,
tief gekränkt über den schlechten Scherz, den man sich offenbar mit mir
erlaubt hatte, und voll Grimm über meine dermalige Lage, in der ich mir
diesen Schimpf von so reichen und mächtigen Leuten ganz ruhig mußte
gefallen lassen.

Die Birne hätte ich jetzt unfehlbar aufgehoben und vor aller Welt
verzehrt, aber sie war nicht mehr da. Also auch um sie hatte mich
die unselige Geschichte gebracht! Diese Vorstellung war nicht dazu
angethan, mich den beiden alten Herren gegenüber sanfter zu stimmen.
Sobald ich aus der Sehweite des Hauses war, öffnete ich den Umschlag.
Ich erblickte eine Banknote! Nun erschienen mir die Herren natürlich
auf einmal in ganz anderem Lichte. Ohne mich einen Augenblick zu
besinnen, schob ich den Brief samt dem Geld in die Westentasche und
lief spornstreichs nach der nächsten billigen Speisewirtschaft. Nun,
wie ich da einhieb, das mußte man sehen! Als schließlich nichts mehr
in mich hineinging, nahm ich die Note aus der Tasche und faltete sie
auseinander. Beim ersten Blick darauf wäre ich beinahe in Ohnmacht
gefallen. Fünf Millionen Dollars!! Mir wirbelte der Kopf bei der bloßen
Vorstellung.

Eine volle Minute dauerte es, bis ich aus der Betäubung, in welche
mich der Anblick der Note versetzte, heraus und wieder ordentlich
zu mir kam. Das erste, was mir nun ins Auge fiel, war der Wirt. Wie
versteinert stand er da, starr den Blick auf die Banknote gerichtet.
Es sah aus, als sei er vor lauter Verzückung nicht mehr imstande ein
Glied zu rühren. Augenblicklich hatte ich den Entschluß gefaßt, der bei
dieser Sachlage der einzig vernünftige war. Ich streckte ihm die Note
hin und sagte dabei in ganz unbefangenem Tone:

»Bitte, wollen Sie mir herausgeben.«

Diese Anrede gab ihm sein geistiges Gleichgewicht wieder. Er erschöpfte
sich in Entschuldigungen, daß er nicht imstande sei die Note zu
wechseln, und wollte sie um keinen Preis annehmen. Nur anschauen wollte
er sie, immer wieder anschauen; es war, als könnte er sich nicht
satt daran sehen; vor ihrer Berührung dagegen scheute er zurück, als
wäre es ein geweihter Gegenstand, viel zu heilig für die Hände eines
Sterblichen.



»Es thut mir leid, wenn ich Ihnen Mühe mache,« begann ich wieder,
»allein ich muß darauf beharren, daß Sie mir auf die Note herausgeben,
ich habe kein Geld sonst.«

Das mache ganz und gar nichts, versetzte er, er lasse diese
unbedeutende Zeche ganz gern bis zum nächstenmal stehen. Ich erwiderte,
es könne lange dauern, bis ich wieder bei ihm vorbei komme; allein er
versicherte abermals, das habe nichts auf sich, er könne wohl warten,
ich könne überhaupt zu jeder Zeit bei ihm haben was ich wolle und den
Betrag dafür stehen lassen, so lange es mir beliebe. Ich werde doch
nicht von ihm glauben, daß er einem so reichen Herrn wie ich, bloß
deshalb kein Vertrauen schenke, weil ich ein lustiger Kauz sei, der
zum Ulk gerne in geringer Kleidung unter die Leute gehe. Unterdessen
hatten sich weitere Gäste eingefunden; auch jetzt gab er mir noch
durch Zeichen zu verstehen, ich solle das Ungetüm doch nur wieder
einstecken; und als ich fortging, machte er einen Bückling um den
andern hinter mir drein bis zur Thür. Ich machte mich schnurstracks
wieder auf den Weg nach der Wohnung des Brüderpaars, um die Leutchen
von der vorgekommenen Verwechslung in Kenntnis zu setzen, ehe ich durch
polizeiliche Nachforschungen hiezu veranlaßt würde. Es war mir gar
nicht recht wohl bei der Sache, ja, ich hatte eigentlich ganz gehörig
Angst, obwohl mich natürlich durchaus keine Schuld traf. Aber ich
kannte die Welt und wußte nur zu wohl, daß, wenn jemand aus Versehen
einem Bettler statt einer Einpfundnote eine Millionenbanknote giebt,
er unfehlbar in eine gräßliche Wut auf den armen Teufel gerät, anstatt
sich für seine Kurzsichtigkeit nach Gebühr an der eigenen Nase zu
fassen. Als ich in die Nähe des Hauses kam, begann sich meine Aufregung
etwas zu legen, denn da war alles still und ruhig. -- Offenbar war der
Streich noch nicht entdeckt worden. Ich klingelte. Derselbe Bediente
wie das erstemal erschien wieder. Ich fragte nach den beiden Herrn.

»Sie sind fort,« erwiderte er in dem hochmütigen, kalten Ton, den
seinesgleichen meist an sich haben.

»Fort? Wohin?«

»Verreist.«

»In welcher Richtung?«

»Wahrscheinlich nach dem Kontinent.«

»Dem Kontinent?«

»Jawohl.«

»Welchen Weg haben sie eingeschlagen?«

»Kann ich nicht sagen.«

»Wann kommen sie denn zurück?«

»In einem Monat, wie sie sagten.«

»In einem Monat! Ach, das ist ja schrecklich! Geben Sie mir doch nur
irgend einen noch so entfernten Anhaltspunkt, wie ich ihnen ein Wort
zukommen lassen kann. Es ist von der allerhöchsten Wichtigkeit.«

»Kann ich wirklich nicht. Ich habe keine Ahnung, wohin sie gereist
sind.«

»Dann muß ich irgend ein Angehöriges der Familie sprechen.«

»Die Familie ist ebenfalls fort, auf Reisen schon seit Monaten -- in
Aegypten, Indien, glaube ich.«

»Mann, es ist ein ungeheures Versehen vorgekommen. Noch vor Nacht
kommen die Herren gewiß zurück. Wollen Sie ihnen dann sagen, ich sei
dagewesen und werde so lange immer wieder kommen, bis die Sache in
Ordnung sei. Sie dürften also ganz unbesorgt sein.«

»Ich will es ihnen sagen, falls sie zurückkommen, aber ich erwarte sie
nicht zurück. Die Herren sagten, daß Sie schon in einer Stunde wieder
erscheinen würden, um nachzufragen. Ich solle Ihnen aber nur sagen, es
sei alles in Ordnung, sie würden schon zur rechten Zeit zurück sein und
Sie erwarten.«

Nun mußte ich mein Vorhaben freilich aufgeben und wieder fortgehen.
-- Dieses unergründliche Rätsel! Mir war, als müßte ich den Verstand
darüber verlieren. Sie würden »zu rechter Zeit zurück sein.« Was konnte
das zu bedeuten haben? O, in dem Briefe würde ich vielleicht Aufklärung
darüber finden. Den hatte ich ganz vergessen. Ich zog ihn aus der
Tasche und las ihn durch. Er lautete:

»Gescheit und ehrlich sind Sie, das sieht man Ihnen am Gesichte an.
Wie wir weiter annehmen dürfen, sind Sie außerdem mittellos und fremd.
Inliegend finden Sie einen Geldbetrag, der zu einem unverzinslichen
Darlehen für Sie auf die Dauer von dreißig Tagen bestimmt ist. Nach
Verlauf dieser Zeit sprechen Sie wieder hier vor. Ich habe eine Wette
auf Sie gemacht. Gewinne ich sie, so sollen Sie jede beliebige Stellung
erhalten, die ich zu vergeben habe -- d. h. vorausgesetzt natürlich,
das solche Ihrer bisherigen Thätigkeit entspricht und daß Sie die
Fähigkeit besitzen, sie auszufüllen.«

-- Keine Unterschrift, keine Adresse, kein Datum. --

Nun, da steckte ich in einer netten Klemme. Der Leser kennt ja die
Vorgeschichte des Falles, ich selbst dagegen hatte keine Ahnung davon.
Für mich war das Ganze lediglich ein unergründliches, dunkles Rätsel.
Ich hatte nicht die entfernteste Vorstellung, um was es sich bei der
Sache handelte und ob es dabei gut oder schlecht mit mir gemeint war.
In einer öffentlichen Anlage ließ ich mich auf einer Bank nieder, um
hier die Sache gründlich zu überdenken und mich über mein ferneres
Verhalten schlüssig zu machen.



Nach Verlauf einer Stunde hatte bei mir an der Hand meiner Erwägungen
die folgende Auffassung endgiltige Gestalt gewonnen: Ob es die beiden
Herren gut mit mir meinen oder schlecht, ist eine Frage, die ich nicht
zu ergründen vermag, -- also: ruhig zusehen. Es handelt sich dabei
um einen Scherz, eine Idee oder ein Experiment irgend welcher Art,
worüber ich ebensowenig ins klare kommen kann, -- also wiederum ruhig
zusehen. Man ist auf mich eine Wette eingegangen, deren Gegenstand
ich unmöglich zu erraten imstande bin -- also abermals ruhig zusehen.
Damit wären die unfaßbaren Größen abgethan; die übrigen in Betracht
kommenden Faktoren sind dagegen sämtlich greifbarer, reeller Art und
lassen sich ganz genau zum voraus bestimmen und berechnen. Wenn ich
bei der Bank von England darum nachsuche, die Note dem Eigentümer auf
Rechnung zu stellen, so wird man allerdings meinem Antrage nachkommen,
denn dort kennt man ja seinen Namen, wenn auch ich ihn nicht weiß;
aber dann wird man mich weiter fragen, wie ich in den Besitz der Note
komme? Sage ich die Wahrheit, so sperrt man mich selbstredend in
ein Irrenhaus, lüge ich dagegen, so erhalte ich Quartier in Numero
Sicher. Genau ebenso würde es mir ergehen, falls ich versuchen wollte,
die Note irgendwo sonst einzulösen oder Geld darauf aufzunehmen.
Ich _muß_ diese unerträgliche Last mit mir herumschleppen, bis jene
Herren zurückkommen, ob ich will, oder nicht. Sie ist ohne allen Wert
für mich, so wertlos wie eine Hand voll Asche, und doch muß ich sie
aufs sorgfältigste behüten und bewahren, während ich dabei auf fremde
Mildthätigkeit angewiesen bin, um mein Leben zu fristen. Nicht einmal
verschenken könnte ich die Note, wenn ich wollte; denn kein ehrlicher
Bürger, ja selbst nicht der gemeinste Straßenräuber würde sie annehmen
oder das geringste damit zu thun haben wollen. Das Bruderpaar ist in
jedem Falle vollkommen gedeckt, -- selbst wenn ich die Note verliere
oder verbrenne; denn im ersten Falle brauchen sie nur Zahlungssperre zu
veranlassen, im zweiten dagegen ersetzt ihnen die Bank den vollen Wert.
Ich dagegen muß inzwischen einen ganzen Monat voll unerhörter Qualen
durchmachen, ohne im geringsten Entgelt oder Lohn dafür zu erhalten, --
wofern ich nicht jene Wette gewinnen helfe, sie mag sich nun beziehen
worauf sie wolle, und dafür die mir zugesagte Stellung erhalte. Ja
freilich, wenn ich _die_ bekäme! -- So große Herren haben oft Pöstchen
zu vergeben, nach denen man sich die Finger leckt.

Von dem Gedanken an diesen Posten konnte ich mich nun nicht mehr
losreißen. Ich begann, mich mit hochfliegenden Hoffnungen zu tragen.
Zweifelsohne war ein glänzender Gehalt damit verbunden, der mit
nächstem Monat beginnen mußte, und damit war ich ja dann wieder völlig
flott. Diese frohen Aussichten versetzten mich rasch in eine sehr
gehobene Stimmung, obwohl ich vorläufig noch immer ziellos in den
Straßen umherirrte. Als ich an einem Kleiderladen vorbei kam, erfaßte
mich das sehnlichste Verlangen, meine Lumpen abzuwerfen und mich wieder
einmal anständig zu kleiden. Konnte ich mir das leisten? Nein, denn
ich besaß wohl eine Millionenpfundnote, aber sonst nichts auf der
Welt. So zwang ich mich denn, an dem Laden vorüberzugehen. Aber bald
stand ich wieder davor. Die Versuchung war zu grausam; gewiß sechsmal
ging ich bis an den Laden hin und wieder fort, während ich heldenmütig
gegen sie ankämpfte. Aber schließlich gab ich mich überwunden -- ich
konnte nicht anders. Ich fragte nach einem verschnittenen Anzug, der
ihnen vielleicht liegen geblieben sei. Der Bedienstete, an den ich mich
gewendet hatte, nickte nur stumm einem andern zu. Als ich auf diesen
zuging, wies er mich in gleicher Weise an einen dritten, der mir nun
zurief:

»Werde Sie sogleich bedienen!«

Ich wartete, bis er mit seinem augenblicklichen Geschäfte fertig war,
dann führte er mich in ein Hinterzimmer, wo er aus einem ganzen Haufen
verschnittener Anzüge den schlechtesten für mich heraussuchte. Ich zog
ihn an. Er paßte nicht, war auch durchaus nicht hübsch, dagegen war
er völlig neu und somit für mich höchst begehrenswert. Ich hatte also
nichts daran auszusetzen und bemerkte in etwas unsicherem Tone:

»Es wäre mir sehr erwünscht, wenn Sie einige Tage auf den Betrag warten
könnten. Ich habe kein kleines Geld bei mir.«

Der Kerl nahm eine unverschämt spöttische Miene an und erwiderte:

»Ach, wirklich! Nun, das habe ich mir gleich gedacht. Herren wie Sie,
haben gewöhnlich nur große Scheine in der Tasche.«

Aergerlich über diese Unverschämtheit versetzte ich:

»Lieber Freund, Sie müssen jemand, den Sie nicht kennen, nicht immer
nach den Kleidern beurteilen, die er trägt; ich bin wirklich ganz
wohl imstande, den Anzug zu bezahlen. Ich wollte Ihnen nur die Mühe
ersparen, eine große Note zu wechseln.«

Darauf milderte er seinen Ton ein wenig und erwiderte, immer noch
ziemlich von oben herab:

»Ich wollte Ihnen ja nicht zu nahe treten; aber wenn wir uns denn doch
einmal gegenseitig die Wahrheit sagen, so finde ich es nicht gerade
am Platze, daß Sie sich daran zu zweifeln erlauben, ob wir auf eine
Banknote, die Sie bei sich tragen, auch herausgeben können. Wir geben
auf _jede_ heraus.«

»O, das ist etwas anderes; dann bitte ich um Vergebung,« erwiderte
ich und reichte ihm die Note hinüber. Mit einem Lächeln nahm er sie
entgegen, mit jener Art von Lächeln, die das ganze Gesicht mit einem
System von Falten, Runzeln und Schlangenlinien überzieht, wie die
Ringe auf einer Wasserfläche, wenn man einen Stein hineingeworfen
hat. Als er aber den Blick auf die Note gleiten ließ, wurde dieses
Lächeln plötzlich zu Stein und nahm eine graugelbe Farbe an, so daß es
aussah, wie die Lavastücke, die man zu wellenförmig gewundenen Gebilden
erstarrt an den Abhängen des Vesuv findet. Das war das erstemal
in meinem Leben, daß vor meinen Augen ein Lächeln so vollkommen
unverändert stehen blieb. Immer noch stand der Mensch, die Note in der
Hand, mit demselben Ausdruck da, bis endlich der Prinzipal herbeigeeilt
kam, um zu sehen, was denn sei.

»Nun, was giebt's?« fragte er, »was ist los? wo fehlt's?«

»Es giebt gar nichts,« versetzte ich, »ich warte nur auf mein
Kleingeld.«

»So geben Sie ihm doch heraus, White, frisch vorwärts!«

»Herausgeben!« rief der Commis, der nun auch wieder zum Leben erwachte,
»das ist leicht gesagt; sehen Sie nur erst die Note einmal an!«

Der Prinzipal warf einen Blick darauf, dann pfiff er in vielsagender
Weise halblaut durch die Zähne und machte sich über den Haufen
verschnittener Anzüge her, indem er sie fortwährend von einer Seite
zur andern warf. Dabei machte er seiner Aufregung durch folgendes
Selbstgespräch Luft:

»Einem exzentrischen Millionär einen solch unsagbar scheußlichen Anzug
zu verkaufen! White ist ein Narr, ein geborener Narr. Immerfort macht
er solche Streiche. So oft ein Millionär in den Laden kommt, treibt er
ihn mir wieder hinaus, weil er es in seinem ganzen Leben noch nicht
so weit gebracht hat, daß er einen Millionär von einem Bettler zu
unterscheiden imstande ist. So, da hab' ich, was ich suchte,« wandte
er sich nun an mich. »Bitte, legen Sie doch das Zeug da wieder ab und
werfen Sie es ins Feuer. Thun Sie mir den Gefallen und ziehen Sie dafür
dieses Hemd an und diesen Anzug hier. Das ist das einzig Richtige,
das einzig Wahre -- einfach und doch reich, wahrhaft fürstlich und
doch nicht im mindesten auffallend. Wurde für eine ausländische
Fürstlichkeit eigens angefertigt; der Besteller konnte es aber nicht
brauchen und mußte einen Traueranzug dagegen nehmen, weil man meinte,
seine Mutter liege im Sterben -- und dann starb sie nicht. Aber das ist
Nebensache, es geht eben nicht immer wie wir eh, eh -- das heißt wie
man -- Da! die Hosen sind ganz recht, sitzen Ihnen wunderbar. Jetzt
die Weste. Aha, ebenfalls vorzüglich! Jetzt den Rock! -- Guter Gott,
schauen Sie nur her, großartig, unübertrefflich! das Vollkommenste, was
je aus meinem Geschäfte hervorgegangen ist.«



Ich konnte nicht umhin, meiner Befriedigung Ausdruck zu geben.

»O gewiß, gewiß. Für einen fertigen Anzug paßt er ja ganz gut, das muß
ich selber sagen. Aber warten Sie nur, was wir Ihnen erst nach Maß
liefern werden. Vorwärts, White, Buch und Feder, aber rasch!« Dann
fing er an: »Beinlänge 32,« und so fort. Ehe ich eine Silbe dagegen
vorzubringen vermochte, hatte er mir das Maß zu Gesellschaftsanzügen,
Morgenanzügen und allem möglichen sonst genommen. Als ich endlich zu
Worte kommen konnte, sagte ich:

»Aber, mein werter Herr, ich kann das alles _unmöglich_ bestellen, wenn
Sie nicht mit der Bezahlung auf unbestimmte Zeit warten oder die Note
wechseln können.«

»Auf unbestimmte Zeit! Das will ja gar nichts heißen, gar nichts. In
alle Ewigkeit -- so müssen Sie sagen. White, lassen Sie die Sachen
schleunigst anfertigen und dem Herrn dann unverzüglich in die Wohnung
schicken. Die kleineren Kunden mögen warten. Notieren Sie die Adresse
des Herrn.«

»Ich bin eben im Umzug begriffen; ich komme dann wieder herüber und
gebe Ihnen meine neue Adresse,« warf ich ein.

»Ganz schön, ganz schön. Nur einen Augenblick, bitte, dann werde ich
Sie zur Thür geleiten. So, hier -- habe die Ehre, mich Ihnen bestens zu
empfehlen!«

Nun, so mußte es ja wohl kommen, nicht wahr? Auf dem allernatürlichsten
Wege war ich bald dahin gelangt, daß ich überall einfach verlangte,
was ich haben wollte und dann beim Bezahlen mit meiner Millionennote
vorrückte. Noch bevor eine Woche um war, wohnte ich kostbar
eingerichtet im größten Luxus und von aller Bequemlichkeit umgeben in
einem teuren Privathotel in Hanover Square. Hier nahm ich auch das
Diner ein, zum Frühstück dagegen suchte ich regelmäßig die kleine
Speisewirtschaft auf, in der mir meine Millionennote zu meinem ersten
Mahl verholfen hatte. Die Wirtschaft gelangte durch mich zu ungeahnter
Blüte. Allenthalben sprach man davon, daß der fremde Kauz, der die
Millionen nur in der Westentasche herumtrage, ihr seine Gönnerschaft
zuwende. Dies genügte, um aus dem armseligen, elenden Ding, das
mit Mühe sein Dasein fristete, ein berühmtes, stets überfülltes
Lokal zu machen. In seiner Dankbarkeit drängte mir der Wirt ein
Darlehen nach dem andern auf und ließ schlechterdings keine Weigerung
gelten, so daß ich trotz meiner Bettelarmut im Gelde schwamm und ein
wahres Herrenleben führte. Dabei sagte ich mir wohl, daß ich einem
unvermeidlichen Krach entgegengehe; aber nun war es einmal so weit
gekommen und jetzt hieß es, mit dem Strome schwimmen oder untergehen.
Man sieht, ohne dieses Vorgefühl eines drohenden Unheils würde meine
Lage einfach lächerlich erschienen sein; aber so erhielt sie dadurch
eine sehr ernste, nüchterne Seite, ja geradezu einen tragischen
Zug. Nachts im Finstern drängte sich dieses Gefühl besonders in den
Vordergrund, warnend und drohend, so daß ich mich seufzend auf meinem
Lager herumwarf, und nur mit Mühe Schlaf finden konnte. Aber im frohen
Schimmer des Tageslichts war dieser tragische Zug immer sehr bald
wieder verflogen und dann schwebte ich in höheren Regionen und wiegte
mich in einem wahren Taumel, in einem förmlichen Rausche des Glücks.

Und das war auch ganz natürlich. War ich doch zu einer der
Merkwürdigkeiten der größten Stadt der Welt geworden. Das war mir
denn zu Kopfe gestiegen, und zwar nicht etwa nur so ein klein wenig,
sondern ganz gehörig. Keine Zeitung im ganzen Vereinigten Königreich
konnte man mehr zur Hand nehmen, ohne auf einen oder mehrere Artikel
über den ›Mann mit der Million in der Westentasche‹ und auf Berichte
über das Neueste, was er gesagt und gethan, zu stoßen. Zuerst waren
diese Notizen am Fuße der Personalnachrichten erschienen, bald aber
kam ich über die Ritter, dann über die Baronets und so immer höher
hinauf, je berühmter ich wurde, bis ich schließlich den höchsten für
mich möglichen Ehrenplatz einnahm, auf dem mir nur noch Prinzen von
königlichem Geblüt und der Primas von ganz England vorgingen. Aber,
wohl gemerkt, das war noch kein wahrer Ruhm, was ich bis jetzt besaß,
nur Berühmtheit; da kam ein Knalleffekt, der mit einem Schlage das
vergängliche Blech der Berühmtheit in das gediegene Gold des Ruhmes
verwandelte: im ›Punch‹ erschien eine Karikatur von mir. Ja, jetzt
war ich ein gemachter Mann; jetzt war mir mein Rang gesichert. Witze
durfte man nun wohl noch über mich machen, aber nur ganz respektvolle,
keine spöttischen oder rohen mehr. Man konnte über mich lächeln;
auslachen dagegen durfte man mich nicht mehr. Diese Zeiten waren
vorüber. Der ›Punch‹ bildete mich ab wie ich ganz in Lumpen gehüllt mit
einem wohlgenährten Protzen um den Londoner Tower würfelte. Nun, man
kann sich einbilden, wie das auf einen jungen Menschen wirken mußte,
um den sich bisher kein Mensch gekümmert hatte, wenn er sah, daß er
kein Wort mehr sagen konnte, ohne daß es aufgeschnappt und von allen
Lippen wiederholt wurde; wenn er überall, wo er sich sehen ließ, die
Bemerkungen von Mund zu Mund fliegen hörte: »da geht er«; »das ist
er«; wenn er sein Frühstück nicht einnehmen konnte, ohne dabei von
einer gaffenden Zuschauermenge umlagert zu werden und sich in keiner
Opernloge zeigen durfte, ohne augenblicklich einem Kreuzfeuer von
tausend Gläsern ausgesetzt zu sein. Kurz und gut -- ich schaukelte mich
den ganzen Tag auf einem wahren Ozean von Ruhm.

Ich hatte sogar meinen zerlumpten Anzug behalten und ging ab und zu
darin aus, um das Vergnügen wieder einmal durchzukosten, mich beim
Einkauf irgend einer Kleinigkeit beleidigen zu lassen und dann den
Unverschämten mit meiner Millionennote niederzuschmettern. Aber lange
konnte ich das nicht fortführen. Aus den illustrierten Zeitungen war
meine Erscheinung so allgemein bekannt, daß ich mich in diesem Aufzuge
stets augenblicklich erkannt und von einer Menschenmenge verfolgt
sah; und sobald ich Miene machte, etwas kaufen zu wollen, bot mir der
Geschäftsinhaber seinen ganzen Laden auf Kredit an, noch ehe ich dazu
kommen konnte, meine Note auf ihn los zu lassen.

Etwa zehn Tage, nachdem ich zu dieser Berühmtheit gelangt war, dachte
ich daran, meiner patriotischen Pflicht nachzukommen, indem ich dem
amerikanischen Gesandten meine Aufwartung machte. Er empfing mich mit
dem meinem Falle angemessenen Entzücken, machte mir Vorwürfe, daß ich
die Erfüllung dieser meiner Pflicht so lange habe anstehen lassen und
erklärte mir, nur dadurch könne ich mir seine Vergebung erkaufen, daß
ich bei einer am Abend in seinem Hause stattfindenden Gesellschaft
den Platz eines durch Krankheit verhinderten Gastes einnehme. Ich
sagte zu, und wir kamen allmählich tiefer ins Gespräch. Dabei stellte
sich heraus, daß er mit meinem Vater auf einer Schulbank gesessen und
später zusammen mit demselben im Yale College studiert und bis zu
meines Vaters Tode Freundschaft mit ihm unterhalten hatte. So lud er
mich denn ein, jede freie Stunde in seinem Hause zu verbringen, was
ich natürlich mit Freuden annahm. Genauer gesagt war mir das mehr als
angenehm, es war mir vom höchsten Werte. Bei Eintritt des Krachs war er
doch vielleicht imstande, mich vor gänzlichem Untergang zu bewahren.
Ich konnte mir zwar nicht recht vorstellen, wie das zugehen sollte;
allein ich dachte, er würde vielleicht schon einen Weg dazu finden.
Für eine Generalbeichte, die ich ihm zu Anfang meines entsetzlichen
hiesigen Daseins ohne weiteres abgelegt haben würde, war es bereits
zu spät. Nein, das konnte ich nicht mehr riskieren, ich steckte schon
zu tief drinnen; das heißt wenigstens so tief, daß es nicht geraten
schien, einem Bekannten so neuen Datums genauere Mitteilungen darüber
zu machen, wenn sich auch in meinen eigenen Augen die Sache noch nicht
so hoffnungslos ausnahm. Denn bei meiner ganzen Borgwirtschaft hielt
ich mich höchst sorgfältig innerhalb der Grenzen meiner Mittel -- das
heißt meines zukünftigen Gehaltes. Bestimmt _wissen_ konnte ich ja
natürlich nicht, wieviel derselbe betragen würde, aber eine genügende
Grundlage für dessen annähernde Schätzung war doch dadurch gegeben, daß
mir der alte Herr die freie Wahl unter sämtlichen Stellungen lassen
wollte, die er zu vergeben hätte, vorausgesetzt, daß ich dazu befähigt
wäre -- und das war doch sicher der Fall, darüber hegte ich keinen
Zweifel. Die Wette machte mir auch weiter keine Sorge; in _dem_ Punkte
hatte ich stets Glück gehabt. Nun, ich schätzte also meinen Gehalt
auf sechshundert bis tausend Pfund im Jahre; sagen wir sechshundert
fürs erste Jahr und dann so Jahr für Jahr mehr, bis ich es durch meine
Leistungen auf tausend gebracht hätte. Meine Schulden erreichten bis
jetzt nur die Höhe meines ersten Jahresgehalts. Von allen Seiten hatte
man mir Geld angeboten, allein ich hatte diese Darlehen meist unter
irgend einem Vorwand zurückgewiesen; so beliefen sich meine daher
stammenden Schulden auf nicht mehr als dreihundert Pfund, während
ich die andern dreihundert zur Bestreitung meines Unterhalts und zu
Einkäufen gebraucht hatte. Mit dem Gehalt des zweiten Jahres hoffte ich
nun bei der nötigen Vorsicht und Sparsamkeit vollends bis zum Ende des
Monats zu reichen, und daran wollte ich es gewiß nicht fehlen lassen.
War dann mein Monat erst herum und mein Gönner von der Reise zurück,
dann war ja alles wieder im schönsten Geleise; dann gedachte ich,
einfach Anweisungen auf die beiden ersten Jahresgehalte unter meine
Gläubiger zu verteilen und mich tüchtig an die Arbeit zu machen.

Es war eine sehr angenehme Tischgesellschaft von vierzehn Personen:
Herzog und Herzogin von S. mit Tochter, Earl und Counteß N., Viscount
C., Lord und Lady G., einige Menschenkinder beiderlei Geschlechts
ohne Rang und Titel, der Gesandte nebst Gemahlin und Tochter, sowie
eine zu Besuch bei der letzteren befindliche junge Engländerin von
zweiundzwanzig Jahren, Namens Portia Langham, in welche ich mich im
Lauf von zwei Minuten bereits verliebt hatte, ebenso wie sie sich in
mich -- was ich bemerken konnte, ohne eine Brille dazu nötig zu haben.
Dann war noch ein Gast da, ein Amerikaner. -- Doch, ich eile meiner
Erzählung etwas voraus. Während die Gesellschaft noch in sehnsüchtiger
Erwartung des Mahles im Salon beisammen saß und die Zuspätkommenden mit
kalter Verachtung musterte, meldete der Diener: »Mr. Lloyd Hastings.«

Dieser neue Gast faßte, sobald die Förmlichkeiten der Begrüßung vorüber
waren, mich ins Auge und kam mit ausgestreckter Hand auf mich zu; in
dem Augenblick aber, wo er die meinige fassen und schütteln wollte,
stockte er plötzlich und sagte mit verlegener Miene:

»Ich bitte sehr um Vergebung, ich glaubte Sie zu kennen.«

»Nun, du kennst mich auch, alter Junge.«

»Nein! Bist _du_ der -- das --«

»Das große Westentaschentier? Jawohl, gewiß. Du darfst mich getrost bei
meinem Spottnamen nennen, ich bin schon daran gewöhnt.«

»Na, na, na, diese Ueberraschung! Ein oder zweimal war mir dein
Name in Verbindung mit dieser Bezeichnung zu Gesicht gekommen,
aber es kam mir nie dabei in den Sinn, daß du der fragliche Henry
Adams sein könntest. Es ist doch noch kein halbes Jahr her, daß du
in San Francisco auf Hopkins' Kontor gebüffelt und um dir einen
Nebenverdienst zu verschaffen, ganze Nächte lang mit mir an der
Ordnung und Richtigstellung der Bücher und Geschäftsberichte der
Gould- und Curry-Extension-Gruben gearbeitet hast. Und jetzt soll ich
mir vorstellen, daß du hier in London als vielfacher Millionär und
kolossale Berühmtheit herumläufst! Es ist ja das reinste Märchen aus
Tausend und eine Nacht. Mensch, ich kann es gar nicht fassen, nicht
begreifen -- laß mich nur erst wieder etwas zu mir kommen.«

»Wahrhaftig, Lloyd, es geht mir kein Haar besser als dir. Es ist mir
selbst unfaßlich.«

»Bei Gott, wirklich ganz unerhört! Heute ist es gerade drei Monate her,
daß wir zusammen nach dem Miners-Restaurant gingen.« --

»Nein, nach dem What-Cheer.«

»Richtig, jawohl, nach dem What-Cheer. Da ließen wir uns um zwei Uhr
morgens ein Kotelett und eine Tasse Kaffee geben, nachdem wir sechs
Stunden zusammen über den Büchern der Extension geschwitzt hatten.
Damals wollte ich dich überreden, mit mir nach London zu kommen und
machte mich verbindlich, dir Urlaub auszuwirken und dich völlig frei zu
halten, versprach dir auch noch etwas extra für den Fall, daß es mir
gelänge, die Kuxe an den Mann zu bringen. Aber da wolltest du nichts
von der Sache wissen. Du meintest, dabei komme doch nichts heraus, und
du könntest doch nicht aufs Ungewisse deine ganze Stellung aufgeben, um
dann vielleicht nach Jahr und Tag wieder von vorne anfangen zu müssen.
Und nun bist du doch hier. Welch eine merkwürdige Geschichte ist das
doch! Was hat dich denn hierher verschlagen, und wodurch in aller Welt
hast du dich so kolossal heraufgebracht?«

»Ach, das kam ganz zufällig. Es ist eine lange Geschichte -- ein ganzer
Roman kann man sagen. Ich erzähle dir alles, aber nicht jetzt.«

»Wann denn?«

»Ende dieses Monats.«

»Das sind ja noch über vierzehn Tage. Das heißt doch der menschlichen
Neugierde zuviel zumuten. Sage lieber, in einer Woche.«

»Das geht nicht. Den Grund wirst du schon noch erfahren. Nun, wie steht
es denn mit den Geschäften?«

Mit einemmal war der heitere Ausdruck in seinen Mienen wie weggeblasen,
und mit einem Seufzer erwiderte er: »Du hattest ganz recht mit deiner
Prophezeiung, ganz recht. Wäre ich doch nicht hierher gekommen. Ich mag
gar nicht davon reden.«

»Doch, doch. Wenn wir hier fertig sind, mußt du mit mir nach Hause
kommen und mir alles erzählen.«

»Wie? Darf ich? Ist das dein Ernst?« Dabei wurden ihm die Augen feucht.

»Jawohl, ich will die ganze Geschichte hören, Wort für Wort.«

»Ach, wie beglückt bin ich, daß ich endlich wieder bei einem
menschlichen Wesen in Blick und Wort einem Interesse für meine
Angelegenheiten begegnen darf nach allem, was ich durchgemacht habe.
Lieber Gott! Auf den Knieen möchte ich dir dafür danken!«

Mit einem warmen Druck meiner Hand sprang er auf und sah in
fröhlichster Stimmung der Mahlzeit entgegen -- aus der jedoch
nichts wurde. Nein, es ging wie es stets geht bei der verkehrten,
widerwärtigen englischen Sitte -- man war nicht imstande, sich über die
Rangordnung zu einigen und so gab es keine Mahlzeit. Wenn ein Engländer
zum Diner eingeladen wird, so ißt er sich jedesmal zu Hause satt, ein
Fremder dagegen, der von keiner Seite gewarnt wird, geht ahnungslos in
die Falle. Diesmal freilich kam niemand zu Schaden, wir hatten alle
bereits zu Hause gespeist, dem einzigen Neuling unter uns, Hastings,
hatte der Gesandte gleich bei der Einladung gesagt, daß er getreu dem
Landesbrauche für ein Gastmahl keine Vorsorge habe treffen lassen.
Trotzdem setzte man sich nun, um den Schein zu wahren, ein jeder Herr
mit einer Dame am Arm, nach dem Speisesaal in Bewegung; allein dabei
ging der Streit bereits an. Der Herzog beanspruchte den Vortritt sowie
den Platz oben an der Tafel, indem er einem Gesandten, der nur ein
Volk, nicht einen Monarchen vertrete, an Rang vorgehe. Dem gegenüber
machte ich meine Rechte geltend, ohne einen Fußbreit nachzugeben. Die
Zeitungen wiesen mir im Personalbericht den Platz vor allen Herzögen
an, die nicht dem königlichen Hause angehörten, demnach sei es ganz
in der Ordnung, daß mir vor _diesem_ Herzog der Vorrang gebühre. Mit
allem Hin- und Herreden, worin wir unser Möglichstes leisteten, kam
die Sache natürlich nicht zum Austrag. Endlich war mein Gegner so
unbedachtsam, Geburt und Ahnen ins Feld zu führen; da übertrumpfte ich
ihn jedoch mit dem Hinweis darauf, daß ich, wie schon mein Name zeige,
in gerader Linie von Adam abstamme, während aus dem seinigen zusammen
mit seiner normännischen Abkunft klar hervorgehe, daß er nur in der
Seitenlinie mit dem Stammvater des Menschengeschlechts verwandt sei. So
bewegte sich denn der Zug nach dem Salon zurück, wo wir, gruppenweise
herumstehend, eine bescheidene Erfrischung -- bestehend in einem Teller
voll Sardinen und ein paar Erdbeeren -- einnahmen. Dabei wurde es mit
der Heiligkeit der Rangordnung etwas weniger streng genommen; die
beiden Höchststehenden loosten miteinander, indem sie ein Geldstück
in die Luft warfen. Der Gewinner machte sich darauf zuerst über seine
Erdbeeren her, während der Verlierende den Schilling einsteckte. So
ging es dann weiter, bei allen nach der Reihe. Nach der Erfrischung
brachte man Spieltische und wir spielten sämtlich Cribbage, um sechs
Pence die Partie. In England spielt man nämlich niemals zum bloßen
Vergnügen. Man will durchaus gewinnen oder verlieren -- ob das eine
oder das andere, ist gleichgiltig -- sonst verzichtet man lieber ganz.

Der Abend verfloß allerliebst, wenigstens uns beiden, Miß Langham
und mir. Ich war so bezaubert von dem holden Geschöpf, daß ich nicht
imstande war, meine Trümpfe zu zählen, wenn es über zwei Sequenzen
hinaus ging; und wenn ich einen Stich gemacht hatte, übersah ich es
jedesmal und fing wieder an auszuspielen, sodaß ich eine Partie um
die andere verloren haben würde, wäre es meiner Partnerin nicht genau
ebenso gegangen. So war es ganz natürlich, daß keins von uns beiden
aufkam, das fiel uns aber nicht im mindesten auf, wir wußten nur, daß
wir glücklich waren, und weiter wollten wir auch nichts wissen und
hatten nur den Wunsch, in diesem Gefühl nicht gestört zu sein.

Ich erklärte ihr sogar -- wirklich in allem Ernste -- ich _erklärte_
ihr, daß ich sie liebe, und sie -- nun sie wurde wohl rot bis unter die
Haare, hatte aber nichts dagegen -- und sagte dies auch. O, es war
der schönste Abend meines Lebens! Jedesmal, so oft ich ansagte, oder
meine Trümpfe zählte, fügte ich als Postskript bei: »Gott, wie reizend
Sie sind!« oder etwas Aehnliches, wofür sie mir dann bei der gleichen
Gelegenheit die Empfangsbestätigung erteilte, indem sie zum Schluß
anhängte: »Finden Sie das wirklich?« Und dabei ließ sie einen so süßen,
schelmischen Blick unter ihren langen Wimpern auf mich blitzen. O, es
war wirklich zu -- herrlich!



Ich benahm mich übrigens vollständig offen und ehrlich dem Mädchen
gegenüber. Ich sagte ihr, daß ich nichts auf der Welt besäße, als eben
die eine Millionennote, von der sie schon so viel gehört habe, und daß
selbst diese nicht mein Eigentum sei. Dies erregte ihre Neugier, und
darauf hin erzählte ich ihr halblaut die ganze Geschichte frisch von
der Leber weg. Sie wollte sich darüber fast totlachen. Was sie dabei
so lächerlich fand, war mir ein Rätsel, aber so war es nun einmal.
Jede halbe Minute erregte irgend ein Umstand ihre Lachlust aufs neue,
sodaß ich ihr wieder anderthalb Minuten Zeit zum Atemschöpfen lassen
mußte. Sie lachte sich buchstäblich lahm; noch nie war mir so etwas
vorgekommen. Daß eine traurige Geschichte -- eine Geschichte, die von
nichts anderem handelt als von den Leiden, Kümmernissen und Sorgen
eines Menschen -- eine solche Wirkung hervorbrachte, war doch unerhört.
Und doch hatte ich sie nur um so lieber dafür, daß sie so heiter zu
sein wußte, wo eigentlich gar kein Grund zur Heiterkeit vorlag; sah es
doch ganz darnach aus, als könnte ich eine derartige Frau demnächst
recht notwendig brauchen. Ich eröffnete ihr natürlich, daß wir wohl
ein paar Jahre würden warten müssen, bis ich in Genuß meines Gehaltes
käme; hieraus machte sie sich aber nichts und ermahnte mich nur zur
größten Sparsamkeit, damit nicht auch noch mein dritter Jahresgehalt
angegriffen werden müsse. Dann wurde sie auf einmal besorgt und
meinte, ob wir mit unseren Vermutungen über den Betrag meines ersten
Jahresgehalts nicht doch am Ende die Rechnung ohne den Wirt machten.

Diese nur zu wohl begründete Bemerkung brachte zwar mein Vertrauen in
die Zukunft einigermaßen ins Wanken, dafür gab sie mir aber auch einen
guten, praktischen Gedanken ein, den ich sofort frischweg aussprach:
»Portia, mein Schatz, würde es dir etwas ausmachen, mich zu den alten
Herren zu begleiten, wenn ich mich ihnen wieder vorstellen muß?«

Sie erschrak ein wenig, sagte aber: »N -- un, wenn meine Begleitung
dazu beitragen kann, dir Mut zu machen. Aber ist es denn auch ganz
passend, was meinst du?«

»Das wohl schwerlich, oder eigentlich nicht; aber sieh', es hängt so
unendlich viel davon ab, daß --«

»Dann gehe ich unter allen Umständen mit, ob passend oder nicht!«
erwiderte sie mit edler Begeisterung, die ihr herrlich stand. »O, der
Gedanke macht mich so glücklich, etwas für dich thun zu können.«

»Etwas, mein Herz? Alles thust du, ganz allein. Du bist so schön, so
lieblich, so bezaubernd, daß, wenn ich dich zur Seite habe, die guten
alten Herren uns ohne Widerrede jeden beliebigen Gehalt bewilligen
müssen, und sollten sie darüber zu Bettlern werden.«

Ha, nun mußte man sehen, wie ihr das Blut voll in die Wangen strömte
und ihre Augen in Glück erstrahlten!

»Du böser Schmeichler! Das ist ja alles nicht wahr, was du da sagst,
aber mit gehe ich doch. Vielleicht wird es dir bei der Gelegenheit
klar, daß andere Leute mich mit andern Augen betrachten als du.«

Hegte ich nun noch Zweifel? War mein Vertrauen noch erschüttert? Es
wird wohl genügen, wenn ich sage, daß ich bei mir selbst in aller
Stille meinen Gehalt unverzüglich auf zwölfhundert Pfund im Jahr
erhöhte. Ich sagte ihr aber davon nichts; das sparte ich mir zu einer
Ueberraschung für später auf.

Auf dem ganzen Wege nach meiner Wohnung schwebte ich in höheren
Regionen und hörte kein Wort von allem, was Hastings an mich hinsprach.
Erst, als wir zu Hause anlangten und Hastings sich beim Eintritt in
meinen Salon in begeisterten Lobsprüchen auf meine reiche und bequeme
Einrichtung erging, kam ich wieder zu mir.

»Erst lasse mich einen Augenblick hier stehen bleiben,« rief er, »damit
ich mich satt sehen kann! Guter Gott, das ist ja ein Palast, der
leibhaftige Palast! Und da fehlt nichts, bis zum behaglichen Kaminfeuer
und dem Abendbrot. Henry, hier kommt man nicht nur zum Bewußtsein,
wie reich du bist, nein, hier fühle ich auch im tiefsten Innern, wie
arm ich bin, wie arm und wie elend, wie geschlagen, gebrochen, und
vernichtet!«

Hol's der Henker! Seine Worte wirkten auf mich wie ein kaltes Sturzbad.
Mit einem Schlage war ich völlig ernüchtert und zu dem Bewußtsein
erwacht, daß ich auf einem Vulkan stehe, der jeden Augenblick
ausbrechen konnte. Ich hatte ja nicht gewußt, oder vielmehr, ich hatte
eine kurze Zeit selbst nicht eingestehen wollen, daß alles nur ein
Traum sei; aber jetzt, -- guter Himmel! Tief in Schulden, ohne einen
Heller Geld, eines holden Mädchens Lebensglück an mein Schicksal
gekettet und dabei nichts vor mir als die Aussicht auf einen Gehalt,
die sich vielleicht -- ach nein, gewiß -- nie verwirklichen sollte. O,
ich bin verloren, rettungslos verloren! --

»Henry, was bei deinem Einkommen jeden Tag nur so nebenbei abfällt,
würde, --«

»Ach, mein tägliches Einkommen! Da steht ein heißer Punsch, damit
vertreibe dir die trüben Gedanken. Profit! Oder nein, warte, du bist
hungrig; komm, setze dich und --«

»Nein, keinen Bissen; ich bringe nichts mehr hinunter; ich kann schon
ein paar Tage lang nichts mehr essen. Aber trinken will ich mit dir,
bis ich nicht mehr stehen kann. Komm!« --

»Da thue ich mit, so lang du willst! Also, frisch drauf los! Lasse
jetzt deine Geschichte vom Stapel, während ich den Punsch braue.«

»Meine Geschichte? Wie? Noch einmal?«

»Noch einmal? Wie meinst du das?«

»Nun, ich meine, ob du die Geschichte zum zweitenmal von vorne anhören
willst.«

»Ob ich sie zum zweitenmal von vorne anhören will! Na, das ist wirklich
ein toller Spaß. Halt, trinke nichts mehr, du kannst nichts mehr
brauchen.«

»Henry, du machst mir Angst. Habe ich dir denn nicht auf dem Weg
hierher die ganze Geschichte erzählt?«

»Du?«

»Ja, ich.«

»Ich lasse mich hängen, wenn ich ein Wort davon gehört habe.«

»Henry, das ist außerm Spaß. Du beunruhigst mich. Was hast du denn bei
dem Gesandten zu dir genommen?«

Jetzt ging mir plötzlich ein wunderbares Licht auf, ich faßte mir ein
Herz und gestand ihm frei und offen: »Das herzigste Mädel auf der Welt
habe ich dort -- erobert!«

In ungestümer Freude stürzte er auf mich los und wir schüttelten
uns die Hände, bis sie uns wehe thaten. Darüber, daß ich von seiner
Erzählung, die unsern anderthalb Stunden dauernden Heimweg ausfüllte,
nicht das geringste vernommen hatte, sagte er kein Wort. Er setzte sich
ruhig hin und erzählte mit der ihm eigenen Gutmütigkeit und Geduld die
ganze Geschichte noch einmal von vorne.

Sie lief auf folgendes hinaus: Er war im Auftrag der Besitzer der
Gould- und Curry-Extension-Gruben nach London gekommen, um die Anteile
zu veräußern, und es sollte dabei alles, was er über eine Million
Dollars lösen würde, ihm verbleiben. In der Hoffnung, dabei ein
vortreffliches Geschäft zu machen, hatte er sich keine Mühe verdrießen,
kein ehrliches Mittel unversucht gelassen und fast seinen letzten
eigenen Heller daran gesetzt, ohne daß es ihm jedoch gelungen wäre,
einen einzigen Kapitalisten zum Anbeißen zu bewegen, und mit Ende des
Monats lief seine Berechtigung ab. Mit einem Worte: er war zu Grunde
gerichtet. Am Schlusse sprang er auf und rief:

»Henry, du kannst mich retten! Du allein auf dem ganzen Erdenrund!
Wirst du mich retten? Oder wirst du mich _nicht_ retten?«

»Sage mir nur, wie ich das machen soll? Erkläre dich, mein Junge.«

»Nimm mir mein Verkaufsrecht ab und zahle mir dafür eine Million und
die Heimreise. Bitte, bitte, sage nicht nein!«

Es war wirklich nicht mehr auszuhalten. Eben stand ich auf dem Punkte,
mit dem Bekenntnis herauszuplatzen: »Lloyd, ich bin ja selbst ein
Bettler -- ohne einen Pfennig Geld und stecke dazu noch in Schulden.«
Aber da leuchtete plötzlich ein herrlicher Gedanke blitzähnlich in
meinem Kopfe auf. Ich biß die Zähne zusammen und bezwang mich, bis ich
so kalt war, wie ein Großkapitalist. Dann sagte ich mit vollkommen
geschäftsmäßiger Ruhe: »Ich will dich retten, Lloyd.«

»Dann bin ich schon gerettet; Gott segne dich ewig dafür! Wenn ich
je --«

»Laß mich ausreden, Lloyd. Ich will dich retten, aber nicht so, wie du
meinst. Denn nach all den Mühen und Opfern, die du es dich hast kosten
lassen, wäre das nicht anständig an dir gehandelt. Ich brauche keine
Minenanteile; an einem Weltplatz wie London kann ich auch mein Geld
ohne dies arbeiten lassen, es ist ja bis jetzt auch gegangen. Nein,
wir machen die Sachen folgendermaßen: Ich kenne ja natürlich dieses
Bergwerk ganz genau; ich weiß, welch ungeheurer Wert darin steckt und
kann es auf Verlangen jedem eidlich bekräftigen. Du sollst im Lauf der
nächsten vierzehn Tage für bare drei Millionen Anteilscheine verkaufen,
indem du von meinem Namen unbeschränkten Gebrauch machst, und dann
teilen wir den Gewinn -- halb und halb.«

Lloyd geriet darüber so außer sich vor Freude, daß er wie toll
herumtanzte und mir meine ganze Einrichtung kurz und klein geschlagen
haben würde, hätte ich ihm nicht schließlich ein Bein gestellt und ihn
an Händen und Füßen gebunden. Als er so dalag, rief er ganz beseligt
aus: »Ich darf deinen Namen gebrauchen! deinen Namen! -- Stelle dir nur
vor, Mensch! In Scharen kommen sie gelaufen, diese reichen Londoner und
prügeln sich um die Anteile! Ich bin ein gemachter Mann, geborgen für
alle Zeit, in meinem ganzen Leben vergesse ich dir das nicht!«

Keine vierundzwanzig Stunden dauerte es, so war die Sache bereits in
ganz London herumgekommen. Ich hatte Tag für Tag nichts zu thun, als zu
Hause zu sitzen und all den Leuten, die bei mir erschienen, zu sagen:
»Jawohl, ich habe ihm gestattet sich auf mich zu beziehen. Ich kenne
ihn und kenne das Bergwerk. Er selbst verdient volles Vertrauen und die
Anteile sind weit mehr wert, als er dafür verlangt!«

Inzwischen verbrachte ich alle meine Abende bei dem Gesandten mit
Portia. Von dem Bergwerk sagte ich ihr keine Silbe, das sparte ich mir
zu einer späteren Ueberraschung auf. Wir sprachen immer nur von unserer
Liebe und vom Gehalt, bald von dem einen, bald von dem andern, manchmal
auch von beidem untereinander. Und dann, guter Gott, das Interesse,
das Frau und Tochter des Gesandten an unserer Angelegenheit nahmen und
die endlosen Listen und Schlauheiten, die sie ersannen, um uns vor
Störungen zu schützen und den Gesandten nicht hinter die Sache kommen
zu lassen -- ach, es war wirklich allerliebst von den beiden!

Als der Monat um war, besaß ich ein Guthaben von einer Million
Dollars bei der London- und County-Bank, und Hastings stand ebenso.
In ausgesuchtester Toilette fuhr ich an Portland-Place vorbei. Als
ich mich an dem Aussehen der Wohnung überzeugt hatte, daß meine Vögel
wieder zu Neste geflogen sein mußten, holte ich meinen Schatz bei dem
Gesandten ab und fuhr mit ihr zusammen wieder nach Portland Place.
Während der ganzen Fahrt bildete der Gehalt den Gegenstand unserer
eifrigsten Erörterungen. Die Besorgnis, in die sie sich dabei hinein
redete, ließ sie so reizend erscheinen, daß es kaum mehr auszuhalten
war.

»Mein Herzchen,« sagte ich zu ihr, »so wie du jetzt aussiehst, wäre es
ein Verbrechen, einen Pfennig weniger als dreitausend Pfund im Jahre zu
verlangen.«

»Henry, Henry, du richtest uns noch zu Grunde,« erwiderte sie.

»Sei unbesorgt! Sieh nur so aus und verlasse dich auf mich. Ich will
die Sache schon machen.«

Es war soweit gekommen, daß ich auf dem ganzen Wege ihr Mut zusprechen
mußte. Sie selbst redete noch fortwährend auf mich ein:

»Bedenke doch, daß, wenn wir zu viel verlangen, wir vielleicht gar
keinen Gehalt bekommen; und was soll dann aus uns werden, wenn wir
nicht wissen, womit wir unsern Unterhalt verdienen wollen?«

Es war wieder derselbe Diener, der uns einließ, und da waren sie
auch wieder, die beiden alten Herren. Natürlich waren sie höchlich
überrascht über das holde Geschöpf an meiner Seite. Ich erklärte jedoch:

»Sie dürfen keinen Anstoß daran nehmen, meine Herren, es ist meine
zukünftige Lebensgefährtin.« Darauf stellte ich ihr die Herren mit
ihren Namen vor. Diese zeigten sich hierüber gar nicht erstaunt;
sie dachten vermutlich, daß ich so gescheit gewesen sein würde, im
Adreßbuch nachzuschlagen. Sie forderten uns auf, Platz zu nehmen und
behandelten mich mit größter Höflichkeit, gaben sich auch alle Mühe,
meiner Begleiterin durch freundlichen Zuspruch über ihre Verlegenheit
hinweg zu helfen. Endlich sagte ich:

»Meine Herren, ich komme, Ihnen Bericht zu erstatten.«

»Das ist uns sehr angenehm,« erwiderte mein Gönner, »dann können wir ja
die Wette zwischen mir und meinem Bruder Abel jetzt zur Entscheidung
bringen. Falls Sie für mich gewonnen haben, dürfen Sie sich jede
beliebige Stellung wählen, die ich zu vergeben habe. Sind Sie noch im
Besitz der Millionennote?«

»Hier ist sie.« Damit behändigte ich ihm dieselbe.

»Gewonnen!« rief er und gab seinem Bruder einen Klapps auf den Rücken.
»Nun, was sagst du jetzt, Bruder?«

»Ich sage, _er_ hat es überlebt und _ich_ habe zwanzigtausend Pfund
verloren. Ich hätte es niemals geglaubt!«

»Ich habe noch mehr zu berichten,« fuhr ich fort, »und zwar ziemlich
viel. Ich bitte, mir demnächst eine Stunde bestimmen zu wollen,
um Ihnen meine Erlebnisse während dieses ganzen Monats genauer zu
schildern. Sie können sich darauf verlassen, es lohnt sich den Bericht
anzuhören. Inzwischen wollen Sie gefälligst dies hier in Augenschein
nehmen.«

»Was, Mensch, einen Depositenschein über 200000 Pfund? Gehört das
Ihnen?«

»Gehört mir. Das ist die Frucht des weisen Gebrauchs, den ich von dem
kleinen Darlehen gemacht habe, das Sie mir gütigst gewährten. Und
dieser Gebrauch bestand lediglich darin, daß ich von Zeit zu Zeit einen
kleinen Einkauf machte und beim Bezahlen allemal die Banknote zum
Wechseln hingab.«

»Mensch, das ist ja äußerst merkwürdig, ganz unglaublich!«

»Und doch verhält es sich so; ich werde Ihnen den Beweis liefern. Sie
brauchen mir durchaus nicht auf mein bloßes Wort zu glauben.«

Jetzt war die Reihe des Erstaunens an Portia. Mit weit geöffneten Augen
fragte sie:

»Henry, gehört dieses Geld wirklich dir? Hast du mir die Unwahrheit
gesagt?«

»Das habe ich allerdings, mein Liebchen. Aber ich weiß, du bist mir
deswegen nicht böse.«

»O, doch!« schmollte sie. »Es war abscheulich von dir, mich so hinters
Licht zu führen.«

»Ach, gewiß. Es war ja nur ein schlechter Scherz, weißt du. Komm, wir
wollen uns jetzt verabschieden.«

»Aber, so warten Sie doch. Wegen des Postens. Sie wissen ja. Ich muß
Ihnen doch den Posten geben,« warf mein Gönner ein.

»Ach,« erwiderte ich, »ich danke Ihnen tausendmal, aber ich brauche
wirklich keinen.«

»Aber ich hätte Ihnen den allerbesten gegeben, den ich zu vergeben
habe.«

»Ich danke Ihnen nochmals von ganzem Herzen, aber auch _diesen_ brauche
ich nicht.«

»Schäme dich, Henry! Du bist dem guten Herrn nicht halb so dankbar als
er es verdiente. Darf ich ihm an deiner Statt den Dank abstatten?«

»Freilich, mein Liebchen. Ich bin nur neugierig, wie du das machen
willst.«

Sie ging zu meinem Gönner hin, setzte sich ihm auf den Schoß, schlang
ihren Arm um seinen Hals und gab ihm einen Kuß mitten auf den Mund.
Dabei wußten sich die beiden alten Herren vor Lachen kaum zu fassen,
während ich selbst vor Erstaunen wie versteinert dastand, bis Portia
sagte:

»Papa, er hat gesagt, von all den Posten, die du zu vergeben hast,
wolle er keinen einzigen annehmen, und das thut mir so weh, gerade als
ob --«

»Wie, lieber Schatz, dies ist dein _Papa_?«

»Jawohl, mein Stiefpapa, und zwar der allerbeste, den es auf der ganzen
Welt giebt. Nicht wahr, nun begreifst du, warum ich bei dem Gesandten
so lachen mußte, als du, ohne mein Verhältnis zu Papa und Onkel Abel zu
kennen, mir die Sorgen und Nöte schildertest, in die ihr Einfall dich
versetzt hatte.«

Natürlich sprach ich jetzt ohne Scheu und Umschweife ganz wie mir ums
Herz war.

»Mein verehrter Herr,« sagte ich, »ich muß meine Erklärung
zurücknehmen. _Eine_ Stellung haben Sie doch zu vergeben, die ich sehr
gern haben möchte.«

»Welche ist das?«

»Die Stelle eines Schwiegersohnes.«



»So? Aber wenn Sie als solcher noch nie bedienstet waren, so sind Sie
auch nicht imstande, das Zeugnis darüber beizubringen, das in unserem
Abkommen zur Bedingung gemacht ist und so --«

»Machen Sie den Versuch mit mir, ich bitte Sie inständigst! Nur so
dreißig bis vierzig Jahre lang probieren Sie es mit mir, und wenn
dann --«

»Nun ja, gut denn; das ist ja gar nicht viel verlangt. So nehmen Sie
Portia.«

Ob wir beide glücklich waren? Keine Sprache besitzt Worte genug, um es
auszudrücken. Und _das_ Geschwätz und _das_ Vergnügen in ganz London,
als nach ein paar Tagen alle meine Erlebnisse mit der Banknote bekannt
wurden, nebst der Wendung, welche die Sache zuletzt genommen! Du guter
Gott! --

Portias Papa gab die gastliche Note der Bank zurück und ließ sich
ihren Betrag auszahlen. Die Bank setzte sie sodann außer Kurs und
verehrte sie ihm, worauf er uns damit ein Hochzeitsgeschenk machte.
Seither hängt sie unter Glas und Rahmen im Allerheiligsten unseres
Heims. Denn _ihr_ verdanke ich den Besitz meiner Portia. Wäre diese
Note nicht gewesen, so hätte ich nicht in London bleiben können, ich
hätte mich dem Gesandten nicht vorgestellt und wäre niemals mit Portia
zusammengetroffen. Deshalb sage ich immer: »Sie lautete zwar klar und
deutlich auf eine Million Pfund; und doch war es während der ganzen
Zeit ihrer Giltigkeit nur einmal möglich, einen einzigen Gegenstand
dafür zu kaufen, und auch dieser wurde mindestens zehnfach unter seinem
Werte bezahlt!«

_Einige Urteile_:

_Richard Weitbrecht_: »=Es ist ein wahrer Genuß=, nach so vielen
lahmen Mittelmäßigkeiten einem temperamentvollen, =auf jeder Seite
fesselnden, lebendigen Erzähler zu lauschen= ... Doch es bedarf nicht
des Vergleichs mit geringerem, noch ist not, über Bret Harte's längst
anerkannte Erzählungskunst mit ihrer glücklichen Verbindung von
=Psychologischem=, =Abenteuerlichem= und =Romantischem= viel zu sagen.
Mich hat's bei seinen »Drei Teilhabern« ganz merkwürdig überkommen --
ich las fast mit denselben Gefühlen, mit denen ich einst in meiner
Jugend Marryats und Gerstäckers amerikanische Geschichten verschlungen
habe, und wie damals vergaß ich dabei alle Kritik. Darum soll auch
jetzt keine geschrieben werden, und ich wünsche nur, daß andere sich an
Bret Harte ebenso =auf ein paar Stunden jung lesen wie ich=.«

_Straßburger Post_: »Sein Humor ist der Schmerz lösende und Groll
verscheuchende, der uns stets erwärmt. Seine Gestalten haben Fleisch
und Blut wie die des Jeremias Gotthelf und -- nirgends moralisiert
er, was eben den echten Künstler zeigt. Bret Harte schildert für alle
Menschen und nicht nur für Amerika; =im literarischen Weltkonzerte
gehört er zu denen, die neue Gebiete erobert haben=.«

_Deutsche Tageszeitung_: »Der kalifornische Dichter gehört zu den
Erscheinungen der modernen amerikanischen Literatur, die verdienen,
auch in Deutschland nicht vergessen zu werden. Niemand wird die
Erzählungen ohne innere Befriedigung aus der Hand legen.«

                            AN APPRECIATION

                                -------

(This “Biographical Criticism” was prepared by Prof. Brander Matthews,
as an introduction to the Uniform Edition of Mark Twain’s Works,
published in 1899).


It is a common delusion of those who discuss contemporary literature
that there is such an entity as the “reading public,” possessed of a
certain uniformity of taste. There is not one public; there are many
publics--as many, in fact, as there are different kinds of taste; and
the extent of an author’s popularity is in proportion to the number of
these separate publics he may chance to please. Scott, for example,
appealed not only to those who relished romance and enjoyed excitement,
but also to those who appreciated his honest portrayal of sturdy
characters. Thackeray is preferred by ambitious youth who are
insidiously flattered by his tacit compliments to their knowledge of the
world, by the disenchanted who cannot help seeing the petty meannesses
of society, and by the less sophisticated in whom sentiment has not gone
to seed in sentimentality. Dickens in his own day bid for the approval
of those who liked broad caricature (and were therefore pleased with
Stiggins and Chadband), of those who fed greedily on plentiful pathos
(and were therefore delighted with the deathbeds of Smike and Paul
Dombey and Little Nell) and also of those who asked for unexpected
adventure (and were therefore glad to disentangle the melodramatic
intrigues of Ralph Nickleby).

In like manner the American author who has chosen to call himself Mark
Twain has attained to an immense popularity because the qualities he
possesses in a high degree appeal to so many and so widely varied
publics--first of all, no doubt, to the public that revels in hearty and
robust fun, but also to the public which is glad to be swept along by
the full current of adventure, which is sincerely touched by manly
pathos, which is satisfied by vigorous and exact portrayal of character,
and which respects shrewdness and wisdom and sanity and a healthy hatred
of pretense and affectation and sham. Perhaps no one book of Mark
Twain’s--with the possible exception of _Huckleberry Finn_--is equally a
favorite with all his readers; and perhaps some of his best
characteristics are absent from his earlier books or but doubtfully
latent in them. Mark Twain is many sided; and he has ripened in
knowledge and in power since he first attracted attention as a wild
Western funny man. As he has grown older he has reflected more; he has
both broadened and deepened. The writer of “comic copy” for a
mining-camp newspaper has developed into a liberal humorist, handling
life seriously and making his readers think as he makes them laugh,
until to-day Mark Twain has perhaps the largest audience of any author
now using the English language. To trace the stages of this evolution
and to count the steps whereby the sagebrush reporter has risen to the
rank of a writer of world-wide celebrity, is as interesting as it is
instructive.

                                   I

Samuel Langhorne Clemens was born November 30, 1835, at Florida,
Missouri. His father was a merchant who had come from Tennessee and who
removed soon after his son’s birth to Hannibal, a little town on the
Mississippi. What Hannibal was like and what were the circumstances of
Mr. Clemen’s boyhood we can see for ourselves in the convincing pages of
_Tom Sawyer_. Mr. Howells has called Hannibal “a loafing, out-at-elbows,
down-at-the-heels, slave-holding Mississippi town”; and Mr. Clemens, who
silently abhorred slavery, was of a slave-owning family.

When the future author was but twelve his father died, and the son had
to get his education as best he could. Of actual schooling he got little
and of book learning still less, but life itself is not a bad teacher
for a boy who wants to study, and young Clemens did not waste his
chances. He spent six years in the printing office of the little local
paper,--for, like not a few others on the list of American authors that
stretches from Benjamin Franklin to William Dean Howells, he began his
connection with literature by setting type. As a journeyman printer the
lad wandered from town to town and rambled even as far east as New York.

When he was nineteen he went back to the home of his boyhood and
presently resolved to become a pilot on the Mississippi. How he learned
the river he has told us in _Life on the Mississippi_, wherein his
adventures, his experiences, and his impressions while he was a cub
pilot are recorded with a combination of precise veracity and abundant
humor which makes the earlier chapters of that marvelous book a most
masterly fragment of autobiography. The life of a pilot was full of
interest and excitement and opportunity, and what young Clemens saw and
heard and divined during the years when he was going up and down the
mighty river we may read in the pages of _Huckleberry Finn_ and
_Pudd’nhead Wilson_. But toward the end of the ’fifties the railroads
began to rob the river of its supremacy as a carrier; and in the
beginning of the ’sixties the Civil War broke out and the Mississippi no
longer went unvexed to the sea. The skill, slowly and laboriously
acquired, was suddenly rendered useless, and at twenty-five the young
man found himself bereft of his calling. As a border state, Missouri was
sending her sons into the armies of the Union and into the armies of the
Confederacy, while many a man stood doubting, not knowing which way to
turn. The ex-pilot has given us the record of his very brief and
inglorious service as a soldier of the South. When this escapade was
swiftly ended, he went to the Northwest with his brother, who had been
appointed Territorial Secretary of Nevada. Thus the man who had been
born on the borderland of North and South, who had gone East as a
jour-printer, who had been again and again up and down the Mississippi,
now went West while he was still plastic and impressionable; and he had
thus another chance to increase that intimate knowledge of American life
and American character which is one of the most precious of his
possessions.

While still on the river he had written a satiric letter or two which
found their way into print. In Nevada he went to the mines and lived the
life he has described in _Roughing It_, but when he failed to “strike it
rich,” he naturally drifted into journalism and back into a newspaper
office again. The _Virginia City Enterprise_ was not overmanned, and the
newcomer did all sorts of odd jobs, finding time now and then to write a
sketch which seemed important enough to permit of his signature. He now
began to sign himself Mark Twain, taking the name from a call of the man
who heaves the lead on a Mississippi River steamboat, and who cries, “By
the mark, three,” “Mark Twain,” and so on. The name of Mark Twain soon
began to be known to those who were curious in newspaper humor. After a
while he was drawn across the mountains to San Francisco, where he found
casual employment on the _Morning Call_, and where he joined himself to
a little group of aspiring _literators_ which included Mr. Bret Harte,
Mr. Noah Brooks, Mr. Charles Henry Webb, and Mr. Charles Warren
Stoddard.

It was in 1867 that Mr. Webb published Mark Twain’s first book, _The
Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras_; and it was in 1867 that the
proprietors of the _Alta California_ supplied him with the funds
necessary to enable him to become one of the passengers on the steamer
_Quaker City_, which had been chartered to take a select party on what
is now known as the Mediterranean trip. The weekly letters, in which he
set forth what befell him on this journey, were printed in the _Alta_
Sunday after Sunday, and were copied freely by the other Californian
papers. These letters served as the foundation of a book published in
1869 and called _The Innocents Abroad_, a book which instantly brought
to the author celebrity and cash.

Both of these valuable aids to ambition were increased by his next step,
his appearance on the lecture platform. Mr. Noah Brooks, who was present
at his first attempt, has recorded that Mark Twain’s “method as a
lecturer was distinctly unique and novel. His slow, deliberate drawl,
the anxious and perturbed expression of his visage, the apparently
painful effort with which he framed his sentences, the surprise that
spread over his face when the audience roared with delight or
rapturously applauded the finer passages of his word painting, were
unlike anything of the kind they had ever known.” In the thirty years
since that first appearance the method has not changed, although it has
probably matured. Mark Twain is one of the most effective of platform
speakers and one of the most artistic, with an art of his own which is
very individual and very elaborate in spite of its seeming simplicity.

Although he succeeded abundantly as a lecturer, and although he was the
author of the most widely circulated book of the decade, Mark Twain
still thought of himself only as a journalist; and when he gave up the
West for the East he became an editor of the Buffalo _Express_, in which
he had bought an interest. In 1870 he married; and it is perhaps not
indiscreet to remark that his was another of those happy unions of which
there have been so many in the annals of American authorship. In 1871 he
removed to Hartford, where his home has been ever since; and at the same
time he gave up newspaper work.

In 1872 he wrote _Roughing It_, and in the following year came his first
sustained attempt at fiction, _The Gilded Age_, written in collaboration
with Mr. Charles Dudley Warner. The character of “Colonel Mulberry
Sellers” Mark Twain soon took out of this book to make it the central
figure of a play which the late John T. Raymond acted hundreds of times
throughout the United States, the playgoing public pardoning the
inexpertness of the dramatist in favor of the delicious humor and the
compelling veracity with which the chief character was presented. So
universal was this type and so broadly recognizable its traits that
there were few towns wherein the play was presented in which some one
did not accost the actor who impersonated the ever-hopeful schemer to
declare: “I’m the original of Sellers! Didn’t Mark ever tell you? Well,
he took the Colonel from me!”

Encouraged by the welcome accorded to this first attempt at fiction,
Mark Twain turned to the days of his boyhood and wrote _Tom Sawyer_,
published in 1875. He also collected his sketches, scattered here and
there in newspapers and magazines. Toward the end of the ’seventies he
went to Europe again with his family; and the result of this journey is
recorded in _A Tramp Abroad_, published in 1880. Another volume of
sketches, _The Stolen White Elephant_, was put forth in 1882; and in the
same year Mark Twain first came forward as a historical novelist--if
_The Prince and the Pauper_ can fairly be called a historical novel. The
year after, he sent forth the volume describing his _Life on the
Mississippi_; and in 1884 he followed this with the story in which that
life has been crystallized forever, _Huckleberry Finn_, the finest of
his books, the deepest in its insight, and the widest in its appeal.

This Odyssey of the Mississippi was published by a new firm, in which
the author was a chief partner, just as Sir Walter Scott had been an
associate of Ballantyne and Constable. There was at first a period of
prosperity in which the house issued the _Personal Memoirs_ of Grant,
giving his widow checks for $350,000 in 1886, and in which Mark Twain
himself published _A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur’s Court_, a
volume of _Merry Tales_, and a story called _The American Claimant_,
wherein “Colonel Sellers” reappears. Then there came a succession of
hard years; and at last the publishing house in which Mark Twain was a
partner failed, as the publishing house in which Walter Scott was a
partner had formerly failed. The author of _Huckleberry Finn_ at sixty
found himself suddenly saddled with a load of debt, just as the author
of _Waverley_ had been burdened full threescore years earlier; and Mark
Twain stood up stoutly under it, as Scott had done before him. More
fortunate than the Scotchman, the American has lived to pay the debt in
full.

Since the disheartening crash came, he has given to the public a third
Mississippi River tale, _Pudd’nhead Wilson_, issued in 1894; and a third
historical novel _Joan of Arc_, a reverent and sympathetic study of the
bravest figure in all French history, printed anonymously in _Harper’s
Magazine_ and then in a volume acknowledged by the author in 1896. As
one of the results of a lecturing tour around the world he prepared
another volume of travels, _Following the Equator_, published toward the
end of 1897. Mention must also be made of a fantastic tale called _Tom
Sawyer Abroad_, sent forth in 1894, of a volume of sketches, _The
Million Pound Bank-Note_, assembled in 1893, and also of a collection of
literary essays, _How to Tell a Story_, published in 1897.

This is but the barest outline of Mark Twain’s life--such a brief
summary as we must have before us if we wish to consider the conditions
under which the author has developed and the stages of his growth. It
will serve, however, to show how various have been his forms of
activity--printer, pilot, miner, journalist, traveler, lecturer,
novelist, publisher--and to suggest the width of his experience of life.

                                   II

A humorist is often without honor in his own country. Perhaps this is
partly because humor is likely to be familiar, and familiarity breeds
contempt. Perhaps it is partly because (for some strange reason) we tend
to despise those who make us laugh, while we respect those who make us
weep--forgetting that there are formulas for forcing tears quite as
facile as the formulas for forcing smiles. Whatever the reason, the fact
is indisputable that the humorist must pay the penalty of his humor; he
must run the risk of being tolerated as a mere fun maker, not to be
taken seriously, and unworthy of critical consideration. This penalty
has been paid by Mark Twain. In many of the discussions of American
literature he is dismissed as though he were only a competitor of his
predecessors, Artemus Ward and John Phœnix, instead of being, what he is
really, a writer who is to be classed--at whatever interval only time
may decide--rather with Cervantes and Molière.

Like the heroines of the problem plays of the modern theater, Mark Twain
has had to live down his past. His earlier writing gave but little
promise of the enduring qualities obvious enough in his later works. Mr.
Noah Brooks has told us how he was advised, if he wished to “see genuine
specimens of American humor, frolicsome, extravagant, and audacious,” to
look up the sketches which the then almost unknown Mark Twain was
printing in a Nevada newspaper. The humor of Mark Twain is still
American, still frolicsome, extravagant, and audacious; but it is riper
now and richer, and it has taken unto itself other qualities existing
only in germ in these firstlings of his muse. The sketches in _The
Jumping Frog_ and the letters which made up _The Innocents Abroad_ are
“comic copy,” as the phrase is in newspaper offices--comic copy not
altogether unlike what John Phœnix had written and Artemus Ward, better
indeed than the work of these newspaper humorists (for Mark Twain had it
in him to develop as they did not), but not essentially dissimilar.

And in the eyes of many who do not think for themselves, Mark Twain is
only the author of these genuine specimens of American humor. For when
the public has once made up its mind about any man’s work, it does not
relish any attempt to force it to unmake this opinion and to remake it.
Like other juries, it does not like to be ordered to reconsider its
verdict as contrary to the facts of the case. It is always sluggish in
beginning the necessary readjustment, and not only sluggish, but
somewhat grudging. Naturally it cannot help seeing the later works of a
popular writer from the point of view it had to take to enjoy his
earlier writings. And thus the author of _Huckleberry Finn_ and _Joan of
Arc_ is forced to pay a high price for the early and abundant popularity
of _The Innocents Abroad_.

No doubt, a few of his earlier sketches were inexpensive in their
elements; made of materials worn threadbare by generations of earlier
funny men, they were sometimes cut in the pattern of his predecessors.
No doubt, some of the earliest of all were crude and highly colored, and
may even be called forced, not to say violent. No doubt, also, they did
not suggest the seriousness and the melancholy which always must
underlie the deepest humor, as we find it in Cervantes and Molière, in
Swift and in Lowell. But even a careless reader, skipping through the
book in idle amusement, ought to have been able to see in _The Innocents
Abroad_ that the writer of that liveliest of books of travel was no mere
merry-andrew, grinning through a horse collar to make sport for the
groundlings; but a sincere observer of life, seeing through his own eyes
and setting down what he saw with abundant humor, of course, but also
with profound respect for the eternal verities.

George Eliot in one of her essays calls those who parody lofty themes
“debasers of the moral currency.” Mark Twain is always an advocate of
the sterling ethical standard. He is ready to overwhelm an affectation
with irresistible laughter, but he never lacks reverence for the things
that really deserve reverence. It is not at the Old Masters that he
scoffs in Italy, but rather at those who pay lip service to things which
they neither enjoy nor understand. For a ruin or a painting or a legend
that does not seem to him to deserve the appreciation in which it is
held he refuses to affect an admiration he does not feel; he cannot help
being honest--he was born so. For meanness of all kinds he has a burning
contempt; and on Abelard he pours out the vials of his wrath. He has a
quick eye for all humbugs and a scorching scorn for them; but there is
no attempt at being funny in the manner of the cockney comedians when he
stands in the awful presence of the Sphinx. He is not taken in by the
glamour of Palestine; he does not lose his head there; he keeps his
feet: but he knows that he is standing on holy ground; and there is
never a hint of irreverence in his attitude.

_A Tramp Abroad_ is a better book than _The Innocents Abroad_; it is
quite as laughter-provoking, and its manner is far more restrained. Mark
Twain was then master of his method, sure of himself, secure of his
popularity; and he could do his best and spare no pains to be certain
that it was his best. Perhaps there is a slight falling off in
_Following the Equator_; a trace of fatigue, of weariness, of
disenchantment. But the last book of travels has passages as broadly
humorous as any of the first; and it proves the author’s possession of a
pithy shrewdness not to be suspected from a perusal of its earliest
predecessor. The first book was the work of a young fellow rejoicing in
his own fun and resolved to make his readers laugh with him or at him;
the latest book is the work of an older man, who has found that life is
not all laughter, but whose eye is as clear as ever and whose tongue is
as plain-spoken.

These three books of travel are like all other books of travel in that
they relate in the first person what the author went forth to see.
Autobiographic also are _Roughing It_ and _Life on the Mississippi_, and
they have always seemed to me better books than the more widely
circulated travels. They are better because they are the result of a
more intimate knowledge of the material dealt with. Every traveler is of
necessity but a bird of passage; he is a mere carpetbagger; his
acquaintance with the countries he visits is external only; and this
acquaintanceship is made only when he is a full-grown man. But Mark
Twain’s knowledge of the Mississippi was acquired in his youth; it was
not purchased with a price; it was his birthright; and it was internal
and complete. And his knowledge of the mining camp was achieved in early
manhood when the mind is open and sensitive to every new impression.
There is in both these books a fidelity to the inner truth, a certainty
of touch, a sweep of vision, not to be found in the three books of
travels. For my own part I have long thought that Mark Twain could
securely rest his right to survive as an author on those opening
chapters in _Life on the Mississippi_ in which he makes clear the
difficulties, the seeming impossibilities, that fronted those who wished
to learn the river. These chapters are bold and brilliant, and they
picture for us forever a period and a set of conditions, singularly
interesting and splendidly varied, that otherwise would have had to
forego all adequate record.

                                  III

It is highly probable that when an author reveals the power of evoking
views of places and of calling up portraits of people such as Mark Twain
showed in _Life on the Mississippi_, and when he has the masculine grasp
of reality Mark Twain made evident in _Roughing It_, he must needs
sooner or later turn from mere fact to avowed fiction and become a
story-teller. The long stories which Mark Twain has written fall into
two divisions--first, those of which the scene is laid in the present,
in reality, and mostly in the Mississippi Valley, and second, those of
which the scene is laid in the past, in fantasy mostly, and in Europe.

As my own liking is a little less for the latter group, there is no need
for me now to linger over them. In writing these tales of the past Mark
Twain was making up stories in his head; personally I prefer the tales
of his in which he has his foot firm on reality. _The Prince and the
Pauper_ has the essence of boyhood in it; it has variety and vigor; it
has abundant humor and plentiful pathos; and yet I for one would give
the whole of it for the single chapter in which Tom Sawyer lets the
contract for whitewashing his aunt’s fence.

Mr. Howells has declared that there are two kinds of fiction he likes
almost equally well--“a real novel and a pure romance”; and he joyfully
accepts _A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur’s Court_ as “one of the
greatest romances ever imagined.” It is a humorous romance overflowing
with stalwart fun; and it is not irreverent, but iconoclastic, in that
it breaks not a few disestablished idols. It is intensely American and
intensely nineteenth century and intensely democratic--in the best sense
of that abused adjective. The British critics were greatly displeased
with the book;--and we are reminded of the fact that the Spanish still
somewhat resent _Don Quixote_ because it brings out too truthfully the
fatal gap in the Spanish character between the ideal and the real. So
much of the feudal still survives in British society that Mark Twain’s
merry and elucidating assault on the past seemed to some almost an
insult to the present.

But no critic, British or American, has ventured to discover any
irreverence in _Joan of Arc_, wherein, indeed, the tone is almost devout
and the humor almost too much subdued. Perhaps it is my own distrust of
the so-called historical novel, my own disbelief that it can ever be
anything but an inferior form of art, which makes me care less for this
worthy effort to honor a noble figure. And elevated and dignified as is
the _Joan of Arc_, I do not think that it shows us Mark Twain at his
best; although it has many a passage that only he could have written, it
is perhaps the least characteristic of his works. Yet it may well be
that the certain measure of success he has achieved in handling a
subject so lofty and so serious, will help to open the eyes of the
public to see the solid merits of his other stories, in which his humor
has fuller play and in which his natural gifts are more abundantly
displayed.

Of these other stories three are “real novels,” to use Mr. Howells’s
phrase; they are novels as real as any in any literature. _Tom Sawyer_
and _Huckleberry Finn_ and _Pudd’nhead Wilson_ are invaluable
contributions to American literature--for American literature is nothing
if it is not a true picture of American life and if it does not help us
to understand ourselves. _Huckleberry Finn_ is a very amusing volume,
and a generation has read its pages and laughed over it immoderately;
but it is very much more than a funny book; it is a marvelously accurate
portrayal of a whole civilization. Mr. Ormsby, in an essay which
accompanies his translation of _Don Quixote_, has pointed out that for a
full century after its publication that greatest of novels was enjoyed
chiefly as a tale of humorous misadventure, and that three generations
had laughed over it before anybody suspected that it was more than a
mere funny book. It is perhaps rather with the picaresque romances of
Spain that _Huckleberry Finn_ is to be compared than with the
masterpiece of Cervantes; but I do not think it will be a century or
take three generations before we Americans generally discover how great
a book _Huckleberry Finn_ really is, how keen its vision of character,
how close its observation of life, how sound its philosophy, and how it
records for us once and for all certain phases of Southwestern society
which it is most important for us to perceive and to understand. The
influence of slavery, the prevalence of feuds, the conditions and the
circumstances that make lynching possible--all these things are set
before us clearly and without comment. It is for us to draw our own
moral, each for himself, as we do when we see Shakespeare acted.

_Huckleberry Finn_, in its art, for one thing, and also in its broader
range, is superior to _Tom Sawyer_ and to _Pudd’nhead Wilson_, fine as
both these are in their several ways. In no book in our language, to my
mind, has the boy, simply as a boy, been better realized than in _Tom
Sawyer_. In some respects _Pudd’nhead Wilson_ is the most dramatic of
Mark Twain’s longer stories, and also the most ingenious; like _Tom
Sawyer_ and _Huckleberry Finn_, it has the full flavor of the
Mississippi River, on which its author spent his own boyhood, and from
contact with the soil of which he always rises reinvigorated.

It is by these three stories, and especially by _Huckleberry Finn_, that
Mark Twain is likely to live longest. Nowhere else is the life of the
Mississippi Valley so truthfully recorded. Nowhere else can we find a
gallery of Southwestern characters as varied and as veracious as those
Huck Finn met in his wanderings. The histories of literature all praise
the _Gil Blas_ of Le Sage for its amusing adventures, its natural
characters, its pleasant humor, and its insight into human frailty; and
the praise is deserved. But in everyone of these qualities _Huckleberry
Finn_ is superior to _Gil Blas_. Le Sage set the model of the picaresque
novel, and Mark Twain followed his example; but the American book is
richer than the French--deeper, finer, stronger. It would be hard to
find in any language better specimens of pure narrative, better examples
of the power of telling a story and of calling up action so that the
reader cannot help but see it, than Mark Twain’s account of the
Shepherdson-Grangerford feud, and his description of the shooting of
Boggs by Sherburn and of the foiled attempt to lynch Sherburn afterward.

These scenes, fine as they are, vivid, powerful, and most artistic in
their restraint, can be matched in the two other books. In _Tom Sawyer_
they can be paralleled by the chapter in which the boy and the girl are
lost in the cave, and Tom, seeing a gleam of light in the distance,
discovers that it is a candle carried by Indian Joe, the one enemy he
has in the world. In _Pudd’nhead Wilson_ the great passages of
_Huckleberry Finn_ are rivaled by that most pathetic account of the weak
son willing to sell his own mother as a slave “down the river.” Although
no one of the books is sustained throughout on this high level, and
although, in truth, there are in each of them passages here and there
that we could wish away (because they are not worthy of the association
in which we find them), I have no hesitation in expressing here my own
conviction that the man who has given us four scenes like these is to be
compared with the masters of literature; and that he can abide the
comparison with equanimity.

                                   IV

Perhaps I myself prefer these three Mississippi Valley books above all
Mark Twain’s other writings (although with no lack of affection for
those also) partly because these have the most of the flavor of the soil
about them. After veracity and the sense of the universal, what I best
relish in literature is this native aroma, pungent, homely, and abiding.
Yet I feel sure that I should not rate him so high if he were the author
of these three books only. They are the best of him, but the others are
good also, and good in a different way. Other writers have given us this
local color more or less artistically, more or less convincingly: one
New England and another New York, a third Virginia, and a fourth
Georgia, and a fifth Wisconsin; but who so well as Mark Twain has given
us the full spectrum of the Union? With all his exactness in reproducing
the Mississippi Valley, Mark Twain is not sectional in his outlook; he
is national always. He is not narrow; he is not Western or Eastern; he
is American with a certain largeness and boldness and freedom and
certainty that we like to think of as befitting a country so vast as
ours and a people so independent.

In Mark Twain we have “the national spirit as seen with our own eyes,”
declared Mr. Howells; and, from more points of view than one, Mark Twain
seems to me to be the very embodiment of Americanism. Self-educated in
the hard school of life, he has gone on broadening his outlook as he has
grown older. Spending many years abroad, he has come to understand other
nationalities, without enfeebling his own native faith. Combining a
mastery of the commonplace with an imaginative faculty, he is a
practical idealist. No respecter of persons, he has a tender regard for
his fellow man. Irreverent toward all outworn superstitions, he has ever
revealed the deepest respect for all things truly worthy of reverence.
Unwilling to take pay in words, he is impatient always to get at the
root of the matter, to pierce to the center, to see the thing as it is.
He has a habit of standing upright, of thinking for himself, and of
hitting hard at whatsoever seems to him hateful and mean; but at the
core of him there is genuine gentleness and honest sympathy, brave
humanity and sweet kindliness. Perhaps it is boastful for us to think
that these characteristics which we see in Mark Twain are
characteristics also of the American people as a whole; but it is
pleasant to think so.

Mark Twain has the very marrow of Americanism. He is as intensely and as
typically American as Franklin or Emerson or Hawthorne. He has not a
little of the shrewd common sense and the homely and unliterary
directness of Franklin. He is not without a share of the aspiration and
the elevation of Emerson; and he has a philosophy of his own as
optimistic as Emerson’s. He possesses also somewhat of Hawthorne’s
interest in ethical problems, with something of the same power of
getting at the heart of them; he, too, has written his parables and
apologues wherein the moral is obvious and unobtruded. He is
uncompromisingly honest; and his conscience is as rugged as his style
sometimes is.

No American author has to-day at his command a style more nervous, more
varied, more flexible, or more various than Mark Twain’s. His colloquial
ease should not hide from us his mastery of all the devices of rhetoric.
He may seem to disobey the letter of the law sometimes, but he is always
obedient to the spirit. He never speaks unless he has something to say;
and then he says it tersely, sharply, with a freshness of epithet and an
individuality of phrase, always accurate, however unacademic. His
vocabulary is enormous, and it is deficient only in the dead words; his
language is alive always, and actually tingling with vitality. He
rejoices in the daring noun and in the audacious adjective. His instinct
for the exact word is not always unerring, and now and again he has
failed to exercise it; but there is in his prose none of the flatting
and sharping he censured in Fenimore Cooper’s. His style has none of the
cold perfection of an antique statue; it is too modern and too American
for that, and too completely the expression of the man himself, sincere
and straightforward. It is not free from slang, although this is far
less frequent than one might expect; but it does its work swiftly and
cleanly. And it is capable of immense variety. Consider the tale of the
Blue Jay in _A Tramp Abroad_, wherein the humor is sustained by unstated
pathos; what could be better told than this, with every word the right
word and in the right place? And take Huck Finn’s description of the
storm when he was alone on the island, which is in dialect, which will
not parse, which bristles with double negatives, but which none the less
is one of the finest passages of descriptive prose in all American
literature.

                                   V

After all, it is as a humorist pure and simple that Mark Twain is best
known and best beloved. In the preceding pages I have tried to point out
the several ways in which he transcends humor, as the word is commonly
restricted, and to show that he is no mere fun maker. But he is a fun
maker beyond all question, and he has made millions laugh as no other
man of our century has done. The laughter he has aroused is wholesome
and self-respecting; it clears the atmosphere. For this we cannot but be
grateful. As Lowell said, “let us not be ashamed to confess that, if we
find the tragedy a bore, we take the profoundest satisfaction in the
farce. It is a mark of sanity.” There is no laughter in Don Quixote, the
noble enthusiast whose wits are unsettled; and there is little on the
lips of Alceste the misanthrope of Molière; but for both of them life
would have been easier had they known how to laugh. Cervantes himself,
and Molière also, found relief in laughter for their melancholy; and it
was the sense of humor which kept them tolerantly interested in the
spectacle of humanity, although life had pressed hardly on them both. On
Mark Twain also life has left its scars; but he has bound up his wounds
and battled forward with a stout heart, as Cervantes did, and Molière.
It was Molière who declared that it was a strange business to undertake
to make people laugh; but even now, after two centuries, when the best
of Molière’s plays are acted, mirth breaks out again and laughter
overflows.

It would be doing Mark Twain a disservice to liken him to Molière, the
greatest comic dramatist of all time; and yet there is more than one
point of similarity. Just as Mark Twain began by writing comic copy
which contained no prophecy of a masterpiece like _Huckleberry Finn_, so
Molière was at first the author only of semiacrobatic farces on the
Italian model in no wise presaging _Tartuffe_ and _The Misanthrope_.
Just as Molière succeeded first of all in pleasing the broad public that
likes robust fun, and then slowly and step by step developed into a
dramatist who set on the stage enduring figures plucked out of the
abounding life about him, so also has Mark Twain grown, ascending from
_The Jumping Frog_ to _Huckleberry Finn_, as comic as its elder brother
and as laughter-provoking, but charged also with meaning and with
philosophy. And like Molière again, Mark Twain has kept solid hold of
the material world; his doctrine is not of the earth earthy, but it is
never sublimated into sentimentality. He sympathizes with the spiritual
side of humanity, while never ignoring the sensual. Like Molière, Mark
Twain takes his stand on common sense and thinks scorn of affectation of
every sort. He understands sinners and strugglers and weaklings; and he
is not harsh with them, reserving his scorching hatred for hypocrites
and pretenders and frauds.

At how long an interval Mark Twain shall be rated after Molière and
Cervantes it is for the future to declare. All that we can see clearly
now is that it is with them that he is to be classed--with Molière and
Cervantes, with Chaucer and Fielding, humorists all of them, and all of
them manly men.






                              INTRODUCTION


A number of articles in this volume, even the more important, have not
heretofore appeared in print. Mark Twain was nearly always
writing--busily trying to keep up with his imagination and enthusiasm: A
good many of his literary undertakings remained unfinished or were held
for further consideration, in time to be quite forgotten. Few of these
papers were unimportant, and a fresh interest attaches to them to-day in
the fact that they present some new detail of the author’s devious
wanderings, some new point of observation, some hitherto unexpressed
angle of his indefatigable thought.

The present collection opens with a chapter from a book that was never
written, a book about England, for which the author made some
preparation, during his first visit to that country, in 1872. He filled
several notebooks with brief comments, among which appears this single
complete episode, the description of a visit to Westminster Abbey by
night. As an example of what the book might have been we may be sorry
that it went no farther.

It was not, however, quite in line with his proposed undertaking, which
had been to write a more or less satirical book on English manners and
customs. Arriving there, he found that he liked the people and their
country too well for that, besides he was so busy entertaining, and
being entertained, that he had little time for critical observation. In
a letter home he wrote:

  I came here to take notes for a book, but I haven’t done much but
  attend dinners and make speeches. I have had a jolly good time, and I
  do hate to go away from these English folks; they make a stranger feel
  entirely at home, and they laugh so easily that it is a comfort to
  make after-dinner speeches here.

England at this time gave Mark Twain an even fuller appreciation than he
had thus far received in his own country. To hunt out and hold up to
ridicule the foibles of hosts so hospitable would have been quite
foreign to his nature. The notes he made had little satire in them,
being mainly memoranda of the moment....

“Down the Rhône,” written some twenty years later, is a chapter from
another book that failed of completion. Mark Twain, in Europe partly for
his health, partly for financial reasons, had agreed to write six
letters for the New York _Sun_, two of which--those from Aix and
Marienbad--appear in this volume. Six letters would not make a book of
sufficient size and he thought he might supplement them by making a
drifting trip down the Rhône, the “river of angels,” as Stevenson called
it, and turning it into literature.

The trip itself proved to be one of the most delightful excursions of
his life, and his account of it, so far as completed, has interest and
charm. But he was alone, with only his boatman (the “Admiral”) and his
courier, Joseph Very, for company, a monotony of human material that was
not inspiring. He made some attempt to introduce fictitious characters,
but presently gave up the idea. As a whole the excursion was too drowsy
and comfortable to stir him to continuous effort; neither the notes nor
the article, attempted somewhat later, ever came to conclusion.

Three articles in this volume, beginning with “To the Person Sitting in
Darkness,” were published in the _North American Review_ during 1901-02,
at a period when Mark Twain had pretty well made up his mind on most
subjects, and especially concerning the interference of one nation with
another on matters of religion and government. He had recently returned
from a ten years’ sojourn in Europe and his opinion was eagerly sought
on all public questions, especially upon those of international aspect.
He was no longer regarded merely as a humorist, but as a sort of Solon
presiding over a court of final conclusions. A writer in the _Evening
Mail_ said of this later period:

  Things have reached the point where, if Mark Twain is not at a public
  meeting or banquet, he is expected to console it with one of his
  inimitable letters of advice and encouragement.

His old friend, W. D. Howells, expressed an amused fear that Mark
Twain’s countrymen, who in former years had expected him to be merely a
humorist, should now, in the light of his wider acceptance abroad,
demand that he be mainly serious.

He was serious enough, and fiercely humorous as well, in his article “To
the Person Sitting in Darkness” and in those which followed it. It
seemed to him that the human race, always a doubtful quantity, was
behaving even worse than usual. On New Year’s Eve, 1900-01, he wrote:

                  A GREETING FROM THE NINETEENTH TO THE
                            TWENTIETH CENTURY

  I bring you the stately nation named Christendom, returning,
  bedraggled, besmirched, and dishonored, from pirate raids in
  Kiao-Chau, Manchuria, South Africa, and the Philippines, with her soul
  full of meanness, her pocket full of boodle, and her mouth full of
  pious hypocracies. Give her soap and a towel, but hide the
  looking-glass.

Certain missionary activities in China, in particular, invited his
attention, and in the first of the _Review_ articles he unburdened
himself. A masterpiece of pitiless exposition and sarcasm, its
publication stirred up a cyclone. Periodicals more or less orthodox
heaped upon him denunciation and vituperation. “To My Missionary
Critics,” published in the _Review_ for April, was his answer. He did
not fight alone, but was upheld by a vast following of liberal-minded
readers, both in and out of the Church. Edward S. Martin wrote him:

  How gratifying it is to feel that we have a man among us who
  understands the rarity of plain truth, and who delights to utter it,
  and has the gift of doing so without cant, and with not too much
  seriousness.

The principals of the primal human drama, our biblical parents of Eden,
play a considerable part in Mark Twain’s imaginative writings. He wrote
“Diaries” of both Adam and Eve, that of the latter being among his
choicest works. He was generally planning something that would include
one or both of the traditional ancestors, and results of this tendency
express themselves in the present volume. Satan, likewise, the
picturesque angel of rebellion and defeat, the Satan of _Paradise Lost_,
made a strong appeal and in no less than three of the articles which
follow the prince of error variously appears. For the most part these
inventions offer an aspect of humor; but again the figure of the outcast
angel is presented to us in an attitude of sorrowful kinship with the
great human tragedy.

                          EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE




                    A MEMORABLE MIDNIGHT EXPERIENCE
                                 (1872)


“Come along--and hurry. Few people have got originality enough to think
of the expedition I have been planning, and still fewer could carry it
out, maybe, even if they _did_ think of it. Hurry, now. Cab at the
door.”

It was past eleven o’clock and I was just going to bed. But this friend
of mine was as reliable as he was eccentric, and so there was not a
doubt in my mind that his “expedition” had merit in it. I put on my coat
and boots again, and we drove away.

“Where is it? Where are we going?”

“Don’t worry. You’ll see.”

He was not inclined to talk. So I thought this must be a weighty matter.
My curiosity grew with the minutes, but I kept it manfully under the
surface. I watched the lamps, the signs, the numbers, as we thundered
down the long streets, but it was of no use--I am always lost in London,
day or night. It was very chilly--almost bleak. People leaned against
the gusty blasts as if it were the dead of winter. The crowds grew
thinner and thinner and the noises waxed faint and seemed far away. The
sky was overcast and threatening. We drove on, and still on, till I
wondered if we were ever going to stop. At last we passed by a spacious
bridge and a vast building with a lighted clock tower, and presently
entered a gateway, passed through a sort of tunnel, and stopped in a
court surrounded by the black outlines of a great edifice. Then we
alighted, walked a dozen steps or so, and waited. In a little while
footsteps were heard and a man emerged from the darkness and we dropped
into his wake without saying anything. He led us under an archway of
masonry, and from that into a roomy tunnel, through a tall iron gate,
which he locked behind us. We followed him down this tunnel, guided more
by his footsteps on the stone flagging than by anything we could very
distinctly see. At the end of it we came to another iron gate, and our
conductor stopped there and lit a little bull’s-eye lantern. Then he
unlocked the gate--and I wished he had oiled it first, it grated so
dismally. The gate swung open and we stood on the threshold of what
seemed a limitless domed and pillared cavern carved out of the solid
darkness. The conductor and my friend took off their hats reverently,
and I did likewise. For the moment that we stood thus there was not a
sound, and the silence seemed to add to the solemnity of the gloom. I
_looked_ my inquiry!

“It is the tomb of the great dead of England--_Westminster Abbey_.”

(One cannot express a start--in words.) Down among the columns--ever so
far away, it seemed--a light revealed itself like a star, and a voice
came echoing through the spacious emptiness:

“Who goes there!”

“Wright!”

The star disappeared and the footsteps that accompanied it clanked out
of hearing in the distance. Mr. Wright held up his lantern and the vague
vastness took something of form to itself--the stately columns developed
stronger outlines, and a dim pallor here and there marked the places of
lofty windows. We were among the tombs; and on every hand dull shapes of
men, sitting, standing, or stooping, inspected us curiously out of the
darkness--reached out their hands toward us--some appealing, some
beckoning, some warning us away. Effigies, they were--statues over the
graves; but they looked human and natural in the murky shadows. Now a
little half-grown black-and-white cat squeezed herself through the bars
of the iron gate and came purring lovingly about us, unawed by the time
or the place--unimpressed by the marble pomp that sepulchers a line of
mighty dead that ends with a great author of yesterday and began with a
sceptered monarch away back in the dawn of history more than twelve
hundred years ago. And she followed us about and never left us while we
pursued our work. We wandered hither and thither, uncovered, speaking in
low voices, and stepping softly by instinct, for any little noise rang
and echoed there in a way to make one shudder. Mr. Wright flashed his
lantern first upon this object and then upon that, and kept up a running
commentary that showed that there was nothing about the venerable Abbey
that was trivial in his eyes or void of interest. He is a man in
authority--being superintendent of the works--and his daily business
keeps him familiar with every nook and corner of the great pile. Casting
a luminous ray now here, now yonder, he would say:

“Observe the height of the Abbey--one hundred and three feet to the base
of the roof--I measured it myself the other day. Notice the base of this
column--old, very old--hundreds and hundreds of years; and how well they
knew how to build in those old days. Notice it--every stone is laid
horizontally--that is to say, just as nature laid it originally in the
quarry--not set up edgewise; in our day some people set them on edge,
and then wonder why they split and flake. Architects cannot teach nature
anything. Let me remove this matting--it is put there to preserve the
pavement; now, there is a bit of pavement that is seven hundred years
old; you can see by these scattering clusters of colored mosaics how
beautiful it was before time and sacrilegious idlers marred it. Now
there, in the border, was an inscription once; see, follow the
circle--you can trace it by the ornaments that have been pulled
out--here is an A, and there is an O, and yonder another A--all
beautiful old English capitals--there is no telling what the inscription
was--no record left, now. Now move along in this direction, if you
please. Yonder is where old King Sebert the Saxon, lies--his monument is
the oldest one in the Abbey; Sebert died in 616, and that’s as much as
twelve hundred and fifty years ago--think of it!--twelve hundred and
fifty years. Now yonder is the last one--Charles Dickens--there on the
floor with the brass letters on the slab--and to this day the people
come and put flowers on it. Why, along at first they almost had to
_cart_ the flowers out, there were so many. Could not _leave_ them
there, you know, because it’s where everybody walks--and a body wouldn’t
want them trampled on, anyway. All this place about here, now, is the
Poet’s Corner. There is Garrick’s monument, and Addison’s, and
Thackeray’s bust--and Macaulay lies there. And here, close to Dickens
and Garrick, lie Sheridan and Doctor Johnson--and here is old
Parr--Thomas Parr--you can read the inscription:

  “Tho: Par of Y Covnty of Sallop Borne A :1483. He Lived in Y Reignes
  of Ten Princes, viz: K. Edw. 4 K. Ed. 5. K. Rich 3. K. Hen. 7. K. Hen.
  8. Edw. 6. QVV. Ma. Q. Eliz. K. IA. and K. Charles, Aged 152 Yeares,
  And Was Buryed Here Novemb. 15. 1635.

“Very old man indeed, and saw a deal of life. (Come off the grave,
Kitty, poor thing; she keeps the rats away from the office, and there’s
no harm in her--her and her mother.) And here--this is Shakespeare’s
statue--leaning on his elbow and pointing with his finger at the lines
on the scroll:

             “The cloud-capt towers, the gorgeous palaces,
             The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
             Yea, all which it inherit shall dissolve,
             And, like the baseless fabric of a vision,
             Leave not a wrack behind.

“That stone there covers Campbell the poet. Here are names you know
pretty well--Milton, and Gray who wrote the ‘Elegy,’ and Butler who
wrote ‘Hudibras,’ and Edmund Spencer, and Ben Jonson--there are three
tablets to him scattered about the Abbey, and all got ‘O Rare Ben
Jonson’ cut on them--you were standing on one of them just now--he is
buried standing up. There used to be a tradition here that explains it.
The story goes that he did not dare ask to be buried in the Abbey, so he
asked King James if he would make him a present of eighteen inches of
English ground, and the king said yes, and asked him where he would have
it, and he said in Westminster Abbey. Well, the king wouldn’t go back on
his word, and so there he is sure enough--stood up on end. Years ago, in
Dean Buckland’s time--before my day--they were digging a grave close to
Jonson and they uncovered him and his head fell off. Toward night the
clerk of the works hid the head to keep it from being stolen, as the
ground was to remain open till next day. Presently the dean’s son came
along and he found a head, and hid it away for Jonson’s. And by and by
along comes a stranger, and _he_ found a head, too, and walked off with
it under his cloak, and a month or so afterward he was heard to boast
that he had Ben Jonson’s head. Then there was a deal of correspondence
about it, in the _Times_, and everybody distressed. But Mr. Frank
Buckland came out and comforted everybody by telling how he saved the
true head, and so the stranger must have got one that wasn’t of any
consequence. And then up speaks the clerk of the works and tells how
_he_ saved the right head, and so _Dean Buckland_ must have got a wrong
one. Well, it was all settled satisfactorily at last, because the clerk
of the works _proved_ his head. And then I believe they got that head
from the stranger--so now we have three. But it shows you what regiments
of people you are walking over--been collecting here for twelve hundred
years--in some places, no doubt, the bones are fairly matted together.

“And here are some unfortunates. Under this place lies Anne, queen of
Richard III, and daughter of the Kingmaker, the great Earl of
Warwick--murdered she was--poisoned by her husband. And here is a slab
which you see has once had the figure of a man in armor on it, in brass
or copper, let into the stone. You can see the shape of it--but it is
all worn away now by people’s feet; the man has been dead five hundred
years that lies under it. He was a knight in Richard II’s time. His
enemies pressed him close and he fled and took sanctuary here in the
Abbey. Generally a man was safe when he took sanctuary in those days,
but this man was not. The captain of the Tower and a band of men pursued
him and his friends and they had a bloody fight here on this floor; but
this poor fellow did not stand much of a chance, and they butchered him
right before the altar.”

We wandered over to another part of the Abbey, and came to a place where
the pavement was being repaired. Every paving stone has an inscription
on it and covers a grave. Mr. Wright continued:

“Now, you are standing on William Pitt’s grave--you can read the name,
though it is a good deal worn--and you, sir, are standing on the grave
of Charles James Fox. I found a very good place here the other
day--nobody suspected it--been curiously overlooked, somehow--but--it is
a very nice place indeed, and very comfortable” (holding his bull’s eye
to the pavement and searching around). “Ah, here it is--this is the
stone--nothing under here--nothing at all--a very nice place indeed--and
very comfortable.”

Mr. Wright spoke in a professional way, of course, and after the manner
of a man who takes an interest in his business and is gratified at any
piece of good luck that fortune favors him with; and yet with all that
silence and gloom and solemnity about me, there was something about his
idea of a nice, comfortable place that made the cold chills creep up my
back. Presently we began to come upon little chamberlike chapels, with
solemn figures ranged around the sides, lying apparently asleep, in
sumptuous marble beds, with their hands placed together above their
breasts--the figures and all their surroundings black with age. Some
were dukes and earls, some where kings and queens, some were ancient
abbots whose effigies had lain there so many centuries and suffered such
disfigurement that their faces were almost as smooth and featureless as
the stony pillows their heads reposed upon. At one time while I stood
looking at a distant part of the pavement, admiring the delicate tracery
which the now flooding moonlight was casting upon it through a lofty
window, the party moved on and I lost them. The first step I made in the
dark, holding my hands before me, as one does under such circumstances,
I touched a cold object, and stopped to feel its shape. I made out a
thumb, and then delicate fingers. It was the clasped, appealing hands of
one of those reposing images--a lady, a queen. I touched the face--by
accident, not design--and shuddered inwardly, if not outwardly; and then
something rubbed against my leg, and I shuddered outwardly and inwardly
both. It was the cat. The friendly creature meant well, but, as the
English say, she gave me “such a turn.” I took her in my arms for
company and wandered among the grim sleepers till I caught the glimmer
of the lantern again. Presently, in a little chapel, we were looking at
the sarcophagus, let into the wall, which contains the bones of the
infant princes who were smothered in the Tower. Behind us was the
stately monument of Queen Elizabeth, with her effigy dressed in the
royal robes, lying as if at rest. When we turned around, the cat, with
stupendous simplicity, was coiled up and sound asleep upon the feet of
the Great Queen! Truly this was reaching far toward the millennium when
the lion and the lamb shall lie down together. The murderer of Mary and
Essex, the conqueror of the Armada, the imperious ruler of a turbulent
empire, become a couch, at last, for a tired kitten! It was the most
eloquent sermon upon the vanity of human pride and human grandeur that
inspired Westminster preached to us that night.

We would have turned puss out of the Abbey, but for the fact that her
small body made light of railed gates and she would have come straight
back again. We walked up a flight of half a dozen steps and, stopping
upon a pavement laid down in 1260, stood in the core of English history,
as it were--upon the holiest ground in the British Empire, if profusion
of kingly bones and kingly names of old renown make holy ground. For
here in this little space were the ashes, the monuments and gilded
effigies, of ten of the most illustrious personages who have worn crowns
and borne scepters in this realm. This royal dust was the slow
accumulation of hundreds of years. The latest comer entered into his
rest four hundred years ago, and since the earliest was sepulchered,
more than eight centuries have drifted by. Edward the Confessor, Henry
the Fifth, Edward the First, Edward the Third, Richard the Second, Henry
the Third, Eleanor, Philippa, Margaret Woodville--it was like bringing
the colossal myths of history out of the forgotten ages and speaking to
them face to face. The gilded effigies were scarcely marred--the faces
were comely and majestic, old Edward the First looked the king--one had
no impulse to be familiar with him. While we were contemplating the
figure of Queen Eleanor lying in state, and calling to mind how like an
ordinary human being the great king mourned for her six hundred years
ago, we saw the vast illuminated clock face of the Parliament House
tower glowering at us through a window of the Abbey and pointing with
both hands to midnight. It was a derisive reminder that we were a part
of this present sordid, plodding, commonplace time, and not august
relics of a bygone age and the comrades of kings--and then the booming
of the great bell tolled twelve, and with the last stroke the mocking
clock face vanished in sudden darkness and left us with the past and its
grandeurs again.

We descended, and entered the nave of the splendid Chapel of Henry VII.
Mr. Wright said:

“Here is where the order of knighthood was conferred for centuries; the
candidates sat in these seats; these brasses bear their coats of arms;
these are their banners overhead, torn and dusty, poor old things, for
they have hung there many and many a long year. In the floor you see
inscriptions--kings and queens that lie in the vault below. When this
vault was opened in our time they found them lying there in beautiful
order--all quiet and comfortable--the red velvet on the coffins hardly
faded any. And the bodies were sound--I saw them myself. They were
embalmed, and looked natural, although they had been there such an awful
time. Now in this place here, which is called the chantry, is a curious
old group of statuary--the figures are mourning over George Villiers,
Duke of Buckingham, who was assassinated by Felton in Charles I’s time.
Yonder, Cromwell and his family used to lie. Now we come to the south
aisle and this is the grand monument to Mary Queen of Scots, and her
effigy--you easily see they get all the portraits from this effigy. Here
in the wall of the aisle is a bit of a curiosity pretty roughly carved:

                             Wm. WEST TOOME
                                 SHOWER
                                  1698

“William West, tomb shower, 1698. That fellow carved his name around in
several places about the Abbey.”

This was a sort of revelation to me. I had been wandering through the
Abbey, never imagining but that its shows were created only for us--the
people of the nineteenth century. But here is a man (become a show
himself now, and a curiosity) to whom all these things were sights and
wonders a hundred and seventy-five years ago. When curious idlers from
the country and from foreign lands came here to look, he showed them old
Sebert’s tomb and those of the other old worthies I have been speaking
of, and called them ancient and venerable; and he showed them Charles
II’s tomb as the newest and latest novelty he had; and he was doubtless
present at the funeral. Three hundred years before his time some
ancestor of his, perchance, used to point out the ancient marvels, in
the immemorial way and then say: “This, gentlemen, is the tomb of his
late Majesty Edward the Third--and I wish I could see him alive and
hearty again, as I saw him twenty years ago; yonder is the tomb of
Sebert the Saxon king--he has been lying there well on to eight hundred
years, they say. And three hundred years before _this_ party,
Westminster was still a show, and Edward the Confessor’s grave was a
novelty of some thirty years’ standing--but old “Sebert” was hoary and
ancient still, and people who spoke of Alfred the Great as a
comparatively recent man pondered over Sebert’s grave and tried to take
in all the tremendous meaning of it when the “toome shower” said, “This
man has lain here well nigh five hundred years.” It does seem as if all
the generations that have lived and died since the world was created
have visited Westminster to stare and wonder--and still found ancient
things there. And some day a curiously clad company may arrive here in a
balloon ship from some remote corner of the globe, and as they follow
the verger among the monuments they may hear him say: “This is the tomb
of Victoria the Good Queen; battered and uncouth as it looks, it once
was a wonder of magnificence--but twelve hundred years work a deal of
damage to these things.”

As we turned toward the door the moonlight was beaming in at the
windows, and it gave to the sacred place such an air of restfulness and
peace that Westminster was no longer a grisly museum of moldering
vanities, but her better and worthier self--the deathless mentor of a
great nation, the guide and encourager of right ambitions, the preserver
of just fame, and the home and refuge for the nation’s best and bravest
when their work is done.




                       TWO MARK TWAIN EDITORIALS

  (Written 1869 and 1870, for the Buffalo _Express_, of which Mark Twain
  became editor and part owner)

                                   I
                              “SALUTATORY”

Being a stranger, it would be immodest and unbecoming in me to suddenly
and violently assume the associate editorship of the _Buffalo Express_
without a single explanatory word of comfort or encouragement to the
unoffending patrons of the paper, who are about to be exposed to
constant attacks of my wisdom and learning. But this explanatory word
shall be as brief as possible. I only wish to assure parties having a
friendly interest in the prosperity of the journal, that I am not going
to hurt the paper deliberately and intentionally at any time. I am not
going to introduce any startling reforms, or in any way attempt to make
trouble. I am simply going to do my plain, unpretending duty, when I
cannot get out of it; I shall work diligently and honestly and
faithfully at all times and upon all occasions, when privation and want
shall compel me to do it; in writing, I shall always confine myself
strictly to the truth, except when it is attended with inconvenience; I
shall witheringly rebuke all forms of crime and misconduct, except when
committed by the party inhabiting my own vest; I shall not make use of
slang or vulgarity upon any occasion or under any circumstances, and
shall never use profanity except in discussing house rent and taxes.
Indeed, upon second thought, I will not even use it then, for it is
unchristian, inelegant, and degrading--though to speak truly I do not
see how house rent and taxes are going to be discussed worth a cent
without it. I shall not often meddle with politics, because we have a
political editor who is already excellent, and only needs to serve a
term in the penitentiary in order to be perfect. I shall not write any
poetry, unless I conceive a spite against the subscribers.

Such is my platform. I do not see any earthly use in it, but custom is
law, and custom must be obeyed, no matter how much violence it may do to
one’s feelings. And this custom which I am slavishly following now is
surely one of the least necessary that ever came into vogue. In private
life a man does not go and trumpet his crime before he commits it, but
your new editor is such an important personage that he feels called upon
to write a “salutatory” at once, and he puts into it all that he knows,
and all that he don’t know, and some things he thinks he knows but isn’t
certain of. And he parades his list of wonders which he is going to
perform; of reforms which he is going to introduce, and public evils
which he is going to exterminate; and public blessings which he is going
to create; and public nuisances which he is going to abate. He spreads
this all out with oppressive solemnity over a column and a half of large
print, and feels that the country is saved. His satisfaction over it,
something enormous. He then settles down to his miracles and inflicts
profound platitudes and impenetrable wisdom upon a helpless public as
long as they can stand it, and then they send him off consul to some
savage island in the Pacific in the vague hope that the cannibals will
like him well enough to eat him. And with an inhumanity which is but a
fitting climax to his career of persecution, instead of packing his
trunk at once he lingers to inflict upon his benefactors a
“valedictory.” If there is anything more uncalled for than a
“salutatory,” it is one of those tearful, blubbering, long-winded
“valedictories”--wherein a man who has been annoying the public for ten
years cannot take leave of them without sitting down to cry a column and
a half. Still, it is the custom to write valedictories, and custom
should be respected. In my secret heart I admire my predecessor for
declining to print a valedictory, though in public I say and shall
continue to say sternly, it is custom and he ought to have printed one.
People never read them any more than they do the “salutatories,” but
nevertheless he ought to have honored the old fossil--he ought to have
printed a valedictory. I said as much to him, and he replied:

“I have resigned my place--I have departed this life--I am
journalistically dead, at present, ain’t I?”

“Yes.”

“Well, wouldn’t you consider it disgraceful in a corpse to sit up and
comment on the funeral?”

I record it here, and preserve it from oblivion, as the briefest and
best “valedictory” that has yet come under my notice.

                                                         MARK TWAIN.

P. S.--I am grateful for the kindly way in which the press of the land
have taken notice of my irruption into regular journalistic life,
telegraphically or editorially, and am happy in this place to express
the feeling.

                                   II
                     A TRIBUTE TO ANSON BURLINGAME

                            (February, 1870)

On Wednesday, in St. Petersburg, Mr. Burlingame died after a short
illness. It is not easy to comprehend, at an instant’s warning, the
exceeding magnitude of the loss which mankind sustains in this
death--the loss which all nations and all peoples sustain in it. For he
had outgrown the narrow citizenship of a state and become a citizen of
the world; and his charity was large enough and his great heart warm
enough to feel for all its races and to labor for them. He was a true
man, a brave man, an earnest man, a liberal man, a just man, a generous
man, in all his ways and by all his instincts a noble man; he was a man
of education and culture, a finished conversationalist, a ready, able,
and graceful speaker, a man of great brain, a broad and deep and weighty
thinker. He was a great man--a very, very great man. He was imperially
endowed by nature; he was faithfully befriended by circumstances, and he
wrought gallantly always, in whatever station he found himself.

He was a large, handsome man, with such a face as children instinctively
trust in, and homeless and friendless creatures appeal to without fear.
He was courteous at all times and to all people, and he had the rare and
winning faculty of being always _interested_ in whatever a man had to
say--a faculty which he possessed simply because nothing was trivial to
him which any man or woman or child had at heart. When others said harsh
things about even unconscionable and intrusive bores after they had
retired from his presence, Mr. Burlingame often said a generous word in
their favor, but never an unkind one.

A chivalrous generosity was his most marked characteristic--a large
charity, a noble kindliness that could not comprehend narrowness or
meanness. It is this that shows out in his fervent abolitionism,
manifested at a time when it was neither very creditable nor very safe
to hold such a creed; it was this that prompted him to hurl his famous
Brooks-and-Sumner speech in the face of an astonished South at a time
when all the North was smarting under the sneers and taunts and material
aggressions of admired and applauded Southerners. It was this that made
him so warmly espouse the cause of Italian liberty--an espousal so
pointed and so vigorous as to attract the attention of Austria, which
empire afterward declined to receive him when he was appointed Austrian
envoy by Mr. Lincoln. It was this trait which prompted him to punish
Americans in China when they imposed upon the Chinese. It was this trait
which moved him, in framing treaties, to frame them in the broad
interest of the world, instead of selfishly seeking to acquire
advantages for his own country alone and at the expense of the other
party to the treaty, as had always before been the recognized
“diplomacy.” It was this trait which was and is the soul of the crowning
achievements of his career, the treaties with America and England in
behalf of China. In every labor of this man’s life there was present a
good and noble motive; and in nothing that he ever did or said was there
anything small or base. In real greatness, ability, grandeur of
character, and achievement, he stood head and shoulders above all the
Americans of to-day, save one or two.

Without any noise, or any show, or any flourish, Mr. Burlingame did a
score of things of shining mark during his official residence in China.
They were hardly heard of away here in America. When he first went to
China, he found that with all their kingly powers, American envoys were
still not of much consequence in the eyes of their countrymen of either
civil or official position. But he was a man who was always “posted.” He
knew all about the state of things he would find in China before he
sailed from America. And so he took care to demand and receive
additional powers before he turned his back upon Washington. When the
customary consular irregularities placidly continued and he notified
those officials that such irregularities must instantly cease, and they
inquired with insolent flippancy what the consequence might be in case
they did not cease, he answered blandly that he would _dismiss_ them,
from the highest to the lowest! (He had quietly come armed with absolute
authority over their official lives.) The consular irregularities
ceased. A far healthier condition of American commercial interests
ensued there.

To punish a foreigner in China was an unheard-of thing. There was no way
of accomplishing it. Each Embassy had its own private district or
grounds, forced from the imperial government, and into that sacred
district Chinese law officers could not intrude. All foreigners guilty
of offenses against Chinamen were tried by their own countrymen, in
these holy places, and as no Chinese testimony was admitted, the culprit
almost always went free. One of the very first things Mr. Burlingame did
was to make a Chinaman’s oath as good as a foreigner’s; and in his
ministerial court, through Chinese and American testimony combined, he
very shortly convicted a noted American ruffian of murdering a Chinaman.
And now a community accustomed to light sentences were naturally
startled when, under Mr. Burlingame’s hand, and bearing the broad seal
of the American Embassy, came an order to take him out and hang him!

Mr. Burlingame broke up the “extra-territorial” privileges (as they were
called), as far as our country was concerned, and made justice as free
to all and as untrammeled in the metes and bounds of its jurisdiction,
in China, as ever it was in any land.

Mr. Burlingame was the leading spirit in the co-operative policy. He got
the Imperial College established. He procured permission for an American
to open the coal mines of China. Through his efforts China was the first
country to close her ports against the war vessels of the Southern
Confederacy; and Prince Kung’s order, in this matter, was singularly
energetic, comprehensive, and in earnest. The ports were closed then,
and never opened to a Southern warship afterward.

Mr. Burlingame “construed” the treaties existing between China and the
other nations. For many years the ablest diplomatists had vainly tried
to come to a satisfactory understanding of certain obscure clauses of
these treaties, and more than once powder had been burned in
consequences of failure to come to such understandings. But the clear
and comprehensive intellect of the American envoy reduced the wordy
tangle of diplomatic phrases to a plain and honest handful of
paragraphs, and these were unanimously and thankfully accepted by the
other foreign envoys, and officially declared by them to be a thorough
and satisfactory elucidation of all the uncertain clauses in the
treaties.

Mr. Burlingame did a mighty work, and made official intercourse with
China lucid, simple, and systematic, thenceforth for all time, when he
persuaded that government to adopt and accept the code of international
law by which the civilized nations of the earth are guided and
controlled.

It is not possible to specify all the acts by which Mr. Burlingame made
himself largely useful to the world during his official residence in
China. At least it would not be possible to do it without making this
sketch too lengthy and pretentious for a newspaper article.

Mr. Burlingame’s short history--for he was only forty-seven--reads like
a fairy tale. Its successes, its surprises, its happy situations, occur
all along, and each new episode is always an improvement upon the one
which went before it.

He begins life an assistant in a surveying party away out on the Western
frontier; then enters a branch of a Western college; then passes through
Harvard with the honors; becomes a Boston lawyer and looks back
complacently from his high perch upon the old days when he was a
surveyor nobody in the woods; becomes a state senator, and makes laws;
still advancing, goes to the Constitutional Convention and makes
regulations wherewith to rule the makers of laws; enters Congress and
smiles back upon the Legislature and the Boston lawyer, and from these
smiles still back upon the country surveyor, recognizes that he is known
to fame in Massachusetts; challenges Brooks and is known to the nation;
next, with a long stride upward, he is clothed with ministerial dignity
and journeys to the under side of the world to represent the youngest in
the court of the oldest of the nations; and finally, after years go by,
we see him moving serenely among the crowned heads of the Old World, a
magnate with secretaries and undersecretaries about him, a retinue of
quaint, outlandish Orientals in his wake, and a long following of
servants--and the world is aware that his salary is unbelievably
enormous, not to say imperial, and likewise knows that he is invested
with power to make treaties with all the chief nations of the earth, and
that he bears the stately title of Ambassador, and in his person
represents the mysterious and awful grandeur of that vague colossus, the
Emperor of China, his mighty empire and his four hundred millions of
subjects! Down what a dreamy vista his backward glance must stretch,
now, to reach the insignificant surveyor in the Western woods!

He was a good man, and a very, very great man. America lost a son, and
all the world a servant, when he died.




                       THE TEMPERANCE CRUSADE AND
                             WOMAN’S RIGHTS
                                 (1873)


The women’s crusade against the rum sellers continues. It began in an
Ohio village early in the new year, and has now extended itself
eastwardly to the Atlantic seaboard, 600 miles, and westwardly (at a
bound, without stopping by the way,) to San Francisco, about 2,500
miles. It has also scattered itself along down the Ohio and Mississippi
rivers southwardly some ten or twelve hundred miles. Indeed, it promises
to sweep, eventually, the whole United States, with the exception of the
little cluster of commonwealths which we call New England. Puritan New
England is sedate, reflective, conservative, and very hard to inflame.

The method of the crusaders is singular. They contemn the use of force
in the breaking up of the whisky traffic. They only assemble before a
drinking shop, or within it, and sing hymns and pray, hour after
hour--and day after day, if necessary--until the publican’s business is
broken up and he surrenders. This is not force, at least they do not
consider it so. After the surrender the crusaders march back to
headquarters and proclaim the victory, and ascribe it to the powers
above. They rejoice together awhile, and then go forth again in their
strength and conquer another whisky shop with their prayers and hymns
and their staying capacity (pardon the rudeness), and spread _that_
victory upon the battle flag of the powers above. In this generous way
the crusaders have parted with the credit of not less than three
thousand splendid triumphs, which some carping people say they gained
their own selves, without assistance from any quarter. If I am one of
these, I am the humblest. If I seem to doubt that prayer is the agent
that conquers these rum sellers, I do it honestly, and not in a flippant
spirit. If the crusaders were to stay at home and pray for the rum
seller and for his adoption of a better way of life, or if the crusaders
even assembled together in a church and offered up such a prayer with a
united voice, and it accomplished a victory, I would then feel that it
was the praying that moved Heaven to do the miracle; for I believe that
if the prayer is the agent that brings about the desired result, it
cannot be necessary to pray the prayer in any particular place in order
to get the ear, or move the grace, of the Deity. When the crusaders go
and invest a whisky shop and fall to praying, one suspects that they are
praying rather less to the Deity than _at_ the rum man. So I cannot help
feeling (after carefully reading the details of the rum sieges) that as
much as nine tenths of the credit of each of the 3,000 victories
achieved thus far belongs of right to the crusaders themselves, and it
grieves me to see them give it away with such spendthrift generosity.

I will not afflict you with statistics, but I desire to say just a word
or two about the character of this crusade. The crusaders are young
girls and women--not the inferior sort, but the very best in the village
communities. The telegraph keeps the newspapers supplied with the
progress of the war, and thus the praying infection spreads from town to
town, day after day, week after week. When it attacks a community it
seems to seize upon almost everybody in it at once. There is a meeting
in a church, speeches are made, resolutions are passed, a purse for
expenses is made up, a “praying band” is appointed; if it be a large
town, half a dozen praying bands, each numbering as many as a hundred
women, are appointed, and the working district of each band marked out.
Then comes a grand assault in force, all along the line. Every
stronghold of rum is invested; first one and then another champion
ranges up before the proprietor and offers up a special petition for
him; he has to stand meekly there behind his bar, under the eyes of a
great concourse of ladies who are better than he is and are aware of it,
and hear all the secret iniquities of his business divulged to the
angels above, accompanied by the sharp sting of wishes for his
regeneration, which imply an amount of need for it which is in the last
degree uncomfortable to him. If he holds out bravely, the crusaders hold
out more bravely still--or at least more persistently; though I doubt if
the grandeur of the performance would not be considerably heightened if
one solitary crusader were to try praying at a hundred rum sellers in a
body for a while, and see how it felt to have everybody against her
instead of for her. If the man holds out the crusaders camp before his
place and keep up the siege till they wear him out. In one case they
besieged a rum shop two whole weeks. They built a shed before it and
kept up the praying all night and all day long every day of the
fortnight, and this in the bitterest winter weather, too. They
conquered.

You may ask if such an investment and such interference with a man’s
business (in cases where he is “protected” by a license) is lawful? By
no means. But the whole community being with the crusaders, the
authorities have usually been overawed and afraid to execute the laws,
the authorities being, in too many cases, mere little politicians, and
more given to looking to chances of re-election than fearlessly
discharging their duty according to the terms of their official oaths.

Would you consider the conduct of these crusaders justifiable? I
do--thoroughly justifiable. They find themselves voiceless in the making
of laws and the election of officers to execute them. Born with brains,
born in the country, educated, having large interests at stake, they
find their tongues tied and their hands fettered, while every ignorant
whisky-drinking foreign-born savage in the land may hold office, help to
make the laws, degrade the dignity of the former and break the latter at
his own sweet will. They see their fathers, husbands, and brothers sit
inanely at home and allow the scum of the country to assemble at the
“primaries,” name the candidates for office from their own vile ranks,
and, unrebuked, elect them. They live in the midst of a country where
there is no end to the laws and no beginning to the execution of them.
And when the laws intended to protect their sons from destruction by
intemperance lie torpid and without sign of life year after year, they
recognize that here is a matter which interests them personally--a
matter which comes straight home to them. And since they are allowed to
lift no legal voice against the outrageous state of things they suffer
under in this regard, I think it is no wonder that their patience has
broken down at last, and they have contrived to persuade themselves that
they are justifiable in breaking the law of trespass when the laws that
should make the trespass needless are allowed by the voters to lie dead
and inoperative.

I cannot help glorying in the pluck of these women, sad as it is to see
them displaying themselves in these unwomanly ways; sad as it is to see
them carrying their grace and their purity into places which should
never know their presence; and sadder still as it is to see them trying
to save a set of men who, it seems to me, there can be no reasonable
object in saving. It does not become us to scoff at the crusaders,
remembering what it is they have borne all these years, but it does
become us to admire their heroism--a heroism that boldly faces jeers,
curses, ribald language, obloquy of every kind and degree--in a word,
every manner of thing that pure-hearted, pure-minded women such as these
are naturally dread and shrink from, and remains steadfast through it
all, undismayed, patient, hopeful, giving no quarter, asking none,
determined to conquer and succeeding. It is the same old superb spirit
that animated that other devoted, magnificent, mistaken crusade of six
hundred years ago. The sons of such women as these must surely be worth
saving from the destroying power of rum.

The present crusade will doubtless do but little work against
intemperance that will be really permanent, but it will do what is as
much, or even more, to the purpose, I think. I think it will suggest to
more than one man that if women could vote they would vote on the side
of morality, even if they did vote and speak rather frantically and
furiously; and it will also suggest that when the women once made up
their minds that it was not good to leave the all-powerful “primaries”
in the hands of loafers, thieves, and pernicious little politicians,
they would not sit indolently at home as their husbands and brothers do
now, but would hoist their praying banners, take the field in force,
pray the assembled political scum back to the holes and slums where they
belong, and set up some candidates fit for decent human beings to vote
for.

I dearly want the women to be raised to the political altitude of the
negro, the imported savage, and the pardoned thief, and allowed to vote.
It is our last chance, I think. The women will be voting before long,
and then if a B. F. Butler can still continue to lord it in Congress; if
the highest offices in the land can still continue to be occupied by
perjurers and robbers; if another Congress (like the forty-second)
consisting of 15 honest men and 296 of the other kind can once more be
created, it will at last be time, I fear, to give over trying to save
the country by human means, and appeal to Providence. Both the great
parties have failed. I wish we might have a woman’s party now, and see
how that would work. I feel persuaded that in extending the suffrage to
women this country could lose absolutely nothing and might gain a great
deal. For thirty centuries history has been iterating and reiterating
that in a moral fight woman is simply dauntless, and we all know, even
with our eyes shut upon Congress and our voters, that from the day that
Adam ate of the apple and told on Eve down to the present day, man, in a
moral fight, has pretty uniformly shown himself to be an arrant coward.

I will mention casually that while I cannot bring myself to find fault
with the women whom we call the crusaders, since I feel that they, being
politically fettered, have the natural right of the oppressed to rebel,
I have a very different opinion about the clergymen who have in a
multitude of instances attached themselves to the movement, and by voice
and act have countenanced and upheld the women in unlawfully trespassing
upon whisky mills and interrupting the rum sellers’ business. It seems
to me that it would better become clergymen to teach their flocks to
respect the laws of the land, and urge them to refrain from breaking
them. But it is not a new thing for a thoroughly good and well-meaning
preacher’s soft heart to run away with his soft head.




                                 O’SHAH

     (A series of news letters describing a visit to England by the
                            Shah of Persia)

                                   I
                         THE ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND

                                            LONDON, _June 18, 1873_.

“Would you like to go over to Belgium and help bring the Shah to
England?”

I said I was willing.

“Very well, then; here is an order from the Admiralty which will admit
you on board Her Majesty’s ship _Lively_, now lying at Ostend, and you
can return in her day after to-morrow.”

That was all. That was the end of it. Without stopping to think, I had
in a manner taken upon myself to bring the Shah of Persia to England. I
could not otherwise regard the conversation I had just held with the
London representative of the New York _Herald_. The amount of discomfort
I endured for the next two or three hours cannot be set down in words. I
could not eat, sleep, talk, smoke with any satisfaction. The more I
thought the thing over the more oppressed I felt. What was the Shah to
me, that I should go to all this worry and trouble on his account? Where
was there the least occasion for taking upon myself such a
responsibility? If I got him over all right, well. But if I lost him? if
he died on my hands? if he got drowned? It was depressing, any way I
looked at it. In the end I said to myself, “If I get this Shah over here
safe and sound I never will take charge of another one.” And yet, at the
same time I kept thinking: “This country has treated me well, stranger
as I am, and this foreigner is the country’s guest--that is enough, I
will help him out; I will fetch him over; I will land him in London, and
say to the British people, ‘Here is your Shah; give me a receipt.’”

I felt easy in my mind now, and was about to go to bed, but something
occurred to me. I took a cab and drove downtown and routed out that
_Herald_ representative.

“Where is Belgium?” said I.

“Where is Belgium? I never heard such a question!”

“That doesn’t make any difference to me. If I have got to fetch this
Shah I don’t wish to go to the wrong place. Where is Belgium? Is it a
shilling fare in a cab?”

He explained that it was in foreign parts--the first place I have heard
of lately which a body could not go to in a cab for a shilling.

I said I could not go alone, because I could not speak foreign languages
well, could not get up in time for the early train without help, and
could not find my way. I said it was enough to have the Shah on my
hands; I did not wish to have everything piled on me. Mr. Blank was then
ordered to go with me. I do like to have somebody along to talk to when
I go abroad.

When I got home I sat down and thought the thing all over. I wanted to
go into this enterprise understandingly. What was the main thing? That
was the question. A little reflection informed me. For two weeks the
London papers had sung just one continual song to just one continual
tune, and the idea of it all was “how to impress the Shah.” These papers
had told all about the St. Petersburg splendors, and had said at the end
that splendors would no longer answer; that England could not outdo
Russia in that respect; therefore some other way of impressing the Shah
must be contrived. And these papers had also told all about the Shahstic
reception in Prussia and its attendant military pageantry. England could
not improve on that sort of thing--she could not impress the Shah with
soldiers; something else must be tried. And so on. Column after column,
page after page of agony about how to “impress the Shah.” At last they
had hit upon a happy idea--a grand naval exhibition. That was it! A man
brought up in Oriental seclusion and simplicity, a man who had never
seen anything but camels and such things, could not help being surprised
and delighted with the strange novelty of ships. The distress was at an
end. England heaved a great sigh of relief; she knew at last how to
impress the Shah.

My course was very plain, now, after that bit of reflection. All I had
to do was to go over to Belgium and impress the Shah. I failed to form
any definite plan as to the process, but I made up my mind to manage it
somehow. I said to myself, “I will impress this Shah or there shall be a
funeral that will be worth contemplating.”

I went to bed then, but did not sleep a great deal, for the
responsibilities were weighing pretty heavily upon me. At six o’clock in
the morning Mr. Blank came and turned me out. I was surprised at this,
and not gratified, for I detest early rising. I never like to say severe
things, but I was a good deal tried this time. I said I did not mind
getting up moderately early, but I hated to be called day before
yesterday. However, as I was acting in a national capacity and for a
country that I liked, I stopped grumbling and we set out. A grand naval
review is a good thing to impress a Shah with, but if he would try
getting up at six o’clock in the morning--but no matter; we started.

We took the Dover train and went whistling along over the housetops at
the rate of fifty miles an hour, and just as smoothly and pleasantly,
too, as if we were in a sleigh. One never can have anything but a very
vague idea of what speed is until he travels over an English railway.
Our “lightning” expresses are sleepy and indolent by comparison. We
looked into the back windows of the endless ranks of houses abreast and
below us, and saw many a homelike little family of early birds sitting
at their breakfasts. New views and new aspects of London were about me;
the mighty city seemed to spread farther and wider in the clear morning
air than it had ever done before. There is something awe-inspiring about
the mere look of the figures that express the population of London when
one comes to set them down in a good large hand--4,000,000! It takes a
body’s breath away, almost.

We presently left the city behind. We had started drowsy, but we did not
stay so. How could we, with the brilliant sunshine pouring down, the
balmy wind blowing through the open windows, and the Garden of Eden
spread all abroad? We swept along through rolling expanses of growing
grain--not a stone or a stump to mar their comeliness, not an unsightly
fence or an ill-kept hedge; through broad meadows covered with fresh
green grass as clean swept as if a broom had been at work there--little
brooks wandering up and down them, noble trees here and there, cows in
the shade, groves in the distance and church spires projecting out of
them; and there were the quaintest old-fashioned houses set in the midst
of smooth lawns or partly hiding themselves among fine old forest trees;
and there was one steep-roofed ancient cottage whose walls all around,
and whose roof, and whose chimneys, were clothed in a shining mail of
ivy leaves!--so thoroughly, indeed, that only one little patch of roof
was visible to prove that the house was not a mere house of leaves, with
glass windows in it. Imagine those dainty little homes surrounded by
flowering shrubs and bright green grass and all sorts of old trees--and
then go on and try to imagine something more bewitching.

By and by we passed Rochester, and, sure enough, right there, on the
highest ground in the town and rising imposingly up from among
clustering roofs, was the gray old castle--roofless, ruined, ragged, the
sky beyond showing clear and blue through the glassless windows, the
walls partly clad with ivy--a time-scarred, weather-beaten old pile, but
ever so picturesque and ever so majestic, too. There it was, a whole
book of English history. I had read of Rochester Castle a thousand
times, but I had never really believed there was any such building
before.

Presently we reached the sea and came to a stand far out on a pier; and
here was Dover and more history. The chalk cliffs of England towered up
from the shore and the French coast was visible. On the tallest hill sat
Dover Castle, stately and spacious and superb, looking just as it has
always looked any time these ten or fifteen thousand years--I do not
know its exact age, and it does not matter, anyway.

We stepped aboard the little packet and steamed away. The sea was
perfectly smooth, and painfully brilliant in the sunshine. There were no
curiosities in the vessel except the passengers and a placard in French
setting forth the transportation fares for various kinds of people. The
lithographer probably considered that placard a triumph. It was printed
in green, blue, red, black, and yellow; no individual line in one color,
even the individual letters were separately colored. For instance, the
first letter of a word would be blue, the next red, the next green, and
so on. The placard looked as if it had the smallpox or something. I
inquired the artist’s name and place of business, intending to hunt him
up and kill him when I had time; but no one could tell me. In the list
of prices first-class passengers were set down at fifteen shillings and
four pence, and dead bodies at one pound ten shillings and eight
pence--just double price! That is Belgian morals, I suppose. I never say
a harsh thing unless I am greatly stirred; but in my opinion the man who
would take advantage of a dead person would do almost any odious thing.
I publish this scandalous discrimination against the most helpless class
among us in order that people intending to die abroad may come back by
some other line.

We skimmed over to Ostend in four hours and went ashore. The first
gentleman we saw happened to be the flag lieutenant of the fleet, and he
told me where the _Lively_ lay, and said she would sail about six in the
morning. Heavens and earth. He said he would give my letter to the
proper authority, and so we thanked him and bore away for the hotel.
Bore away is good sailor phraseology, and I have been at sea portions of
two days now. I easily pick up a foreign language.

Ostend is a curious, comfortable-looking, massively built town, where
the people speak both the French and the Flemish with exceeding fluency,
and yet I could not understand them in either tongue. But I will write
the rest about Ostend in to-morrow’s letter.

We idled about this curious Ostend the remainder of the afternoon and
far into the long-lived twilight, apparently to amuse ourselves, but
secretly I had a deeper motive. I wanted to see if there was anything
here that might “impress the Shah.” In the end I was reassured and
content. If Ostend could impress him, England could amaze the head clear
off his shoulders and have marvels left that not even the trunk could be
indifferent to.

These citizens of Flanders--Flounders, I think they call them, though I
feel sure I have eaten a creature of that name or seen it in an aquarium
or a menagerie, or in a picture or somewhere--are a thrifty, industrious
race, and are as commercially wise and farsighted as they were in Edward
the Third’s time, and as enduring and patient under adversity as they
were in Charles the Bold’s. They are prolific in the matter of children;
in some of the narrow streets every house seemed to have had a freshet
of children, which had burst through and overflowed into the roadway.
One could hardly get along for the pack of juveniles, and they were all
soiled and all healthy. They all wore wooden shoes, which clattered
noisily on the stone pavements. All the women were hard at work; there
were no idlers about the houses. The men were away at labor, no doubt.
In nearly every door women sat at needlework or something of that
marketable nature--they were knitting principally. Many groups of women
sat in the street, in the shade of walls, making point lace. The lace
maker holds a sort of pillow on her knees with a strip of cardboard
fastened on it, on which the lace pattern has been punctured. She sticks
bunches of pins in the punctures and about them weaves her web of
threads. The numberless threads diverge from the bunch of pins like the
spokes of a wheel, and the spools from which the threads are being
unwound form the outer circle of the wheel. The woman throws these
spools about her with flying fingers, in and out, over and under one
another, and so fast that you can hardly follow the evolutions with your
eyes. In the chaos and confusion of skipping spools you wonder how she
can possibly pick up the right one every time, and especially how she
can go on gossiping with her friends all the time and yet never seem to
miss a stitch. The laces these ingenious Flounders were making were very
dainty and delicate in texture and very beautiful in design.

Most of the shops in Ostend seemed devoted to the sale of sea shells.
All sorts of figures of men and women were made of shells; one sort was
composed of grotesque and ingenious combinations of lobster claws in the
human form. And they had other figures made of stuffed frogs--some
fencing, some barbering each other, and some were not to be described at
all without indecent language. It must require a barbarian nature to be
able to find humor in such nauseating horrors as these last. These
things were exposed in the public windows where young girls and little
children could see them, and in the shops sat the usual hairy-lipped
young woman waiting to sell them.

There was a contrivance attached to the better class of houses which I
had heard of before, but never seen. It was an arrangement of mirrors
outside the window, so contrived that the people within could see who
was coming either up or down the street--see all that might be going on,
in fact--without opening the window or twisting themselves into
uncomfortable positions in order to look.

A capital thing to watch for unwelcome (or welcome) visitors with, or to
observe pageants in cold or rainy weather. People in second and third
stories had, also, another mirror which showed who was passing
underneath.

The dining room at our hotel was very spacious and rather gorgeous. One
end of it was composed almost entirely of a single pane of plate glass,
some two inches thick--for this is the plate-glass manufacturing region,
you remember. It was very clear and fine. If one were to enter the place
in such a way as not to catch the sheen of the glass, he would suppose
that the end of the house was wide open to the sun and the storms. A
strange boyhood instinct came strongly upon me, and I could not really
enjoy my dinner, I wanted to break that glass so badly. I have no doubt
that every man feels so, and I know that such a glass must be simply
torture to a boy.

This dining room’s walls were almost completely covered with large oil
paintings in frames.

It was an excellent hotel; the utmost care was taken that everything
should go right. I went to bed at ten and was called at eleven to “take
the early train.” I said I was not the one, so the servant stirred up
the next door and he was not the one; then the next door and the
next--no success--and so on till the reverberations of the knocking were
lost in the distance down the hall, and I fell asleep again. They called
me at twelve to take another early train, but I said I was not the one
again, and asked as a favor that they would be particular to call the
rest next time, but never mind me. However, they could not understand my
English; they only said something in reply to signify that, and then
went on banging up the boarders, none of whom desired to take the early
train.

When they called me at one, it made my rest seem very broken, and I said
if they would skip me at two I would call myself--not really intending
to do it, but hoping to beguile the porter and deceive him. He probably
suspected that and was afraid to trust me, because when he made his
rounds at that hour he did not take any chances on me, but routed me out
along with the others. I got some more sleep after that, but when the
porter called me at three I felt depressed and jaded and greatly
discouraged. So I gave it up and dressed myself. The porter got me a cup
of coffee and kept me awake while I drank it. He was a good,
well-meaning sort of Flounder, but really a drawback to the hotel, I
should think.

Poor Mr. Blank came in then, looking worn and old. He had been called
for all the different trains, too, just as I had. He said it was a good
enough hotel, but they took too much pains. While we sat there talking
we fell asleep and were called again at four. Then we went out and dozed
about town till six, and then drifted aboard the _Lively_.

She was trim and bright, and clean and smart; she was as handsome as a
picture. The sailors were in brand-new man-of-war costume, and plenty of
officers were about the decks in the state uniform of the
service--cocked hats, huge epaulettes, claw-hammer coats lined with
white silk--hats and coats and trousers all splendid with gold lace. I
judged that these were all admirals, and so got afraid and went ashore
again. Our vessel was to carry the Shah’s brother, also the Grand
Vizier, several Persian princes, who were uncles to the Shah, and other
dignitaries of more or less consequence. A vessel alongside was to carry
the luggage, and a vessel just ahead (the _Vigilant_) was to carry
nobody but just the Shah and certain Ministers of State and servants and
the Queen’s special ambassador, Sir Henry Rawlinson, who is a Persian
scholar and talks to the Shah in his own tongue.

I was very glad, for several reasons, to find that I was not to go in
the same ship with the Shah. First, with him not immediately under my
eye I would feel less responsibility for him; and, secondly, as I was
anxious to impress him, I wanted to practice on his brother first.

                          THE SHAH’S QUARTERS

On the afterdeck of the _Vigilant_--very handsome ship--a temporary
cabin had been constructed for the sole and special use of the Shah,
temporary but charmingly substantial and graceful and pretty. It was
about thirty feet long and twelve wide, beautifully gilded, decorated
and painted within and without. Among its colors was a shade of light
green, which reminds me of an anecdote about the Persian party, which I
will speak of in to-morrow’s letter.

It was getting along toward the time for the Shah to arrive from
Brussels, so I ranged up alongside my own ship. I do not know when I
ever felt so ill at ease and undecided. It was a sealed letter which I
had brought from the Admiralty, and I could not guess what the purport
of it might be. I supposed I was intended to command the ship--that is,
I had supposed it at first, but, after seeing all those splendid
officers, I had discarded that idea. I cogitated a good deal, but to no
purpose. Presently a regiment of Belgian troops arrived and formed in
line along the pier. Then a number of people began to spread down
carpets for fifty yards along the pier, by the railway track, and other
carpets were laid from these to the ships. The gangway leading on board
my ship was now carpeted and its railings were draped with
bright-colored signal flags. It began to look as if I was expected; so I
walked on board. A sailor immediately ran and stopped me, and made
another sailor bring a mop for me to wipe my feet on, lest I might soil
the deck, which was wonderfully clean and nice. Evidently I was not the
person expected, after all. I pointed to the group of officers and asked
the sailor what the naval law would do to a man if he were to go and
speak to some of those admirals--for there was an awful air of etiquette
and punctilio about the premises; but just then one of those officers
came forward and said that if his instinct was correct an Admiralty
order had been received giving me a passage in the ship; and he also
said that he was the first lieutenant, and that I was very welcome and
he would take pains to make me feel at home, and furthermore there was
champagne and soda waiting down below; and furthermore still, all the
London correspondents, to the number of six or seven, would arrive from
Brussels with the Shah, and would go in our ship, and if our passage
were not a lively one, and a jolly and enjoyable one, it would be a very
strange thing indeed. I could have jumped for joy if I had not been
afraid of breaking some rule of naval etiquette and getting hanged for
it.

Now the train was signaled, and everybody got ready for the great event.
The Belgian regiment straightened itself up, and some two hundred
Flounders arrived and took conspicuous position on a little mound. I was
a little afraid that this would impress the Shah; but I was soon
occupied with other interests. The train of thirteen cars came tearing
in, and stopped abreast the ships. Music and guns began an uproar.
Odd-looking Persian faces and felt hats (brimless stovepipes) appeared
at the car windows.

Some gorgeous English officials fled down the carpet from the
_Vigilant_. They stopped at a long car with the royal arms upon it,
uncovered their heads, and unlocked the car door. Then the Shah stood up
in it and gave us a good view. He was a handsome, strong-featured man,
with a rather European fairness of complexion; had a mustache, wore
spectacles, seemed of a good height and graceful build and carriage, and
looked about forty or a shade less. He was very simply dressed--brimless
stovepipe and close-buttoned dark-green military suit, without ornament.
No, not wholly without ornament, for he had a band two inches wide worn
over his shoulder and down across his breast, scarf fashion, which band
was one solid glory of fine diamonds.

A Persian official appeared in the Shah’s rear and enveloped him in an
ample quilt--or cloak, if you please--which was lined with fur. The
outside of it was of a whitish color and elaborately needle-worked in
Persian patterns like an India shawl. The Shah stepped out and the
official procession formed about him and marched him down the carpet and
on board the _Vigilant_ to slow music. Not a Flounder raised a cheer.
All the small fry swarmed out of the train now.

The Shah walked back alongside his fine cabin, looking at the assemblage
of silent, solemn Flounders; the correspondent of the London _Telegraph_
was hurrying along the pier and took off his hat and bowed to the “King
of Kings,” and the King of Kings gave a polite military salute in
return. This was the commencement of the excitement. The success of the
breathless _Telegraph_ man made all the other London correspondents mad,
every man of whom flourished his stovepipe recklessly and cheered
lustily, some of the more enthusiastic varying the exercise by lowering
their heads and elevating their coat tails. Seeing all this, and feeling
that if I was to “impress the Shah” at all, now was my time, I ventured
a little squeaky yell, quite distinct from the other shouts, but just as
hearty. His Shahship heard and saw and saluted me in a manner that was,
I considered, an acknowledgment of my superior importance. I do not know
that I ever felt so ostentatious and absurd before. All the
correspondents came aboard, and then the Persian baggage came also, and
was carried across to the ship alongside of ours. When she could hold no
more we took somewhere about a hundred trunks and boxes on board our
vessel. Two boxes fell into the water, and several sailors jumped in and
saved one, but the other was lost. However, it probably contained
nothing but a few hundred pounds of diamonds and things.

At last we got under way and steamed out through a long slip, the piers
on either side being crowded with Flounders; but never a cheer. A
battery of three guns on the starboard pier boomed a royal salute, and
we swept out to sea, the _Vigilant_ in the lead, we right in her wake,
and the baggage ship in ours. Within fifteen minutes everybody was well
acquainted; a general jollification set in, and I was thoroughly glad I
had come over to fetch the Shah.

             MARK TWAIN EXECUTES HIS CONTRACT AND DELIVERS
                           THE SHAH IN LONDON

                        LONDON, _June 19, 1873_.

                          SOME PERSIAN FINERY

Leaving Ostend, we went out to sea under a clear sky and upon smooth
water--so smooth, indeed, that its surface was scarcely rippled. I say
the sky was clear, and so it was, clear and sunny; but a rich haze lay
upon the water in the distance--a soft, mellow mist, through which a
scattering sail or two loomed vaguely. One may call such a morning
perfect.

The corps of correspondents were well jaded with their railway journey,
but after champagne and soda downstairs with the officers, everybody
came up refreshed and cheery and exceedingly well acquainted all around.
The Persian grandees had meantime taken up a position in a glass house
on the afterdeck, and were sipping coffee in a grave, Oriental way. They
all had much lighter complexions and a more European cast of features
than I was prepared for, and several of them were exceedingly handsome,
fine-looking men.

They all sat in a circle on a sofa (the deckhouse being circular), and
they made a right gaudy spectacle. Their breasts were completely crusted
with gold bullion embroidery of a pattern resembling frayed and
interlacing ferns, and they had large jeweled ornaments on their breasts
also. The Grand Vizier came out to have a look around. In addition to
the sumptuous gold fernery on his breast he wore a jeweled star as large
as the palm of my hand, and about his neck hung the Shah’s miniature,
reposing in a bed of diamonds, that gleamed and flashed in a wonderful
way when touched by the sunlight. It was said that to receive the Shah’s
portrait from the Shah was the highest compliment that could be
conferred upon a Persian subject. I did not care so much about the
diamonds, but I would have liked to have the portrait very much. The
Grand Vizier’s sword hilt and the whole back of the sheath from end to
end were composed of a neat and simple combination of some twelve or
fifteen thousand emeralds and diamonds.

                     “IMPRESSING” A PERSIAN GENERAL

Several of the Persians talked French and English. One of them, who was
said to be a general, came up on the bridge where some of us were
standing, pointed to a sailor, and asked me if I could tell him what
that sailor was doing?

I said he was communicating with the other ships by means of the optical
telegraph--that by using the three sticks the whole alphabet could be
expressed. I showed him how A, B and C were made, and so forth. Good!
This Persian was “impressed”! He showed it by his eyes, by his gestures,
by his manifest surprise and delight. I said to myself, if the Shah were
only here now, the grand desire of Great Britain could be accomplished.
The general immediately called the other grandees and told them about
this telegraphic wonder. Then he said:

“Now does everyone on board acquire this knowledge?”

“No, only the officers.”

“And this sailor?”

“He is only the signalman. Two or three sailors on board are detailed
for this service, and by order and direction of the officers they
communicate with the other ships.”

“Very good! very fine! Very great indeed!”

These men were unquestionably impressed. I got the sailor to bring the
signal book, and the matter was fully explained, to their high
astonishment; also the flag signals, and likewise the lamp signals for
night telegraphing. Of course, the idea came into my head, in the first
place, to ask one of the officers to conduct this bit of instruction,
but I at once dismissed it. I judged that this would all go to the Shah,
sooner or later. I had come over on purpose to “impress the Shah,” and I
was not going to throw away my opportunity. I wished the Queen had been
there; I would have been knighted, sure. You see, they knight people
here for all sorts of things--knight them, or put them into the peerage
and make great personages of them. Now, for instance, a king comes over
here on a visit; the Lord Mayor and sheriffs do him becoming honors in
the city, and straightway the former is created a baronet and the latter
are knighted. When the Prince of Wales recovered from his illness one of
his chief physicians was made a baronet and the other was knighted.
Charles II made duchesses of one or two female acquaintances of his for
something or other--I have forgotten now what it was. A London
shoe-maker’s apprentice became a great soldier--indeed, a
Wellington--won prodigious victories in many climes and covered the
British arms with glory all through a long life; and when he was 187
years old they knighted him and made him Constable of the Tower. But he
died next year and they buried him in Westminster Abbey. There is no
telling what that man might have become if he had lived. So you see what
a chance I had; for I have no doubt in the world that I have been the
humble instrument, under Providence, of “impressing the Shah.” And I
really believe that if the Queen comes to hear of it I shall be made a
duke.

Friends intending to write will not need to be reminded that a duke is
addressed as “Your Grace”; it is considered a great offense to leave
that off.

                     A PICTURESQUE NAVAL SPECTACLE

When we were a mile or so out from Ostend conversation ceased, an
expectant look came into all faces, and opera glasses began to stand out
from above all noses. This impressive hush lasted a few minutes, and
then some one said:

“There they are!”

“Where?”

“Away yonder ahead--straight ahead.”

Which was true. Three huge shapes smothered in the haze--the _Vanguard_,
the _Audacious_, and the _Devastation_--all great ironclads. They were
to do escort duty. The officers and correspondents gathered on the
forecastle and waited for the next act. A red spout of fire issued from
the _Vanguard’s_ side, another flashed from the _Audacious_. Beautiful
these red tongues were against the dark haze. Then there was a long
pause--ever so long a pause and not a sound, not the suspicion of a
sound; and now, out of the stillness, came a deep, solemn “boom! boom!”
It had not occurred to me that at so great a distance I would not hear
the report as soon as I saw the flash. The two crimson jets were very
beautiful, but not more so than the rolling volumes of white smoke that
plunged after them, rested a moment over the water, and then went
wreathing and curling up among the webbed rigging and the tall masts,
and left only glimpses of these things visible, high up in the air,
projecting as if from a fog.

Now the flashes came thick and fast from the black sides of both
vessels. The muffled thunders of the guns mingled together in one
continued roll, the two ships were lost to sight, and in their places
two mountains of tumbled smoke rested upon the motionless water, their
bases in the hazy twilight and their summits shining in the sun. It was
good to be there and see so fine a spectacle as that.

                            THE NAVAL SALUTE

We closed up fast upon the ironclads. They fell apart to let our
flotilla come between, and as the _Vigilant_ ranged up the rigging of
the ironclads was manned to salute the Shah. And, indeed, that was
something to see. The shrouds, from the decks clear to the trucks, away
up toward the sky, were black with men. On the lower rounds of these
rope ladders they stood five abreast, holding each other’s hands, and so
the tapering shrouds formed attenuated pyramids of humanity, six
pyramids of them towering into the upper air, and clear up on the top of
each dizzy mast stood a little creature like a clothes pin--a mere black
peg against the sky--and that mite was a sailor waving a flag like a
postage stamp. All at once the pyramids of men burst into a cheer, and
followed it with two more, given with a will; and if the Shah was not
impressed he must be the offspring of a mummy.

And just at this moment, while we all stood there gazing---

However breakfast was announced and I did not wait to see.

                     THE THIRTY-FOUR-TON GUNS SPEAK

If there is one thing that is pleasanter than another it is to take
breakfast in the wardroom with a dozen naval officers. Of course, that
awe-inspiring monarch, the captain, is aft, keeping frozen state with
the Grand Viziers when there are any on board, and so there is nobody in
the wardroom to maintain naval etiquette. As a consequence none is
maintained. One officer, in a splendid uniform, snatches a champagne
bottle from a steward and opens it himself; another keeps the servants
moving; another opens soda; everybody eats, drinks, shouts, laughs in
the most unconstrained way, and it does seem a pity that ever the thing
should come to an end. No individual present seemed sorry he was not in
the ship with the Shah. When the festivities had been going on about an
hour, some tremendous booming was heard outside. Now here was a question
between duty and broiled chicken. What might that booming mean? Anguish
sat upon the faces of the correspondents. I watched to see what they
would do, and the precious moments were flying. Somebody cried down a
companionway:

“The _Devastation_ is saluting!”

The correspondents tumbled over one another, over chairs, over
everything in their frenzy to get on deck, and the last gun reverberated
as the last heel disappeared on the stairs. The _Devastation_, the pride
of England, the mightiest war vessel afloat, carrying guns that outweigh
any metal in any service, it is said (thirty-five tons each), and these
boys had missed that spectacle--at least I knew that some of them had. I
did not go. Age has taught me wisdom. If a spectacle is going to be
particularly imposing I prefer to see it through somebody else’s eyes,
because that man will always exaggerate. Then I can exaggerate his
exaggeration, and my account of the thing will be the most impressive.

But I felt that I had missed my figure this time, because I was not sure
which of these gentlemen reached the deck in time for a glimpse and
which didn’t. And this morning I cannot tell by the London papers. They
all have imposing descriptions of that thing, and no one of them
resembles another. Mr. X’s is perhaps the finest, but he was singing a
song about “Spring, Spring, Gentle Spring,” all through the bombardment,
and was overexcited, I fear.

The next best was Mr. Y’s; but he was telling about how he took a
Russian battery, along with another man, during the Crimean War, and he
was not fairly through the story till the salute was over, though I
remember he went up and saw the smoke. I will not frame a description of
the _Devastation’s_ salute, for I have no material that I can feel sure
is reliable.

                      THE GRAND SPECTACULAR CLIMAX

When we first sailed away from Ostend I found myself in a dilemma; I had
no notebook. But “any port in a storm,” as the sailors say. I found a
fair, full pack of ordinary playing cards in my overcoat pocket--one
always likes to have something along to amuse children with--and really
they proved excellent to take notes on, although bystanders were a bit
inclined to poke fun at them and ask facetious questions. But I was
content; I made all the notes I needed. The aces and low “spot” cards
are very good indeed to write memoranda on, but I will not recommend the
Kings and Jacks.

                         SPEAKING BY THE CARDS

Referring to the seven of hearts, I find that this naval exhibition and
journey from Ostend to Dover is going to cost the government £500,000.
Got it from a correspondent. It is a round sum.

Referring to the ace of diamonds, I find that along in the afternoon we
sighted a fresh fleet of men-of-war coming to meet us. The rest of the
diamonds, down to the eight spot (nines and tens are no good for notes)
are taken up with details of that spectacle. Most of the clubs and
hearts refer to matters immediately following that, but I really can
hardly do anything with them because I have forgotten what was trumps.

                             THE SPECTACLE

But never mind. The sea scene grew little by little, until presently it
was very imposing. We drew up into the midst of a waiting host of
vessels. Enormous five-masted men-of-war, great turret ships, steam
packets, pleasure yachts--every sort of craft, indeed--the sea was thick
with them; the yards and riggings of the warships loaded with men, the
packets crowded with people, the pleasure ships rainbowed with brilliant
flags all over and over--some with flags strung thick on lines
stretching from bowsprit to foremast, thence to mainmast, thence to
mizzenmast, and thence to stern. All the ships were in motion--gliding
hither and thither, in and out, mingling and parting--a bewildering
whirl of flash and color. Our leader, the vast, black, ugly, but very
formidable _Devastation_, plowed straight through the gay throng, our
Shah-ships following, the lines of big men-of-war saluting, the booming
of the guns drowning the cheering, stately islands of smoke towering
everywhere. And so, in this condition of unspeakable grandeur, we swept
into the harbor of Dover, and saw the English princes and the long ranks
of red-coated soldiers waiting on the pier, civilian multitudes behind
them, the lofty hill front by the castle swarming with spectators, and
there was the crash of cannon and a general hurrah all through the air.
It was rather a contrast to silent Ostend and the unimpressible
Flanders.

                      THE SHAH “IMPRESSED” AT LAST

The Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Arthur received the Shah in state, and
then all of us--princes, Shahs, ambassadors, Grand Viziers and newspaper
correspondents--climbed aboard the train and started off to London just
like so many brothers.

From Dover to London it was a sight to see. Seventy miles of human
beings in a jam--the gaps were not worth mentioning--and every man,
woman, and child waving hat or handkerchief and cheering. I
wondered--could not tell--could not be sure--could only wonder--would
this “impress the Shah”? I would have given anything to know. But--well,
it ought--but--still one could not tell.

And by and by we burst into the London Railway station--a very large
station it is--and found it wonderfully decorated and all the
neighboring streets packed with cheering citizens. Would this impress
the Shah? I--I--well, I could not yet feel certain.

The Prince of Wales received the Shah--ah, you should have seen how
gorgeously the Shah was dressed now--he was like the sun in a total
eclipse of rainbows--yes, the Prince received him, put him in a grand
open carriage, got in and made him sit over further and not “crowd,” the
carriage clattered out of the station, all London fell apart on either
side and lifted a perfectly national cheer, and just at that instant the
bottom fell out of the sky and forty deluges came pouring down at once!

The great strain was over, the crushing suspense at an end. I said,
“Thank God, this will impress the Shah.”

Now came the long files of Horse Guards in silver armor. We took the
great Persian to Buckingham Palace. I never stirred till I saw the gates
open and close upon him with my own eyes and knew he was there. Then I
said:

“England, here is your Shah; take him and be happy, but don’t ever ask
me to fetch over another one.”

This contract has been pretty straining on me.

                                  III
                       THE SHAH AS A SOCIAL STAR

                        LONDON, _June 21, 1873_.


After delivering the Shah at the gates of that unsightly pile of dreary
grandeur known as Buckingham Palace I cast all responsibility for him
aside for the time being, and experienced a sense of relief and likewise
an honest pride in my success, such as no man can feel who has not had a
Shah at nurse (so to speak) for three days.

It is said by those who ought to know that when Buckingham Palace was
being fitted up as a home for the Shah one of the chief rooms was
adorned with a rich carpet which had been designed and manufactured
especially to charm the eye of His Majesty. The story goes on to say
that a couple of the Persian suite came here a week ago to see that all
things were in readiness and nothing overlooked, and that when they
reached that particular room and glanced at the lovely combination of
green figures and white ones in that carpet they gathered their robes
carefully up about their knees and then went elaborately tiptoeing about
the floor with the aspect and anxiety of a couple of cats hunting for
dry ground in a wet country, and they stepped only on the white figures
and almost fainted whenever they came near touching a green one. It is
said that the explanation is that these visiting Persians are all
Mohammedans, and green being a color sacred to the descendants of the
Prophet, and none of these people being so descended, it would be
dreadful profanation for them to defile the holy color with their feet.
And the general result of it all was that carpet had to be taken up and
is a dead loss.

Man is a singular sort of human being, after all, and his religion does
not always adorn him. Now, our religion is the right one, and has fewer
odd and striking features than any other; and yet my ancestors used to
roast Catholics and witches and warm their hands by the fire; but they
would be blanched with horror at the bare thought of breaking the
Sabbath, and here is a Persian monarch who never sees any impropriety in
chopping a subject’s head off for the mere misdemeanor of calling him
too early for breakfast, and yet would be consumed with pious remorse if
unheeding foot were to chance to step upon anything so green as you or
I, my reader.

Oriental peoples say that women have no souls to save and, almost
without my memory, many American Protestants said the same of babies. I
thought there was a wide gulf between the Persians and ourselves, but I
begin to feel that they are really our brothers after all.

After a day’s rest the Shah went to Windsor Castle and called on the
Queen. What that suggests to the reader’s mind is this:--That the Shah
took a hand satchel and an umbrella, called a cab and said he wanted to
go to the Paddington station; that when he arrived there the driver
charged him sixpence too much, and he paid it rather than have trouble;
that he tried now to buy a ticket, and was answered by a ticket seller
as surly as a hotel clerk that he was not selling tickets for that train
yet; that he finally got his ticket, and was beguiled of his satchel by
a railway porter at once, who put it into a first-class carriage and got
a sixpence, which the company forbids him to receive; that presently
when the guard (or conductor) of the train came along the Shah slipped a
shilling into his hand and said he wanted to smoke, and straightway the
guard signified that it was all right; that when the Shah arrived at
Windsor Castle he rang the bell, and when the girl came to the door
asked her if the Queen was at home, and she left him standing in the
hall and went to see; that by and by she returned and said would he
please sit down in the front room and Mrs. Guelph would be down
directly; that he hung his hat on the hatrack, stood his umbrella up in
the corner, entered the front room and sat down on a haircloth chair;
that he waited and waited and got tired; that he got up and examined the
old piano, the depressing lithographs on the walls and the album of
photographs of faded country relatives on the center table, and was just
about to fall back on the family Bible when the Queen entered briskly
and begged him to sit down and apologized for keeping him waiting, but
she had just got a new girl and everything was upside down, and so forth
and so on; but how are the family, and when did he arrive, and how long
should he stay and why didn’t he bring his wife. I knew that that was
the picture which would spring up in the American reader’s mind when it
was said the Shah went to visit the Queen, because that was the picture
which the announcement suggested to my own mind.

But it was far from the facts, very far. Nothing could be farther. In
truth, these people made as much of a to do over a mere friendly call as
anybody else would over a conflagration. There were special railway
trains for the occasion; there was a general muster of princes and dukes
to go along, each one occupying room 40; there were regiments of cavalry
to clear the way; railway stations were turned into flower gardens,
sheltered with flags and all manner of gaudy splendor; there were
multitudes of people to look on over the heads of interminable ranks of
policemen standing shoulder to shoulder and facing front; there was
braying of music and booming of cannon. All that fuss, in sober truth,
over a mere off-hand friendly call. Imagine what it would have been if
he had brought another shirt and was going to stay a month.

                            AT THE GUILDHALL

Truly, I am like to suffocate with astonishment at the things that are
going on around me here. It is all odd, it is all queer enough, I can
tell you; but last night’s work transcends anything I ever heard of in
the way of--well, how shall I express it? how can I word it? I find it
awkward to get at it. But to say it in a word--and it is a true one,
too, as hundreds and hundreds of people will testify--last night the
Corporation of the City of London, with a simplicity and ignorance which
almost rise to sublimity, actually gave a ball to a Shah who does not
dance. If I would allow myself to laugh at a cruel mistake, this would
start me. It is the oddest thing that has happened since I have had
charge of the Shah. There is some excuse for it in the fact that the
Aldermen of London are simply great and opulent merchants, and cannot be
expected to know much about the ways of high life--but then they could
have asked some of us who have been with the Shah.

The ball was a marvel in its way. The historical Guildhall was a scene
of great magnificence. There was a high dais at one end, on which were
three state chairs under a sumptuous canopy; upon the middle one sat the
Shah, who was almost a Chicago conflagration of precious stones and gold
bullion lace. Among other gems upon his breast were a number of emeralds
of marvelous size, and from a loop hung an historical diamond of great
size and wonderful beauty. On the right of the Shah sat the Princess of
Wales, and on his left the wife of the Crown Prince of Russia. Grouped
about the three stood a full jury of minor princes, princesses, and
ambassadors hailing from many countries.

                            THE TWO CORRALS

The immense hall was divided in the middle by a red rope. The Shah’s
division was sacred to blue blood, and there was breathing room there;
but the other corral was but a crush of struggling and perspiring
humanity. The place was brilliant with gas and was a rare spectacle in
the matter of splendid costumes and rich coloring. The lofty
stained-glass windows, pictured with celebrated episodes in the history
of the ancient city, were lighted from the outside, and one may imagine
the beauty of the effect. The great giants, Gog and Magog (whose origin
and history, curiously enough, are unknown even to tradition), looked
down from the lofty gallery, but made no observation. Down the long
sides of the hall, with but brief spaces between, were imposing groups
of marble statuary; and, contrasted with the masses of life and color
about them, they made a picturesque effect. The groups were statues (in
various attitudes) of the Duke of Wellington. I do not say this
knowingly, but only supposingly; but I never have seen a statue in
England yet that represented anybody but the Duke of Wellington, and, as
for the streets and terraces and courts and squares that are named after
him or after selections from his 797 titles, they are simply beyond the
grasp of arithmetic. This reminds me that, having named everything after
Wellington that there was left to name in England (even down to
Wellington boots), our British brothers, still unsatisfied, still
oppressed with adulation, blandly crossed over and named our Californian
big trees Wellington, and put it in Latin at that. They did that, calmly
ignoring the fact that we, the discoverers and owners of the trees, had
long ago named them after a larger man. However, if the ghost of
Wellington enjoys such a proceeding, possibly the ghost of Washington
will not greatly trouble itself about the matter. But what really
disturbs me is that, while Wellington is justly still in the fashion
here, Washington is fading out of the fashion with us. It is not a good
sign. The idols we have raised in his stead are not to our honor.

Some little dancing was done in the sacred corral in front of the Shah
by grandees belonging mainly to “grace-of-God” families, but he himself
never agitated a foot. The several thousand commoner people on the other
side of the rope could not dance any more than sardines in a box.
Chances to view the Guildhall spectacle were so hungered for that people
offered £5 for the privilege of standing three minutes in the musicians’
gallery and were refused. I cannot convey to you an idea of the
inordinate desire which prevails here to see the Shah better than by
remarking that speculators who held four-seat opera boxes at Covent
Garden Theater to-night were able to get $250 for them. Had all the
seats been sold at auction the opera this evening would have produced
not less than one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars in gold! I am
below the figures rather than above them. The greatest house (for money)
that America ever saw was gathered together upon the occasion of Jenny
Lind’s first concert at Castle Garden. The seats were sold at auction
and produced something over twenty thousand dollars.

I am by no means trying to describe the Guildhall affair of last night.
Such a crush of titled swells; such a bewildering array of jeweled
uniforms and brilliant feminine costumes; such solemn and awful
reception ceremonies in the library; such grim and stately imposing
addresses and Persian replies; such imposing processional pageantry
later on; such depressing dancing before the apathetic Shah; such ornate
tables and imperial good cheer at the banquet--it makes a body tired to
merely think of trying to put all that on paper. Perhaps you, sir, will
be good enough to imagine it, and thus save one who respects you and
honors you five columns of solid writing.

              THE LUNATIC ASYLUM IS BLESSED WITH A GLIMPSE

As regards the momentous occasion of the opera, this evening, I found
myself in a grievous predicament, for a republican. The tickets were all
sold long ago, so I must either go as a member of the royal family or
not at all. After a good deal of reflection it seemed best not to mix up
with that class lest a political significance might be put upon it. But
a queer arrangement had been devised whereby I might have a glimpse of
the show, and I took advantage of that. There is an immense barn-like
glass house attached to the rear of the theater, and that was fitted up
with seats, carpets, mirrors, gas, columns, flowers, garlands, and a
meager row of shrubs strung down the sides on brackets--to create an
imposing forest effect, I suppose. The place would seat ten or twelve
hundred people. All but a hundred paid a dollar and a quarter a
seat--for what? To look at the Shah three quarters of a minute, while he
walked through to enter the theater. The remaining hundred paid $11 a
seat for the same privilege, with the added luxury of rushing on the
stage and glancing at the opera audience for one single minute
afterward, while the chorus sung “God Save the Queen!” We are all gone
mad, I do believe. Eleven hundred five-shilling lunatics and a hundred
two-guinea maniacs. The _Herald_ purchased a ticket and created me one
of the latter, along with two or three more of the staff.

Our cab was about No. 17,342 in the string that worked its slow way
through London and past the theater. The Shah was not to come till nine
o’clock, and yet we had to be at the theater by half past six, or we
would not get into the glass house at all, they said. We were there on
time, and seated in a small gallery which overlooked a very brilliantly
dressed throng of people. Every seat was occupied. We sat there two
hours and a half gazing and melting. The wide, red-carpeted central
aisle below offered good display ground for officials in fine uniforms,
and they made good use of it.

                            ROYALTY ARRIVES

By and by a band in showy uniform came in and stood opposite the
entrance. At the end of a tedious interval of waiting trumpets sounded
outside, there was some shouting, the band played half of “God Save the
Queen,” and then the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and a dozen gorgeous
Persian officials entered. After a little the young Prince Arthur came,
in a blue uniform, with a whole broadside of gold and silver medals on
his breast--for good behavior, punctuality, accurate spelling,
penmanship, etc., I suppose, but I could not see the inscriptions. The
band gave him some bars of “God Save the Queen,” too, while he stood
under us talking, with altogether unroyal animation, with the
Persians--the crowd of people staring hungrily at him the while--country
cousins, maybe, who will go home and say, “I was as close to him as I am
to that chair this minute.”

Then came the Duke of Teck and the Princess Mary, and the band
God-Save-the-Queen’d them also. Now came the Prince of Wales and the
Russian Tsarina--the royal anthem again, with an extra blast at the end
of it. After them came a young, handsome, mighty giant, in showy
uniform, his breast covered with glittering orders, and a general’s
chapeau, with a flowing white plume, in his hand--the heir to all the
throne of all the Russias. The band greeted him with the Russian
national anthem, and played it clear through. And they did right; for
perhaps it is not risking too much to say that this is the only national
air in existence that is really worthy of a great nation.

And at last came the long-expected millennium himself, His Imperial
Majesty the Shah, with the charming Princess of Wales on his arm. He had
all his jewels on, and his diamond shaving brush in his hat front. He
shone like a window with the westering sun on it.

                          WHAT THE ASYLUM SAW

The small space below us was full now--it could accommodate no more
royalty. The august procession filed down the aisle in double rank, the
Shah and the Princess of Wales in the lead, and cheers broke forth and a
waving of handkerchiefs as the Princess passed--all said this
demonstration was meant for her. As the procession disappeared through
the farther door, the hundred eleven-dollar maniacs rushed through a
small aperture, then through an anteroom, and gathered in a flock on the
stage, the chorus striking up “God Save the Queen” at the same moment.

We stood in a mighty bandbox, or a Roman coliseum, with a sea of faces
stretching far away over the ground floor, and above them rose five
curving tiers of gaudy humanity, the dizzy upper tier in the far
distance rising sharply up against the roof, like a flower garden trying
to hold an earthquake down and not succeeding. It was a magnificent
spectacle, and what with the roaring of the chorus, the waving of
handkerchiefs, the cheering of the people, the blazing gas, and the
awful splendor of the long file of royalty, standing breast to breast in
the royal box, it was wonderfully exhilarating, not to say exciting.

The chorus sang only three-quarters of a minute--one stanza--and down
came the huge curtain and shut out the fairyland. And then all those
eleven-dollar people hunted their way out again.

                           A NATION DEMENTED

We are certainly gone mad. We scarcely look at the young colossus who is
to reign over 70,000,000 of people and the mightiest empire in extent
which exists to-day. We have no eyes but for this splendid barbarian,
who is lord over a few deserts and a modest ten million of
ragamuffins--a man who has never done anything to win our gratitude or
excite our admiration, except that he managed to starve a million of his
subjects to death in twelve months. If he had starved the rest I suppose
we would set up a monument to him now.

The London theaters are almost absolutely empty these nights. Nobody
goes, hardly. The managers are being ruined. The streets for miles are
crammed with people waiting whole long hours for a chance glimpse of the
Shah. I never saw any man “draw” like this one.

Is there any truth in the report that your bureaus are trying to get the
Shah to go over there and lecture? He could get $100,000 a night here
and choose his own subject.

I know a showman who has got a pill that belonged to him, and which for
some reason he did not take. That showman will not take any money for
that pill. He is going to travel with it. And let me tell you he will
get more engagements than he can fill in a year.

                  MARK TWAIN HOOKS THE PERSIAN OUT OF
                          THE ENGLISH CHANNEL

                        LONDON, _June 26, 1873_.

I suppose I am the only member of the Shah’s family who is not wholly
broken down and worn out; and, to tell the truth, there is not much of
me left. If you have ever been limited to four days in Paris or Rome or
Jerusalem and been “rushed” by a guide you can form a vague, far-away
sort of conception of what the Shah and the rest of us have endured
during these late momentous days. If this goes on we may as well get
ready for the imperial inquest.

When I was called at five o’clock the other morning to go to Portsmouth,
and remembered that the Shah’s incessant movements had left me only
three hours’ sleep that night, nothing but a sense of duty drove me
forth. A cab could not be found, nor a carriage in all London. I lost an
hour and a half waiting and trying, then started on foot and lost my
way; consequently I missed one train by a good while, another one by
three minutes, and then had more than half an hour to spare before
another would go. Most people had had a similar experience, and there
was comfort in that. We started at last, and were more than three hours
going seventy-two miles. We stopped at no stations, hardly, but we
halted every fifteen minutes out in the woods and fields for no purpose
that we could discover. Never was such an opportunity to look at
scenery. There were five strangers in our car, or carriage, as the
English call it, and by degrees their English reserve thawed out and
they passed around their sherry and sandwiches and grew sociable.

One of them had met the Russian General of Police in St. Petersburg, and
found him a queer old simple-hearted soldier, proud of his past and
devoted to his master, the present Tsar, and to the memory of his
predecessor, Nicholas. The English gentleman gave an instance of the old
man’s simplicity which one would not expect in a chief of police. The
general had been visiting London and been greatly impressed by two
things there--the admirable police discipline and the museum. It
transpired that the museum he referred to was not that mighty collection
of marvels known to all the world as the British Museum, but Mme.
Toussaud’s Waxworks Show; and in this waxwork show he had seen a figure
of the Emperor Nicholas. And did it please him? Yes, as to the likeness;
for it was a good likeness and a commanding figure; but--“_Mon Dieu!_
try to fancy it, m’sieu--dressed in the uniform of a simple colonel of
infantry!--the great Nicholas of Russia, my august late master, dressed
in a colonel’s uniform!”

The old general could not abide that. He went to the proprietor and
remonstrated against this wanton indignity. The proprietor was grieved;
but it was the only Russian uniform he could get, and----

“Say no more!” said the general. “May I get you one?”

The proprietor would be most happy. The general lost not a moment; he
wrote at once to the Emperor Alexander, describing with anguish the
degradation which the late great Nicholas was suffering day by day
through his infamously clothed waxen representative, and imploring His
Majesty to send suitable raiment for the imperial dummy, and also a
letter to authenticate the raiment. And out of regard for the old
servant and respect for his outraged feelings the Emperor of all the
Russias descended from his Alpine altitude to send to the Toussaud
waxwork the general’s uniform worn last by his father, and to write with
his own hand an authenticating letter to go with it. So the
simple-hearted police chief was happy once more, and never once thought
of charging the “museum” $10,000 for these valuable additions to the
show, which he might easily have done, and collected the money, too. How
like our own chiefs of police this good old soul is!

Another of these English gentlemen told an anecdote, which, he said, was
old, but which I had not heard before. He said that one day St. Peter
and the devil chanced to be thrown together, and found it pretty dull
trying to pass the time. Finally they got to throwing dice for a lawyer.
The devil threw sixes. Then St. Peter threw sixes. The devil threw sixes
again. St. Peter threw sixes again. The devil threw sixes once more.
Then St. Peter threw sevens, and the devil said, “Oh, come now, Your
Honor, cheat fair. None of your playing miracles here!” I thought there
was a nice bit of humor in that suggestion to “cheat fair.”

                     A SMALL PRIVATE NAUTICAL RACE

I am getting to Portsmouth about as fast in this letter as I did in that
train. The Right Honorable the Mayor of Portsmouth had had a steamer
placed at his disposal by the Admiralty, and he had invited the Lord
Mayor of London and other guests to go in her. This was the ship I was
to sail in, and she was to leave her pier at 9 A.M. sharp. I arrived at
that pier at ten minutes to eleven exactly. There was one chance left,
however. The ship had stopped for something and was floating at ease
about a mile away.

A rusty, decayed, little two-oared skiff, the size of a bathtub, came
floating by, with a fisherman and his wife and child in it. I entreated
the man to come in and take me to the ship. Presently he consented and
started toward me. I stood impatient and all ready to jump the moment he
should get within thirty yards of me; he halted at the distance of
thirty-five and said it would be a long pull; did I think I could pay
him two shillings for it, seeing it was a holiday? All this palaver and
I in such a state of mind! I jumped aboard and told him to rush, which
he did; at least he threw his whole heart into his little, useless oars,
and we moved off at the rate of a mile a week. This was solid misery.
When we had gone a hundred and nine feet and were gaining on the tenth a
long, trim, graceful man-of-war’s boat came flying by, bound for the
flagship. Without expecting even the courtesy of a response, I hailed
and asked the coxswain to take me to the mayor’s vessel. He said,
“Certainly, sir!--ease her, boys!” I could not have been more astonished
at anything in the world. I quickly gave my man his two shillings, and
he started to pull me to the boat. Then there was a movement of
discontent among the sailors, and they seemed about to move on. I
thought--well, you are not such generous fellows, after all, as I took
you to be, or so polite, either; but just then the coxswain hailed and
said:

“The boys don’t mind the pull, and they’re perfectly willing to take
you, but they say they ain’t willing to take the fisherman’s job away
from him.”

Now that was genuine manliness and right conduct. I shall always
remember that honorable act. I told them the fisherman was already paid,
and I was in their boat the next moment. Then ensued the real fun of the
day, as far as I was personally concerned. The boys glanced over their
shoulders to measure the distance, and then at the order to “Give way!”
they bent to it and the boat sped through the water like an arrow. We
passed all kinds of craft and steadily shortened the distance that lay
between us and the ship. Presently the coxswain said:

“No use! Her wheels have begun to turn over. Lively now, lively!”

Then we flew. We watched the ship’s movement with a sharp interest and
calculated our chances.

“Can you steer?” said the coxswain.

“Can a duck swim?” said I.

“Good--we’ll make her yet!”

I took the helm and he the stroke oar, and that one oar did appear to
add a deal to that boat’s speed. The ship was turning around to go out
to sea, and she did seem to turn unnecessarily fast, too; but just as
she was pointed right and both her wheels began to go ahead our boat’s
bow touched her companionway and I was aboard. It was a handsome race,
and very exciting. If I could have had that dainty boat and those eight
white-shirted, blue-trousered sailors for the day I would not have gone
in any ship, but would have gone about in vast naval style and
experienced the feelings of an admiral.

                       OLD HISTORICAL MEN-OF-WAR

Our ship sailed out through a narrow way, bordered by piers that swarmed
with people, and likewise by prodigious men-of-war of the fashion of a
hundred years ago. There were, perhaps, a dozen of the stately veterans,
these relics of an historic past; and not looking aged and seedy,
either, but as bright and fresh as if they had been launched and painted
yesterday. They were the noblest creatures to look upon; hulls of huge
proportion and great length; four long tiers of cannon grinning from
their tall sides; vast sterns that towered into the air like the gable
end of a church; graceful bows and figureheads; masts as trim and lofty
as spires--surely no spectacle could be so imposing as a sea fight in
the old times, when such beautiful and such lordly ships as these ruled
the seas. And how it must have stirred the heart of England when a fleet
of them used to come sailing in from victory, with ruined sides and
tattered spars and sails, while bells and cannon pealed a welcome!

One of the grandest of these veterans was the very one upon whose deck
Nelson himself fell in the moment of triumph. I suppose England would
rather part with ten colonies than with that illustrious old ship. We
passed along within thirty steps of her, and I was just trying to
picture in my mind the tremendous scenes that had transpired upon her
deck upon that day, the proudest in England’s naval history, when the
venerable craft, stirred by the boom of saluting cannon, perhaps, woke
up out of her long sleep and began to vomit smoke and thunder herself,
and then she looked her own natural self again, and no doubt the spirit
of Nelson was near. Still it would have been pleasanter to be on her
decks than in front of her guns; for, as the white volumes of smoke
burst in our faces, one could not help feeling that a ball might by
accident have got mixed up with a blank cartridge, and might chip just
enough off the upper end of a man to disfigure him for life; and,
besides, the powder they use in cannon is in grains as large as billiard
chalks, and it does not all explode--suppose a few should enter one’s
system? The crash and roar of these great guns was as unsettling a sound
as I have ever heard at short range. I took off my hat and acknowledged
the salute, of course, though it seemed to me that it would have been
better manners if they had saluted the Lord Mayor, inasmuch as he was on
board.

                   THE WORLD’S GREATEST NAVY ON VIEW

We went out to the Spithead and sailed up and down there for four hours
through four long ranks of stately men-of-war--formidable ironclads they
were--the most insignificant of which would make a breakfast of a whole
fleet of Nelson’s prodigious ships and still be hungry. The show was
very fine, for there were forty-nine of the finest ironclads the world
can show, and many gunboats besides. Indeed, here in its full strength
was the finest navy in the world, and this the only time in history that
just such a spectacle has been seen, and none who saw it that day is
likely to live long enough to see its like again. The vessels were all
dressed out with flags, and all about them frolicked a bewildering host
of bannered yachts, steamers, and every imaginable sort of craft. It
would be hard to contrive a gayer scene. One of the royal yachts came
flying along presently and put the Shah on board one of the ironclads,
and then the yards of the whole fleet were manned simultaneously, and
such another booming and bellowing of great guns ensued as I cannot
possibly describe. Within two minutes the huge fleet was swallowed up in
smoke, with angry red tongues of fire darting through it here and there.
It was wonderful to look upon. Every time the _Devastation_ let off one
of her thirty-five-ton guns it seemed as if an entire London fog issued
from her side, and the report was so long coming that if she were to
shoot a man he would be dead before he heard it, and would probably go
around wondering through all eternity what it was that happened to him.
I returned to London in a great hurry by a train that was in no way
excited by it, but failed in the end and object I had in view after all,
which was to go to the grand concert at Albert Hall in honor of the
Shah. I had a strong desire to see that building filled with people
once. Albert Hall is one of the many monuments erected to the memory of
the late Prince Albert. It is a huge and costly edifice, but the
architectural design is old, not to say in some sense a plagiarism; for
there is but little originality in putting a dome on a gasometer. It is
said to seat 13,000 people, and surely that is a thing worth seeing--at
least to a man who was not at the Boston Jubilee. But no tickets were to
be had--every seat was full, they said. It was no particular matter, but
what made me mad was to come so extremely close and then miss. Indeed, I
was madder than I can express, to think that if the architect had only
planned the place to hold 13,001 I could have got in. But, after all, I
was not the only person who had occasion to feel vexed. Colonel X, a
noted man in America, bought a seat some days ago for $10 and a little
afterward met a knowing person who said the Shah would be physically
worn out before that concert night and would not be there, and
consequently nobody else; so the seat was immediately sold for $5. Then
came another knowing one, who said the Shah would unquestionably be at
the concert, so the colonel went straight and bought his ticket back
again. The temporary holder of it only charged him $250 for carrying it
around for him during the interval! The colonel was at the concert, and
took the Shah’s head clerk for the Shah all the evening. Vexation could
go no further than that.

                   MARK TWAIN GIVES THE ROYAL PERSIAN
                              A “SEND-OFF”

                        LONDON, _June 30, 1873_.

For the present we are done with the Shah in London. He is gone to the
country to be further “impressed.” After all, it would seem that he was
more moved and more genuinely entertained by the military day at Windsor
than by even the naval show at Portsmouth. It is not to be wondered at,
since he is a good deal of a soldier himself and not much of a sailor.
It has been estimated that there were 300,000 people assembled at
Windsor--some say 500,000. That was a show in itself. The Queen of
England was there; so was Windsor Castle; also an imposing array of
cavalry, artillery, and infantry. And the accessories to these several
shows were the matchless rural charms of England--a vast expanse of
green sward, walled in by venerable forest trees, and beyond them
glimpses of hills clothed in Summer vegetation. Upon such a theater a
bloodless battle was fought and an honorable victory won by trained
soldiers who have not always been carpet knights, but whose banners bear
the names of many historic fights.

England is now practically done with the Shah. True, his engagement is
not yet completed, for he is still billed to perform at one or two
places; but curiosity is becoming sated, and he will hardly draw as good
houses as heretofore. Whenever a star has to go to the provinces it is a
bad sign. The poor man is well nigh worn out with hard work. The other
day he was to have performed before the Duke of Buccleuch and was
obliged to send an excuse. Since then he failed of his engagement at the
Bank of England. He does not take rest even when he might. He has a
telegraphic apparatus in his apartments in Buckingham Palace, and it is
said that he sits up late, talking with his capital of Persia by
telegraph. He is so fascinated with the wonderful contrivance that he
cannot keep away from it. No doubt it is the only homelike thing the
exile finds in the hard, practical West, for it is the next of kin to
the enchanted carpets that figure in the romance and traditions of his
own land, and which carry the wanderer whither he will about the earth,
circumscribing the globe in the twinkling of an eye, propelled by only
the force of an unspoken wish.

                         GOSSIP ABOUT THE SHAH

This must be a dreary, unsatisfactory country to him, where one’s
desires are thwarted at every turn. Last week he woke up at three in the
morning and demanded of the Vizier on watch by his bedside that the
ballet dancers be summoned to dance before him. The Vizier prostrated
himself upon the floor and said:

“O king of kings, light of the world, source of human peace and
contentment, the glory and admiration of the age, turn away thy sublime
countenance, let not thy fateful frown wither thy slave; for behold the
dancers dwell wide asunder in the desert wastes of London, and not in
many hours could they be gathered together.”

The Shah could not even speak, he was so astounded with the novelty of
giving a command that could not be obeyed. He sat still a moment,
suffering, then wrote in his tablets these words:

“MEM.--Upon arrival in Teheran, let the Vizier have the coffin which has
just been finished for the late general of the household troops--it will
save time.”

He then got up and set his boots outside the door to be blacked and went
back to bed, calm and comfortable, making no more to-do about giving
away that costly coffin than I would about spending a couple of
shillings.

                       THE LESSON OF HIS JOURNEY

If the mountains of money spent by civilized Europe in entertaining the
Shah shall win him to adopt some of the mild and merciful ways that
prevail in Christian realms it will have been money well and wisely laid
out. If he learns that a throne may rest as firmly upon the affections
of a people as upon their fears; that charity and justice may go hand in
hand without detriment to the authority of the sovereign; that an
enlarged liberty granted to the subject need not impair the power of the
monarch; if he learns these things Persia will be the gainer by his
journey, and the money which Europe has expended in entertaining him
will have been profitably invested. That the Shah needs a hint or two in
these directions is shown by the language of the following petition,
which has just reached him from certain Parsees residing here and in
India:

                              THE PETITION

  1. A heavy and oppressive poll tax, called the Juzia, is imposed upon
  the remnant of the ancient Zoroastrian race now residing in Persia. A
  hundred years ago, when the Zoroastrian population was 30,000
  families, and comparatively well-to-do, the tax was only 250 toomans;
  now, when there are scarcely six thousand souls altogether, and
  stricken with poverty, they have to pay 800 toomans. In addition to
  the crushing effect of this tax, the government officials oppress
  these poor people in enforcing the tax.

  2. A Parsee desirous of buying landed property is obliged to pay
  twenty per cent. on the value of the property as fee to the Kazee and
  other authorities.

  3. When a Parsee dies any member of his family, no matter however
  distant, who may have previously been converted to Mohammedanism,
  claims and obtains the whole property of the deceased, to the
  exclusion of all the rightful heirs. In enforcing this claim the
  convert is backed and supported by government functionaries.

  4. When a Parsee returns to Persia from a foreign country he is
  harassed with all sorts of exactions at the various places he has to
  pass through in Persia.

  5. When any dispute arises, whether civil or criminal, between a
  Mohammedan and a Parsee, the officials invariably side with the
  former, and the testimony of one Mohammedan--no matter how false on
  its very face--receives more credit than that of a dozen or any number
  of Parsee witnesses. If a Mohammedan kills a Parsee he is only fined
  about eight toomans, or four pounds sterling; but on the contrary, if
  a Parsee wounds or murders a Mohammedan he is not only cut to pieces
  himself, but all his family and children are put to the sword, and
  sometimes all the Parsees living in the same street are harassed in a
  variety of ways. The Parsees are prevented from dressing themselves
  well and from riding a horse or donkey. No matter, even if he were ill
  and obliged to ride, he is compelled to dismount in the presence of a
  Mohammedan rider, and is forced to walk to the place of his
  destination. The Parsees are not allowed to trade in European
  articles, nor are they allowed to deal in domestic produce, as
  grocers, dyers, or oilmen, tailors, dairymen, &c., on the ground that
  their touch would pollute the articles and supplies and make them
  unfit for the use of Mohammedans.

  6. The Parsees are often insulted and abused in every way by the
  Mohammedans, and their children are stolen or forcibly taken away from
  them by the Mohammedans. These children are concealed in Mohammedan
  houses, their names are changed, and they are forced to become
  Mohammedans, and when they refuse to embrace the Mohammedan faith they
  are maltreated in various ways. When a man is forcibly converted, his
  wife and family are also forced to join him as Mohammedans. The
  Mohammedans desecrate the sacred places of worship of the Zoroastrians
  and the places for the disposal of their dead.

  7. In general the Parsees are heavily taxed in various ways, and are
  subjected to great oppression. In consequence of such persecution the
  Parsee population of Persia has, during this century, considerably
  decreased and is now so small that it consists of a few thousand
  families only. It is possible that these persecutions are practiced on
  the Zoroastrian inhabitants of Persia without the knowledge of His
  Majesty the Shah.

                       THE INGENIOUS BARON REUTER

It is whispered that the Shah’s European trip was not suggested by the
Shah himself, but by the noted telegraphic newsman, Baron Reuter. People
who pretend to know say that Reuter began life very poor; that he was an
energetic spirit and improved such opportunities as fell in his way;
that he learned several languages, and finally became a European guide,
or courier, and employed himself in conducting all sorts of foreigners
through all sorts of countries and wearing them out with the usual
frantic system of sight-seeing. That was a good education for him; it
also gave him an intimate knowledge of all the routes of travel and
taught him how certain long ones might be shortened. By and by he got
some carrier pigeons and established a news express, which necessarily
prospered, since it furnished journals and commercial people with all
matters of importance considerably in advance of the mails. When
railways came into vogue he obtained concessions which enlarged his
facilities and still enabled him to defy competition. He was ready for
the telegraph and seized that, too; and now for years

                          “REUTER’S TELEGRAMS”

has stood in brackets at the head of the telegraphic column of all
European journals. He became rich; he bought telegraph lines and built
others, purchased a second-hand German baronetcy, and finally sold out
his telegraphic property to his government for $3,000,000 and was out of
business for once. But he could not stay out.

After building himself a sort of a palace, he looked around for fresh
game, singled out the Shah of Persia and “went for him,” as the
historian Josephus phrases it. He got an enormous “concession” from him
and then conceived the admirable idea of exhibiting a Shah of Persia in
the capitals of Europe and thus advertising his concession before
needful capitalists. It was a sublimer idea than any that any showman’s
brain has ever given birth to. No Shah had ever voluntarily traveled in
Europe before; but then no Shah had ever fallen into the hands of a
European guide before.

                          THE FAT “CONCESSION”

The baron’s “concession” is a financial curiosity. It allows him the
sole right to build railways in Persia for the next seventy years; also
street railroads; gives all the land necessary, free of charge, for
double tracks and fifty or sixty yards on each side; all importations of
_material_, etc., free of duty; all the baron’s exports free of duty
also. The baron may appropriate and work all mines (except those of the
precious metals) free of charge, the Shah to have 15 per cent of the
profits. Any private mine may be “gobbled” (the Persian word is
_akbamarish_) by the baron if it has not been worked during five years
previously. The baron has the exclusive privilege of making the most of
all government forests, he giving the Shah 15 per cent of the profits
from the wood sold. After a forest is removed, the baron is to be
preferred before all other purchasers if he wants to buy the land. The
baron alone may dig wells and construct canals, and he is to own all the
land made productive by such works. The baron is empowered to raise
$30,000,000 on the capital stock for working purposes, and the Shah
agrees to pay 7 per cent interest on it; and Persia is wholly
unencumbered with debt. The Shah hands over to the baron the management
of his customs for twenty years, and the baron engages to pay for this
privilege $100,000 a year more than the Shah now receives, so the baron
means to wake up that sleepy Persian commerce. After the fifth year the
baron is to pay the Shah an additional 60 per cent of the profits, if
his head is still a portion of his person then. The baron is to have
first preference in the establishment of a bank. The baron has
preference in establishing gas, road, telegraph, mill, manufacturing,
forge, pavement, and all such enterprises. The Shah is to have 20 per
cent of the profits arising from the railways. Finally, the baron may
sell out whenever he wants to.

It is a good “concession” in its way. It seems to make the Shah say:
“Run Persia at my expense and give me a fifth of the profits.”

One’s first impulse is to envy the baron; but, after all, I do not know.
Some day, if things do not go to suit the Shah, he may say, “There is no
head I admire so much as this baron’s; bring it to me on a plate.”

                   DEPARTURE OF THE IMPERIAL CIRCUS.

We are all sorry to see the Shah leave us, and yet are glad on his
account. We have had all the fun and he all the fatigue. He would not
have lasted much longer here. I am just here reminded that the only way
whereby you may pronounce the Shah’s title correctly is by taking a
pinch of snuff. The result will be “t-Shah!”




                      A WONDERFUL PAIR OF SLIPPERS

                (WITH LETTERS CONCERNING THEM FROM MARK
                      TWAIN AND ELSIE LESLIE LYDE)

                          MARK TWAIN’S LETTER

                                            HARTFORD, _Oct. 5, ’89_.

DEAR ELSIE: The way of it was this. Away last spring, Gillette[1] and I
pooled intellects on this proposition: to get up a pleasant surprise of
some kind for you against your next visit--the surprise to take the form
of a tasteful and beautiful testimonial of some sort or other, which
should express somewhat of the love we felt for you. Together we hit
upon just the right thing--a pair of slippers. Either one of us could
have thought of a single slipper, but it took both of us to think of two
slippers. In fact, one of us did think of one slipper, and then, quick
as a flash, the other thought of the other one. It shows how wonderful
the human mind is. It is really paleontological; you give one mind a
bone, and the other one instantly divines the rest of the animal.

Gillette embroidered his slipper with astonishing facility and splendor,
but I have been a long time pulling through with mine. You see, it was
my very first attempt at art, and I couldn’t rightly get the hang of it
along at first. And then I was so busy that I couldn’t get a chance to
work at it at home, and they wouldn’t let me embroider on the cars; they
said it made the other passengers afraid. They didn’t like the light
that flared into my eye when I had an inspiration. And even the most
fair-minded people doubted me when I explained what it was I was
making--especially brakemen. Brakemen always swore at it, and carried
on, the way ignorant people do, about art. They wouldn’t take my word
that it was a slipper; they said they believed it was a snowshoe that
had some kind of a disease.

But I have pulled through, and within twenty-four hours of the time I
told you I would--day before yesterday. There ought to be a key to the
designs, but I haven’t had time to get one up. However, if you will lay
the work before you with the forecastle pointing north, I will begin at
that end and explain the whole thing, layer by layer, so that you can
understand it.

I began with that first red bar, and without ulterior design, or plan of
any sort--just as I would begin a Prince and Pauper, or any other tale.
And mind you it is the easiest and surest way; because if you invent two
or three people and turn them loose in your manuscript, something is
bound to happen to them--you can’t help it; and then it will take you
the rest of the book to get them out of the natural consequences of that
occurrence, and so, first thing you know, there’s your book all finished
up and never cost you an idea. Well, the red stripe, with a bias stitch,
naturally suggested a blue one with a perpendicular stitch, and I
slammed it in, though when it came daylight I saw it was green--which
didn’t make any difference, because green and blue are much the same,
anyway, and in fact from a purely moral point of view are regarded by
the best authorities as identical. Well, if you will notice, a blue
perpendicular stitch always suggests a ropy red involved stitch, like a
family of angle-worms trying to climb in under each other to keep
warm--it would suggest that, every time, without the author of the
slipper ever having to think about it at all.

Now at that point, young Dr. Root came in, and, of course, he was
interested in the slipper right away, because he has always had a
passion for art himself, but has never had a chance to try, because his
folks are opposed to it and superstitious about it, and have done all
they could to keep him back; and so he was eager to take a hand and see
what he could do. And it was beautiful to see him sit there and tell
Mrs. Clemens what had been happening while we were off on summer
vacation, and hold the slipper up toward the end of his nose, and forget
the sordid world, and imagine the canvas was a “subject” with a scalp
wound, and nimbly whirl in that lovely surgical stitch which you see
there--and never hesitating a moment in his talk except to say “Ouch”
when he stuck himself, and then going right on again as smooth and easy
as nothing. Yes, it was a charming spectacle. And it was real art,
too--realistic, just native untaught genius; you can see the very scalp
itself, showing through between the stitches.

Well, next I threw in that sheaf of green rods which the lictors used to
carry before the Roman consuls to lick them with when they didn’t
behave--they turned blue in the morning, but that is the way green
always acts.

The next week, after a good rest, I snowed in that sea of frothy waves,
and set that yellow thing afloat in it and those two things that are
skewered through it. It isn’t a home plate, and it isn’t a papal tiara
with the keys of St. Peter; no, it is a heart--my heart--with two arrows
stuck through it--arrows that go in blue and come out crimson--crimson
with the best drops in that heart, and gladly shed for love of you,
dear.

Now then, as you strike to the south’ard and drift along down the
starboard side, abaft the main-to’-gallant scuppers, you come to that
blue quarter-deck which runs the rest of the way aft to the jumping-off
place. In the midst of that blue you will see some big red letters--M.
T.; and west’ard, over on the port side, you will see some more red
letters--TO E. L. Aggregated, these several groups of letters signify,
Mark Twain to Elsie Leslie. And you will notice that you have a gift for
art yourself, for the southern half of the L, embroidered by yourself,
is as good as anything I can do, after all my experience.

There, now you understand the whole work. From a professional point of
view I consider the Heart and Arrows by all odds the greatest triumph
of the whole thing; in fact, one of the ablest examples of civil
engineering in a beginner I ever saw--for it was all inspiration, just
the lightninglike inspiration of the moment. I couldn’t do it again in
a hundred years--even if I recover this time and get just as well and
strong as I was before. You notice what fire there is in it--what
rapture, enthusiasm, frenzy--what blinding explosions of color. It is
just a “Turner”--that is what it is. It is just like his “Slave Ship,”
that immortal work. What you see in the “Slave Ship” is a terrific
explosion of radiating rags and fragments of flaming crimson flying
from a common center of intense yellow which is in violent
commotion--insomuch that a Boston reporter said it reminded him of a
yellow cat dying in a platter of tomatoes.

Take the slippers and wear them next your heart, Elsie dear; for every
stitch in them is a testimony of the affection which two of your
loyalest friends bear you. Every single stitch cost us blood. I’ve got
twice as many pores in me now as I used to have; and you would never
believe how many places you can stick a needle into yourself until you
go into the embroidery line and devote yourself to art.

Do not wear these slippers in public, dear; it would only excite envy;
and, as like as not, somebody would try to shoot you.

Merely use them to assist you in remembering that among the many, many
people who think all the world of you is your friend,

                                                         MARK TWAIN.


                             ELSIE’S REPLY.

                                        NEW YORK, _October g, 1889_.

MY DEAR MR. CLEMENS: The slipper the long letter and all the rest came
this afternoon, I think they are splendid and shall have them framed and
keep them among my very most prechus things. I have had a great many
nice things given to me and people often say very pleasant things but I
am not quite shure they always mean it or that they are as trustable as
you and “Leo” and I am very shure thay would not spend their prechus
time and shed their blood for me so you see that is one reason why I
will think so much of it and then it was all so funny to think of two
great big men like you and “little Willie” (that is what “Leo” calls
himself to me) imbroidering a pair of slippers for a little girl like me
of corse you have a great many large words in your letter that I do not
quite understand. One word comencing with P. has fifteen letters in it
and I do not know what you mean by pooled unless you mean you and Leo
put your two minds together to make the slippers which was very nice of
you both I think you are just right about the angle worms thay did look
like that this summer when I used to dig them for bate to fish with
please tell Dr. Root I will think of him when I look at the part he did
the Surgicle Stich I mean I hope you will be quite well and strong by
the time you get this letter as you were before you made my slipper it
would make me very sad if you were to be ill. Give my love to Mrs.
Clemens Susie Clara Gene I-know and you-know and Vix and all of my
Hartford friends tell Gene I wish I was with her and we would have a
nice jump in the hay loft. When you come to New York you must call and
see me then we will see about those big words my address is up in the
top left corner of this letter.

                  To my loyal friend
                                 Mark Twain
                             From his little friend
                                                  ELSIE LESLIE LYDE.

                        AIX, THE PARADISE OF THE
                               RHEUMATICS
               (Contributed to the New York _Sun_, 1891)


Aix-les-Bains. Certainly this is an enchanting place. It is a strong
word, but I think the facts justify it. True, there is a rabble of
nobilities, big and little, here all the time, and often a king or two;
but as these behave quite nicely and also keep mainly to themselves,
they are little or no annoyance. And then a king makes the best
advertisement there is, and the cheapest. All he costs is a reception at
the station by the mayor and the police in their Sunday uniforms,
shop-front decorations along the route from station to hotel, brass band
at the hotel, fireworks in the evening, free bath in the morning. This
is the whole expense; and in return for it he goes away from here with
the broad of his back metaphorically stenciled over with display ads.,
which shout to all nations of the world, assisted by the telegraph:

  Rheumatism routed at Aix-les-Bains!

  Gout admonished, Nerves braced up!

  All diseases welcomed, and satisfaction given or the money returned at
  the door!

We leave nature’s noble cliffs and crags undefiled and uninsulted by the
advertiser’s paint brush. We use the back of a king, which is better and
properer and more effective, too, for the cliffs stay still and few see
it, but the king moves across the fields of the world and is visible
from all points, like a constellation. We are out for kings this week,
but one will be along soon--possibly His Satanic Majesty of Russia.
There’s a colossus for you! A mysterious and terrible form that towers
up into unsearchable space and casts a shadow across the universe like a
planet in eclipse. There will be but one absorbing spectacle in this
world when we stencil him and start him out.

This is an old valley, this of Aix, both in the history of man and in
the geological records of its rocks. Its little lake of Bourget carries
the human history back to the lake dwellers, furnishing seven groups of
their habitations, and Dr. William Wakefield says in his interesting
local guide that the mountains round about furnish “Geographically, a
veritable epitome of the globe.” The stratified chapters of the earth’s
history are clearly and permanently written on the sides of the roaring
bulk of the Dent du Chat, but many of the layers of race, religion, and
government which in turn have flourished and perished here between the
lake dweller of several thousand years ago and the French republican of
to-day, are ill defined and uninforming by comparison. There are several
varieties of pagans. They went their way, one after the other, down into
night and oblivion, leaving no account of themselves, no memorials. The
Romans arrived 2,300 years ago, other parts of France are rich with
remembrances of their eight centuries of occupation, but not many are
here. Other pagans followed the Romans. By and by Christianity arrived,
some 400 years after the time of Christ. The long procession of races,
languages, religions, and dynasties demolished one another’s records--it
is man’s way always.

As a result, nothing is left of the handiwork of the remoter inhabitants
of the region except the constructions of the lake dwellers and some
Roman odds and ends. There is part of a small Roman temple, there is
part of a Roman bath, there is a graceful and battered Roman arch. It
stands on a turfy level over the way from the present great bath house,
is surrounded by magnolia trees, and is both a picturesque and
suggestive object. It has stood there some 1,600 years. Its nearest
neighbor, not twenty steps away, is a Catholic church. They are symbols
of the two chief eras in the history of Aix. Yes, and of the European
world. I judge that the venerable arch is held in reverent esteem by
everybody, and that this esteem is its sufficient protection from
insult, for it is the only public structure I have yet seen in France
which lacks the sign, “It is forbidden to post bills here.” Its neighbor
the church has that sign on more than one of its sides, and other signs,
too, forbidding certain other sorts of desecration.

The arch’s nearest neighbor--just at its elbow, like the church--is the
telegraph office. So there you have the three great eras bunched
together--the era of War, the era of Theology, the era of Business. You
pass under the arch, and the buried Cæsars seem to rise from the dust of
the centuries and flit before you; you pass by that old battered church,
and are in touch with the Middle Ages, and with another step you can put
down ten francs and shake hands with Oshkosh under the Atlantic.

It is curious to think what changes the last of the three symbols stand
for; changes in men’s ways and thoughts, changes in material
civilization, changes in the Deity--or in men’s conception of the Deity,
if that is an exacter way of putting it. The second of the symbols
arrived in the earth at a time when the Deity’s possessions consisted of
a small sky freckled with mustard-seed stars, and under it a patch of
landed estate not so big as the holdings of the Tsar to-day, and all His
time was taken up in trying to keep a handful of Jews in some sort of
order--exactly the same number of them that the Tsar has lately been
dealing with in a more abrupt and far less loving and long-suffering
way. At a later time--a time within all old men’s memories--the Deity
was otherwise engaged. He was dreaming His eternities away on His Great
White Throne, steeped in the soft bliss of hymns of praise wafted aloft
without ceasing from choirs of ransomed souls, Presbyterians and the
rest. This was a Deity proper enough to the size and conditions of
things, no doubt a provincial Deity with provincial tastes. The change
since has been inconceivably vast. His empire has been unimaginably
enlarged. To-day He is a Master of a universe made up of myriads upon
myriads of gigantic suns, and among them, lost in that limitless sea of
light, floats that atom. His earth, which once seemed so good and
satisfactory and cost so many days of patient labor to build, is a mere
cork adrift in the waters of a shoreless Atlantic. This is a business
era, and no doubt he is governing His huge empire now, not by dreaming
the time away in the buzz of hymning choirs, with occasional explosions
of arbitrary power disproportioned to the size of the annoyance, but by
applying laws of a sort proper and necessary to the sane and successful
management of a complex and prodigious establishment, and by seeing to
it that the exact and constant operation of these laws is not interfered
with for the accommodation of any individual or political or religious
faction or nation.

Mighty has been the advance of the nations and the liberalization of
thought. A result of it is a changed Deity, a Deity of a dignity and
sublimity proportioned to the majesty of His office and the magnitude of
His empire, a Deity who has been freed from a hundred fretting chains
and will in time be freed from the rest by the several ecclesiastical
bodies who have these matters in charge. It was, without doubt, a
mistake and a step backward when the Presbyterian Synods of America
lately decided, by vote, to leave Him still embarrassed with the dogma
of infant damnation. Situated as we are, we cannot at present know with
how much of anxiety He watched the balloting, nor with how much of
grieved disappointment He observed the result.

Well, all these eras above spoken of are modern, they are of last week,
they are of yesterday, they are of this morning, so to speak. The
springs, the healing waters that gush up from under this hillside
village, indeed are ancient. They, indeed, are a genuine antiquity; they
antedate all those fresh human matters by processions of centuries; they
were born with the fossils of the Dent du Chat, and they have been
always abundant. They furnished a million gallons a day to wash the lake
dwellers with, the same to wash the Cæsars with, no less to wash Balzac
with, and have not diminished on my account. A million gallons a day for
how many days? Figures cannot set forth the number. The delivery, in the
aggregate, has amounted to an Atlantic. And there is still an Atlantic
down in there. By Doctor Wakefield’s calculation the Atlantic is
three-quarters of a mile down in the earth. The calculation is based
upon the temperature of the water, which is 114 degrees to 117 degrees
Fahrenheit, the natural law being that below a certain depth heat
augments at the rate of one degree for every sixty feet of descent.

Aix is handsome, and is handsomely situated, too, on its hill slope,
with its stately prospect of mountain range and plain spread out before
it and about it. The streets are mainly narrow, and steep and crooked
and interesting, and offer considerable variety in the way of names; on
the corner of one of them you read this: “Rue du Puits d’Enfer” (“Pit of
Hell Street”). Some of the sidewalks are only eighteen inches wide; they
are for the cats, probably. There is a pleasant park, and there are
spacious and beautiful grounds connected with the two great pleasure
resorts, the Cercle and the Villa des Fleurs. The town consists of big
hotels, little hotels, and _pensions_. The season lasts about six
months, beginning with May. When it is at its height there are thousands
of visitors here, and in the course of the season as many as 20,000 in
the aggregate come and go.

These are not all here for the baths; some come for the gambling
facilities and some for the climate. It is a climate where the field
strawberry flourishes through the spring, summer, and fall. It is hot in
the summer, and hot in earnest; but this is only in the daytime; it is
not hot at night. The English season is May and June; they get a good
deal of rain then, and they like that. The Americans take July, and the
French take August. By the 1st of July the open-air music and the
evening concerts and operas and plays are fairly under way, and from
that time onward the rush of pleasure has a steadily increasing boom. It
is said that in August the great grounds and the gambling rooms are
crowded all the time and no end of ostensible fun going on.

It is a good place for rest and sleep and general recuperation of
forces. The book of Doctor Wakefield says there is something about this
atmosphere which is the deadly enemy of insomnia, and I think this must
be true, for if I am any judge, this town is at times the noisiest one
in Europe, and yet a body gets more sleep here than he would at home, I
don’t care where his home is. Now, we are living at a most comfortable
and satisfactory _pension_, with a garden of shade trees and flowers and
shrubs, and a convincing air of quiet and repose. But just across the
narrow street is the little market square, and at the corner of that is
the church that is neighbor to the Roman arch, and that narrow street,
and that billiard table of a market place, and that church are able, on
a bet, to turn out more noise to a cubic yard at the wrong time than any
other similar combination in the earth or out of it. In the street you
have the skull-bursting thunder of the passing hack, a volume of sound
not producible by six hacks anywhere else; on the hack is a lunatic with
a whip which he cracks to notify the public to get out of his way. This
crack is as keen and sharp and penetrating and ear-splitting as a pistol
shot at close range, and the lunatic delivers it in volleys, not single
shots. You think you will not be able to live till he gets by, and when
he does get by he leaves only a vacancy for the bandit who sells _Le
Petit Journal_ to fill with his strange and awful yell. He arrives with
the early morning and the market people, and there is a dog that arrives
at about the same time and barks steadily at nothing till he dies, and
they fetch another dog just like him. The bark of this breed is the twin
of the whip volley, and stabs like a knife. By and by, what is left of
you the church bell gets. There are many bells, and apparently six or
seven thousand town clocks, and as they are all five minutes
apart--probably by law--there are no intervals. Some of them are
striking all the time--at least, after you go to bed they are. There is
one clock that strikes the hour and then strikes it over again to see if
it was right. Then for evenings and Sundays there is a chime--a chime
that starts in pleasantly and musically, then suddenly breaks into a
frantic roar, and boom, and crash of warring sounds that makes you think
Paris is up and the Revolution come again. And yet, as I have said, one
sleeps here--sleeps like the dead. Once he gets his grip on his sleep,
neither hack, nor whip, nor news fiend, nor dog, nor bell cyclone, nor
all of them together, can wrench it loose or mar its deep and tranquil
continuity. Yes, there is indeed something in this air that is death to
insomnia.

The buildings of the Cercle and the Villa des Fleurs are huge in size,
and each has a theater in it, and a great restaurant, also conveniences
for gambling and general and variegated entertainment. They stand in
ornamental grounds of great extent and beauty. The multitudes of
fashionable folk sit at refreshment tables in the open air, afternoons,
and listen to the music, and it is there that they mainly go to break
the Sabbath.

To get the privilege of entering these grounds and buildings you buy a
ticket for a few francs, which is good for the whole season. You are
then free to go and come at all hours, attend the plays and concerts
free, except on special occasions, gamble, buy refreshments, and make
yourself symmetrically comfortable.

Nothing could be handier than those two little theaters. The curtain
doesn’t rise until 8.30; then between the acts one can idle for half an
hour in the other departments of the building, damaging his appetite in
the restaurants or his pocketbook in the baccarat room. The singers and
actors are from Paris, and their performance is beyond praise.

I was never in a fashionable gambling hell until I came here. I had read
several millions of descriptions of such places, but the reality was new
to me. I very much wanted to see this animal, especially the new
historic game of baccarat, and this was a good place, for Aix ranks next
to Monte Carlo for high play and plenty of it. But the result was what I
might have expected--the interest of the looker-on perishes with the
novelty of the spectacle; that is to say, in a few minutes. A permanent
and intense interest is acquirable in baccarat, or in any other game,
but you have to buy it. You don’t get it by standing around and looking
on.

The baccarat table is covered with green cloth and is marked off in
divisions with chalk or something. The banker sits in the middle, the
croupier opposite. The customers fill all the chairs at the table, and
the rest of the crowd are massed at their back and leaning over them to
deposit chips or gold coins. Constantly money and chips are flung upon
the table, and the game seems to consist in the croupier’s reaching for
these things with a flexible sculling oar, and raking them home. It
appeared to be a rational enough game for him, and if I could have
borrowed his oar I would have stayed, but I didn’t see where the
entertainment of the others came in. This was because I saw without
perceiving, and observed without understanding. For the widow and the
orphan and the others do win money there. Once an old gray mother in
Israel or elsewhere pulled out, and I heard her say to her daughter or
her granddaughter as they passed me, “There, I’ve won six louis, and I’m
going to quit while I’m ahead.” Also there was this statistic. A friend
pointed to a young man with the dead stub of a cigar in his mouth, which
he kept munching nervously all the time and pitching hundred-dollar
chips on the board while two sweet young girls reached down over his
shoulders to deposit modest little gold pieces, and said: “He’s only
funning, now; wasting a few hundred to pass the time--waiting for the
gold room to open, you know, which won’t be till after midnight--then
you’ll see him bet! He won £14,000 there last night. They don’t bet
anything there but big money.”

The thing I chiefly missed was the haggard people with the intense eye,
the hunted look, the desperate mien, candidates for suicide and the
pauper’s grave. They are in the description, as a rule, but they were
off duty that night. All the gamblers, male and female, old and young,
looked abnormally cheerful and prosperous.

However, all the nations were there, clothed richly and speaking all the
languages. Some of the women were painted, and were evidently shaky as
to character. These items tallied with the descriptions well enough.

The etiquette of the place was difficult to master. In the brilliant and
populous halls and corridors you don’t smoke, and you wear your hat, no
matter how many ladies are in the thick throng of drifting humanity, but
the moment you cross the sacred threshold and enter the gambling hell,
off the hat must come, and everybody lights his cigar and goes to
suffocating the ladies.

But what I came here for five weeks ago was the baths. My right arm was
disabled with rheumatism. To sit at home in America and guess out the
European bath best fitted for a particular ailment or combination of
ailments, it is not possible, and it would not be a good idea to
experiment in that way, anyhow. There are a great many curative baths on
the Continent, and some are good for one disease and bad for another. So
it is necessary to let your physician name a bath for you. As a rule,
Americans go to Europe to get this advice, and South Americans go to
Paris for it. Now and then an economist chooses his bath himself and
does a thousand miles of railroading to get to it, and then the local
physicians tell him he has come to the wrong place. He sees that he has
lost time and money and strength, and almost the minute he realizes this
he loses his temper. I had the rheumatism and was advised to go to Aix,
not so much because I had that disease as because I had the promise of
certain others. What they were was not explained to me, but they are
either in the following menu or I have been sent to the wrong place.
Doctor Wakefield’s book says:

  We know that the class of maladies benefited by the water and baths at
  Aix are those due to defect of nourishment, debility of the nervous
  system, or to a gouty, rheumatic, herpetic, or scrofulous
  diathesis--all diseases extremely debilitating, and requiring a tonic,
  and not depressing action of the remedy. This it seems to find here,
  as recorded experience and daily action can testify. According to the
  line of treatment followed particularly with due regard to the
  temperature, the action of the Aix waters can be made sedative,
  exciting, derivative, or alterative and tonic.

The “Establishment” is the property of France, and all the officers and
servants are employees of the French government. The bathhouse is a huge
and massive pile of white marble masonry, and looks more like a temple
than anything else. It has several floors and each is full of bath
cabinets. There is every kind of bath--for the nose, the ears, the
throat, vapor baths, swimming baths, and all people’s favorite, the
douche. It is a good building to get lost in, when you are not familiar
with it. From early morning until nearly noon people are streaming in
and streaming out without halt. The majority come afoot, but great
numbers are brought in sedan chairs, a sufficiently ugly contrivance
whose cover is a steep little tent made of striped canvas. You see
nothing of the patient in this diving bell as the bearers tramp along,
except a glimpse of his ankles bound together and swathed around with
blankets or towels to that generous degree that the result suggests a
sore piano leg. By attention and practice the pallbearers have got so
that they can keep out of step all the time--and they do it. As a
consequence their veiled churn goes rocking, tilting, swaying along like
a bell buoy in a ground swell. It makes the oldest sailor homesick to
look at that spectacle.

The “course” is usually fifteen douche baths and five tub baths. You
take the douche three days in succession, then knock off and take a tub.
You keep up this distribution through the course. If one course does not
cure you, you take another one after an interval. You seek a local
physician and he examines your case and prescribes the kind of bath
required for it, with various other particulars; then you buy your
course tickets and pay for them in advance--nine dollars. With the
tickets you get a memorandum book with your dates and hours all set down
on it. The doctor takes you into the bath the first morning and gives
some instructions to the two _doucheurs_ who are to handle you through
the course. The _pourboires_ are about ten cents to each of the men for
each bath, payable at the end of the course. Also at the end of the
course you pay three or four francs to the superintendent of your
department of the bathhouse. These are useful particulars to know, and
are not to be found in the books. A servant of your hotel carries your
towels and sheet to the bath daily and brings them away again. They are
the property of the hotel; the French government doesn’t furnish these
things.

You meet all kinds of people at a place like this, and if you give them
a chance they will submerge you under their circumstances, for they are
either very glad or very sorry they came, and they want to spread their
feelings out and enjoy them. One of these said to me:

“It’s great, these baths. I didn’t come here for my health; I only came
to find out if there was anything the matter with me. The doctor told me
if there was the symptoms would soon appear. After the first douche I
had sharp pains in all my muscles. The doctor said it was different
varieties of rheumatism, and the best varieties there were, too. After
my second bath I had aches in my bones, and skull and around. The doctor
said it was different varieties of neuralgia, and the best in the
market, anybody would tell me so. I got many new kinds of pains out of
my third douche. These were in my joints. The doctor said it was gout,
complicated with heart disease, and encouraged me to go on. Then we had
the fourth douche, and I came out on a stretcher that time, and fetched
with me one vast, diversified undulating continental kind of pain, with
horizons to it, and zones, and parallels of latitude, and meridians of
longitude, and isothermal belts, and variations of the compass--oh,
everything tidy, and right up to the latest developments, you know. The
doctor said it was inflammation of the soul, and just the very thing.
Well, I went right on gathering them in, toothache, liver complaint,
softening of the brain, nostalgia, bronchitis, osteology, fits,
Coleoptera, hydrangea, Cyclopædia Britannica, delirium tremens, and a
lot of other things that I’ve got down on my list that I’ll show you,
and you can keep it if you like and tally off the bric-à-brac as you lay
it in.

The doctor said I was a grand proof of what these baths could do; said I
had come here as innocent of disease as a grindstone, and inside of
three weeks these baths had sluiced out of me every important ailment
known to medical science, along with considerable more that were
entirely new and patentable. Why, he wanted to exhibit me in his bay
window!”

There seem to be a good many liars this year. I began to take the baths
and found them most enjoyable; so enjoyable that if I hadn’t had a
disease I would have borrowed one, just to have a pretext for going on.
They took me into a stone-floored basin about fourteen feet square,
which had enough strange-looking pipes and things in it to make it look
like a torture chamber. The two half-naked men seated me on a pine stool
and kept a couple of warm-water jets as thick as one’s wrist playing
upon me while they kneaded me, stroked me, twisted me, and applied all
the other details of the scientific massage to me for seven or eight
minutes. Then they stood me up and played a powerful jet upon me all
around for another minute. The cool shower bath came next, and the thing
was over. I came out of the bathhouse a few minutes later feeling
younger and fresher and finer than I have felt since I was a boy. The
spring and cheer and delight of this exaltation lasted three hours, and
the same uplifting effect has followed the twenty douches which I have
taken since.

After my first douche I went to the chemist’s on the corner, as per
instructions, and asked for half a glass of Challe water. It comes from
a spring sixteen miles from here. It was furnished to me, but,
perceiving that there was something the matter with it, I offered to
wait till they could get some that was fresh, but they said it always
smelled that way. They said that the reason that this was so much ranker
than the sulphur water of the bath was that this contained thirty-two
times as much sulphur as that. It is true, but in my opinion that water
comes from a cemetery, and not a fresh cemetery, either. History says
that one of the early Roman generals lost an army down there somewhere.
If he could come back now I think this water would help him find it
again. However, I drank the Challe, and have drunk it once or twice
every day since. I suppose it is all right, but I wish I knew what was
the matter with those Romans.

My first baths developed plenty of pain, but the subsequent ones removed
almost all of it. I have got back the use of my arm these last few days,
and I am going away now.

There are many beautiful drives about Aix, many interesting places to
visit, and much pleasure to be found in paddling around the little Lake
Bourget on the small steamers, but the excursion which satisfied me best
was a trip to Annecy and its neighborhood. You go to Annecy in an hour
by rail, through a garden land that has not had its equal for beauty
perhaps since Eden; and certainly not Eden was cultivated as this garden
is. The charm and loveliness of the whole region are bewildering.
Picturesque rocks, forest-clothed hills, slopes richly bright in the
cleanest and greenest grass, fields of grain without freck or flaw,
dainty of color and as shiny and shimmery as silk, old gray mansions and
towers, half buried in foliage and sunny eminences, deep chasms with
precipitous walls, and a swift stream of pale-blue water between, with
now and then a tumbling cascade, and always noble mountains in view,
with vagrant white clouds curling about their summits.

Then at the end of an hour you come to Annecy and rattle through its old
crooked lanes, built solidly up with curious old houses that are a dream
of the Middle Ages, and presently you come to the main object of your
trip--Lake Annecy. It is a revelation; it is a miracle. It brings the
tears to a body’s eyes, it affects you just as all things that you
instantly recognize as perfect affect you--perfect music, perfect
eloquence, perfect art, perfect joy, perfect grief. It stretches itself
out there in a caressing sunlight, and away toward its border of
majestic mountains, a crisped and radiant plain of water of the divinest
blue that can be imagined. All the blues are there, from the faintest
shoal-water suggestion of the color, detectable only in the shadow of
some overhanging object, all the way through, a little blue and a little
bluer still, and again a shade bluer, till you strike the deep, rich
Mediterranean splendor which breaks the heart in your bosom, it is so
beautiful.

And the mountains, as you skim along on the steamboat, how stately their
forms, how noble their proportions, how green their velvet slopes, how
soft the mottlings of the sun and shadow that play about the rocky
ramparts that crown them, how opaline the vast upheavals of snow banked
against the sky in the remotenesses beyond--Mont Blanc and the
others--how shall anybody describe? Why, not even the painter can quite
do it, and the most the pen can do is to suggest.

Up the lake there is an old abbey--Tallories--relic of the Middle Ages.
We stopped there; stepped from the sparkling water and the rush and boom
and fret and fever of the nineteenth century into the solemnity and the
silence and the soft gloom and the brooding mystery of a remote
antiquity. The stone step at the water’s edge had the traces of a
worn-out inscription on it; the wide flight of stone steps that led up
to the front door was polished smooth by the passing feet of forgotten
centuries, and there was not an unbroken stone among them all. Within
the pile was the old square cloister with covered arcade all around it
where the monks of the ancient times used to sit and meditate, and now
and then welcome to their hospitalities the wandering knight with his
tin breeches on, and in the middle of the square court (open to the sky)
was a stone well curb, cracked and slick with age and use, and all about
it were weeds, and among the weeds moldy brickbats that the Crusaders
used to throw at one another. A passage at the further side of the
cloister led to another weedy and roofless little inclosure beyond where
there was a ruined wall clothed to the top with masses of ivy, and
flanking it was a battered and picturesque arch. All over the building
there were comfortable rooms and comfortable beds and clean plank floors
with no carpets on them. In one room upstairs were half a dozen
portraits, dimming relics of the vanished centuries--portraits of abbots
who used to be as grand as princes in their old day, and very rich, and
much worshiped and very bold; and in the next room there were a howling
chromo and an electric bell. Downstairs there was an ancient wood
carving with a Latin word commanding silence, and there was a spang-new
piano close by. Two elderly French women, with the kindest and honestest
and sincerest faces, have the abbey now, and they board and lodge people
who are tired of the roar of cities and want to be where the dead
silence and serenity and peace of this old nest will heal their
blistered spirits and patch up their ragged minds. They fed us well,
they slept us well, and I wish I could have stayed there a few years and
got a solid rest.




MARIENBAD--A HEALTH FACTORY

                                -------

THE SIMPLE BUT SUFFICIENT REGIMEN IMPOSED ON PATIENTS IN AN AUSTRIAN
    RESORT--OBSERVATIONS ON DIGESTION.

                                -------

               (Contributed to the New York _Sun_, 1891)

This place is the village of Marienbad, Bohemia. It seems no very great
distance from Annecy, in Haute-Savoie, to this place--you make it in
less than thirty hours by these continental express trains--but the
changes in the scenery are great; they are quite out of proportion to
the distance covered. From Annecy by Aix to Geneva, you have blue lakes,
with bold mountains springing from their borders, and far glimpses of
snowy wastes lifted against the horizon beyond, while all about you is a
garden cultivated to the last possibility of grace and beauty--a
cultivation which doesn’t stop with the handy lower levels, but is
carried right up the sheer steeps and propped there with ribs of
masonry, and made to stay there in spite of Newton’s law. Beyond
Geneva--beyond Lausanne, at any rate--you have for a while a country
which noticeably resembles New England, and seems out of place and like
an intruder--an intruder who is wearing his every-day clothes at a
fancy-dress ball. But presently on your right, huge green mountain
ramparts rise up, and after that for hours you are absorbed in watching
the rich shadow effects which they furnish, and are only dully aware
that New England is gone and that you are flying past quaint and
unspeakable old towns and towers. Next day you have the lake of Zurich,
and presently the Rhine is swinging by you. How clean it is! How clear
it is! How blue it is! How green it is! How swift and rollicking and
insolent are its gait and style! How vivid and splendid its
colors--beautiful wreck and chaos of all the soap bubbles in the
universe! A person born on the Rhine must worship it.

     I saw the blue Rhine sweep along; I heard, or seemed to hear,
     The German songs we used to sing in chorus sweet and clear.

Yes, that is where his heart would be, that is where his last thoughts
would be, the “soldier of the legion” who “lay dying in Algiers.”

And by and by you are in a German region, which you discover to be quite
different from the recent Swiss lands behind you. You have a sea before
you, that is to say; the green land goes rolling away, in ocean swells,
to the horizon. And there is another new feature. Here and there at wide
intervals you have islands, hills two hundred and three hundred feet
high, of a haystack form, that rise abruptly out of the green plain, and
are wooded solidly to the top. On the top there is just room for a
ruined castle, and there it is, every time; above the summit you see the
crumbling arches and broken towers projecting.

Beyond Stuttgart, next day, you find other changes still. By and by,
approaching and leaving Nuremberg and down by Newhaus, your landscape is
humped everywhere with scattered knobs of rock, unsociable crags of a
rude, towerlike look, and thatched with grass and vines and bushes. And
now and then you have gorges, too, of a modest pattern as to size, with
precipice walls curiously carved and honeycombed by--I don’t know
what--but water, no doubt.

The changes are not done yet, for the instant the country finds it is
out of Württemberg and into Bavaria it discards one more thickness of
soil to go with previous disrobings, and then nothing remains over the
bones but the shift. There may be a poorer soil somewhere, but it is not
likely.

A couple of hours from Bayreuth you cross into Bohemia, and before long
you reach this Marienbad, and recognize another sharp change, the change
from the long ago to to-day; that is to say from the very old to the
spick and span new; from an architecture totally without shapeliness or
ornament to an architecture attractively equipped with both; from
universal dismalness as to color to universal brightness and beauty as
to tint; from a town which seems made up of prisons to a town which is
made up of gracious and graceful mansions proper to the light of heart
and crimeless. It is like jumping out of Jerusalem into Chicago.

The more I think of these many changes, the more surprising the thing
seems. I have never made so picturesque a journey before, and there
cannot be another trip of like length in the world that can furnish so
much variety and of so charming and interesting a sort.

There are only two or three streets here in this snug pocket in the
hemlock hills, but they are handsome. When you stand at the foot of a
street and look up at the slant of it you see only block fronts of
graceful pattern, with happily broken lines and the pleasant accent of
bay projections and balconies in orderly disorder and harmonious
confusion, and always the color is fresh and cheery, various shades of
cream, with softly contrasting trimmings of white, and now and then a
touch of dim red. These blocks are all thick walled, solid, massive,
tall for this Europe; but it is the brightest and newest looking town on
the Continent, and as pretty as anybody could require. The steep hills
spring high aloft from their very back doors and are clothed densely to
their tops with hemlocks.

In Bavaria everybody is in uniform, and you wonder where the private
citizens are, but here in Bohemia the uniforms are very rare.
Occasionally one catches a glimpse of an Austrian officer, but it is
only occasionally. Uniforms are so scarce that we seem to be in a
republic. Almost the only striking figure is the Polish Jew. He is very
frequent. He is tall and of grave countenance and wears a coat that
reaches to his ankle bones, and he has a little wee curl or two in front
of each ear. He has a prosperous look, and seems to be as much respected
as anybody.

The crowds that drift along the promenade at music time twice a day are
fashionably dressed after the Parisian pattern, and they look a good
deal alike, but they speak a lot of languages which you have not
encountered before, and no ignorant person can spell their names, and
they can’t pronounce them themselves.

Marienbad--Mary’s Bath. The Mary is the Virgin. She is the patroness of
these curative springs. They try to cure everything--gout, rheumatism,
leanness, fatness, dyspepsia, and all the rest. The whole thing is the
property of a convent, and has been for six or seven hundred years.
However, there was never a boom here until a quarter of a century ago.

If a person has the gout, this is what they do with him: they have him
out at 5.30 in the morning, and give him an egg and let him look at a
cup of tea. At six he must be at his particular spring, with his tumbler
hanging at his belt--and he will have plenty of company there. At the
first note of the orchestra he must lift his tumbler and begin to sip
his dreadful water with the rest. He must sip slowly and be a long time
at it. Then he must tramp about the hills for an hour or so, and get all
the exercise and fresh air possible. Then he takes his tub or wallows in
his mud, if mud baths are his sort. By noon he has a fine appetite, and
the rules allow him to turn himself loose and satisfy it, so long as he
is careful and eats only such things as he doesn’t want. He puts in the
afternoon walking the hills and filling up with fresh air. At night he
is allowed to take three ounces of any kind of food he doesn’t like and
drink one glass of any kind of liquor that he has a prejudice against;
he may also smoke one pipe if he isn’t used to it. At half past nine
sharp he must be in bed and his candle out. Repeat the whole thing the
next day. I don’t see any advantage in this over having the gout.

In the case of most diseases that is about what one is required to
undergo, and if you have any pleasant habit that you value, they want
that. They want that the first thing. They make you drop everything that
gives an interest to life. Their idea is to reverse your whole system of
existence and make a regenerating revolution. If you are a Republican,
they make you talk free trade. If you are a Democrat they make you talk
protection; if you are a Prohibitionist, you have got to go to bed drunk
every night till you get well. They spare nothing, they spare nobody.
Reform, reform, that is the whole song. If a person is an orator, they
gag him; if he likes to read, they won’t let him; if he wants to sing,
they make him whistle. They say they can cure any ailment, and they do
seem to do it; but why should a patient come all the way here? Why
shouldn’t he do these things at home and save the money? No disease
would stay with a person who treated it like that.

I didn’t come here to take baths, I only came to look around. But first
one person, then another began to throw out hints, and pretty soon I was
a good deal concerned about myself. One of these goutees here said I had
a gouty look about the eye; next a person who has catarrh of the
intestines asked me if I didn’t notice a dim sort of stomach ache when I
sneezed. I hadn’t before, but I did seem to notice it then. A man that’s
here for heart disease said he wouldn’t come downstairs so fast if he
had my build and aspect. A person with an old-gold complexion said a man
died here in the mud bath last week that had a petrified liver--good
deal such a looking man as I am, and the same initials, and so on, and
so on.

Of course, there was nothing to be uneasy about, and I wasn’t what you
may call really uneasy; but I was not feeling very well--that is, not
brisk--and I went to bed. I suppose that that was not a good idea,
because then they had me. I started in at the supper end of the mill and
went through. I am said to be all right now, and free from disease, but
this does not surprise me. What I have been through in these two weeks
would free a person of pretty much everything in him that wasn’t nailed
there--any loose thing, any unattached fragment of bone, or meat or
morals, or disease, or propensities or accomplishments, or what not. And
I don’t say but that I feel well enough, I feel better than I would if I
was dead, I reckon. And, besides, they say I am going to build up now
and come right along and be all right. I am not saying anything, but I
wish I had enough of my diseases back to make me aware of myself, and
enough of my habits to make it worth while to live. To have nothing the
matter with you and no habits is pretty tame, pretty colorless. It is
just the way a saint feels, I reckon; it is at least the way he looks. I
never could stand a saint. That reminds me that you see very few priests
around here, and yet, as I have already said, this whole big enterprise
is owned and managed by a convent. The few priests one does see here are
dressed like human beings, and so there may be more of them than I
imagine. Fifteen priests dressed like these could not attract as much of
your attention as would one priest at Aix-les-Bains. You cannot pull
your eye loose from the French priest as long as he is in sight, his
dress is so fascinatingly ugly. I seem to be wandering from the subject,
but I am not. This is about the coldest place I ever saw, and the
wettest, too. This August seems like an English November to me. Rain?
Why, it seems to like to rain here. It seems to rain every time there is
a chance. You are strictly required to be out airing and exercising
whenever the sun is shining, so I hate to see the sun shining because I
hate air and exercise--duty air and duty exercise taken for medicine. It
seems ungenuine, out of season, degraded to sordid utilities, a subtle
spiritual something gone from it which one can’t describe in words,
but--don’t you understand? With that gone what is left but canned air,
canned exercise, and you don’t want it.

When the sun does shine for a few moments or a few hours these people
swarm out and flock through the streets and over the hills and through
the pine woods, and make the most of the chance, and I have flocked out,
too, on some of these occasions, but as a rule I stay in and try to get
warm.

And what is there for means, besides heavy clothing and rugs, and the
polished white tomb that stands lofty and heartless in the corner and
thinks it is a stove? Of all the creations of human insanity this thing
is the most forbidding. Whether it is heating the room or isn’t, the
impression is the same--cold indifference. You can’t tell which it is
doing without going and putting your hand on it. They burn little
handfuls of kindlings in it, no substantial wood, and no coal.

The fire burns out every fifteen minutes, and there is no way to tell
when this has happened. On these dismal days, with the rain steadily
falling, it is no better company than a corpse. A roaring hickory fire,
with the cordial flames leaping up the chimney--But I must not think of
such things, they make a person homesick. This is a most strange place
to come to get rid of disease.

That is what you think most of the time. But in the intervals, when the
sun shines and you are tramping the hills and are comparatively warm,
you get to be neutral, maybe even friendly. I went up to the
Aussichtthurm the other day. This is a tower which stands on the summit
of a steep hemlock mountain here; a tower which there isn’t the least
use for, because the view is as good at the base of it as it is at the
top of it. But Germanic people are just mad for views--they never get
enough of a view--if they owned Mount Blanc, they would build a tower on
top of it.

The roads up that mountain through that hemlock forest are hard packed
and smooth, and the grades are easy and comfortable. They are for
walkers, not for carriages. You move through steep silence and twilight,
and you seem to be in a million-columned temple; whether you look up the
hill or down it you catch glimpses of distant figures flitting without
sound, appearing and disappearing in the dim distances, among the stems
of the trees, and it is all very spectral, and solemn and impressive.
Now and then the gloom is accented and sized up to your comprehension in
a striking way; a ray of sunshine finds its way down through and
suddenly calls your attention, for where it falls, far up the hillslope
in the brown duskiness, it lays a stripe that has a glare like
lightning. The utter stillness of the forest depths, the soundless hush,
the total absence of stir or motion of any kind in leaf or branch, are
things which we have no experience of at home, and consequently no name
for in our language. At home there would be the plaint of insects and
the twittering of birds and vagrant breezes would quiver the foliage.
Here it is the stillness of death. This is what the Germans are forever
talking about, dreaming about, and despairingly trying to catch and
imprison in a poem, or a picture, or a song--they adored Waldeinsamkeit,
loneliness of the woods. But how catch it? It has not a body; it is a
spirit. We don’t talk about it in America, or dream of it, or sing about
it, because we haven’t it. Certainly there is something wonderfully
alluring about it, beguiling, dreamy, unworldly. Where the gloom is
softest and richest, and the peace and stillness deepest, far up on the
side of that hemlock mountain, a spot where Goethe used to sit and
dream, is marked by a granite obelisk, and on its side is carved this
famous poem, which is the master’s idea of Waldeinsamkeit:

                    Ueber allen Wipfeln ist Ruh,
                    In allen Wipfeln spürest du
                        Kaum einen Hauch:
                    Die Vogel in schweigen in Walde.
                    Warte nur--Balde
                        Ruhest du auch.

It is raining again now. However, it was doing that before. I have been
over to the establishment and had a tub bath with two kinds of pine
juice in it. These fill the room with a pungent and most pleasant
perfume; they also turn the water to a color of ink and cover it with a
snowy suds, two or three inches deep. The bath is cool--about 75° or 80°
F., and there is a cooler shower bath after it. While waiting in the
reception room all by myself two men came in and began to talk.
Politics, literature, religion? No, their ailments. There is no other
subject here, apparently. Wherever two or three of these people are
gathered together, there you have it, every time. The first that can get
his mouth open contributes his disease and the condition of it, and the
others follow with theirs. The two men just referred to were
acquaintances, and they followed the custom. One of them was built like
a gasometer and is here to reduce his girth; the other was built like a
derrick and is here to fat up, as they express it, at this resort. They
were well satisfied with the progress they were making. The gasometer
had lost a quarter of a ton in ten days, and showed the record on his
belt with pride, and he walked briskly across the room, smiling in a
vast and luminous way, like a harvest moon, and said he couldn’t have
done that when he arrived here. He buttoned his coat around his equator
and showed how loose it was. It was pretty to see his happiness, it was
so childlike and honest. He set his feet together and leaned out over
his person and proved that he could see them. He said he hadn’t seen
them from that point before for fifteen years. He had a hand like a
boxing glove. And on one of his fingers he had just found a diamond ring
which he had missed eleven years ago.

The minute the derrick got a chance he broke in and began to tell how he
was piling on blubber right along--three-quarters of an ounce every four
days; and he was still piping away when I was sent for. I left the fat
man standing there panting and blowing, and swelling and collapsing like
a balloon, his next speech all ready and urgent for delivery.

The patients are always at that sort of thing, trying to talk one
another to death. The fat ones and the lean ones are nearly the worse at
it, but not quite; the dyspeptics are the worst. They are at it all day
and all night, and all along. They have more symptoms than all the
others put together and so there is more variety of experience, more
change of condition, more adventure, and consequently more play for the
imagination, more scope for lying, and in every way a bigger field to
talk. Go where you will, hide where you may, you cannot escape that word
liver; you overhear it constantly--in the street, in the shop, in the
theater, in the music grounds. Wherever you see two or a dozen people of
ordinary bulk talking together, you know they are talking about their
livers. When you first arrive here your new acquaintances seem sad and
hard to talk to, but pretty soon you get the lay of the land and the
hand of things, and after that you haven’t any more trouble. You look
into the dreary dull eye and softly say:

“Well, how’s your liver?”

You will see that dim eye flash up with a grateful flame, and you will
see that jaw begin to work, and you will recognize that nothing is
required of you from this out but to listen as long as you remain
conscious. After a few days you will begin to notice that out of these
people’s talk a gospel is framing itself and next you will find yourself
believing it. It is this--that a man is not what his rearing, his
schooling, his beliefs, his principles make him, he is what his liver
makes him; that with a healthy liver he will have the clear-seeing eye,
the honest heart, the sincere mind, the loving spirit, the loyal soul,
the truth and trust and faith that are based as Gibraltar is based, and
that with an unhealthy liver he must and will have the opposite of all
these, he will see nothing as it really is, he cannot trust anybody, or
believe in anything, his moral foundations are gone from under him. Now,
isn’t that interesting? I think it is.

One of the most curious things in these countries is the street manners
of the men and women. In meeting you they come straight on without
swerving a hair’s breadth from the direct line and wholly ignoring your
right to any part of the road. At the last moment you must yield up your
share of it and step aside, or there will be a collision. I noticed this
strange barbarism first in Geneva twelve years ago.

In Aix-les-Bains, where sidewalks are scarce and everybody walks in the
streets, there is plenty of room, but that is no matter; you are always
escaping collisions by mere quarter inches. A man or woman who is headed
in such a way as to cross your course presently without a collision will
actually alter his direction shade by shade and compel a collision
unless at the last instant you jump out of the way. Those folks are not
dressed as ladies and gentlemen. And they do not seem to be consciously
crowding you out of the road; they seem to be innocently and stupidly
unaware that they are doing it. But not so in Geneva. There this class,
especially the men, crowd out men, women, and girls of all rank and
raiment consciously and intentionally--crowd them off the sidewalk and
into the gutter.

There was nothing of this sort in Bayreuth. But here--well, here the
thing is astonishing. Collisions are unavoidable unless you do all the
yielding yourself. Another odd thing--here this savagery is confined to
the folk who wear the fine clothes; the others are courteous and
considerate. A big burly Comanche, with all the signs about him of
wealth and education, will tranquilly force young ladies to step off
into the gutter to avoid being run down by him. It is a mistake that
there is no bath that will cure people’s manners. But drowning would
help.

However, perhaps one can’t look for any real showy amount of delicacy of
feeling in a country where a person is brought up to contemplate without
a shudder the spectacle of women harnessed up with dogs and hauling
carts. The woman is on one side of the pole, the dog on the other, and
they bend to the work and tug and pant and strain--and the man tramps
leisurely alongside and smokes his pipe. Often the woman is old and
gray, and the man is her grandson. The Austrian national ornithological
device ought to be replaced by a grandmother harnessed to a slush cart
with a dog. This merely in the interest of fact. Heraldic fancy has been
a little too much overworked in these countries, anyway.

Lately one of those curious things happened here which justify the
felicitous extravagances of the stage and help us to accept them. A
despondent man, bankrupt, friendless, and desperate, dropped a dose of
strychnia into a bottle of whisky and went out in the dusk to find a
handy place for his purpose, which was suicide. In a lonely spot he was
stopped by a tramp, who said he would kill him if he didn’t give up his
money. Instead of jumping at the chance of getting himself killed and
thus saving himself the impropriety and annoyance of suicide, he forgot
all about his late project and attacked the tramp in a most sturdy and
valiant fashion. He made a good fight, but failed to win. The night
passed, the morning came, and he woke out of unconsciousness to find
that he had been clubbed half to death and left to perish at his
leisure. Then he reached for his bottle to add the finishing touch, but
it was gone. He pulled himself together and went limping away, and
presently came upon the tramp stretched out stone dead with the empty
bottle beside him. He had drunk the whisky and committed suicide
innocently. Now, while the man who had been cheated out of his suicide
stood there bemoaning his hard luck and wondering how he might manage to
raise money enough to buy some more whisky and poison, some people of
the neighborhood came by and he told them about his curious adventure.
They said that this tramp had been the scourge of the neighborhood and
the dread of the constabulary. The inquest passed off quietly and to
everybody’s satisfaction, and then the people, to testify their
gratitude to the hero of the occasion, put him on the police, on a
good-enough salary, and he is all right now and is not meditating
suicide any more. Here are all the elements of the naïvest Arabian tale;
a man who resists robbery when he hasn’t anything to be robbed of does
the very best to save his life when he has come out purposely to throw
it away; and finally is victorious in defeat, killing his adversary in
an effectual and poetic fashion after being already hors du combat
himself. Now if you let him rise in the service and marry the chief of
police’s daughter it has the requisite elements of the Oriental romance,
lacking not a detail so far as I can see.




                             DOWN THE RHÔNE
                                 (1891)


In old times a summer sail down the Rhône was a favorite trip with
travelers. But that day is long gone by. The conveniences for the sail
disappeared many years ago--driven out of existence by the railway.

In August, 1891, I made this long-neglected voyage with a boatman and a
courier. The following account of it is part diary and part comment. The
main idea of the voyage was, not to see sights, but to rest up from
sight-seeing. There was little or nothing on the Rhône to examine or
study or write didactically about; consequently, to glide down the
stream in an open boat, moved by the current only, would afford many
days of lazy repose, with opportunity to smoke, read, doze, talk,
accumulate comfort, get fat, and all the while be out of reach of the
news and remote from the world and its concerns.

Our point of departure was to be the Castle of Châtillon on Lake
Bourget, not very far from Aix-les-Bains. I went down from Geneva by
rail on a Saturday afternoon, and reached the station nearest the castle
during the evening. I found the courier waiting for me. He had been down
in the lake region several days, hunting for a boat, engaging the
boatman, etc.

_From my log._--The luggage was given to the porters--a couple of
peasant girls of seventeen or eighteen years, and a couple of younger
ones--children, one might say, of twelve or thirteen. It consisted of
heavy satchels and holdalls, but they gathered it up and trudged away,
not seeming to mind the weight. The road was through woods and
uphill--dark and steep and long. I tried to take the heavy valise from
the smallest one, telling her I would carry it myself. She did not
understand, of course, and resisted. I tried, then, to take the bag by
gentle force. This alarmed her. The courier came and explained that she
was afraid she was going to lose the trifle of money she was earning.

The courier told her this was not the case, but she looked doubtful and
concluded to hang on to a sure thing.

“How much is it she’s going to get?”

“She will charge about half a franc.”

“Then pay her _now_, and she’ll give up the bag.”

But that scheme failed, too. The child hung to the bag and seemed
distressed. No explanation could be got out of her, but one of the other
girls said the child was afraid that if she gave it up, the fact would
be used against her with tourists as proof that she was not strong
enough to carry their luggage for them, and so she would lose chances to
get work.

By and by the winding road carried us by an open space where we could
see very well--see the ruins of a burned-out little hamlet of the
humblest sort--stone walls with empty window holes, narrow alleys
cluttered with wreckage and fallen thatch, etc. Our girls were eager to
have us stop and view this wonder, the result of the only conflagration
they had ever seen, the only large event that had ever accented their
monotonous lives. It had happened a couple of months before, and the
villagers had lost everything, even to their stockings of savings, and
were too poor to rebuild their houses. A young woman, an old one, and
all the horses had been burned to death; the young girls said they could
take us among the ruins and show us the very spot.

We finally came out on the top of the hill, and there stood the castle,
a rather picturesque old stack of masonry with a walled yard about it
and an odd old stumpy tower in a corner of the yard handsomely clothed
in vines. The castle is a private residence, whose owner leaves it in
charge of his housekeeper and some menservants, and lives in Lyons
except when he wants to fish or shoot.

The courier had engaged rooms, but the fact had probably been forgotten,
for we had trouble in rousing the garrison. It was getting late and they
were asleep. Eventually a man unlocked and unbarred the door and led us
up a winding stair of heavy and very plain stonework. My bed was higher
from the floor than necessary. This is apparently the rule in old French
houses of the interior. But there is a stepladder.

In the morning I looked out of my window and saw the tops of trees below
me, thick and beautiful foliage, and below the trees was the bright blue
water of the lake shining in the sun. The window seemed to be about two
hundred feet above the water. An airy and inspiring situation, indeed. A
pope was born in that room a couple of centuries ago. I forget his name.

In that old day they built for utility, this was evident.
Everything--floors, sashes, shutters, beams, joists--were cheap, coarse,
ornamentless, but everlastingly solid and substantial. On the wall hung
an indication of the politics of the present owner. This was a small
photograph with “Philippe Comte de Paris” written under it.

The castle was ancient, in its way, but over the door of one of its
rooms there was a picture set in a frame whose profound antiquity made
all its surroundings seem modern and fresh. This frame was of good firm
oak, as black as a coal, and had once been part of a lake-dweller’s
house. It was already a thing of antiquity when the Romans were planting
colonies in France before the time of Christ. The remains of a number of
lake villages have been dug out of the mud of Lake Bourget.

Breakfast was served in the open air on a precipice in a little arbor
sheltered by vines, with glimpses through the tree tops of the blue
water far below, and with also a wide prospect of mountain scenery. The
coffee was the best I ever drank in Europe.

Presently there was a bugle blast from somewhere about the
battlements--a fine Middle Age effect--and after a moment it was
answered from the further shore of the lake, and we saw a boat put out
from that shore. It was ours. We were soon on board and away.

It was a roomy, long flatboat, very light and easy to manage--easy to
manage because its sides tapered a little toward both ends, and both
ends curved up free from the water and made the steering prompt and
easy. The rear half was sheltered from sun and rain by a temporary (and
removable) canopy stretched over hoop-pole arches, after the fashion of
the old-time wagon covers of the emigrants to California. We at once
rolled the sides of the canopy high up, so that we might have the breeze
and a free view on every hand.

On the other side of the lake we entered a narrow canal, and here we had
our last glimpse of that picturesque Châtillon perched on its high
promontory. The sides of the canal were walled with vines heavily laden
with black grapes. The vine leaves were white with the stuff which is
squirted on them from a thing like a fire extinguisher to kill the
calamitous phylloxera. We saw only one living creature for the first
lonely mile--a man with his extinguisher strapped on his back and hard
at his deadly work. I asked our admiral, Joseph Rougier, of the village
of Chanaz, if it would be a good idea to offer to sell this Sabbath
breaker a few choice samples of foreign phylloxera, and he said yes, if
one wanted to play the star part in an inquest.

At last two women and a man strolling churchward in their Sunday best
gave us a courteous hail and walked briskly along abreast of us, plying
the courier and the sailor with eager questions about our curious and
unaccountable project, and by the time they had got their fill and
dropped astern to digest the matter and finish wondering over it, we
were serene again and busy discussing the scenery; for now there was
really some scenery to look at, of a mild but pleasant type--low
precipices, a country road shaded by large trees, a few cozy thatched
cabins scattered along, and now and then an irruption of joyous children
who flocked to inspect us and admire, followed by friendly dogs who
stood and barked at us, but wagged their tails to say no offense was
intended.

Soon the precipice grew bolder, and presently Chanaz came in sight and
the canal bore us along its front--along its street, for it had only
one. We stepped ashore. There was a roll of distant drums, and soon a
company or two of French infantry came marching by. All the citizens
were out, and every male took off his hat politely as the soldiers moved
past him, and this salute was always returned by the officers.

I wanted envelopes, wine, grapes, and postage stamps, and was directed
to a stone stairway and told to go up one flight. Up there I found a
small well-smoked kitchen paved with worn-out bricks, with pots and pans
hanging about the walls, and a bent and humped woman of seventy cooking
a very frugal dinner. The tiredest dog I have seen this year lay asleep
under the stove, in a roasting heat, an incredible heat, a heat that
would have pulled a remark of the Hebrew children; but the dog slept
along with perfect serenity and did not seem to know that there was
anything the matter with the weather. The old woman set off her coffee
pot. Next she removed her pork chop to the table; it seemed to me that
this was premature--the dog was better done.

We asked for the envelopes and things; she motioned us to the left with
her ladle. We passed through a door and found ourselves in the smallest
wholesale and retail commercial house in the world, I suppose. The place
was not more than nine feet square. The proprietor was polite and
cheerful enough for a place five or six times as large. He was weighing
out two ounces of parched coffee for a little girl, and when the
balances came level at last he took off a light bean and put on a
heavier one in the handsomest way and then tied up the purchase in a
piece of paper and handed it to the child with as nice a bow as one
would see anywhere. In that shop he had a couple of bushels of wooden
shoes--a dollar’s worth, altogether, perhaps--but he had no other
articles in such lavish profusion. Yet he had a pound or so or a
dipperful of any kind of thing a person might want. You couldn’t buy two
things of a kind there, but you could buy one of any and every kind. It
was a useful shop, and a sufficient one, no doubt, yet its contents
could not have cost more than ten dollars. Here was home on a small
scale, but everything comfortable, no haggard looks visible, no
financial distress apparent. I got all the things I came for except
double-postage stamps for foreign service; I had to take domestic stamps
instead. The merchant said he kept a double-stamp in stock a couple of
years, but there was no market for it, so he sent it back to Paris,
because it was eating up its insurance. A careful man and thrifty; and
of such is the commonwealth of France.

We got some hot fried fish in Chanaz and took them aboard and cleared
out. With grapes and claret and bread they made a satisfactory luncheon.
We paddled a hundred yards, turned a rock corner, and here was the
furious gray current of the Rhône just a-whistling by! We crept into it
from the narrow canal, and laid in the oars. The floating was begun. One
needs no oar-help in a current like that. The shore seemed to fairly
spin past. Where the current assaults the heavy stone barriers thrown
out from the shores to protect the banks, it makes a break like the
break of a steamboat, and you can hear the roar a couple of hundred
yards off.

The river where we entered it was about a hundred yards wide, and very
deep. The water was at medium stage. The Rhône is not a very long
river--six hundred miles--but it carries a bigger mass of water to the
sea than any other French stream.

For the first few miles we had lonely shores--hardly ever a house. On
the left bank we had high precipices and domed hills; right bank low and
wooded.

At one point in the face of a precipice we saw a great cross (carved out
of the living rock, the Admiral said) forty feet above the carriage
road, where a doctor has had his tomb scooped in the rock and lies in
there safe from his surviving patients--if any.

At 1.25 P.M. we passed the slumbrous village of Massigneux de Rive on
the right and the ditto village of Huissier on the left (in Savoie). We
had to take all names by sound from the Admiral; he said nobody could
spell them. There was a ferry at the former village. A wire is stretched
across the river high overhead; along this runs a wheel which has ropes
leading down and made fast to the ferryboat in such a way that the
boat’s head is held farther upstream than its stern. This angle enables
the current to drive the boat across, and no other motive force is
needed. This would be a good thing on minor rivers in America.

2.10 P.M.--It is delightfully cool, breezy, shady (under the canopy),
and still. Much smoking and lazy reflecting. There is no sound but the
rippling of the current and the moaning of far-off breaks, except that
now and then the Admiral dips a screechy oar to change the course half a
point. In the distance one catches the faint singing and laughter of
playing children or the softened note of a church bell or town clock.
But the reposeful stillness--that is the charm--and the smooth swift
gliding--and the fresh, clear, lively, gray-green water. There was such
a rush, and boom, and life, and confusion, and activity in Geneva
yesterday--how remote all that seems now, how wholly vanished away and
gone out of this world!

2.15.--Village of Yenne. Iron suspension bridge. On the heights back of
the town a chapel with a tower like a thimble, and a very tall white
Virgin standing on it.

2.25.--Precipices on both sides now. River narrow--sixty yards.

2.30.--Immense precipice on right bank, with groups of buildings (Pierre
Châtel) planted on the very edge of it. In its near neighborhood a
massive and picturesque fortification.

All this narrow gut from the bridge down to the next bridge--a mile or
two--is picturesque with its frowning high walls of rock.

In the face of the precipice above the second bridge sits a painted
house on a rock bench--a chapel, we think, but the Admiral says it is
for the storage of wine.

More fortifications at the corner where the river turns--no cannon, but
narrow slits for musketry commanding the river. Also narrow slits in the
solid (hollowed-out) precipice. Perhaps there is no need of cannon here
where you can throw a biscuit across from precipice to precipice.

2.45.--Below that second bridge. On top of the bluffs more
fortifications. Low banks on both sides here.

2.50.--Now both sets of fortifications show up, look huge and
formidable, and are finely grouped. Through the glass they seem deserted
and falling to ruin. Out of date, perhaps.

One will observe, by these paragraphs, that the Rhône is swift enough to
keep one’s view changing with a very pleasant alacrity.

At midafternoon we passed a steep and lofty bluff--right bank--which was
crowned with the moldering ruins of a castle overgrown with trees. A
relic of Roman times, the Admiral said. Name? No, he didn’t know any
name for it. Had it a history? Perhaps; he didn’t know. Wasn’t there
even a legend connected with it? He didn’t know of any.

Not even a legend. One’s first impulse was to be irritated; whereas one
should be merely thankful; for if there is one sort of invention in this
world that is flatter than another, it is the average folklore legend.
It could probably be proven that even the adventures of the saints in
the Roman calendar are not of a lower grade as works of the inventor’s
art.

The dreamy repose, the infinite peace of these tranquil shores, this
Sabbath stillness, this noiseless motion, this strange absence of the
sense of sin, and the stranger absence of the desire to commit it--this
was the perfectest day the year had brought! Now and then we slipped
past low shores with grassy banks. A solitary thatched cottage close to
the edge, one or two big trees with dense foliage sheltering the
cottage, and the family in their Sunday, clothes grouped in the deep
shade, chatting, smoking, knitting, the dogs asleep about their feet,
the kittens helping with the knitting, and all hands content and
praising God without knowing it. We always got a friendly word of
greeting and returned it. One of these families contained eighteen sons,
and all were present. The Admiral was acquainted with everybody along
the banks, and with all the domestic histories, notwithstanding he was
so ineffectual on old Roman matters.

4.20.--Bronze statue of the Virgin on a sterile hill slope.

4.45.--Ruined Roman tower on a bluff. Belongs to the no-name series.

5.--Some more Roman ruins in the distance.

At 6 o’clock we rounded to. We stepped ashore in a woodsy and lonely
place and walked a short mile through a country lane to the sizable and
rather modern-looking village of St.-Genix. Part of the way we followed
another pleasure party--six or eight little children riding aloft on a
mountain of fragrant hay. This is the earliest form of the human
pleasure excursion, and for utter joy and perfect contentment it stands
alone in a man’s threescore years and ten; all that come after it have
flaws, but this has none.

We put up at the Hôtel Labully, in the little square where the church
stands. Satisfactory dinner. Later I took a twilight tramp along the
high banks of a moist ditch called the Guires River. If it was my river
I wouldn’t leave it outdoors nights, in this careless way, where any dog
can come along and lap it up. It is a tributary of the Rhône when it is
in better health.

It became dark while we were on our way back, and then the bicyclers
gave us many a sudden chill. They never furnished us an early warning,
but delivered the paralyzing shock of their rubber-horn hoot right at
our shoulder blades and then flashed spectrally by on their soundless
wheels and floated into the depths of the darkness and vanished from
sight before a body could collect his remark and get it out. Sometimes
they get shot. This is right.

I went to my room, No. 16. The floor was bare, which is the rule down
the Rhône. Its planks were light colored, and had been smoothed by use
rather than art; they had conspicuous black knots in them. The usual
high and narrow bed was there, with the usual little marble-topped
commode by the head of it and the usual strip of foot carpet alongside,
where you climb in. The wall paper was dark--which is usual on the
Continent; even in the northern regions of Germany, where the daylight
in winter is of such poor quality that they don’t even tax it now.

When I woke in the morning it was eight o’clock and raining hard, so I
stayed in bed and had my breakfast and a ripe old Paris paper of last
week brought up. It was a good breakfast--one often gets that; and a
liberal one--one seldom gets that. There was a big bowl for the coffee
instead of a stingy cup which has to be refilled just as you are getting
interested in it; there was a quart of coffee in the pot instead of a
scant half pint; instead of the usual hollow curl of brittle butter
which evades you when you try to scoop it on to the knife and crumbles
when you try to carve it, there was a solid cream-colored lump as big as
a brick; there was abundance of hot milk, and there was also the usual
ostensible cream of Europe. There _must_ be cream in Europe somewhere,
but it is not in the cows; they have been examined.

The rain continued to pour until noon, then the sun burst out and we
were soon up and filing through the village. By the time we had tramped
our mile and pushed out into the stream, the watches marked 1.10 and the
day was brilliant and perfect.

Over on the right were ruins of two castles, one of them of some size.

We passed under a suspension bridge; alongside of it was an iron bridge
of a later pattern. Near by was a little steamer lying at the bank with
no signs of life about her--the first boat, except ferryboats,
encountered since we had entered the Rhône. A lonely river, truly.

We drifted past lofty highlands, but there was nothing inspiring about
them. In Switzerland the velvet heights are sprinkled with homes clear
to the clouds, but these hills were sterile, desolate, gray, melancholy,
and so thin was the skin on them that the rocky bones showed through in
places.

1.30.--We seem lost in the intricate channels of an archipelago of flat
islands covered with bushes.

1.50.--We whirl around a corner into open river again, and observe that
a vast bank of leaden clouds is piling itself up on the horizon; the
tint thrown upon the distant stretches of water is rich and fine.

The river is wide now--a hundred and fifty yards--and without islands.
Suddenly it has become nearly currentless and is like a lake. The
Admiral explains that from this point for nine miles it is called L’Eau
Morte--Dead Water.

The region is not entirely barren of life, it seems--solitary woman
paddling a punt across the wide still pool.

The boat moved, but that is about all one could say. It was indolent
progress; still, it was comfortable. There were flaming sunshine behind
and that rich thunder gloom ahead, and now and then the fitful fanning
of a pleasant breeze.

A woman paddled across--a rather young woman with a face like the “Mona
Lisa.” I had seen the “Mona Lisa” only a little while before, and stood
two hours in front of that painting, repeating to myself: “People come
from around the globe to stand here and worship. What is it they find in
it?” To me it was merely a serene and subdued face, and there an end.
There might be more in it, but I could not find it. The complexion was
bad; in fact, it was not even human; there are no people of that color.
I finally concluded that maybe others still saw in the picture faded and
vanished marvels which _had_ been there once and were now forever
vanished.

Then I remembered something told me once by Noel Flagg,[3] the artist.
There was a time, he said, when he wasn’t yet an artist but thought he
was. His pictures sold, and gave satisfaction, and that seemed a
good-enough verdict. One day he was daubing away in his studio and
feeling good and inspired, when Dr. Horace Bushnell, that noble old
Roman, straggled in there without an invitation and fastened that deep
eye of his on the canvas. The youth was proud enough of such a call, and
glad there was something on the easel that was worthy of it. After a
long look the great divine said:

“You have talent, boy.” (That sounded good.) “What you want is
teaching.”

Teaching--he, an accepted and competent artist! He didn’t like that.
After another long look:

“Do you know the higher mathematics?”

“I? No, sir.”

“You must acquire them.”

“As a proper part of an artist’s training?” This with veiled irony.

“As an _essential_ part of it. Do you know anatomy?”

“No, sir.”

“You must learn how to dissect a body. What are you studying,
now--principally?”

“Nothing, I believe.”

“And the time flying, the time flying! Where are your books? What do you
read?”

“There they are, on the shelves.”

“I see. Poetry and romance. They must wait. Get to your mathematics and
your anatomy right away. Another point: you must train your eye--you
must teach yourself to see.”

“Teach myself to see? I believe I was born with that ability.”

“But nobody is born with a _trained_ ability--nobody. A cow sees--she
sees all the outsides of things, no doubt, but it is only the trained
eye that sees deeper, sees the soul of them, the meaning of them, the
spiritual essence. Are you sure that you see more than the cow sees? You
must go to Paris. You will never learn to see here. There they’ll teach
you; there they’ll train you; there they’ll work you like a slave; there
they’ll bring out the talent that’s in you. Be off! Don’t twaddle here
any longer!”

Flagg thought it over and resolved that the advice was worth taking. He
and his brother cleared for Paris. They put in their first afternoon
there scoffing at the works of the old masters in the Louvre. They
laughed at themselves for crossing a wide ocean to learn what masterly
painting might be by staring at these odious things. As for the “Mona
Lisa,” they exhausted their treasure of wit in making fun of it.

Next day they put themselves into the hands of the Beaux Arts people,
and that was the end of play. They had to start at the very bottom of
their trade and learn it over again, detail by detail, and learn it
_right_, this time. They slaved away, night and day for three months,
and wore themselves to shadows. Then they had a day off, and drifted
into the Louvre. Neither said a word for some time; each disliked to
begin; but at last, in front of the “Mona Lisa,” after standing mute
awhile one of them said:

“Speak out. Say it.”

“Say it yourself.”

“Well, then, we _were_ cows before!”

“Yes--it’s the right name for it. That is what we were. It is
unbelievable, the change that has come over these pictures in three
months. It is the difference between a landscape in the twilight and the
same landscape in the daytime.” Then they fell into each other’s arms.

This all came back to me, now, as I saw this living “Mona Lisa” punting
across L’Eau Morte.

2.40 P.M.--Made for a village on the right bank with all speed--Port de
Groslee. Remains of Roman aqueduct on hilltop back of village.
Rain!--Deluges of it. Took refuge in an inn on the bank--Hôtel des
Voyageurs. The public room was full of voyageurs and tobacco smoke. The
voyageurs may have been river folk in the old times when the inn was
built, but this present crowd was made up of teamsters. They sat at bare
tables, under their feet was the bare floor, about them were the four
bare walls--a dreary place at any time, a heart-breaking place now in
the dark of the downpour. However, it was manifestly not dreary to the
teamsters. They were sipping red wine and smoking; they all talked at
once, and with great energy and spirit, and every now and then they gave
their thighs a sounding slap and burst into a general horse laugh. The
courier said that this was in response to rude wit and coarse anecdotes.
The brace of modest-looking girls who were waiting on the teamsters did
not seem troubled. The courier said that they were used to all kinds of
language and were not defiled by it; that they had probably seldom heard
a spade called anything but a spade, therefore the foulest words came
innocent to their ears.

This inn was built of stone--of course; everybody’s house on the
Continent, from palace to hovel, is built of that dismal material, and
as a rule it is as square as a box and odiously plain and destitute of
ornament; it is formal, forbidding, and breeds melancholy thoughts in
people used to friendlier and more perishable materials of construction.
The frame house and the log house molder and pass away, even in the
builder’s time, and this makes a proper bond of sympathy and fellowship
between the man and his home; but the stone house remains always the
same to the person born in it; in his old age it is still as hard, and
indifferent, and unaffected by time as it was in the long-vanished days
of his childhood. The other kind of house shows by many touching signs
that it has noted his griefs and misfortunes and has felt for them, but
the stone house doesn’t--it is not of his evanescent race, it has no
kinship with him, nor any interest in him.

A professional letter writer happened along presently, and one of the
young girls got him to write a letter for her. It seemed strange that
she could not write it herself. The courier said that the peasant women
of the Rhône do not care for education, but only for religion; that they
are all good Catholics, and that their main ambition in life is to see
the Rhône’s long procession of stone and bronze Virgins added to, until
the river shall be staked out with them from end to end; and that their
main pleasure in life is to contribute from their scant centimes to this
gracious and elevating work. He says it is a quite new caprice; that ten
years ago there was not a Virgin in this part of France at all, and
never had been. This may be true, and, of course, there is nothing
unreasonable about it, but I have already found out that the courier’s
statements are not always exact.

I had a hot fried fish and coffee in a garden shed roofed with a mat of
vines, but the rain came through in streams and I got drenched in spite
of our umbrellas, for one cannot manage table implements and umbrellas
all at the same time with anything like good success.

_Mem._--Last evening, for economy’s sake, proposed to be a Frenchman
because Americans and English are always overcharged. Courier said it
wouldn’t deceive unless I played myself for a deaf-and-dumb
Frenchman--which I did, and so the rooms were only a franc and a half
each. But the Admiral must have let it out that I was only deaf and dumb
in French, for prices were raised in the bill this morning.

4.10 P.M.--Left Port de Groslee.

4.50 P.M.--Château of the Count Cassiloa--or something like that--the
Admiral’s pronunciation is elusive. Courier guesses the spelling at
“Quintionat.” I don’t quite see the resemblance. This courier’s
confidence in himself is a valuable talent. He must be descended from
the idiot who taught our forefathers to spell tizzik with a _ph_ and a
_th_.

The river here is as still and smooth and nearly as dead as a lake. The
water is swirly, though, and consequently makes uneasy steering.

River seems to draw together and greatly narrow itself below the count’s
house. No doubt the current will smarten up there.

Three new quarries along here. Dear me! how little there is in the way
of sight-seeing, when a quarry is an event! Remarked upon with
contentment.

Swept through the narrow canallike place with a good current.

On the left-hand point below, bush-grown ruins of an ancient convent
(St. Alban’s), picturesquely situated on a low bluff. There is a higher
and handsomer bluff a trifle lower down. How did they overlook it? Those
people generally went for the best, not second best. Shapely hole in
latter bluff one hundred feet above the water--anchorite’s nest?
Interesting-looking hole, and would have cost but little time and
trouble to examine it, but it was not done. It is no matter; one can
find other holes.

At last, below bluffs, we find some greensward--not extensive, but a
pleasant novelty.

5.30.--Lovely sunset. Mottled clouds richly painted by sinking sun, and
fleecy shreds of clouds drifting along the fronts of neighboring blue
mountains. Harrow in a field. Apparently harrow, but was distant and
could not tell; could have been a horse.

5.35.--Very large gray broken-arched and unusually picturesque ruin
crowning a hilltop on right. Name unknown. This is a liberal mile above
village of Briord (my spelling--the Admiral’s pronunciation), on same
side. Passed the village swiftly, and left it behind. The villagers came
out and made fun of our strange tub. The dogs chased us and were more
noisy than necessary.

6 P.M.--Another suspension bridge--this is the sixth one. They have
ceased to interest. There was nothing exciting about them, from the
start. Presently landed on left bank and shored the boat for the night.
Hôtel du Rhône Moine. Isolated. Situated right on the bank. Sort of a
village--villagette, to be exact--a little back. Hôtel is two stories
high and not pretentious--family dwelling and cow stable all under one
roof.

I had been longing to have personal experience of peasant life--be “on
the inside” and see it for myself, instead of at second hand in books.
This was an opportunity and I was excited about it and glad. The kitchen
was not clean, but it was a sociable place, and the family were kind and
full of good will. There were three little children, a young girl,
father, mother, grandparents, some dogs, and a plurality of cats. There
was no discord; perfect harmony prevailed.

Our table was placed on the lawn on the river bank. One had no right to
expect any finer style here than he would find in the cheapest and
shabbiest little tavern in America, for the Hôtel du Rhône Moine was for
foot wanderers and laborers on the flatboats that convey stone and sand
and wood to Lyons, yet the style _was_ superior--very much so. The
tablecloth was white, and it and the table furniture were perfectly
clean. We had a fish of a pretty coarse grain, but it was fresh from the
river and hot from the pan; the bread was good, there was abundance of
excellent butter, the milk was rich and pure, the sugar was white, the
coffee was considerably better than that which is furnished by the
choice hotels of the capitals of the Continent. Thus far, peasant life
was a disappointment, it was so much better than anything we were used
to at home in some respects. Two of the dogs came out, presently, and
sat down by the table and rested their chins on it, and so remained. It
was not to beg, for they showed no interest in the supper; they were
merely there to be friendly, it was the only idea they had. A squadron
of cats came out by and by and sat down in the neighborhood and looked
me over languidly, then wandered away without passion, in fact with what
looked like studied indifference. Even the cats and the dogs are well
and sufficiently fed at the Hôtel du Rhône Moine--their dumb testimony
was as good as speech.

I went to bed early. It is inside the house, not outside, that one
really finds the peasant life. Our rooms were over the stable, and this
was not an advantage. The cows and horses were not very quiet, the smell
was extraordinary, the fleas were a disorderly lot, and these things
helped the coffee to keep one awake. The family went to bed at nine and
got up at two. The beds were very high; one could not climb into them
without the help of a chair; and as they were narrow and arched, there
was danger of rolling out in case one drifted into dreams of an
imprudent sort. These lofty bedsteads were not high from caprice, but
for a purpose--they contained chests of drawers, and the drawers were
full of clothing and other family property. On the table in my room were
some bright-colored, even gorgeous little waxen saints and a Virgin
under bell-glasses; also the treasures of the house--jewelry and a
silver watch. It was not costly jewelry, but it was jewelry, at any
rate, and without doubt the family valued it. I judged that this
household were accustomed to having honest guests and neighbors or they
would have removed these things from the room when I entered it, for I
do not look honester than others.

Not that I have always thought in this way about myself, for I haven’t.
I thought the reverse until the time I lost my overcoat, once, when I
was going down to New York to see the Water Color exhibition, and had a
sort of adventure in consequence. The house had been robbed in the
night, and when I came downstairs to rush for the early train there was
no overcoat. It was a raw day, and when I got to New York at noon I grew
colder and colder as I walked along down the Avenue. When I reached East
Thirty-fourth street I stopped on the corner and began to consider. It
seemed to me that it must have been just about there that Smith,[4] the
artist, took me one winter’s night, with others, five years before, and
caroused us with roasted oysters and Southern stories and hilarity in
his fourth story until three or four in the morning; and now if I could
only call to mind which of those houses over the way was his, I could
borrow an overcoat. All the time that I was thinking and standing there
and trying to recollect, I was dimly conscious of a figure near me, but
only dimly, very dimly; but now as I came out of my reverie and found
myself gazing, rapt but totally unconscious, at one of the houses over
there, that figure solidified itself and became at once the most
conspicuous thing in the landscape. It was a policeman. He was standing
not six feet away, and was gazing as intently at my face as I had been
gazing at the house. I was embarrassed--it is always embarrassing to
come to yourself and find a stranger staring at you. You blush, even
when you have not been doing any harm. So I blushed--a thing that does
not commend a person to a policeman; also I tried to smile a placating
smile, but it did not get any response, so then I tried to make it a
kind of friendly smile, which was a mistake, because that only hardens a
policeman, and I saw at once that this smile had hardened this one and
made my situation more difficult than ever; and so, naturally, my
judgment being greatly impaired by now, I spoke--which was an error,
because in these circumstances one cannot arrange without reflection a
remark which will not seem to have a kind of suspicious something about
it to a policeman, and that was what happened this time; for I had
fanned up that haggard smile again, which had been dying out when I
wasn’t noticing, and said:

“Could you tell me, please, if there’s a Mr. Smith lives over there
in----”

“_What_ Smith?”

That rude abruptness drove his other name out of my mind; and as I saw I
never should be able to think of it with the policeman standing there
cowing me with his eye, that way, it seemed to me best to get out a name
of some kind, so as to avert further suspicion, therefore I brought out
the first one which came into my mind, which was John--another error.
The policeman turned purple--apparently with a sense of injury and
insult--and said there were a million John Smiths in New York, and
_which_ one was this? Also what did I want with Smith? I could not
remember--the overcoat was gone out of my mind. So I told him he was a
pupil of mine and that I was giving him lessons in morals; moral
culture--a new system.

That was a lucky hit, anyway. I was merely despicable, now, to the
policeman, but harmless--I could see it in his eye. He looked me over a
moment then said:

“You give him lessons, do you?”

“Yes, sir.”

“How long have you been giving him lessons?”

“Two years, next month.” I was getting my wind again, and confidence.

“Which house does he live in?”

“That one--the middle one in the block.”

“Then what did you ask _me_ for, a minute ago?”

I did not see my way out. He waited for an answer, but got tired before
I could think of one that would fit the case and said:

“How is it that you haven’t an overcoat on, such a day as this?”

“I--well, I never wear them. It doesn’t seem cold to me.”

He thought awhile, with his eye on me, then said, with a sort of sigh:

“Well, maybe you are all right--I don’t know--but you want to walk
pretty straight while you are on my beat; for, morals or no morals,
blamed if I take much stock in you. Move on, now.”

Then he turned away, swinging his club by its string. But his eye was
over his shoulder, my way; so I had to cross to that house, though I
didn’t want to, any more. I did not expect it to be Smith’s house, now
that I was so out of luck, but I thought I would ring and ask, and if it
proved to be some one else’s house, then I would explain that I had come
to examine the gas meter and thus get out the back way and be all right
again. The door was opened by a middle-aged matron with a gentle and
friendly face, and she had a sweet serenity about her that was a notable
contrast to my nervous flurry. I asked after Smith and if he lived
there, and to my surprise and gratitude she said that this was his home.

“Can I see him? Can I see him right away--immediately?”

No; he was gone downtown. My rising hopes fell to ruin.

“Then can I see Mrs. Smith?”

But alas and alas! she was gone downtown with him. In my distress I was
suddenly smitten by one of those ghastly hysterical inspirations, you
know, when you want to do an insane thing just to astonish and petrify
somebody; so I said, with a rather overdone pretense of playful ease and
assurance:

“Ah, this is a very handsome overcoat on the hat rack--be so good as to
lend it to me for a day or two!”

“With pleasure,” she said--and she had the coat on me before I knew what
had happened. It had been my idea to astonish and petrify her, but I was
the person astonished and petrified, myself. So astonished and so
petrified, in fact, that I was out of the house and gone, without a
thank-you or a question, before I came to my senses again. Then I
drifted slowly along, reflecting--reflecting pleasantly. I said to
myself, “She simply divined my character by my face--what a far clearer
intuition she had than that policeman.” The thought sent a glow of
self-satisfaction through me.

Then a hand was laid on my shoulder and I shrank together with a crash.
It was the policeman. He scanned me austerely and said:

“Where did you get that overcoat?”

Although I had not been doing any harm, I had all the sense of being
caught--caught in something disreputable. The officer’s accusing eye and
unbelieving aspect heightened this effect. I told what had befallen me
at the house in as straightforward a way as I could, but I was ashamed
of the tale, and looked it, without doubt, for I knew and felt how
improbable it must necessarily sound to anybody, particularly a
policeman. Manifestly he did not believe me. He made me tell it all over
again, then he questioned me:

“You don’t know the woman?”

“No, I don’t know her.”

“Haven’t the least idea who she is?”

“Not the least.”

“You didn’t tell her your name?”

“No.”

“She didn’t ask for it?”

“No.”

“You just asked her to lend you the overcoat, and she let you take it?”

“She put it on me herself.”

“And didn’t look frightened?”

“Frightened? Of course not.”

“Not even surprised?”

“Not in the slightest degree.”

He paused. Presently he said:

“My friend, I don’t believe a word of it. Don’t you see, yourself, it’s
a tale that won’t wash? Do _you_ believe it?”

“Yes. I know it’s true.”

“Weren’t you surprised?”

“Clear through to the marrow!”

He had been edging me along back to the house. He had a deep design; he
sprung it on me now. Said he:

“Stop where you are. I’ll mighty soon find out!”

He walked to the door and up the steps, keeping a furtive eye out toward
me and ready to jump for me if I ran. Then he pretended to pull the
bell, and instantly faced about to observe the effect on me. But there
wasn’t any; I walked toward him instead of running away. That unsettled
him. He came down the steps, evidently perplexed, and said:

“Well, I can’t make it out. It may be all right, but it’s too many for
me. I don’t like your looks and I won’t have such characters around. Go
along, now, and look sharp. If I catch you prowling around here again
I’ll run you _in_.”

I found Smith at the Water Color dinner that night, and asked him if it
were merely my face that had enabled me to borrow the overcoat from a
stranger, but he was surprised and said:

“No! What an idea--and what intolerable conceit! She is my housekeeper,
and remembered your drawling voice from overhearing it a moment that
night four or five years ago in my house; so she knew where to send the
police if you didn’t bring the coat back!”

After all those years I was sitting here, now, at midnight in the
peasant hotel, in my night clothes, and honoring womankind in my
thoughts; for here was another woman, with the noble and delicate
intuitions of her sex, trusting me, a total stranger, with all her
modest wealth. She entered the room, just then, and stood beaming upon
me a moment with her sweet matronly eyes--then took away the jewelry.

_Tuesday, September 22d._--Breakfast in open air. Extra canvas was now
to be added to the boat’s hood to keep the passengers and valises better
protected during rainstorms. I passed through the villagette and started
to walk over the wooded hill, the boat to find us on the river bank
somewhere below, by and by. I soon got lost among the high bushes and
turnip gardens. Plenty of paths, but none went to river. Reflection.
Decision--that the path most traveled was the one leading in the right
direction. It was a poor conclusion. I got lost again; this time worse
than before. But a peasant of above eighty (as she said, and certainly
she was very old and wrinkled and gray and bent) found me presently and
undertook to guide me safely. She was vigorous, physically, prompt and
decided of movement, and altogether soldierlike; and she had a hawk’s
eye and beak, and a gypsy’s complexion. She said that from her girlhood
up to not so very many years ago she had done a man’s work on a woman’s
pay on the big keel boats that carry stone down the river, and was as
good a man as the best, in the matter of handling stone. Said she had
seen the great Napoleon when she was a little child. Her face was so
wrinkled and dark and so eaglelike that she reminded me of old Indians
one sees out on the Great Plains--the outside signs of age, but in the
eye an indestructible spirit. She had a couple of laden baskets with her
which I had found heavy after three minutes’ carrying, when she was
finding the way for me, but they seemed nothing to her. She impressed
one rather as a man than as a woman; and so, when she spoke of her child
that was drowned, and her voice broke a little and her lip quivered, it
surprised me; I was not expecting it. “Grandchild?” No--it was her own
child. “Indeed? When?” So then it came out that it was sixty years ago.
It seemed strange that she should mind it so long. But that was the
woman of it, no doubt. She had a fragment of newspaper--religious--with
rude holy woodcuts in it and doubtful episodes in the lives of mediæval
saints and anchorites--and she could read these instructive matters in
fine print without glasses; also, her eyes were as good at long
distances. She led hither and thither among the paths and finally
brought me out overlooking the river. There was a steep sandy frontage
there, where there had recently been a small landslide, and the faint
new path ran straight across it for forty feet, like a slight snow track
along the slant of a very steep roof. I halted and declined. I had no
mind to try the crumbly path and creep and quake along it with the
boiling river--and maybe some rocks--under my elbow thirty feet below.
Such places turn my stomach. The old woman took note of me, understood,
and said what sounded like, “_Lass’ ma allez au premier_”--then she
tramped briskly and confidently across with her baskets, sending
miniature avalanches of sand and gravel down into the river with each
step. One of her feet plowed from under her, about midway, but she
snatched it back and marched on, not seeming to mind it. My pride urged
me to move along, and put me to shame. After a time the old woman came
back and coaxed me to try, and did at last get me started in her wake
and I got as far as midway all right; but then to hearten me still more
and show me how easy and safe it was, she began to prance and dance her
way along, with her knuckles in her hips, kicking a landslide loose with
every skip. The exhibition struck a cold panic through me and made my
brain swim. I leaned against the slope and said I would stay there until
the boat came and testified as to whether there were rocks under me or
not. For the third time in my life I was in that kind of a fix--in a
place where I could not go backward or forward, and mustn’t stay where I
was. The boat was a good while coming, but it seemed longer than that.
Where I was, the slope was like a roof; where the slope ended the wall
was perpendicular thence to the water, and one could not see over and
tell what the state of things might be down there. When the boat came
along, the courier said there was nothing down there but deep water--no
rocks. I did not mind the water; so my fears disappeared, now, and I
finished my march without discomfort. I gave the old woman some money,
which pleased her very much and she tried her grateful best to give us a
partridge, newly killed, which she rummaged out of one of her baskets,
and seemed disappointed when I would not take it. But I couldn’t; it
would have been a shabby act. Then she went her way with her heavy
baskets and I got aboard and afloat once more, feeling a great respect
for her and very friendly toward her. She waved a good-by every now and
then till her figure faded out in the plain, joining that interminable
procession of friends made and lost in an hour that drifts past a man’s
life from cradle to grave and returns on its course no more. The courier
said she was probably a poacher and stole the partridge.

The courier was not able to understand why I had not nerve enough to
walk along a crumbling slope with a precipice only thirty feet high
below me; but I had no difficulty in understanding it. It is
constitutional with me to get nervous and incapable under the
probability of getting myself dropped thirty feet on to a pile of rocks;
it does not come from culture. Some people are made in one way, and some
in another--and the above is my way. Some people who can skirt
precipices without a tremor have a strong dread of the dentist’s chair,
whereas I was born without any prejudices against the dentist’s chair;
when in it I am interested, am not in a hurry, and do not greatly mind
the pain. Taken by and large, my style of make has advantages over the
other, I think. Few of us are obliged to circumnavigate precipices, but
we all have to take a chance at the dental chair.

People who early learn the right way to choose a dentist have their
reward. Professional superiority is not everything; it is only part. All
dentists talk while they work. They have inherited this from their
professional ancestors, the barbers. The dentist who talks well--other
things being equal--is the one to choose. He tells anecdotes all the
while and keeps his man so interested and entertained that he hardly
notices the flight of time. For he not only tells anecdotes that are
good in themselves, but he adds nice shadings to them with his
instruments as he goes along, and now and then brings out effects which
could not be produced with any other kind of tools at all. All the time
that such a dentist as this is plowing down into a cavity with that
spinning gouge which he works with a treadle, it is observable that he
has found out where he has uncovered a nerve down in there, and that he
only visits it at intervals, according to the needs of his anecdote,
touching it lightly, very lightly and swiftly, now and then, to brighten
up some happy conceit in his tale and call a delicate electric attention
to it; and all the while he is working gradually and steadily up toward
his climax with veiled and consummate art--then at last the spindle
stops whirling and thundering in the cavity, and you know that the grand
surprise is imminent, now--is hanging in the very air. You can hear your
heart beat as the dentist bends over you with his grip on the spindle
and his voice diminished to a murmur. The suspense grows
bigger--bigger--bigger--your breath stops--then your heart. Then with
lightning suddenness the “nub” is sprung and the spindle drives into the
raw nerve! The most brilliant surprises of the stage are pale and
artificial compared with this.

It is believed by people generally--or at least by many--that the
exquisitely sharp sensation which results from plunging the steel point
into the raw nerve is pain, but I think that this is doubtful. It is so
vivid and sudden that one has no time to examine properly into its
character. It is probably impossible, with our human limitations, to
determine with certainty whether a sensation of so high and perfect an
order as that is pain or whether it is pleasure. Its location brings it
under the disadvantage of a common prejudice; and so men mistake it for
pain when they might perceive that it is the opposite of that if it were
anywhere but in a tooth. I may be in error, but I have experimented with
it a great deal and I am satisfied in my own mind that it is not pain.
It is true that it always feels like pain, but that proves nothing--ice
against a naked back always passes for fire. I have every confidence
that I can eventually prove to everyone’s satisfaction that a nerve-stab
produces pleasure; and not only that, but the most exquisite pleasure,
the most perfect felicity which we are capable of feeling. I would not
ask more than to be remembered hereafter as the man who conferred this
priceless benefaction upon his race.

11.30.--Approaching the Falls of the Rhône. Canal to the left, walled
with compact and beautiful masonry. It is a cut-off. We could pass
through it and avoid the Falls--are advised by the Admiral to do it, but
all decline, preferring to have a dangerous adventure to talk about.

However....

The truth is, the current began to grow ominously swift--and presently
pretty lumpy and perturbed; soon we seemed to be simply flying past the
shores. Then all of a sudden three hundred yards of boiling and tossing
river burst upon our sight through the veiling tempest of rain! I did
not see how our flimsy ark could live through such a place. If we were
wrecked, swimming could not save us; the packed multitude of tall humps
of water meant a bristling chaos of big rocks underneath, and the first
rock we hit would break our bones. If I had been fortified with
ignorance I might have wanted to stay in the boat and see the fun; but I
have had much professional familiarity with water, and I doubted if
there was going to be any fun there. So I said I would get out and walk,
and I did. I need not tell anybody at home; I could leave out the Falls
of the Rhône; they are not on the map, anyhow. If an adventure worth
recording resulted, the Admiral and the courier would have it, and that
would answer. I could see it from the bank--nothing could be better; it
seemed even providential.

I ran along the bank in the driving rain, and enjoyed the sight to the
full. I never saw a finer show than the passage of that boat was,
through the fierce turmoil of water. Alternately she rose high and
plunged deep, throwing up sheets of foaming spray and shaking them off
like a mane. Several times she seemed to fairly bury herself, and I
thought she was gone for good, but always she sprang high aloft the next
moment, a gallant and stirring spectacle to see. The Admiral’s steering
was great. I had not seen the equal of it before.

The boat waited for me down at the Villebois bridge, and I presently
caught up and went aboard. There was a stretch of a hundred yards of
offensively rough water below the bridge, but it had no dangerous
features about it. Still, I was obliged to claim that it had, and that
these perils were much greater than the others.

Noon.--A mile of perpendicular precipices--very handsome. On the left,
at the termination of this stately wall, a darling little old tree-grown
ruin abreast a wooded islet with a large white mansion on it. Near that
ruin nature has gotten up a clever counterfeit of one, tree-grown and
all that, and, as its most telling feature, has furnished it a battered
monolith that stands up out of the underbrush by itself and looks as if
men had shaped it and put it there and time had gnawed it and worn it.

This is the prettiest piece of river we have found. All its aspects are
dainty and gracious and alluring.

1 P.M.--Château de la Salette. This is the port of the Grotte de la
Balme, “one of the seven wonders of Dauphiny.” It is across a plain in
the face of a bluff a mile from the river. A grotto is out of the common
order, and I should have liked to see this one, but the rains have made
the mud very deep and it did not seem well to venture so long a trip
through it.

2.15 P.M.--St.-Etienne. On a distant ridge inland a tall openwork
structure commandingly situated, with a statue of the Virgin standing on
it.

Immense empty freight barges being towed upstream by teams of two and
four big horses--not on the bank, but under it; not on the land, but
always in the water--sometimes breast deep--and around the big flat
bars.

We reached a not very promising-looking village about four o’clock, and
concluded to land; munching fruit and filling the hood with pipe smoke
had grown monotonous. We could not have the hood furled, because the
floods of rain fell unceasingly. The tavern was on the river bank, as is
the custom. It was dull there, and melancholy--nothing to do but look
out of the window into the drenching rain and shiver; one could do that,
for it was bleak and cold and windy, and there was no fire. Winter
overcoats were not sufficient; they had to be supplemented with rugs.
The raindrops were so large and struck the river with such force that
they knocked up the water like pebble splashes.

With the exception of a very occasional wooden-shod peasant, nobody was
abroad in this bitter weather--I mean of our sex. But all weathers are
alike to the women in these continental countries. To them and the other
animals life is serious; nothing interrupts their slavery. Three of them
were washing clothes in the river under the window when we arrived, and
they continued at it as long as there was light to work by. One was
apparently thirty; another--the mother?--above fifty; the
third--grandmother?--so old and worn and gray she could have passed for
eighty. They had no waterproofs or rubbers, of course; over their heads
and shoulders they wore gunny sacks--simply conductors for rivers of
water; some of the volume reached ground, the rest soaked in on the way.

At last a vigorous fellow of thirty-five arrived, dry and comfortable,
smoking his pipe under his big umbrella in an open donkey cart--husband,
son, and grandson of those women? He stood up in the cart, sheltering
himself, and began to superintend, issuing his orders in a masterly tone
of command, and showing temper when they were not obeyed swiftly enough.
Without complaint or murmur the drowned women patiently carried out the
orders, lifting the immense baskets of soaked clothing into the cart and
stowing them to the man’s satisfaction. The cart being full now, he
descended, with his umbrella, entered the tavern, and the women went
drooping homeward in the wake of the cart, and soon were blended with
the deluge and lost to sight. We would tar and feather that fellow in
America, and ride him on a rail.

When we came down into the public room he had his bottle of wine and
plate of food on a bare table black with grease, and was chomping like a
horse. He had the little religious paper which is in everybody’s hands
on the Rhône borders, and was enlightening himself with the histories of
French saints who used to flee to the desert in the Middle Ages to
escape the contamination of women.

Wednesday.--After breakfast, got under way. Still storming as hard as
ever. The whole land looks defeated and discouraged. And very lonely;
here and there a woman in the fields. They merely accent the loneliness.

  NOTE.--The record ends here. Luxurious enjoyment of the excursion
  rendered the traveler indifferent to his notes. The drift continued to
  Arles, whence Mark Twain returned to Geneva and Ouchy by rail. Ten
  years later he set down another picture of this happy journey--“The
  Lost Napoleon”--which follows.--A. B. P.

                           THE LOST NAPOLEON


The lost Napoleon is a part of a mountain range. Several miles of
it--say six. When you stand at the right viewpoint and look across the
plain, there, miles away, stretched out on his back under the sky, you
see the great Napoleon, sleeping, with his arm folded upon his breast.
You recognize him at once and you catch your breath and a thrill goes
through you from head to foot--a most natural thing to happen, for you
have never been so superbly astonished in your life before, and you
realize, if you live a century, it is not likely that you will ever
encounter the like of that tremendous surprise again. You see, it is
unique. You have seen mountain ridges before that looked like men lying
down, but there was always some one to pilot you to the right viewpoint,
and prepare you for the show, and then tell you which is the head and
which the feet and which the stomach, and at last you get the idea and
say, “Yes, now I see it, now I make it out--it is a man, and wonderful,
too.” But all this has damaged the surprise and there is not much
thrill; moreover, the man is only a third-rate celebrity or no celebrity
at all--he is no Napoleon the Great. But I discovered this stupendous
Napoleon myself and was caught wholly by surprise, hence the splendid
emotion, the uplifting astonishment.

We have all seen mountains that looked like whales, elephants, recumbent
lions--correctly figured, too, and a pleasure to look upon--but we did
not discover them, somebody pointed them out to us, and in the same
circumstances we have seen and enjoyed stately crags and summits known
to the people thereabouts as “The Old Man’s Head,” “The Elephant’s
Head,” “Anthony’s Nose,” “The Lady’s Head,” etc., and we have seen
others that were named “Shakespeare’s Head,” and “Satan’s Head,” but
still the fine element of surprise was in almost all cases wanting.

The Lost Napoleon is easily the most colossal and impressive statue in
the world. It is several miles long; in form and proportions it is
perfect. It represents Napoleon himself and not another; and there is
something about the dignity and repose of the great figure that stirs
the imagination and half persuades it that this is not an unsentient
artifice of nature, but the master of the world sentient and
dreaming--dreaming of battle, conquest, empire. I call it the Lost
Napoleon because I cannot remember just where I was when I saw it. My
hope, in writing this, is that I may move some wandering tourist or
artist to go over my track and seek for it--seek for it, find it, locate
it exactly, describe it, paint it, and so preserve it against loss
again.

My track was down the Rhône; I made the excursion ten or eleven years
ago in the pleasantest season of the year. I took a courier with me and
went from Geneva a couple of hours by rail to the blue little Lake
Bourget, and spent the night in a mediæval castle on an island in that
little lake. In the early morning our boat came for us. It was a roomy
open boat fifteen or twenty feet long, with a single pair of long oars,
and with it came its former owner, a sturdy big boatman. The boat was
mine now; I think I paid five dollars for it. I was to pay the boatman a
trifling daily wage and his keep, and he was to take us all the way down
the Rhône to Marseilles. It was warm weather and very sunny, but we
built a canvas arch, like a wagon cover, over the aftermost third of the
boat, with a curtain at its rear which could be rolled up to let the
breeze blow through, and I occupied that tent and was always
comfortable. The sailor sat amidships and manned the oars, and the
courier had the front third of the boat to himself. We crossed the lake
and went winding down a narrow canal bordered by peasant houses and
vineyards, and after about a league of this navigation we came in sight
of the Rhône, a troubled gray stream which went tearing past the mouth
of the peaceful canal at a racing gait. We emerged into it and laid in
the oars. We could go fast enough in that current without artificial
aid. During the first days we slipped along down the curving bends at a
speed of about five miles an hour, but it slackened later.

Our days were all about alike. About four in the afternoon we tied up at
a village and I dined on the greensward in front of the inn by the
water’s edge, on the choicest chickens, vegetables, fruit, butter, and
bread, prepared in French perfection and served upon the whitest linen;
and as a rule I had the friendly house cat and dog for guests and
company and willing and able helpers. I slept in the inn; often in clean
and satisfactory quarters, sometimes in the same room with the cows and
the fleas. I breakfasted on the lawn in the morning with cat and dog
again; then laid in a stock of grapes and other fruits gathered fresh
from the garden and some bottles of red wine made on the premises, and
at eight or nine we went floating down the river again. At noon we went
ashore at a village, bought a freshly caught fish or two, had them
broiled, got some bread and vegetables, and set sail again at once. We
always lunched on board as we floated along. I spent my days reading
books, making notes, smoking, and in other lazy and enchanting ways, and
had the delightfulest ten-day voyage I have ever experienced.

It took us ten days to float to Arles. There the current gave out and I
closed the excursion and returned to Geneva by rail. It was twenty-eight
miles to Marseilles, and we should have been obliged to row. That would
not have been pleasure; it would have meant work for the sailor, and I
do not like work even when another person does it.

I think it was about the eighth day that I discovered Napoleon. My notes
cover four or five days; there they stop; the charm of the trip had
taken possession of me, and I had no energy left. It was getting toward
four in the afternoon--time to tie up for the day. Down ahead on the
right bank I saw a compact jumble of yellowy-browny cubes stacked
together, some on top of the others, and no visible cracks in the mass,
and knew it for a village--a village common to that region down there; a
village jammed together without streets or alleys, substantially--where
your progress is mainly _through_ the houses, not _by_ them, and where
privacy is a thing practically unknown; a village which probably hadn’t
had a house added to the jumble for five hundred years. We were anywhere
from half a mile to a mile above the village when I gave the order to
proceed to that place and tie up. Just then I glanced to my left toward
the distant mountain range, and got that soul-stirring shock which I
have said so much about. I pointed out the grand figure to the courier,
and said:

“Name it. Who is it?”

“Napoleon!”

“Yes, it is Napoleon. Show it to the sailor and ask him to name it.”

The sailor said, “Napoleon.” We watched the figure all the time then
until we reached the village. We walked up the river bank in the morning
to see how far one might have to go before the shape would materially
change, but I do not now remember the result. We watched it afterward as
we floated away from the village, but I cannot remember at what point
the shape began to be marred. However, the mountains being some miles
away, I think that the figure would be recognizable as Napoleon along a
stretch of as much as a mile above and a mile below the village, though
I think that the likeness would be strongest at the point where I first
saw it--that is, half a mile or more above the village.

We talked the grand apparition over at great length and with a strong
interest. I said I believed that if its presence were known to the world
such shoals of tourists would come flocking there to see it that all the
spare ground would soon be covered with hotels; and I think so yet. I
think it would soon be the most celebrated natural curiosity on the
planet, that it would be more visited than Niagara or the Alps, and that
all the other famous natural curiosities of the globe would fall to a
rank away below it. I think so still.

There is a line of lumbering and thundering great freight steamers on
the Rhône, and I think that if some man will board one of them at Arles
and make a trip of some hours upstream--say from three to six--and keep
an eye out to the right and watch that mountain range he will be certain
to find the Lost Napoleon and have no difficulty in rediscovering the
mighty statue when he comes to the right point. It will cost nothing to
make the experiment, and I hope it will be done.

  NOTE.--Mark Twain’s biographer rediscovered it in 1913. It is some
  miles below Valence, opposite the village of Beauchastel.




                       SOME NATIONAL STUPIDITIES
                              (1891-1892)


The slowness of one section of the world about adopting the valuable
ideas of another section of it is a curious thing and unaccountable.
This form of stupidity is confined to no community, to no nation; it is
universal. The fact is the human race is not only slow about borrowing
valuable ideas--it sometimes persists in not borrowing them at all.

Take the German stove, for instance--the huge white porcelain monument
that towers toward the ceiling in the corner of the room, solemn,
unsympathetic, and suggestive of death and the grave--where can you find
it outside of the German countries? I am sure I have never seen it where
German was not the language of the region. Yet it is by long odds the
best stove and the most convenient and economical that has yet been
invented.[5]

To the uninstructed stranger it promises nothing; but he will soon find
that it is a masterly performer, for all that. It has a little bit of a
door which you couldn’t get your head into--a door which seems foolishly
out of proportion to the rest of the edifice; yet the door is right, for
it is not necessary that bulky fuel shall enter it. Small-sized fuel is
used, and marvelously little of that. The door opens into a tiny cavern
which would not hold more fuel than a baby could fetch in its arms. The
process of firing is quick and simple. At half past seven on a cold
morning the servant brings a small basketful of slender pine sticks--say
a modified armful--and puts half of these in, lights them with a match,
and closes the door. They burn out in ten or twelve minutes. He then
puts in the rest and _locks_ the door, and carries off the key. The work
is done. He will not come again until next morning. All day long and
until past midnight all parts of the room will be delightfully warm and
comfortable, and there will be no headaches and no sense of closeness or
oppression. In an American room, whether heated by steam, hot water, or
open fires, the neighborhood of the register or the fireplace is
warmest--the heat is not equally diffused through the room; but in a
German room one is as comfortable in one part of it as in another.
Nothing is gained or lost by being near the stove. Its surface is not
hot; you can put your hand on it anywhere and not get burnt. Consider
these things. One firing is enough for the day; the cost is next to
nothing; the heat produced is the same all day, instead of too hot and
too cold by turns; one may absorb himself in his business in peace; he
does not need to feel any anxieties or solicitudes about his fire; his
whole day is a realized dream of bodily comfort.

The German stove is not restricted to wood; peat is used in it, and coal
bricks also. These coal bricks are made of waste coal dust pressed in a
mold. In effect they are dirt and in fact are dirt cheap. The brick is
about as big as your two fists; the stove will burn up twenty of them in
half an hour, then it will need no more fuel for that day.

This noble stove is at its very best when its front has a big square
opening in it for a _visible_ wood fire. The real heating is done in the
hidden regions of the great structure, of course--the open fire is
merely to rejoice your eye and gladden your heart.

America could adopt this stove, but does America do it? No, she sticks
placidly to her own fearful and wonderful inventions in the stove line.
She has fifty kinds, and not a rational one in the lot. The American
wood stove, of whatsoever breed, is a terror. There can be no
tranquillity of mind where it is. It requires more attention than a
baby. It has to be fed every little while, it has to be watched all the
time; and for all reward you are roasted half your time and frozen the
other half. It warms no part of the room but its own part; it breeds
headaches and suffocation, and makes one’s skin feel dry and feverish;
and when your wood bill comes in you think you have been supporting a
volcano.

We have in America many and many a breed of coal stoves, also--fiendish
things, everyone of them. The base-burner sort are handy and require but
little attention; but none of them, of whatsoever kind, distributes its
heat uniformly through the room, or keeps it at an unvarying
temperature, or fails to take the life out of the atmosphere and leave
it stuffy and smothery and stupefying.

It seems to me that the ideal of comfort would be a German stove to heat
one’s room, and an open wood fire to make it cheerful; then have
furnace-heat in the halls. We could easily find some way to make the
German stove beautiful, and that is all it needs at present. Still, even
as it is to-day, it is lovely, it is a darling, compared with any
“radiator” that has yet been intruded upon the world. That odious gilded
skeleton! It makes all places ugly that it inhabits--just by contagion.

It is certainly strange that useful customs and devices do not spread
from country to country with more facility and promptness than they do.
You step across the German border almost anywhere, and suddenly the
German stove has disappeared. In Italy you find a foolish and
ineffectual modification of it, in Paris you find an unprepossessing
“adaptation” of our base-burner on a reduced pattern.

Fifteen years ago Paris had a cheap and cunning little fire kindler
consisting of a pine shaving, curled as it came from the carpenter’s
plane, and gummed over with an inflammable substance which would burn
several minutes and set fire to the most obdurate wood. It was cheap and
handy, but no stranger carried the idea home with him. Paris has another
swift and victorious kindler, now, in the form of a small black cake
made of I don’t know what; but you shove it under the wood and touch a
match to it and your fire is made. No one will think to carry that
device to America, or elsewhere. In America we prefer to kindle the fire
with the kerosene can and chance the inquest. I have been in a multitude
of places where pine cones were abundant, but only in the French Riviera
and in one place in Italy have I seen them in the wood box to kindle the
fires with.

For perfect adaptation to the service required, look at the American gum
shoe and the American arctic. Their virtues ought to have carried them
to all wet and snowy lands; but they haven’t done anything of the kind.
There are few places on the continent of Europe where one can buy them.

And observe how slowly our typewriting machine makes its way. In the
great city of Florence I was able to find only one place where I could
get typewriting done; and then it was not done by a native, but by an
American girl. In the great city of Munich I found one typewriting
establishment, but the operator was sick and that suspended the
business. I was told that there was no opposition house. In the
prodigious city of Berlin I was not able to find a typewriter at all.
There was not even one in our Embassy or its branches. Our
representative there sent to London for the best one to be had in that
capital, and got an incapable, who would have been tarred and feathered
in Mud Springs, Arizona. Four years ago a typewritten page was a seldom
sight in Europe, and when you saw it it made you heartsick, it was so
inartistic, and so blurred and shabby and slovenly. It was because the
Europeans made the machines themselves, and the making of nice machinery
is not one of their gifts. England imports ours, now. This is wise; she
will have her reward.

In all these years the American fountain pen has hardly got a start in
Europe. There is no market for it. It is too handy, too inspiring, too
capable, too much of a time saver. The dismal steel pen and the
compass-jawed quill are preferred. And semi-liquid mud is preferred to
ink, apparently, everywhere in Europe. This in face of the fact that
there is ink to be had in America--and at club rates, too.

Then there is the elevator, lift, _ascenseur_. America has had the
benefit of this invaluable contrivance for a generation and a half, and
it is now used in all our cities and villages, in all hotels, in all
lofty business buildings and factories, and in many private dwellings.
But we can’t spread it, we can’t beguile Europe with it. In Europe an
elevator is even to this day a rarity and a curiosity. Especially a
curiosity. As a rule it seats but three or four persons--often only
two--and it travels so slowly and cautiously and timorously and piously
and solemnly that it makes a person feel creepy and crawly and scary and
dismal and repentant. Anybody with sound legs can give the continental
elevator two flights the start and beat it to the sixth floor. Every
time these nations merely import an American idea, instead of importing
the concreted thing itself, the result is a failure. They tried to make
the sewing machine, and couldn’t; they are trying to make fountain pens
and typewriters and can’t; they are making these dreary elevators,
now--and patenting them! Satire can no further go.

I think that as a rule we develop a borrowed European idea forward, and
that Europe develops a borrowed American idea backward. We borrowed gas
lighting and the railroad from England, and the arc light from France,
and these things have improved under our culture. We have lent Europe
our tramway, telegraph, sewing machine, phonograph, telephone, and
kodak, and while we may not claim that in these particular instances she
has developed them backward, we are justified in claiming that she has
added no notable improvements to them. We have added the improvements
ourselves and she has accepted them. Why she has not accepted and
universally adopted the improved elevator is a surprising and puzzling
thing. Its rightful place is among the great ideas of our great age. It
is an epoch maker. It is a concentrator of population, and economizer of
room. It is going to build our cities skyward instead of out toward the
horizons.[6] It is going to enable five millions of people to live
comfortably on the same ground space that one million uncomfortably
lives on now. It is going to make cheap quarters for Tom, Dick, and
Harry near their work, in place of three miles from it, as is the rule
to-day. It is going to save them the necessity of adding a six-flight
climb to the already sufficient fatigue of their day’s labor.

We imitate some of the good things which we find in Europe, and we ought
to imitate more of them. At the same time Europe ought to imitate us
somewhat more than she does. The crusty, ill-mannered and in every way
detestable Parisian cabman ought to imitate our courteous and friendly
Boston cabman--and stop there. He can’t learn anything from the guild in
New York. And it would morally help the Parisian shopkeeper if he would
imitate the fair dealing of his American cousin. With us it is not
necessary to ask the price of small articles before we buy them, but in
Paris the person who fails to take that precaution will get scorched. In
business we are prompt, fair, and trustworthy in all our small trade
matters. It is the rule. In the friendliest spirit I would recommend
France to imitate these humble virtues. Particularly in the kodak
business. Pray get no kodak pictures developed in France--and especially
in Nice. They will send you your bill to Rome or Jericho, or
whithersoever you have gone, but that is all you will get. You will
never see your negatives again, or the developed pictures, either. And
by and by the head house in Paris will demand payment once more, and
constructively threaten you with “proceedings.” If you inquire if they
mailed your package across the frontier without registering it, they are
coldly silent. If you inquire how they expected to trace and recover a
lost package without a post-office receipt, they are dumb again. A
little intelligence inserted into the kodak business in those regions
would be helpful, if it could be done without shock.

But the worst of all is, that Europe cannot be persuaded to imitate our
railway methods. Two or three years ago I liked the European methods,
but experience has dislodged that superstition. All over the Continent
the system--to call it by an extravagant term--is sufficiently poor and
slow and clumsy, or unintelligent; but in these regards Italy and France
are entitled to the chromo. In Italy it takes more than half an hour to
buy a through ticket to Paris at Cook & Sons’ offices, there is such a
formidable amount of red tape and recording connected with the vast
transaction. Every little detail of the matter must be written down in a
set of books--your name, condition, nationality, religion, date, hour,
number of the train, and all that; and at last you get your ticket and
think you are done, but you are not; it must be carried to the station
and stamped; and even that is not the end, for if you stop over at any
point it must be stamped again or it is forfeited. And yet you save time
and trouble by going to Cook instead of to the station. Buying your
ticket does not finish your job. Your trunks must be weighed, and paid
for at about human-being rates. This takes another quarter of an hour of
your time--perhaps half an hour if you are at the tail of the
procession. You get paper checks, which are twice as easy to lose as
brass ones. You cannot secure a seat beforehand, but must take your
chances with the general rush to the train. If you have your family with
you, you may have to distribute them among several cars. There is one
annoying feature which is common all over the Continent, and that is,
that if you want to make a short journey you cannot buy your ticket
whenever you find the ticket office open, but must wait until it is
doing business for your particular train; and that only begins, as a
rule, a quarter of an hour before the train’s time of starting. The cars
are most ingeniously inconvenient, cramped, and uncomfortable, and in
Italy they are phenomenally dirty. The European “system” was devised
either by a maniac or by a person whose idea was to hamper, bother, and
exasperate the traveler in all conceivable ways and sedulously and
painstakingly discourage custom. In Italy, as far as my experience goes,
it is the custom to use the sleeping cars on the day trains and take
them off when the sun goes down. One thing is sure, anyway: if that is
not the case, it will be, presently, when they think of it. They can be
depended upon to snap up as darling an idea as that with joy.

No, we are bad enough about not importing valuable European ideas, but
Europe is still slower about introducing ours. Europe has always--from
away back--been neglectful in this regard. Take our admirable postal and
express system, for instance. We had it perfectly developed and running
smoothly and beautifully more than three hundred years ago; and Europe
came over and admired it and eloquently praised it--but didn’t adopt it.
We Americans.... But let Prescott tell about it. I quote from the
_Conquest of Peru_, chapter 2, vol. 1:

  As the distance each courier had to perform was small, they ran over
  the ground with great swiftness, and messages were carried through the
  whole extent of the long routes at the rate of a hundred and fifty
  miles a day. Their office was not limited to carrying dispatches. They
  brought various articles. Fish from the distant ocean, fruits, game,
  and different commodities from the hot regions of the coast were taken
  to the capital in good condition. It is remarkable that this important
  institution should have been found among two barbarian nations of the
  New World long before it was introduced among the civilized nations of
  Europe. By these wise contrivances of the Incas, the most distant
  parts of the long-extended empire of Peru were brought into intimate
  relations with each other. And while the capitals of Christendom, but
  a few hundred miles apart, remained as far asunder as if seas had
  rolled between them, the great capitals Cuzco and Quito were placed in
  immediate correspondence. Intelligence from the numerous provinces was
  transmitted on the wings of the wind to the Peruvian metropolis, the
  great focus to which all the lines of communication converged.

There--that is what we had, three hundred and twenty-five years before
Europe had anything that could be called a businesslike and effective
postal and express service. We are a great people. We have always been a
great people, from the start: always alive, alert, up early in the
morning, and ready to teach. But Europe has been a slow and discouraging
pupil from the start; always, from the very start. It seems to me that
something ought to be done about this.

                    THE CHOLERA EPIDEMIC IN HAMBURG
                                 (1892)


I believe I have never been so badly situated before as I have been
during these last four weeks. To begin with, the time-hallowed and
business-worn thunderbolt out of the clear sky fell about the 18th of
August--people in Hamburg dying like flies of something resembling
cholera! A normal death rate of forty a day suddenly transformed into a
terrific daily slaughter without notice to anybody to prepare for such a
surprise! Certainly that was recognizable as that kind of a thunderbolt.

It was at this point that the oddity of the situation above referred to
began. For you will grant that it is odd to live four weeks a
twelve-hour journey from a devastating plague nest and remain baffled
and defeated all that time in all your efforts to get at the state of
the case there. Naturally one flies to the newspapers when a pestilence
breaks out in his neighborhood. He feels sure of one thing, at any rate:
that the paper will cast all other interests into the background and
devote itself to the one supreme interest of the day; that it will throw
wide its columns and cram them with information, valuable and otherwise,
concerning that great event; and that it will even leave out the idle
jaunts of little dukes and kinglets to make room for the latest plague
item. I sought the newspapers, and was disappointed. I know now that
nothing that can happen in this world can stir the German daily journal
out of its eternal lethargy. When the Last Day comes it will note the
destruction of the world in a three-line paragraph and turn over and go
to sleep again.

This sort of journalism furnishes plenty of wonders. I have seen
ostensible telegrams from Hamburg four days old, gravely put forth as
news, and no apology offered. I have tracked a news item from one paper
to another day after day until it died of old age and fatigue--and yet
everybody treated it with respect, nobody laughed. Is it believable that
these antiquities are forwarded by telegraph? It would be more rational
to send them by slow freight, because less expensive and more speedy.

Then, the meagerness of the news meal is another marvel. That department
of the paper is not headed “Poverty Column,” nobody knows why. We know
that multitudes of people are being swept away daily in Hamburg, yet the
daily telegrams from there could be copied on a half page of note paper,
as a rule. If any newspaper has sent a special reporter thither he has
not arrived yet.

The final miracle of all is the character of this daily dribble of
so-called news. The wisest man in the world can get no information out
of it. It is an Irish stew made up of unrelated odds and ends, a mere
chaotic confusion and worthless. What can one make out of statistics
like these:

Up to noon, 655 cases, 333 deaths. Of these 189 were previously
reported.

The report that 650 bodies are lying unburied is not true. There are
only 340, and the most of these will be buried to-night.

There are 2,062 cases in the hospitals, 215 deaths.

The figures are never given in such a way as to afford one an
opportunity to compare the death list of one day with that of another;
consequently there is no way of finding out whether the pest abates or
increases. Sometimes a report uses the expression “to-day” and does not
say when the day began or ended; sometimes the deaths for several days
are bunched together in a divisionless lump; sometimes the figures make
you think the deaths are five or six hundred a day, while other figures
in the same paragraph seem to indicate that the rate is below two
hundred.

A day or two ago the word cholera was not discoverable at all in that
day’s issue of one of our principal dailies; in to-day’s issue of the
same paper there is no cholera report from Hamburg. Yet a private letter
from there says the raging pestilence is actually increasing.

One might imagine that the papers are forbidden to publish cholera news.
I had that impression myself. It seemed the only explanation of the
absence of special Hamburg correspondence. But it appears now, that the
Hamburg papers are crammed with matter pertaining to the cholera,
therefore that idea was an error. How does one find this out? In this
amazing way: that a daily newspaper located ten or twelve hours from
Hamburg describes with owl-eyed wonder the stirring contents of a
Hamburg daily journal _six days old_, and yet gets from it the only
informing matter, the only matter worth reading, which it has yet
published from that smitten city concerning the pestilence.

You see, it did not even occur to that petrified editor to bail his
columns dry of their customary chloroform and copy that Hamburg journal
entire. He is so used to shoveling gravel that he doesn’t know a diamond
when he sees it. I would trust that man with untold bushels of precious
news, and nobody to watch him. Among other things which he notes in the
Hamburg paper is the fact that its supplements contained one hundred of
the customary elaborate and formal German death notices. That
means--what nobody has had reason to suppose before--that the slaughter
is not confined to the poor and friendless. I think so, because that
sort of death notice occupies a formidable amount of space in an
advertising page, and must cost a good deal of money.

I wander from my proper subject to observe that one hundred of these
notices in a single journal must make that journal a sorrow to the eye
and a shock to the taste, even among the Germans themselves, who are
bred to endure and perhaps enjoy a style of “display ads” which far
surpasses even the vilest American attempts, for insane and outrageous
ugliness. Sometimes a death notice is as large as a foolscap page, has
big black display lines, and is bordered all around with a coarse
mourning border as thick as your finger. The notices are of all sizes
from foolscap down to a humble two-inch square, and they suggest
lamentation of all degrees, from the hundred-dollar hurricane of grief
to the two-shilling sigh of a composed and modest regret. A newspaper
page blocked out with mourning compartments of fifty different sizes
flung together without regard to order or system or size must be a
spectacle to see.

The notice copied above is modest and straightforward. The advertiser
informs sympathizing friends and acquaintances that his dear friend and
old and faithful fellow laborer has been suddenly smitten with death;
then signs his name and adds “of the firm of Beck & Steingoetter,” which
is perhaps another way of saying that the business will be continued as
usual at the old stand. The average notice is often refreshed with a
whiff of business at the end.

The 100 formal notices in the Hamburg paper did not mean merely 100
deaths; each told of one death, but many of them told of more--in some
cases they told of four and five. In the same issue there were 132
one-line death notices. If the dates of these deaths were all stated,
the 232 notices together could be made the basis of a better guess at
the current mortality in Hamburg than the “official” reports furnished,
perhaps. You would know that a certain number died on a certain day who
left behind them people able to publish the fact and pay for it. Then
you could correctly assume that the vast bulk of that day’s harvest were
people who were penniless and left penniless friends behind. You could
add your facts to your assumption and get _some_ sort of idea of the
death rate, and this would be strikingly better than the official
reports, since they give you no idea at all.

To-day a physician was speaking of a private letter received here
yesterday from a physician in Hamburg which stated that every day
numbers of poor people are snatched from their homes to the pest houses,
and that that is the last that is heard of a good many of them. No
intelligible record is kept; they die unknown and are buried so. That no
intelligible record is kept seems proven by the fact that the public
cannot get hold of a burial list for one day that is not made impossible
by the record of the day preceding and the one following it.

What I am trying to make the reader understand is, the strangeness of
the situation here--a mighty tragedy being played upon a stage that is
close to us, and yet we are as ignorant of its details as we should be
if the stage were in China. We sit “in front,” and the audience is in
fact the world; but the curtain is down and from behind it we hear only
an inarticulate murmur. The Hamburg disaster must go into history as the
disaster without a history. And yet a well-trained newspaper staff would
find a way to secure an accurate list of the new hospital cases and the
burials daily, and would do it, and not take it out in complaining of
the foolishness and futility of the official reports. Every day we know
exactly what is going on in the two cholera-stricken ships in the harbor
of New York. That is all the cholera news we get that is worth printing
or believing.

All along we have heard rumors that the force of workers at Hamburg was
too small to cope with the pestilence; that more help was impossible to
get; and we have seen statements which confirmed these sorrowful facts;
statements which furnished the pitiful spectacle of brave workers dying
at their posts from exhaustion; of corpses lying in the halls of the
hospitals, waiting there because there was no worker idle; and now comes
another confirmatory item; it is in the physician’s letter above
referred to--an item which shows you how hard pressed the authorities
are by their colossal burden--an item which gives you a sudden and
terrific sense of the situation there; for in a line it flashes before
you this ghastly picture, a thing seen by the physician: a wagon going
along the street with five sick people in it, and with them four
corpses!




                        QUEEN VICTORIA’S JUBILEE
                                 (1897)


So far as I can see, a procession has value in but two ways--as a show
and as a symbol; its minor function being to delight the eye, its major
one to compel thought, exalt the spirit, stir the heart, and inflame the
imagination. As a mere show, and meaningless--like a Mardi-Gras march--a
magnificent procession is a sight worth a long journey to see; as a
symbol, the most colorless and unpicturesque procession, if it have a
moving history back of it, is worth a thousand of it.

After the Civil War ten regiments of bronzed New York veterans marched
up Broadway in faded uniforms and bearing faded battle flags that were
mere shot-riddled rags--and in each battalion as it swung by, one noted
a great gap, an eloquent vacancy where had marched the comrades who had
fallen and would march no more! Always, as this procession advanced
between the massed multitudes, its approach was welcomed by each block
of people with a burst of proud and grateful enthusiasm--then the head
of it passed, and suddenly revealed those pathetic gaps, and silence
fell upon that block; for every man in it had choked up, and could not
get command of his voice and add it to the storm again for many minutes.
That was the most moving and tremendous effect that I have ever
witnessed--those affecting silences falling between those hurricanes of
worshiping enthusiasm.

There was no costumery in that procession, no color, no tinsel, no
brilliancy, yet it was the greatest spectacle and the most gracious and
exalting and beautiful that has come within my experience. It was
because it had history back of it, and because it was a symbol, and
stood for something, and because one viewed it with the spiritual
vision, not the physical. There was not much for the physical eye to
see, but it revealed continental areas, limitless horizons, to the eye
of the imagination and the spirit.

A procession, to be valuable, must do one thing or the other--clothe
itself in splendors and charm the eye, or symbolize something sublime
and uplifting, and so appeal to the imagination. As a mere spectacle to
look at, I suppose that the Queen’s procession will not be as showy as
the Tsar’s late pageant; it will probably fall much short of the one in
Tannhäuser in the matter of rich and adorable costumery; in the number
of renowned personages on view in it, it will probably fall short of
some that have been seen in England before this. And yet in its major
function, its symbolic function, I think that if all the people in it
wore their everyday clothes and marched without flags or music, it would
still be incomparably the most memorable and most important procession
that ever moved through the streets of London.

For it will stand for English history, English growth, English
achievement, the accumulated power and renown and dignity of twenty
centuries of strenuous effort. Many things about it will set one to
reflecting upon what a large feature of this world England is to-day,
and this will in turn move one, even the least imaginative, to cast a
glance down her long perspective and note the steps of her progress and
the insignificance of her first estate. In this matter London is itself
a suggestive object lesson.

I suppose that London has always existed. One cannot easily imagine an
England that had no London. No doubt there was a village here 5,000
years ago. It was on the river somewhere west of where the Tower is now;
it was built of thatched mud huts close to a couple of limpid brooks,
and on every hand for miles and miles stretched rolling plains of fresh
green grass, and here and there were groups and groves of trees. The
tribes wore skins--sometimes merely their own, sometimes those of other
animals. The chief was monarch, and helped out his complexion with blue
paint. His industry was the chase; his relaxation was war. Some of the
Englishmen who will view the procession to-day are carrying his ancient
blood in their veins.

It may be that that village remained about as it began, away down to the
Roman occupation, a couple of thousand years ago. It was still not much
of a town when Alfred burned the cakes. Even when the Conqueror first
saw it, it did not amount to much. I think it must have been short of
distinguished architecture or he would not have traveled down into the
country to the village of Westminster to get crowned. If you skip down
350 years further you will find a London of some little consequence, but
I believe that that is as much as you can say for it. Still, I am
interested in that London, for it saw the first two processions which
will live longer than any other in English history, I think; the date of
the one is 1415, that of the other is 1897.

The compactly built part of the London of 1415 was a narrow strip not a
mile long, which stretched east and west through the middle of what is
now called “the City.” The houses were densest in the region of
Cheapside. South of the strip were scattering residences which stood in
turfy lawns which sloped to the river. North of the strip, fields and
country homes extended to the walls. Let us represent that London by
three checker-board squares placed in a row; then open out a New York
newspaper like a book, and the space which it covers will properly
represent the London of to-day by comparison. It is the difference
between your hand and a blanket. It is possible that that ancient London
had 100,000 inhabitants, and that 100,000 outsiders came to town to see
the procession. The present London contains five or six million
inhabitants, and it has been calculated that the population has jumped
to 10,000,000 to-day.

The pageant of 1415 was to celebrate the gigantic victory of Agincourt,
then and still the most colossal in England’s history.

From that day to this there has been nothing that even approached it but
Plassey. It was the third and greatest in the series of monster
victories won by the English over the French in the Hundred Years’
War--Crecy, Poitiers, Agincourt. At Agincourt, according to history,
15,000 English, under Henry V, defeated and routed an army of 100,000
French. Sometimes history makes it 8,000 English and 60,000 French; but
no matter, in both cases the proportions are preserved. Eight thousand
of the French nobility were slain and the rest of the order taken
prisoners--1,500 in number--among them the Dukes of Orléans and Bourbon
and Marshal Boucicaut; and the victory left the whole northern half of
France an English possession. This wholesale depletion of the
aristocracy made such a stringent scarcity in its ranks that when the
young peasant girl, Joan of Arc, came to undo Henry’s mighty work
fourteen years later she could hardly gather together nobles enough to
man her staff.

The battle of Agincourt was fought on the 25th of October, and a few
days later the tremendous news was percolating through England.
Presently it was sweeping the country like a tidal wave, like a cyclone,
like a conflagration. Choose your own figure, there is no metaphor known
to the language that can exaggerate the tempest of joy and pride and
exultation that burst everywhere along the progress of that great news.

The king came home and brought his soldiers with him--he and they the
idols of the nation, now. He brought his 1,500 captive knights and
nobles, too--we shall not see any such output of blue blood as that
to-day, bond or free. The king rested three weeks in his palace, the
Tower of London, while the people made preparations and prepared the
welcome due him. On the 22d of December all was ready.

There were no cables, no correspondents, no newspapers then--a
regrettable defect, but not irremediable. A young man who would have
been a correspondent if he had been born 500 years later was in London
at the time, and he remembers the details. He has communicated them to
me through a competent spirit medium, phrased in a troublesome mixture
of obsolete English and moldy French, and I have thoroughly modernized
his story and put it into straight English, and will here record it. I
will explain that his Sir John Oldcastle is a person whom we do not know
very well by that name, nor much care for; but we know him well and
adore him, too, under his other name--Sir John Falstaff. Also, I will
remark that two miles of the Queen’s progress to-day will be over ground
traversed by the procession of Henry V; all solid bricks and mortar,
now, but open country in Henry’s day, and clothed in that unapproachable
beauty which has been the monopoly of sylvan England since the creation.
Ah, where now are those long-vanished forms, those unreturning feet! Let
us not inquire too closely. Translated, this is the narrative of the
spirit-correspondent, who is looking down upon me at this moment from
his high home, and admiring to see how the art and mystery of spelling
has improved since his time!

NARRATIVE OF THE SPIRIT CORRESPONDENT

I was commanded by my lord the Lord Mayor to make a report for the
archives, and was furnished with a fleet horse, and with a paper
permitting me to go anywhere at my will, without let or hindrance, even
up and down the processional route, though no other person not of the
procession itself was allowed this unique privilege during the whole of
the 21st and the 22d.

On the morning of the 22d, toward noon, I rode from the Tower into the
city, and through it as far as St. Paul’s. All the way, on both sides,
all the windows, balconies, and roofs were crowded with people, and
wherever there was a vacancy it had been built up in high tiers of seats
covered with red cloth, and these seats were also filled with people--in
all cases in bright holiday attire--the woman of fashion barring the
view from all in the rear with those tiresome extinguisher hats, which
of late have grown to be a cloth-yard high. From every balcony depended
silken stuffs of splendid and various colors, and figured and pictured
rich tapestries. It was brisk, sharp weather, but a rare one for sun,
and when one looked down this swinging double wall of beautiful fabrics,
glowing and flashing and changing color like prisms in the flooding
light, it was a most fair sight to see. And there were frequent May
poles, garlanded to their tops, and from the tops swung sheaves of
silken long ribbons of all bright colors, which in the light breeze
writhed and twisted and prettily mingled themselves together.

I rode solitary--in state, as it might be--and was envied, as I could
see, and did not escape comment, but had a plenty of it; for the
conduits were running gratis wine, and the results were accumulating. I
got many ribald compliments on my riding, on my clothes, on my office.
Everybody was happy, so it was best to seem so myself, which I did--for
those people’s aim was better than their eggs.

A place had been reserved for me on a fine and fanciful erection in St.
Paul’s Churchyard, and there I waited for the procession. It seemed a
long time, but at last a dull booming sound arose in the distance, and
after a while we saw the banners and the head of the procession come
into view, and heard the muffled roar of voices that welcomed it. The
roar moved continuously toward us, growing steadily louder and louder,
and stronger and stronger, and with it the bray and crash of music; and
presently it was right with us, and seemed to roll over us and submerge
us, and stun us, and deafen us--and behold, there was the hero of
Agincourt passing by!

All the multitude was standing up, red-faced, frantic, bellowing,
shouting, the tears running down their faces; and through the storm of
waving hats and handkerchiefs one glimpsed the battle banners and the
drifting host of marching men as through a dimming flurry of snow.

The king, tall, slender, handsome, rode with his visor up, that all
might see his face. He was clad in his silver armor from head to heel,
and had his great two-handed sword at his side, his battle-ax at his
pommel, his shield upon his arm, and about his helmet waved and tossed a
white mass of fluffy plumes. On either side of him rode the captive
dukes, plumed like himself, but wearing long crimson satin gowns over
their armor; after these came the French marshal similarly habited;
after him followed the fifteen hundred French knights, with robes of
various colors over their armor, and with each two rode two English
knights, sometimes robed in various colors, sometimes in white with a
red cross on the shoulder, these white-clad ones being Knights Templars.
Every man of the three thousand bore his shield upon his left arm, newly
polished and burnished, and on it was his device.

As the king passed the church he bowed his head and lifted his shield,
and by one impulse all the knights did the same; and so as far down the
line as the eye could reach one saw the lifted shields simultaneously
catch the sun, and it was like a sudden mile-long shaft of flashing
light; and, Lord! it lit up that dappled sea of color with a glory like
“the golden vortex in the west over the foundered sun”! (The
introduction of this quotation is very interesting, for it shows that
our literature of to-day has a circulation in heaven--pirated editions,
no doubt.--M.T.)

The knights were a long time in passing; then came 5,000 Agincourt
men-at-arms, and they were a long time; and at the very end, last of
all, came that intolerable old tun of sack and godless ruffler, Sir John
Oldcastle (now risen from the dead for the third time), fat-faced,
purple with the spirit of bygone and lamented drink, smiling his
hospitable, wide smile upon all the world, leering at the women,
wallowing about in his saddle, proclaiming his valorous deeds as fast as
he could lie, taking the whole glory of Agincourt to his single self,
measuring off the miles of his slain and then multiplying them by 5, 7,
10, 15, as inspiration after inspiration came to his help--the most
inhuman spectacle in England, a living, breathing outrage, a slander
upon the human race; and after him came, mumming and blethering, his
infamous lieutenants; and after them his “paladins,” as he calls them,
the mangiest lot of starvelings and cowards that was ever littered, the
disgrace of the noblest pageant that England has ever seen. God rest
their souls in the place appointed for all such!

There was a moment of prayer at the Temple, the procession moved down
the country road, its way walled on both sides by welcoming multitudes,
and so, by Charing Cross, and at last to the Abbey for the great
ceremonies. It was a grand day, and will remain in men’s memories.


That was as much of it as the spirit correspondent could let me have; he
was obliged to stop there because he had an engagement to sing in the
choir, and was already late.

The contrast between that old England and the present England is one of
the things which will make the pageant of the present day impressive and
thought-breeding. The contrast between the England of the Queen’s reign
and the England of any previous British reign is also an impressive
thing. British history is two thousand years old, and yet in a good many
ways the world has moved further ahead since the Queen was born than it
moved in all the rest of the two thousand put together. A large part of
this progress has been moral, but naturally the material part of it is
the most striking and the easiest to measure. Since the Queen first saw
the light she has seen invented and brought into use (with the exception
of the cotton gin, the spinning frames, and the steamboat) every one of
the myriad of strictly modern inventions which, by their united powers,
have created the bulk of the modern civilization and made life under it
easy and difficult, convenient and awkward, happy and horrible, soothing
and irritating, grand and trivial, an indispensable blessing and an
unimaginable curse--she has seen all these miracles, these wonders,
these marvels piled up in her time, and yet she is but seventy-eight
years old. That is to say, she has seen more things invented than any
other monarch that ever lived; and more than the oldest old-time English
commoner that ever lived, including Old Parr; and more than Methuselah
himself--five times over.

Some of the details of the moral advancement which she has seen are also
very striking and easily graspable.

She has seen the English criminal laws prodigiously modified, and 200
capital crimes swept from the statute book.

She has seen English liberty greatly broadened--the governing and
lawmaking powers, formerly the possession of the few, extended to the
body of the people, and purchase in the army abolished.

She has seen the public educator--the newspaper--created, and its
teachings placed within the reach of the leanest purse. There was
nothing properly describable as a newspaper until long after she was
born.

She has seen the world’s literature set free, through the institution of
international copyright.

She has seen America invent arbitration, the eventual substitute for
that enslaver of nations, the standing army; and she has seen England
pay the first bill under it, and America shirk the second--but only
temporarily; of this we may be sure.

She has seen a Hartford American (Doctor Wells) apply anæsthetics in
surgery for the first time in history, and for all time banish the
terrors of the surgeon’s knife; and she has seen the rest of the world
ignore the discoverer and a Boston doctor steal the credit of his work.

She has seen medical science and scientific sanitation cut down the
death rate of civilized cities by more than half, and she has seen these
agencies set bounds to the European march of the cholera and imprison
the Black Death in its own home.

She has seen woman freed from the oppression of many burdensome and
unjust laws; colleges established for her; privileged to earn degrees in
men’s colleges--but not get them; in some regions rights accorded to her
which lifted her near to political equality with man, and a hundred
bread-winning occupations found for her where hardly one existed
before--among them medicine, the law, and professional nursing. The
Queen has herself recognized merit in her sex; of the 501 lordships
which she has conferred in sixty years, one was upon a woman.

The Queen has seen the right to organize trade unions extended to the
workman, after that right had been the monopoly of guilds of masters for
six hundred years.

She has seen the workman rise into political notice, then into political
force, then (in some parts of the world) into the chief and commanding
political force; she has seen the day’s labor of twelve, fourteen, and
eighteen hours reduced to eight, a reform which has made labor a means
of extending life instead of a means of committing salaried suicide.

But it is useless to continue the list--it has no end.

There will be complexions in the procession to-day which will suggest
the vast distances to which the British dominion has extended itself
around the fat rotundity of the globe since Britain was a remote unknown
back settlement of savages with tin for sale, two or three thousand
years ago; and also how great a part of this extension is comparatively
recent; also, how surprisingly speakers of the English tongue have
increased within the Queen’s time.

When the Queen was born there were not more than 25,000,000
English-speaking people in the world; there are about 120,000,000 now.
The other long-reign queen, Elizabeth, ruled over a short 100,000 square
miles of territory and perhaps 5,000,000 subjects; Victoria reigns over
more territory than any other sovereign in the world’s history ever
reigned over; her estate covers a fourth part of the habitable area of
the globe, and her subjects number about 400,000,000.

It is indeed a mighty estate, and I perceive now that the English are
mentioned in the Bible:

“Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.”

The Long-Reign Pageant will be a memorable thing to see, for it stands
for the grandeur of England, and is full of suggestion as to how it had
its beginning and what have been the forces that have built it up.

I got to my seat in the Strand just in time--five minutes past ten--for
a glance around before the show began. The houses opposite, as far as
the eye could reach in both directions, suggested boxes in a theater
snugly packed. The gentleman next to me likened the groups to beds of
flowers, and said he had never seen such a massed and multitudinous
array of bright colors and fine clothes.

These displays rose up and up, story by story, all balconies and windows
being packed, and also the battlements stretching along the roofs. The
sidewalks were filled with standing people, but were not uncomfortably
crowded. They were fenced from the roadway by red-coated soldiers, a
double stripe of vivid color which extended throughout the six miles
which the procession would traverse.

Five minutes later the head of the column came into view and was
presently filing by, led by Captain Ames, the tallest man in the British
army. And then the cheering began. It took me but a little while to
determine that this procession could not be described. There was going
to be too much of it, and too much variety in it, so I gave up the idea.
It was to be a spectacle for the kodak, not the pen.

Presently the procession was without visible beginning or end, but
stretched to the limit of sight in both directions--bodies of soldiery
in blue, followed by a block of soldiers in buff, then a block of red, a
block of buff, a block of yellow, and so on, an interminable drift of
swaying and swinging splotches of strong color sparkling and flashing
with shifty light reflected from bayonets, lance heads, brazen helmets,
and burnished breastplates. For varied and beautiful uniforms and
unceasing surprises in the way of new and unexpected splendors, it much
surpassed any pageant that I have ever seen.

I was not dreaming of so stunning a show. All the nations seemed to be
filing by. They all seemed to be represented. It was a sort of
allegorical suggestion of the Last Day, and some who live to see that
day will probably recall this one if they are not too much disturbed in
mind at the time.

There were five bodies of Oriental soldiers of five different
nationalities, with complexions differentiated by five distinct shades
of yellow. There were about a dozen bodies of black soldiers from
various parts of Africa, whose complexions covered as many shades of
black, and some of these were the very blackest people I have ever seen
yet.

Then there was an exhaustive exhibition of the hundred separate brown
races of India, the most beautiful and satisfying of all the complexions
that have been vouchsafed to man, and the one which best sets off
colored clothes and best harmonizes with all tints.

The Chinese, the Japanese, the Koreans, the Africans, the Indians, the
Pacific Islanders--they were all there, and with them samples of all the
whites that inhabit the wide reach of the Queen’s dominions.

The procession was the human race on exhibition, a spectacle curious and
interesting and worth traveling far to see. The most splendid of the
costumes were those worn by the Indian princes, and they were also the
most beautiful and richest. They were men of stately build and princely
carriage, and wherever they passed the applause burst forth.

Soldiers, soldiers, soldiers, and still more and more soldiers and
cannon and muskets and lances--there seemed to be no end to this
feature. There are 50,000 soldiers in London, and they all seemed to be
on hand. I have not seen so many except in the theater, when thirty-five
privates and a general march across the stage and behind the scenes and
across the front again and keep it up till they have represented
300,000.

In the early part of the procession the colonial premiers drove by, and
by and by after a long time there was a grand output of foreign princes,
thirty-one in the invoice.

The feature of high romance was not wanting, for among them rode Prince
Rupert of Bavaria, who would be Prince of Wales now and future king of
England and emperor of India if his Stuart ancestors had conducted their
royal affairs more wisely than they did. He came as a peaceful guest to
represent his mother, Princess Ludwig, heiress of the house of Stuart,
to whom English Jacobites still pay unavailing homage as the rightful
queen of England.

The house of Stuart was formally and officially shelved nearly two
centuries ago, but the microbe of Jacobite loyalty is a thing which is
not exterminable by time, force, or argument.

At last, when the procession had been on view an hour and a half,
carriages began to appear. In the first came a detachment of two-horse
ones containing ambassadors extraordinary, in one of them Whitelaw Reid,
representing the United States; then six containing minor foreign and
domestic princes and princesses; then five four-horse carriages
freighted with offshoots of the family.

The excitement was growing now; interest was rising toward the boiling
point. Finally a landau driven by eight cream-colored horses, most
lavishly upholstered in gold stuffs, with postilions and no drivers, and
preceded by Lord Wolseley, came bowling along, followed by the Prince of
Wales, and all the world rose to its feet and uncovered.

The Queen Empress was come. She was received with great enthusiasm. It
was realizable that she was the procession herself; that all the rest of
it was mere embroidery; that in her the public saw the British Empire
itself. She was a symbol, an allegory of England’s grandeur and the
might of the British name.

It is over now; the British Empire has marched past under review and
inspection. The procession stood for sixty years of progress and
accumulation, moral, material, and political. It was made up rather of
the beneficiaries of these prosperities than of the creators of them.

As far as mere glory goes, the foreign trade of Great Britain has grown
in a wonderful way since the Queen ascended the throne. Last year it
reached the enormous figure of £620,000,000, but the capitalist, the
manufacturer, the merchant, and the workingmen were not officially in
the procession to get their large share of the resulting glory.

Great Britain has added to her real estate an average of 165 miles of
territory per day for the past sixty years, which is to say she has
added more than the bulk of an England proper per year, or an aggregate
of seventy Englands in the sixty years.

But Cecil Rhodes was not in the procession; the Chartered Company was
absent from it. Nobody was there to collect his share of the glory due
for his formidable contributions to the imperial estate. Even Doctor
Jameson was out, and yet he had tried so hard to accumulate territory.

Eleven colonial premiers were in the procession, but the dean of the
order, the imperial Premier, was not, nor the Lord Chief Justice of
England, nor the Speaker of the House. The bulk of the religious
strength of England dissent was not officially represented in the
religious ceremonials. At the Cathedral that immense new industry,
speculative expansion, was not represented unless the pathetic shade of
Barnato rode invisible in the pageant.

It was a memorable display and must live in history. It suggested the
material glories of the reign finely and adequately. The absence of the
chief creators of them was perhaps not a serious disadvantage. One could
supply the vacancies by imagination, and thus fill out the procession
very effectively. One can enjoy a rainbow without necessarily forgetting
the forces that made it.




                            LETTERS TO SATAN

If Your Grace would prepay your postage it would be a pleasant change. I
am not meaning to speak harshly, but only sorrowfully. My remark applies
to all my outland correspondents, and to everybody’s. None of them puts
on the full postage, and that is just the same as putting on none at
all: the foreign governments ignore the half postage, and we who are
abroad have to pay full postage on those half-paid letters. And as for
writing on thin paper, none of my friends ever think of it; they all use
pasteboard, or sole leather, or things like that. But enough of that
subject; it is painful.

I believe you have set me a hard task; for if it is true that you have
not been in the world for three hundred years, and have not received
into your establishment an educated person in all that time, I shall be
obliged to talk to you as if you had just been born and knew nothing at
all about the things I speak of. However, I will do the best I can, and
will faithfully try to put in all the particulars, trivial ones as well
as the other sorts. If my report shall induce Your Grace to come out of
your age-long seclusion and make a pleasure tour through the world in
person, instead of doing it by proxy through me, I shall feel that I
have labored to good purpose. You have many friends in the world; more
than you think. You would have a vast welcome in Paris, London, New
York, Chicago, Washington, and the other capitals of the world; if you
would go on the lecture platform you could charge what you pleased. You
would be the most formidable attraction on the planet. The curiosity to
see you would be so great that no place of amusement would contain the
multitude that would come. In London many devoted people who have seen
the Prince of Wales only fifteen hundred or two thousand times would be
willing to miss one chance of seeing him again for the sake of seeing
you. In Paris, even with the Tsar on view, you could do a fairly good
business; and in Chicago--Oh, but you ought to go to Chicago, you know.
But further of this anon. I will to my report, now, and tell you about
Lucerne, and how I journeyed hither; for doubtless you will travel by
the same route when you come.

I kept house a few months in London, with my family, while I arranged
the matters which you were good enough to intrust me with. There were no
adventures, except that we saw the Jubilee. Afterward I was invited to
one of the Queen’s functions, which was a royal garden party. A garden
is a green and bloomy countrified stretch of land which--But you
remember the Garden of Eden; well, it is like that. The invitation
prescribed the costume that must be worn: “Morning dress with trousers.”
I was intending to wear mine, for I always wear something at garden
parties where ladies are to be present; but I was hurt by this arbitrary
note of compulsion, and did not go. All the European courts are
particular about dress, and you are not allowed to choose for yourself
in any case; you are always told exactly what you must wear; and whether
it is going to become you or not, you are not allowed to make any
changes. Yet the court taste is often bad, and sometimes even
indelicate. I was once invited to dine with an emperor when I was living
awhile in Germany, and the invitation card named the dress I must wear:
“Frock coat and black cravat.” To put it in English, that meant
swallow-tail and black cravat. It was cold weather, too, the middle of
winter; and not only that, but ladies were to be present. That was five
years ago. By this time the coat has gone out, I suppose, and you would
feel at home there if you still remember the old Eden styles.

As soon as the Jubilee was fairly over we broke up housekeeping and went
for a few days to what is called in England “an hotel.” If we could have
afforded an horse and an hackney cab we could have had an heavenly good
time flitting around on our preparation errands, and could have finished
them up briskly; but the buses are slow and they wasted many precious
hours for us. A bus is a sort of great cage on four wheels, and is six
times as strong and eleven times as heavy as the service required of it
demands--but that is the English of it. The bus aptly symbolizes the
national character. The Englishman requires that everything about him
shall be stable, strong, and permanent, except the house which he builds
to rent. His own private house is as strong as a fort. The rod which
holds up the lace curtains could hold up an hippopotamus. The three-foot
flagstaff on his bus, which supports a Union Jack the size of a
handkerchief, would still support it if it were one of the gates of
Gaza. Everything he constructs is a deal heavier and stronger than it
needs to be. He built ten miles of terraced benches to view the Jubilee
procession from, and put timber enough in them to make them a permanent
contribution to the solidities of the world--yet they were intended for
only two days’ service.

When they were being removed an American said, “Don’t do it--save them
for the Resurrection.” If anything gets in the way of the Englishman’s
bus it must get out of it or be bowled down--and that is English. It is
the serene self-sufficient spirit which has carried his flag so far. He
ought to put his aggressive bus in his coat of arms, and take the gentle
unicorn out.

We made our preparations for Switzerland as fast as we could; then
bought the tickets. Bought them of Thomas Cook & Sons, of
course--nowadays shortened to “Cook’s,” to save time and words. Things
have changed in thirty years. I can remember when to be a “Cook’s
tourist” was a thing to be ashamed of, and when everybody felt
privileged to make fun of Cook’s “personally conducted” gangs of
economical provincials. But that has all gone by, now. All sorts and
conditions of men fly to Cook in our days. In the bygone times travel in
Europe was made hateful and humiliating by the wanton difficulties,
hindrances, annoyances, and vexations put upon it by ignorant, stupid,
and disobliging transportation officials, and one had to travel with a
courier or risk going mad. You could not buy a railway ticket on one day
which you purposed to use next day--it was not permitted. You could not
buy a ticket for _any_ train until fifteen minutes before that train was
due to leave. Though you had twenty trunks, you must manage somehow to
get them weighed and the extra weight paid for within that fifteen
minutes; if the time was not sufficient you would have to leave behind
such trunks as failed to pass the scales. If you missed your train, your
ticket was no longer good. As a rule, you could make neither head nor
tail of the railway guide, and if your intended journey was a long one
you would find that the officials could tell you little about which way
to go; consequently you often bought the wrong ticket and got yourself
lost. But Cook has remedied all these things and made travel simple,
easy, and a pleasure. He will sell you a ticket to any place on the
globe, or all the places, and give you all the time you need, and as
much more besides; and it is good for all trains of its class, and its
baggage is weighable at all hours. It provides hotels for you
everywhere, if you so desire; and you cannot be overcharged, for the
coupons show just how much you must pay. Cook’s servants at the great
stations will attend to your baggage, get you a cab, tell you how much
to pay cabmen and porters, procure guides for you, or horses, donkeys,
camels, bicycles, or anything else you want, and make life a comfort and
a satisfaction to you. And if you get tired of traveling and want to
stop, Cook will take back the remains of your ticket, with 10 per cent
off. Cook is your banker everywhere, and his establishment your shelter
when you get caught out in the rain. His clerks will answer all the
questions you ask, and do it courteously. I recommend Your Grace to
travel on Cook’s tickets when you come; and I do this without
embarrassment, for I get no commission. I do not know Cook. (But if you
would rather travel with a courier, let me recommend Joseph Very. I
employed him twenty years ago, and spoke of him very highly in a book,
for he was an excellent courier--then. I employed him again, six or
seven years ago--for a while. Try him. And when you go home, take him
with you.)

That London hotel was a disappointment. It was up a back alley, and we
supposed it would be cheap. But, no, it was built for the moneyed races.
It was all costliness and show. It had a brass band for dinner--and
little else--and it even had a telephone and a lift. A telephone is a
wire stretched on poles or underground, and has a thing at each end of
it. These things are to speak into and to listen at. The wire carries
the words; it can carry them several hundred miles. It is a time-saving,
profanity-breeding, useful invention, and in America is to be found in
all houses except parsonages. It is dear in America, but cheap in
England; yet in England telephones are as rare as are icebergs in your
place. I know of no way to account for this; I only know that it is
extraordinary. The English take kindly to the other modern conveniences,
but for some puzzling reason or other they will not use the telephone.
There are 44,000,000 people there who have never even seen one.

The lift is an elevator. Like the telephone, it also is an American
invention. Its office is to hoist people to the upper stories and save
them the fatigue and delay of climbing. That London hotel could
accommodate several hundred people, and it had just one lift--a lift
which would hold four persons. In America such an hotel would have from
two to six lifts. When I was last in Paris, three years ago, they were
using there what they thought was a lift. It held two persons, and
traveled at such a slow gait that a spectator could not tell which way
it was going. If the passengers were going to the sixth floor, they took
along something to eat; and at night, bedding. Old people did not use
it; except such as were on their way to the good place, anyhow. Often
people that had been lost for days were found in those lifts, jogging
along, jogging along, frequently still alive. The French took great
pride in their ostensible lift, and called it by a grand
name--_ascenseur_. An hotel that had a lift did not keep it secret, but
advertised it in immense letters, _“Il y a une ascenseur,”_ with three
exclamation points after it.

In that London hotel--But never mind that hotel; it was a cruelly
expensive and tawdry and ill-conditioned place, and I wish I could do it
a damage. I will think up a way some time. We went to Queenboro by the
railroad. A railroad is a--well, a railroad is a railroad. I will
describe it more explicitly another time.

Then we went by steamer to Flushing--eight hours. If you sit at home you
can make the trip in less time, because then you can travel by the
steamer company’s advertisement, and that will take you across the
Channel five hours quicker than their boats can do it. Almost everywhere
in Europe the advertisements can give the facts several hours’ odd in
the twenty-four and get in first.

                                   II

We tarried overnight at a summer hotel on the seashore near
Flushing--the Grand Hôtel des Bains. The word Grand means nothing in
this connection; it has no descriptive value. On the Continent, all
hotels, inns, taverns, hash houses and slop troughs employ it. It is
tiresome. This one was a good-enough hotel, and comfortable, but there
was nothing grand about it but the bill, and even that was not
extravagant enough to make the title entirely justifiable. Except in the
case of one item--Scotch whisky. I ordered a sup of that, for I always
take it at night as a preventive of toothache. I have never had the
toothache; and what is more, I never intend to have it. They charged me
a dollar and a half for it. A dollar and a half for half a pint; a
dollar and a half for that wee little mite--really hardly enough to
break a pledge with. It will be a kindness to me if Your Grace will show
the landlord some special attentions when he arrives. Not merely on
account of that piece of extortion, but because he got us back to town
and the station next day, more than an hour before train time.

There were no books or newspapers for sale there, and nothing to look at
but a map. Fortunately it was an interesting one. It was a railway map
of the Low Countries, and was of a new sort to me, for it was made of
tiles--the ground white, the lines black. It could be washed if it got
soiled, and if no accident happens to it it will last ten thousand years
and still be as bright and fine and new and beautiful then as it is
to-day. It occupied a great area of the wall, and one could study it in
comfort halfway across the house. It would be a valuable thing if our
own railway companies would adorn their waiting rooms with maps like
that.

We left at five in the afternoon. The Dutch road was admirably rough; we
went bumping and bouncing and swaying and sprawling along in a most
vindictive and disorderly way; then passed the frontier into Germany,
and straightway quieted down and went gliding as smoothly through the
landscape as if we had been on runners. We reached Cologne after
midnight.

But this letter is already too long. I will close it by saying that I
was charmed with England and sorry to leave it. It is easy to do
business there. I carried out all of Your Grace’s instructions, and did
it without difficulty. I doubted if it was needful to grease Mr. Cecil
Rhodes’s palm any further, for I think he would serve you just for the
love of it; still, I obeyed your orders in the matter. I made him
Permanent General Agent for South Africa, got him and his South Africa
Company whitewashed by the Committee of Inquiry, and promised him a
dukedom. I also continued the European Concert in office, without making
any change in its material. In my opinion this is the best material for
the purpose that exists outside of Your Grace’s own personal Cabinet. It
coddles the Sultan, it has defiled and degraded Greece, it has massacred
a hundred thousand Christians in Armenia and a splendid multitude of
them in Turkey, and has covered civilization and the Christian name with
imperishable shame. If Your Grace would instruct me to add the Concert
to the list of your publicly acknowledged servants, I think it would
have a good effect. The Foreign Offices of the whole European world are
now under your sovereignty, and little attentions like this would keep
them so.




                    A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT FOR OUR


BLUSHING EXILES | (1898)


  ... Well, what do you think of our country _now_? And what do you
  think of the figure she is cutting before the eyes of the world? For
  one, I am ashamed--(Extract from a long and heated letter from a
  Voluntary Exile, Member of the American Colony, Paris.)

And so you are ashamed. I am trying to think out what it can have been
that has produced this large attitude of mind and this fine flow of
sarcasm. Apparently you are ashamed to look Europe in the face; ashamed
of the American name; temporarily ashamed of your nationality. By the
light of remarks made to me by an American here in Vienna, I judge that
you are ashamed because:

1. We are meddling where we have no business and no right; meddling with
the private family matters of a sister nation; intruding upon her sacred
right to do as she pleases with her own, unquestioned by anybody.

2. We are doing this under a sham humanitarian pretext.

3. Doing it in order to filch Cuba, the formal and distinct disclaimer
in the ultimatum being very, very thin humbug, and easily detectable as
such by you and virtuous Europe.

4. And finally you are ashamed of all this because it is new, and base,
and brutal, and dishonest; and because Europe, having had no previous
experience of such things, is horrified by it and can never respect us
nor associate with us any more.

Brutal, base, dishonest? We? Land thieves? Shedders of innocent blood?
We? Traitors to our official word? We? Are we going to lose Europe’s
respect because of this new and dreadful conduct? Russia’s, for
instance? Is she lying stretched out on her back in Manchuria, with her
head among her Siberian prisons and her feet in Port Arthur, trying to
read over the fairy tales she told Lord Salisbury, and not able to do it
for crying because we are maneuvering to treacherously smouch Cuba from
feeble Spain, and because we are ungently shedding innocent Spanish
blood?

Is it France’s respect that we are going to lose? Is our unchivalric
conduct troubling a nation which exists to-day because a brave young
girl saved it when its poltroons had lost it--a nation which deserted
her as one man when her day of peril came? Is our treacherous assault
upon a weak people distressing a nation which contributed Bartholomew’s
Day to human history? Is our ruthless spirit offending the sensibilities
of the nation which gave us the Reign of Terror to read about? Is our
unmanly intrusion into the private affairs of a sister nation shocking
the feelings of the people who sent Maximilian to Mexico? Are our shabby
and pusillanimous ways outraging the fastidious people who have sent an
innocent man (Dreyfus) to a living hell, taken to their embraces the
slimy guilty one, and submitted to a thousand indignities Emile
Zola--the manliest man in France?

Is it Spain’s respect that we are going to lose? Is she sitting sadly
conning her great history and contrasting it with our meddling, cruel,
perfidious one--our shameful history of foreign robberies, humanitarian
shams, and annihilations of weak and unoffending nations? Is she
remembering with pride how she sent Columbus home in chains; how she
sent half of the harmless West Indians into slavery and the rest to the
grave, leaving not one alive; how she robbed and slaughtered the Inca’s
gentle race, then beguiled the Inca into her power with fair promises
and burned him at the stake; how she drenched the New World in blood,
and earned and got the name of The Nation with the Bloody Footprint; how
she drove all the Jews out of Spain in a day, allowing them to sell
their property, but forbidding them to carry any money out of the
country; how she roasted heretics by the thousands and thousands in her
public squares, generation after generation, her kings and her priests
looking on as at a holiday show; how her Holy Inquisition imported hell
into the earth; how she was the first to institute it and the last to
give it up--and then only under compulsion; how, with a spirit
unmodified by time, she still tortures her prisoners to-day; how, with
her ancient passion for pain and blood unchanged, she still crowds the
arena with ladies and gentlemen and priests to see with delight a bull
harried and persecuted and a gored horse dragging his entrails on the
ground; and how, with this incredible character surviving all attempts
to civilize it, her Duke of Alva rises again in the person of General
Weyler--to-day the most idolized personage in Spain--and we see a
hundred thousand women and children shut up in pens and pitilessly
starved to death?

Are we indeed going to lose Spain’s respect? Is there no way to avoid
this calamity--or this compliment? Are we going to lose her respect
because we have made a promise in our ultimatum which she thinks we
shall break? And meantime is she trying to recall some promise of her
own which she has kept?

Is the Professional Official Fibber of Europe really troubled with our
morals? Dear Parisian friend, are you taking seriously the daily remark
of the newspaper and the orator about “this noble nation with an
illustrious history”? That is mere kindness, mere charity for a people
in temporary hard luck. The newspaper and the orator do not mean it.
They wink when they say it.

And so you are ashamed. Do not be ashamed; there is no occasion for it.




                                DUELING
                        (Vienna, Austria, 1898)


This pastime is as common in Austria to-day as it is in France. But with
this difference--that here in the Austrian states the duel is dangerous,
while in France it is not. Here it is tragedy, in France it is comedy;
here it is a solemnity, there it is monkeyshines; here the duelist risks
his life, there he does not even risk his shirt. Here he fights with
pistol or saber, in France with a hairpin--a blunt one. Here the
desperately wounded man tries to walk to the hospital; there they paint
the scratch so that they can find it again, lay the sufferer on a
stretcher, and conduct him off the field with a band of music.

At the end of a French duel the pair hug and kiss and cry, and praise
each other’s valor; then the surgeons make an examination and pick out
the scratched one, and the other one helps him on to the litter and pays
his fare; and in return the scratched one treats to champagne and
oysters in the evening, and then “the incident is closed,” as the French
say. It is all polite, and gracious, and pretty, and impressive. At the
end of an Austrian duel the antagonist that is alive gravely offers his
hand to the other man, utters some phrases of courteous regret, then
bids him good-by and goes his way, and that incident also is closed. The
French duelist is painstakingly protected from danger, by the rules of
the game. His antagonist’s weapon cannot reach so far as his body; if he
gets a scratch it will not be above his elbow. But in Austria the rules
of the game do not provide against danger, they carefully provide _for_
it, usually. Commonly the combat must be kept up until one of the men is
disabled; a nondisabling slash or stab does not retire him.

For a matter of three months I watched the Viennese journals, and
whenever a duel was reported in their telegraphic columns I scrap-booked
it. By this record I find that dueling in Austria is not confined to
journalists and old maids, as in France, but is indulged in by military
men, journalists, students, physicians, lawyers, members of the
legislature, and even the Cabinet, the bench, and the police. Dueling is
forbidden by law; and so it seems odd to see the makers and
administrators of the laws dancing on their work in this way. Some
months ago Count Badeni, at that time chief of the government, fought a
pistol duel here in the capital city of the Empire with Representative
Wolf, and both of those distinguished Christians came near getting
turned out of the Church--for the Church as well as the state forbids
dueling.

In one case, lately, in Hungary, the police interfered and stopped a
duel after the first innings. This was a saber duel between the chief of
police and the city attorney. Unkind things were said about it by the
newspapers. They said the police remembered their duty uncommonly well
when their own officials were the parties concerned in duels. But I
think the underlings showed bread-and-butter judgment. If their
superiors had carved each other well, the public would have asked,
“Where were the police?” and their place would have been endangered; but
custom does not require them to be around where mere unofficial citizens
are explaining a thing with sabers.

There was another duel--a double duel--going on in the immediate
neighborhood at the time, and in this case the police obeyed custom and
did not disturb it. Their bread and butter was not at stake there. In
this duel a physician fought a couple of surgeons, and wounded both--one
of them lightly, the other seriously. An undertaker wanted to keep
people from interfering, but that was quite natural again.

Selecting at random from my record, I next find a duel at Tranopol
between military men. An officer of the Tenth Dragoons charged an
officer of the Ninth Dragoons with an offense against the laws of the
card table. There was a defect or a doubt somewhere in the matter, and
this had to be examined and passed upon by a court of honor. So the case
was sent up to Lemberg for this purpose. One would like to know what the
defect was, but the newspaper does not say. A man here who has fought
many duels and has a graveyard says that probably the matter in question
was as to whether the accusation was true or not; that if the charge was
a very grave one--cheating, for instance--proof of its truth would rule
the guilty officer out of the field of honor; the court would not allow
a gentleman to fight with such a person. You see what a solemn thing it
is; you see how particular they are; any little careless speech can lose
you your privilege of getting yourself shot, here. The court seems to
have gone into the matter in a searching and careful fashion, for
several months elapsed before it reached a decision. It then sanctioned
a duel and the accused killed his accuser.

Next I find a duel between a prince and a major; first with pistols--no
result satisfactory to either party; then with sabers, and the major
badly hurt.

Next, a saber duel between journalists--the one a strong man, the other
feeble and in poor health. It was brief; the strong one drove his sword
through the weak one, and death was immediate.

Next, a duel between a lieutenant and a student of medicine. According
to the newspaper report, these are the details: The student was in a
restaurant one evening; passing along, he halted at a table to speak
with some friends; near by sat a dozen military men; the student
conceived that one of these was “staring” at him; he asked the officer
to step outside and explain. This officer and another one gathered up
their capes and sabers and went out with the student. Outside--this is
the student’s account--the student introduced himself to the offending
officer and said, “You seemed to stare at me”; for answer, the officer
struck the student with his fist; the student parried the blow; both
officers drew their sabers and attacked the young fellow, and one of
them gave him a wound on the left arm; then they withdrew. This was
Saturday night. The duel followed on Monday, in the military riding
school--the customary dueling ground all over Austria, apparently. The
weapons were pistols. The dueling terms were somewhat beyond custom in
the matter of severity, if I may gather that from the statement that the
combat was fought “unter sehr schweren Bedingungen”--to wit, “distance,
15 steps--with 3 steps advance.” There was but one exchange of shots.
The student was hit. “He put his hand on his breast, his body began to
bend slowly forward, then collapsed in death and sank to the ground.”

It is pathetic. There are other duels in my list, but I find in each and
all of them one and the same ever-recurring defect--the _principals_ are
never present, but only by their sham representatives. The _real_
principals in any duel are not the duelists themselves, but their
_families_. They do the mourning, the suffering; theirs is the loss and
theirs the misery. They stake all that, the duelist stakes nothing but
his life, and that is a trivial thing compared with what his death must
cost those whom he leaves behind him. Challenges should not mention the
duelist; he has nothing much at stake, and the real vengeance cannot
reach him. The challenge should summon the offender’s old gray mother
and his young wife and his little children--these, or any of whom he is
a dear and worshiped possession--and should say, “You have done me no
harm, but I am the meek slave of a custom which requires me to crush the
happiness out of your hearts and condemn you to years of pain and grief,
in order that I may wash clean with your tears a stain which has been
put upon me by another person.”

The logic of it is admirable; a person has robbed me of a penny; I must
beggar ten innocent persons to make good my loss. Surely nobody’s
“honor” is worth all that.

Since the duelist’s family are the real principals in a duel, the state
ought to compel them to be present at it. Custom, also, ought to be so
amended as to require it; and without it no duel ought to be allowed to
go on. If that student’s unoffending mother had been present and
watching the officer through her tears as he raised his pistol, he--why,
he would have fired in the air! We know that. For we know how we are all
made. Laws ought to be based upon the ascertained facts of our nature.
It would be a simple thing to make a dueling law which would stop
dueling.

As things are now, the mother is never invited. She submits to this; and
without outward complaint, for she, too, is the vassal of custom, and
custom requires her to conceal her pain when she learns the disastrous
news that her son must go to the dueling field, and by the powerful
force that is lodged in habit and custom she is enabled to obey this
trying requirement--a requirement which exacts a miracle of her, and
gets it. In January a neighbor of ours who has a young son in the army
was awakened by this youth at three o’clock one morning, and she sat up
in bed and listened to his message:

“I have come to tell you something, mother, which will distress you, but
you must be good and brave and bear it. I have been affronted by a
fellow officer and we fight at three this afternoon. Lie down and sleep,
now, and think no more about it.”

She kissed him good night and lay down paralyzed with grief and fear,
but said nothing. But she did not sleep; she prayed and mourned till the
first streak of dawn, then fled to the nearest church and implored the
Virgin for help; and from that church she went to another and another;
church after church, and still church after church, and so spent all the
day until three o’clock on her knees in agony and tears; then dragged
herself home and sat down, comfortless and desolate, to count the
minutes, and wait, with an outward show of calm, for what had been
ordained for her--happiness, or endless misery. Presently she heard the
clank of a saber--she had not known before what music was in that
sound--and her son put his head in and said:

“X was in the wrong and he apologized.”

So that incident was closed; and for the rest of her life the mother
will always find something pleasant about the clank of a saber, no
doubt.

In one of my listed duels--However, let it go, there is nothing
particularly striking about it except that the seconds interfered. And
prematurely, too, for neither man was dead. This was certainly
irregular. Neither of the men liked it. It was a duel with cavalry
sabers, between an editor and a lieutenant. The editor walked to the
hospital; the lieutenant was carried. In Austria an editor who can write
well is valuable, but he is not likely to remain so unless he can handle
a saber with charm.

The following very recent telegram shows that also in France duels are
humanely stopped as soon as they approach the (French) danger point:

                          (Reuter’s Telegram)

                                                 PARIS, _March 5th_.

  The duel between Colonels Henry and Picquart took place this morning
  in the riding school of the École Militaire, the doors of which were
  strictly guarded in order to prevent intrusion. The combatants, who
  fought with swords, were in position at ten o’clock.

  At the first re-engagement Lieut.-Col. Henry was slightly scratched in
  the forearm, and just at the same moment his own blade appeared to
  touch his adversary’s neck. Senator Ranc, who was Colonel Picquart’s
  second, stopped the fight, but as it was found that his principal had
  not been touched, the combat continued. A very sharp encounter ensued,
  in which Colonel Henry was wounded in the elbow, and the duel then
  terminated.

After which the stretcher and the band. In lurid contrast with this
delicate flirtation, we have an account of a deadly duel of day before
yesterday in Italy, where the earnest Austrian duel is in vogue. I knew
one of the principals, Cavalotti, slightly, and this gives me a sort of
personal interest in his duel. I first saw him in Rome several years
ago. He was sitting on a block of stone in the Forum, and was writing
something in his notebook--a poem or a challenge, or something like
that--and the friend who pointed him out to me said, “That is
Cavalotti--he has fought thirty duels; do not disturb him.” I did not
disturb him.




                      SKELETON PLAN OF A PROPOSED
                           CASTING VOTE PARTY
                                 (1901)

  NOTE.--Mark Twain’s effort was always for clean politics. In 1901 he
  formulated what to him seemed a feasible plan to obtain this boon. It
  is here first published.--A. B. P.

                            ITS MAIN OBJECT

To compel the two Great Parties to nominate their _best man_ always.

                         FOUNDATION PRINCIPLES

With the offices all filled by the best men of either of the two Great
Parties, we shall have good government. We hold that this is beyond
dispute, and does not need to be argued.

                                DETAILS

1. The C. V. Party should be _organized_. This, in order to secure its
continuance and permanency.

2. Any of the following acts must sever the connection of a member with
the Casting Vote party:

 The seeking of any office, appointive or elective.
 The acceptance of a nomination to any such office.
 The acceptance of such an office.

3. The organization should never vote for _any but a nominee of one or
the other of the two Great Parties_, and should then cast their _entire
vote_ for that nominee.

4. They should have no dealings with minor parties.

5. There should be ward organizations, township, town, city,
congressional district, state and national organizations. The party
should work wherever there is an elective office, from the lowest up to
the Presidency.

6. As a rule, none of the organizations will need to be large. In most
cases they will be able to control the action of the two Great Parties
without that. In the matter of membership, quality will be the main
thing, rather than quantity.

In small constituencies, where a town constable or a justice of the
peace is to be elected it will often be the case that a Casting Vote
lodge of fifty members can elect the nominee it prefers. In every such
community the material for the fifty is present. It will be found among
the men who are disgusted with the prevailing political methods, the low
ambitions and ideals, of the politicians; dishonesty in office;
corruption; the frank distribution of appointments among characterless
and incompetent men as pay for party service; the evasion and sometimes
straight-out violation of the civil-service laws. The fifty will be
found among the men who are ashamed of this condition of things and who
have despaired of seeing it bettered; _who stay away from the polls and
do not vote;_ who do not attend primaries, and would be insulted there
if they did.

The fifty exist in every little community; they are not seen, not heard,
not regarded--but they are there. There, and deeply and sincerely
desirous of good and sound government, and ready to give the best help
they can if any will place before them a competent way. They are
reserved and quiet merchants and shopkeepers, middle-aged; they are
young men making their way in the offices of doctors and lawyers and
behind counters; they are journeyman high-class mechanics; they are
organizers of, and workers for, the community’s charities, art and other
social-improvement clubs, university settlements, Young Men’s Christian
Association, circulating libraries; they are readers of books,
frequenters of the library. They have never seen a primary, and they
have an aversion for the polls.

7. Men proposing to create a Casting Vote lodge should not advertise
their purpose; conspiracies for good, like conspiracies for evil, are
best conducted privately until success is sure. The poll of the two
Great Parties should be examined, and the winning party’s majority
noted. _It is this majority which the Casting Vote must overcome and
nullify._ If the total vote cast was 1,000 and the majority vote fifty,
the proposers of a lodge should canvass privately until they have
secured 75 or 100 names; they can organize then, without solicitude; the
balance of power is in their hands, and this fact by itself will add
names to its membership. If the total vote is 10,000 and the majority
vote 1,000, the procedure should be as before: the thousand-and-upward
should be secured by private canvass before public organization is
instituted. Where a total vote is 1,000,000 the majority vote is not
likely to exceed 30,000. Five or six canvassers can begin the listing;
each man secured becomes a canvasser, ten know three apiece who will
join; the thirty know three apiece who will join; the ninety know three
hundred, the three hundred know a thousand, the thousand know three
thousand--and so on; the required thirty or forty thousand can be
secured in ten days, the lodge organized, and its casting vote be ready
and self-pledged and competent to elect the best of the nominees the two
Great Parties may put up at that date or later.

8. In every ward of every city there is enough of this material to hold
the balance of power over the two Great Parties in a ward election; in
every city there is enough of it to determine which of the two nominees
shall be mayor; in every congressional district there is enough of it to
elect the Governor; also to elect the legislature and choose the U. S.
Senators; and in the United States there is enough of it to throw the
Casting Vote for its choice between the nominees of the two Great
Parties and seat him in the presidential chair.

9. From constable up to President there is no office for which the two
Great Parties cannot furnish able, clean, and acceptable men. Whenever
the balance of power shall be lodged in a permanent third party with no
candidates of its own and no function but to cast its _whole vote_ for
the best man put forward by the Republicans and Democrats, these two
parties _will select the best men they have in their ranks_. Good and
clean government will follow, let its party complexion be what it may;
and the country will be quite content.

                               THE LODGES

The primal lodge--call it A--should consist of 10 men only. It is enough
and can meet in a dwelling house or a shop, and get well acquainted at
once. It has before it the names of the nominees of the two Great
Parties--Jones (Republican), Smith (Democrat). It fails of
unanimity--both candidates perchance being good men and about equally
acceptable--and casts seven votes, say, for Jones and three for Smith.

It elects one of its ten to meet similar delegates from any number of
local A lodges and hand in its vote. This body--call it a B
lodge--examines the aggregate vote; this time the majority may be with
Smith. The members carry the result to the A lodges; and these, by the
conditions of their membership, must vote for Smith.

In the case of a state election, bodies each consisting of a number of B
lodges would elect a delegate to a state council, and the state council
would examine the aggregate vote and give its decision in favor of the
Republican or Democratic candidate receiving the majority of the Casting
Vote’s suffrages.

In the case of a presidential contest, the state council would appoint
delegates to a national convention, and these would examine the
aggregate Casting Vote vote and determine and announce the choice of the
Casting Vote organizations of the whole country. At the presidential
election the A lodges throughout the land would vote for presidential
electors of the Party indicated.

If the reader thinks well of the project, let him begin a private
canvass among his friends and give it a practical test, without waiting
for other people to begin. If in the hands of men who regard their
citizenship as a high trust this scheme shall fail upon trial, a better
must be sought, a better must be invented; for it cannot be well or safe
to let the present political conditions continue indefinitely. They can
be improved, and American citizenship should rouse up from its
disheartenment and see that it is done.




                    THE UNITED STATES OF LYNCHERDOM
                                 (1901)

  law, and when in 1901 a particularly barbarous incident occurred in
  his native state he was moved to express himself in print. The article
  was not offered for publication, perhaps because the moment of
  timeliness had passed. Its general timeliness, however, is perennial
  and a word from “America’s foremost private citizen” on the subject is
  worthy of preservation.--A. B. P.

                                   I

And so Missouri has fallen, that great state! Certain of her children
have joined the lynchers, and the smirch is upon the rest of us. That
handful of her children have given us a character and labeled us with a
name, and to the dwellers in the four quarters of the earth we are
“lynchers,” now, and ever shall be. For the world will not stop and
think--it never does, it is not its way; its way is to generalize from a
single sample. It will not say, “Those Missourians have been busy eighty
years in building an honorable good name for themselves; these hundred
lynchers down in the corner of the state are not real Missourians, they
are renegades.” No, that truth will not enter its mind; it will
generalize from the one or two misleading samples and say, “The
Missourians are lynchers.” It has no reflection, no logic, no sense of
proportion. With it, figures go for nothing; to it, figures reveal
nothing, it cannot reason upon them rationally; it would say, for
instance, that China is being swiftly and surely Christianized, since
nine Chinese Christians are being made every day; and it would fail,
with him, to notice that the fact that 33,000 pagans are _born_ there
every day, damages the argument. It would say, “There are a hundred
lynchers there, therefore the Missourians are lynchers”; the
considerable fact that there are two and a half million Missourians who
are _not_ lynchers would not affect their verdict.

                                   II

Oh, Missouri!

The tragedy occurred near Pierce City, down in the southwestern corner
of the state. On a Sunday afternoon a young white woman who had started
alone from church was found murdered. For there are churches there; in
my time religion was more general, more pervasive, in the South than it
was in the North, and more virile and earnest, too, I think; I have some
reason to believe that this is still the case. The young woman was found
murdered. Although it was a region of churches and schools the people
rose, lynched three negroes--two of them very aged ones--burned out five
negro households, and drove thirty negro families into the woods.

I do not dwell upon the provocation which moved the people to these
crimes, for that has nothing to do with the matter; the only question
is, does the assassin _take the law into his own hands_? It is very
simple, and very just. If the assassin be proved to have usurped the
law’s prerogative in righting his wrongs, that ends the matter; a
thousand provocations are no defense. The Pierce City people had bitter
provocation--indeed, as revealed by certain of the particulars, the
bitterest of all provocations--but no matter, they took the law into
their own hands, when by the terms of their statutes their victim would
certainly hang if the law had been allowed to take its course, for there
are but few negroes in that region and they are without authority and
without influence in overawing juries.

Why has lynching, with various barbaric accompaniments, become a
favorite regulator in cases of “the usual crime” in several parts of the
country? Is it because men think a lurid and terrible punishment a more
forcible object lesson and a more effective deterrent than a sober and
colorless hanging done privately in a jail would be? Surely sane men do
not think that. Even the average child should know better. It should
know that any strange and much-talked-of event is always followed by
imitations, the world being so well supplied with excitable people who
only need a little stirring up to make them lose what is left of their
heads and do mad things which they would not have thought of ordinarily.
It should know that if a man jump off Brooklyn Bridge another will
imitate him; that if a person venture down Niagara Whirlpool in a barrel
another will imitate him; that if a Jack the Ripper make notoriety by
slaughtering women in dark alleys he will be imitated; that if a man
attempt a king’s life and the newspapers carry the noise of it around
the globe, regicides will crop up all around. The child should know that
one much-talked-of outrage and murder committed by a negro will upset
the disturbed intellects of several other negroes and produce a series
of the very tragedies the community would so strenuously wish to
prevent; that each of these crimes will produce another series, and year
by year steadily increase the tale of these disasters instead of
diminishing it; that, in a word, the lynchers are themselves the worst
enemies of their women. The child should also know that by a law of our
make, communities, as well as individuals, are imitators; and that a
much-talked-of lynching will infallibly produce other lynchings here and
there and yonder, and that in time these will breed a mania, a fashion;
a fashion which will spread wide and wider, year by year, covering state
after state, as with an advancing disease. Lynching has reached
Colorado, it has reached California, it has reached Indiana--and now
Missouri! I may live to see a negro burned in Union Square, New York,
with fifty thousand people present, and not a sheriff visible, not a
governor, not a constable, not a colonel, not a clergyman, not a
law-and-order representative of any sort.

  _Increase in Lynching._--In 1900 there were eight more cases than in
  1899, and probably this year there will be more than there were last
  year. The year is little more than half gone, and yet there are
  eighty-eight cases as compared with one hundred and fifteen for all of
  last year. The four Southern states, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and
  Mississippi are the worst offenders. Last year there were eight cases
  in Alabama, sixteen in Georgia, twenty in Louisiana, and twenty in
  Mississippi--over one-half the total. This year to date there have
  been nine in Alabama, twelve in Georgia, eleven in Louisiana, and
  thirteen in Mississippi--again more than one-half the total number in
  the whole United States.--Chicago _Tribune_.

It must be that the increase comes of the inborn human instinct to
imitate--that and man’s commonest weakness, his aversion to being
unpleasantly conspicuous, pointed at, shunned, as being on the unpopular
side. Its other name is Moral Cowardice, and is the commanding feature
of the make-up of 9,999 men in the 10,000. I am not offering this as a
discovery; privately the dullest of us knows it to be true. History will
not allow us to forget or ignore this supreme trait of our character. It
persistently and sardonically reminds us that from the beginning of the
world no revolt against a public infamy or oppression has ever been
begun but by the one daring man in the 10,000, the rest timidly waiting,
and slowly and reluctantly joining, under the influence of that man and
his fellows from the other ten thousands. The abolitionists remember.
Privately the public feeling was with them early, but each man was
afraid to speak out until he got some hint that his neighbor was
privately feeling as he privately felt himself. Then the boom followed.
It always does. It will occur in New York, some day; and even in
Pennsylvania.

It has been supposed--and said--that the people at a lynching enjoy the
spectacle and are glad of a chance to see it. It cannot be true; all
experience is against it. The people in the South are made like the
people in the North--the vast majority of whom are right-hearted and
compassionate, and would be cruelly pained by such a spectacle--and
_would attend it_, and let on to be pleased with it, if the public
approval seemed to require it. We are made like that, and we cannot help
it. The other animals are not so, but we cannot help that, either. They
lack the Moral Sense; we have no way of trading ours off, for a nickel
or some other thing above its value. The Moral Sense teaches us what is
right, and how to avoid it--when unpopular.

It is thought, as I have said, that a lynching crowd enjoys a lynching.
It certainly is not true; it is impossible of belief. It is freely
asserted--you have seen it in print many times of late--that the
lynching impulse has been misinterpreted; that it is _not_ the outcome
of a spirit of revenge, but of a “mere atrocious hunger _to look upon
human suffering_.” If that were so, the crowds that saw the Windsor
Hotel burn down would have enjoyed the horrors that fell under their
eyes. Did they? No one will think that of them, no one will make that
charge. Many risked their lives to save the men and women who were in
peril. Why did they do that? Because _none would disapprove_. There was
no restraint; they could follow their natural impulse. Why does a crowd
of the same kind of people in Texas, Colorado, Indiana, stand by,
smitten to the heart and miserable, and by ostentatious outward signs
pretend to enjoy a lynching? Why does it lift no hand or voice in
protest? Only because it would be unpopular to do it, I think; each man
is afraid of his neighbor’s disapproval--a thing which, to the general
run of the race, is more dreaded than wounds and death. When there is to
be a lynching the people hitch up and come miles to see it, bringing
their wives and children. Really to see it? No--they come only because
they are afraid to stay at home, lest it be noticed and offensively
commented upon. We may believe this, for we all know how _we_ feel about
such spectacles--also, how we would act under the like pressure. We are
not any better nor any braver than anybody else, and we must not try to
creep out of it.

A Savonarola can quell and scatter a mob of lynchers with a mere glance
of his eye: so can a Merrill[7] or a Beloat.[8] For no mob has any sand
in the presence of a man known to be splendidly brave. Besides, a
lynching mob would _like_ to be scattered, for of a certainty there are
never ten men in it who would not prefer to be somewhere else--and would
be, if they but had the courage to go. When I was a boy I saw a brave
gentleman deride and insult a mob and drive it away; and afterward, in
Nevada, I saw a noted desperado make two hundred men sit still, with the
house burning under them, until he gave them permission to retire. A
plucky man can rob a whole passenger train by himself; and the half of a
brave man can hold up a stagecoach and strip its occupants.

Then perhaps the remedy for lynchings comes to this: station a brave man
in each affected community to encourage, support, and bring to light the
deep disapproval of lynching hidden in the secret places of its
heart--for it is there, beyond question. Then those communities will
find something better to imitate--of course, being human, they must
imitate something. Where shall these brave men be found? That is indeed
a difficulty; there are not three hundred of them in the earth. If
merely _physically_ brave men would do, then it were easy; they could be
furnished by the cargo. When Hobson called for seven volunteers to go
with him to what promised to be certain death, four thousand men
responded--the whole fleet, in fact. Because _all the world would
approve_. They knew that; but if Hobson’s project had been charged with
the scoffs and jeers of the friends and associates, whose good opinion
and approval the sailors valued, he could not have got his seven.

No, upon reflection, the scheme will not work. There are not enough
morally brave men in stock. We are out of moral-courage material; we are
in a condition of profound poverty. We have those two sheriffs down
South who--but never mind, it is not enough to go around; they have to
stay and take care of their own communities.

But if we only _could_ have three or four more sheriffs of that great
breed! Would it help? I think so. For we are all imitators: other brave
sheriffs would follow; to be a dauntless sheriff would come to be
recognized as the correct and only thing, and the dreaded disapproval
would fall to the share of the other kind; courage in this office would
become custom, the absence of it a dishonor, just as courage presently
replaces the timidity of the new soldier; then the mobs and the
lynchings would disappear, and----

However. It can never be done without some starters, and where are we to
get the starters? Advertise? Very well, then, let us advertise.

In the meantime, there is another plan. Let us import American
missionaries from China, and send them into the lynching field. With
1,511 of them out there converting two Chinamen apiece per annum against
an uphill birth rate of 33,000 pagans per day,[9] it will take upward of
a million years to make the conversions balance the output and bring the
Christianizing of the country in sight to the naked eye; therefore, if
we can offer our missionaries as rich a field at home at lighter expense
and quite satisfactory in the matter of danger, why shouldn’t they find
it fair and right to come back and give us a trial? The Chinese are
universally conceded to be excellent people, honest, honorable,
industrious, trustworthy, kind-hearted, and all that--leave them alone,
they are plenty good enough just as they are; and besides, almost every
convert runs a risk of catching our civilization. We ought to be
careful. We ought to think twice before we encourage a risk like that;
for, _once civilized, China can never be uncivilized again_. We have not
been thinking of that. Very well, we ought to think of it now. Our
missionaries will find that we have a field for them--and not only for
the 1,511, but for 15,011. Let them look at the following telegram and
see if they have anything in China that is more appetizing. It is from
Texas:

  The negro was taken to a tree and swung in the air. Wood and fodder
  were piled beneath his body and a hot fire was made. _Then it was
  suggested that the man ought not to die too quickly, and he was let
  down to the ground while a party went to Dexter, about two miles
  distant, to procure coal oil._ This was thrown on the flames and the
  work completed.

We implore them to come back and help us in our need. Patriotism imposes
this duty on them. Our country is worse off than China; they are our
countrymen, their motherland supplicates their aid in this her hour of
deep distress. They are competent; our people are not. They are used to
scoffs, sneers, revilings, danger; our people are not. They have the
martyr spirit; nothing but the martyr spirit can brave a lynching mob,
and cow it and scatter it. They can save their country, we beseech them
to come home and do it. We ask them to read that telegram again, and yet
again, and picture the scene in their minds, and soberly ponder it; then
multiply it by 115, add 88; place the 203 in a row, allowing 600 feet of
space for each human torch, so that there may be viewing room around it
for 5,000 Christian American men, women, and children, youths and
maidens; make it night, for grim effect; have the show in a gradually
rising plain, and let the course of the stakes be uphill; the eye can
then take in the whole line of twenty-four miles of blood-and-flesh
bonfires unbroken, whereas if it occupied level ground the ends of the
line would bend down and be hidden from view by the curvature of the
earth. All being ready, now, and the darkness opaque, the stillness
impressive--for there should be no sound but the soft moaning of the
night wind and the muffled sobbing of the sacrifices--let all the far
stretch of kerosened pyres be touched off simultaneously and the glare
and the shrieks and the agonies burst heavenward to the Throne.

There are more than a million persons present; the light from the fires
flushes into vague outline against the night the spires of five thousand
churches. O kind missionary, O compassionate missionary, leave China!
come home and convert these Christians!

I believe that if anything can stop this epidemic of bloody insanities
it is martial personalities that can face mobs without flinching; and as
such personalities are developed only by familiarity with danger and by
the training and seasoning which come of resisting it, the likeliest
place to find them must be among the missionaries who have been under
tuition in China during the past year or two. We have abundance of work
for them, and for hundreds and thousands more, and the field is daily
growing and spreading. Shall we find them? We can try. In 75,000,000
there must be other Merrills and Beloats; and it is the law of our make
that each example shall wake up drowsing chevaliers of the same great
knighthood and bring them to the front.

                   TO THE PERSON SITTING IN DARKNESS
                    (_North American Review_, 1901)


See introduction to this volume for some account of this and the
following article.

  Christmas will dawn in the United States over a people full of hope
  and aspiration and good cheer. Such a condition means contentment and
  happiness. The carping grumbler who may here and there go forth will
  find few to listen to him. The majority will wonder what is the matter
  with him and pass on.--New York _Tribune_, on Christmas Eve.

From the _Sun_, of New York:

  The purpose of this article is not to describe the terrible offenses
  against humanity committed in the name of Politics in some of the most
  notorious East Side districts. _They could not be described, even
  verbally._ But it is the intention to let the great mass of more or
  less careless citizens of this beautiful metropolis of the New World
  get some conception of the havoc and ruin wrought to man, woman, and
  child in the most densely populated and least-known section of the
  city. Name, date, and place can be supplied to those of little
  faith--or to any man who feels himself aggrieved. It is a plain
  statement of record and observation, written without license and
  without garnish.

  Imagine, if you can, a section of the city territory completely
  dominated by one man, without whose permission neither legitimate nor
  illegitimate business can be conducted; _where illegitimate business
  is encouraged and legitimate business discouraged_; where the
  respectable residents have to fasten their doors and windows summer
  nights and sit in their rooms with asphyxiating air and 100-degree
  temperature, rather than try to catch the faint whiff of breeze in
  their natural breathing places, the stoops of their homes; _where
  naked women dance by night in the streets, and unsexed men prowl like
  vultures through the darkness on “business”_ not only permitted but
  encouraged by the police; _where the education of infants begins with
  the knowledge of prostitution_ and the training of little girls is
  training in the arts of Phryne; where _American_ girls brought up with
  the refinements of _American_ homes are imported from small towns
  up-state, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Jersey, and kept as
  virtually prisoners as if they were locked up behind jail bars until
  they have lost all semblance of womanhood; _where small boys are
  taught to solicit for the women of disorderly houses_; where there is
  an organized society of young men _whose sole business in life is to
  corrupt young girls and turn them over to bawdy houses_; where men
  walking with their wives along the street are openly insulted; _where
  children that have adult diseases are the chief patrons of the
  hospitals and dispensaries_; where it is the rule, rather than the
  exception, that _murder, rape, robbery, and theft go unpunished_--in
  short where the Premium of the most awful forms of Vice is the Profit
  of the politicians.

The following news from China appeared in the _Sun_, of New York, on
Christmas Eve. The italics are mine:

  The Rev. Mr. Ament, of the American Board of Foreign Missions, has
  returned from a trip which he made for the purpose of collecting
  indemnities for damages done by Boxers. _Everywhere he went he
  compelled the Chinese to pay._ He says that all his native Christians
  are now provided for. He had 700 of them under his charge, and 300
  were killed. He has _collected 300 taels for each_ of these murders,
  and has _compelled full payment for all the property belonging to
  Christians_ that was destroyed. He also assessed _fines_ amounting to
  THIRTEEN TIMES the amount of the indemnity. _This money will be used
  for the propagation of the Gospel._

  Mr. Ament declares that the compensation he has collected is
  _moderate_ when compared with the amount secured by the Catholics, who
  demand, in addition to money, _head for head_. They collect 500 taels
  for each murder of a Catholic. In the Wenchiu country, 680 Catholics
  were killed, and for this the European Catholics here demand 750,000
  strings of cash and 680 _heads_.

  In the course of a conversation, Mr. Ament referred to the attitude of
  the missionaries toward the Chinese. He said:

  “I deny emphatically that the missionaries are _vindictive_, that they
  _generally_ looted, or that they have done anything _since_ the siege
  that _the circumstances did not demand_. I criticize the Americans.
  _The soft hand of the Americans is not as good as the mailed fist of
  the Germans._ If you deal with the Chinese with a soft hand they will
  take advantage of it.

  “The statement that the French government will return the loot taken
  by the French soldiers is the source of the greatest amusement here.
  The French soldiers were more systematic looters than the Germans, and
  it is a fact that to-day _Catholic Christians_, carrying French flags
  and armed with modern guns, _are looting villages_ in the Province of
  Chili.”

By happy luck, we get all these glad tidings on Christmas Eve--just in
time enable us to celebrate the day with proper gayety and enthusiasm.
Our spirits soar, and we find we can even make jokes: Taels, I win,
Heads you lose.

Our Reverend Ament is the right man in the right place. What we want of
our missionaries out there is, not that they shall merely represent in
their acts and persons the grace and gentleness and charity and
loving-kindness of our religion, but that they shall also represent the
American spirit. The oldest Americans are the Pawnees. Macallum’s
History says:

  When a white Boxer kills a Pawnee and destroys his property, the other
  Pawnees do not trouble to seek _him_ out, they kill any white person
  that comes along; also, they make some white village pay deceased’s
  heirs the full cash value of deceased, together with full cash value
  of the property destroyed; they also make the village pay, in
  addition, _thirteen times_ the value of that property into a fund for
  the dissemination of the Pawnee religion, which they regard as the
  best of all religions for the softening and humanizing of the heart of
  man. It is their idea that it is only fair and right that the innocent
  should be made to suffer for the guilty, and that it is better that
  ninety and nine innocent should suffer than that one guilty person
  should escape.

Our Reverend Ament is justifiably jealous of those enterprising
Catholics, who not only get big money for each lost convert, but get
“head for head” besides. But he should soothe himself with the
reflections that the entirety of their exactions are for their own
pockets, whereas he, less selfishly, devotes only 300 taels per head to
that service, and gives the whole vast thirteen repetitions of the
property-indemnity to the service of propagating the Gospel. His
magnanimity has won him the approval of his nation, and will get him a
monument. Let him be content with these rewards. We all hold him dear
for manfully defending his fellow missionaries from exaggerated charges
which were beginning to distress us, but which his testimony has so
considerably modified that we can now contemplate them without
noticeable pain. For now we know that, even before the siege, the
missionaries were not “generally” out looting, and that, “since the
siege,” they have acted quite handsomely, except when “circumstances”
crowded them. I am arranging for the monument. Subscriptions for it can
be sent to the American Board; designs for it can be sent to me. Designs
must allegorically set forth the Thirteen Reduplications of the
Indemnity, and the Object for which they were exacted; as Ornaments, the
designs must exhibit 680 Heads, so disposed as to give a pleasing and
pretty effect; for the Catholics have done nicely, and are entitled to
notice in the monument. Mottoes may be suggested, if any shall be
discovered that will satisfactorily cover the ground.

Mr. Ament’s financial feat of squeezing a thirteenfold indemnity out of
the pauper peasants to square other people’s offenses, thus condemning
them and their women and innocent little children to inevitable
starvation and lingering death, in order that the blood money so
acquired might be “_used for the propagation of the Gospel_,” does not
flutter my serenity; although the act and the words, taken together,
concrete a blasphemy so hideous and so colossal that, without doubt, its
mate is not findable in the history of this or of any other age. Yet, if
a layman had done that thing and justified it with those words, I should
have shuddered, I know. Or, if I had done the thing and said the words
myself--However, the thought is unthinkable, irreverent as some
imperfectly informed people think me. Sometimes an ordained minister
sets out to be blasphemous. When this happens, the layman is out of the
running; he stands no chance.

We have Mr. Ament’s impassioned assurance that the missionaries are not
“vindictive.” Let us hope and pray that they will never become so, but
will remain in the almost morbidly fair and just and gentle temper which
is affording so much satisfaction to their brother and champion to-day.

The following is from the New York _Tribune_ of Christmas Eve. It comes
from that journal’s Tokyo correspondent. It has a strange and impudent
sound, but the Japanese are but partially civilized as yet. When they
become wholly civilized they will not talk so:

  The missionary question, of course, occupies a foremost place in the
  discussion. It is now felt as essential that the Western Powers take
  cognizance of the sentiment here, that religious invasions of Oriental
  countries by powerful Western organizations are tantamount to
  filibustering expeditions, and should not only be discountenanced, but
  that stern measures should be adopted for their suppression. The
  feeling here is that the missionary organizations constitute a
  constant menace to peaceful international relations.

_Shall we?_ That is, shall we go on conferring our Civilization upon the
peoples that sit in darkness, or shall we give those poor things a rest?
Shall we bang right ahead in our old-time, loud, pious way, and commit
the new century to the game; or shall we sober up and sit down and think
it over first? Would it not be prudent to get our Civilization tools
together, and see how much stock is left on hand in the way of Glass
Beads and Theology, and Maxim Guns and Hymn Books, and Trade Gin and
Torches of Progress and Enlightenment (patent adjustable ones, good to
fire villages with, upon occasion), and balance the books, and arrive at
the profit and loss, so that we may intelligently decide whether to
continue the business or sell out the property and start a new
Civilization Scheme on the proceeds?

Extending the Blessings of Civilization to our Brother who Sits in
Darkness has been a good trade and has paid well, on the whole; and
there is money in it yet, if carefully worked--but not enough, in my
judgment, to make any considerable risk advisable. The People that Sit
in Darkness are getting to be too scarce--too scarce and too shy. And
such darkness as is now left is really of but an indifferent quality,
and not dark enough for the game. The most of those People that Sit in
Darkness have been furnished with more light than was good for them or
profitable for us. We have been injudicious.

The Blessings-of-Civilization Trust, wisely and cautiously administered,
is a Daisy. There is more money in it, more territory, more sovereignty,
and other kinds of emolument, than there is in any other game that is
played. But Christendom has been playing it badly of late years, and
must certainly suffer by it, in my opinion. She has been so eager to get
every stake that appeared on the green cloth, that the People who Sit in
Darkness have noticed it--they have noticed it, and have begun to show
alarm. They have become suspicious of the Blessings of Civilization.
More--they have begun to examine them. This is not well. The Blessings
of Civilization are all right, and a good commercial property; there
could not be a better, in a dim light. In the right kind of a light, and
at a proper distance, with the goods a little out of focus, they furnish
this desirable exhibit to the Gentlemen who Sit in Darkness:

 LOVE,                               LAW AND ORDER,
 JUSTICE,                            LIBERTY,
 GENTLENESS,                         EQUALITY,
 CHRISTIANITY,                       HONORABLE DEALING,
 PROTECTION TO THE WEAK,             MERCY,
 TEMPERANCE,                         EDUCATION,
                              --and so on.

There. Is it good? Sir, it is pie. It will bring into camp any idiot
that sits in darkness anywhere. But not if we adulterate it. It is
proper to be emphatic upon that point. This brand is strictly for
Export--apparently. _Apparently._ Privately and confidentially, it is
nothing of the kind. Privately and confidentially, it is merely an
outside cover, gay and pretty and attractive, displaying the special
patterns of our Civilization which we reserve for Home Consumption,
while _inside_ the bale is the Actual Thing that the Customer Sitting in
Darkness buys with his blood and tears and land and liberty. That Actual
Thing is, indeed, Civilization, but it is only for Export. Is there a
difference between the two brands? In some of the details, yes.

We all know that the Business is being ruined. The reason is not far to
seek. It is because our Mr. McKinley, and Mr. Chamberlain, and the
Kaiser, and the Tsar and the French have been exporting the Actual Thing
_with the outside cover left off_. This is bad for the Game. It shows
that these new players of it are not sufficiently acquainted with it.

It is a distress to look on and note the mismoves, they are so strange
and so awkward. Mr. Chamberlain manufactures a war out of materials so
inadequate and so fanciful that they make the boxes grieve and the
gallery laugh, and he tries hard to persuade himself that it isn’t
purely a private raid for cash, but has a sort of dim, vague
respectability about it somewhere, if he could only find the spot; and
that, by and by, he can scour the flag clean again after he has finished
dragging it through the mud, and make it shine and flash in the vault of
heaven once more as it had shone and flashed there a thousand years in
the world’s respect until he laid his unfaithful hand upon it. It is bad
play--bad. For it exposes the Actual Thing to Them that Sit in Darkness,
and they say: “What! Christian against Christian? And only for money? Is
_this_ a case of magnanimity, forbearance, love, gentleness, mercy,
protection of the weak--this strange and overshowy onslaught of an
elephant upon a nest of field mice, on the pretext that the mice had
squeaked an insolence at him--conduct which “no self-respecting
government could allow to pass unavenged”? as Mr. Chamberlain said. Was
that a good pretext in a small case, when it had not been a good pretext
in a large one?--for only recently Russia had affronted the elephant
three times and survived alive and unsmitten. Is this Civilization and
Progress? Is it something better than we already possess? These
harryings and burnings and desert-makings in the Transvaal--is this an
improvement on our darkness? Is it, perhaps, possible that there are two
kinds of Civilization--one for home consumption and one for the heathen
market?”

Then They that Sit in Darkness are troubled, and shake their heads; and
they read this extract from a letter of a British private, recounting
his exploits in one of Methuen’s victories, some days before the affair
of Magersfontein, and they are troubled again:

  We tore up the hill and into the intrenchments, and the Boers saw we
  had them; so they dropped their guns and went down on their knees and
  put up their hands clasped, and begged for mercy. And we gave it
  them--_with the long spoon_.

The long spoon is the bayonet. See _Lloyd’s Weekly_, London, of those
days. The same number--and the same column--contained some quite
unconscious satire in the form of shocked and bitter upbraidings of the
Boers for their brutalities and inhumanities!

Next, to our heavy damage, the Kaiser went to playing the game without
first mastering it. He lost a couple of missionaries in a riot in
Shantung, and in his account he made an overcharge for them. China had
to pay a hundred thousand dollars apiece for them, in money; twelve
miles of territory, containing several millions of inhabitants and worth
twenty million dollars; and to build a monument, and also a Christian
church; whereas the people of China could have been depended upon to
remember the missionaries without the help of these expensive memorials.
This was all bad play. Bad, because it would not, and could not, and
will not now or ever, deceive the Person Sitting in Darkness. He knows
that it was an overcharge. He knows that a missionary is like any other
man: he is worth merely what you can supply his place for, and no more.
He is useful, but so is a doctor, so is a sheriff, so is an editor; but
a just Emperor does not charge war prices for such. A diligent,
intelligent, but obscure missionary, and a diligent, intelligent country
editor are worth much, and we know it; but they are not worth the earth.
We esteem such an editor, and we are sorry to see him go; but, when he
goes, we should consider twelve miles of territory, and a church, and a
fortune, overcompensation for his loss. I mean, if he was a Chinese
editor, and we had to settle for him. It is no proper figure for an
editor or a missionary; one can get shop-worn kings for less. It was bad
play on the Kaiser’s part. It got this property, true; but it _produced
the Chinese revolt_, the indignant uprising of China’s traduced
patriots, the Boxers. The results have been expensive to Germany, and to
the other Disseminators of Progress and the Blessings of Civilization.

The Kaiser’s claim was paid, yet it was bad play, for it could not fail
to have an evil effect upon Persons Sitting in Darkness in China. They
would muse upon the event, and be likely to say: “Civilization is
gracious and beautiful, for such is its reputation; but can we afford
it? There are rich Chinamen, perhaps they can afford it; but this tax is
not laid upon them, it is laid upon the peasants of Shantung; it is they
that must pay this mighty sum, and their wages are but four cents a day.
Is this a better civilization than ours, and holier and higher and
nobler? Is not this rapacity? Is not this extortion? Would Germany
charge America two hundred thousand dollars for two missionaries, and
shake the mailed fist in her face, and send warships, and send soldiers,
and say: ‘Seize twelve miles of territory, worth twenty millions of
dollars, as additional pay for the missionaries; and make those peasants
build a monument to the missionaries, and a costly Christian church to
remember them by?’ And later would Germany say to her soldiers: ‘March
through America and slay, _giving no quarter_; make the German face
there, as has been our Hun-face here, a terror for a thousand years;
march through the Great Republic and slay, slay, slay, carving a road
for our offended religion through its heart and bowels?’ Would Germany
do like this to America, to England, to France, to Russia? Or only to
China, the helpless--imitating the elephant’s assault upon the field
mice? Had we better invest in this Civilization--this Civilization which
called Napoleon a buccaneer for carrying off Venice’s bronze horses, but
which steals our ancient astronomical instruments from our walls, and
goes looting like common bandits--that is, all the alien soldiers except
America’s; and (Americans again excepted) storms frightened villages and
cables the result to glad journals at home every day: ‘Chinese losses,
450 killed; ours, _one officer and two men wounded_. Shall proceed
against neighboring village to-morrow, where a _massacre_ is reported.’
Can we afford Civilization?”

And next Russia must go and play the game injudiciously. She affronts
England once or twice--with the Person Sitting in Darkness observing and
noting; by moral assistance of France and Germany, she robs Japan of her
hard-earned spoil, all swimming in Chinese blood--Port Arthur--with the
Person again observing and noting; then she seizes Manchuria, raids its
villages, and chokes its great river with the swollen corpses of
countless massacred peasants--that astonished Person still observing and
noting. And perhaps he is saying to himself: “It is yet _another_
Civilized Power, with its banner of the Prince of Peace in one hand and
its loot basket and its butcher knife in the other. Is there no
salvation for us but to adopt Civilization and lift ourselves down to
its level?”

And by and by comes America, and our Master of the Game plays it
badly--plays it as Mr. Chamberlain was playing it in South Africa. It
was a mistake to do that; also, it was one which was quite unlooked for
in a Master who was playing it so well in Cuba. In Cuba, he was playing
the usual and regular _American_ game, and it was winning, for there is
no way to beat it. The Master, contemplating Cuba, said: “Here is an
oppressed and friendless little nation which is willing to fight to be
free; we go partners, and put up the strength of seventy million
sympathizers and the resources of the United States: play!” Nothing but
Europe combined could call that hand: and Europe cannot combine on
anything. There, in Cuba, he was following our great traditions in a way
which made us very proud of him, and proud of the deep dissatisfaction
which his play was provoking in continental Europe. Moved by a high
inspiration, he threw out those stirring words which proclaimed that
forcible annexation would be “criminal aggression”; and in that
utterance fired another “shot heard round the world.” The memory of that
fine saying will be outlived by the remembrance of no act of his but
one--that he forgot it within the twelvemonth, and its honorable gospel
along with it.

For, presently, came the Philippine temptation. It was strong; it was
too strong, and he made that bad mistake: he played the European game,
the Chamberlain game. It was a pity; it was a great pity, that error;
that one grievous error, that irrevocable error. For it was the very
place and time to play the American game again. And at no cost. Rich
winnings to be gathered in, too; rich and permanent; indestructible; a
fortune transmissible forever to the children of the flag. Not land, not
money, not dominion--no, something worth many times more than that
dross: our share, the spectacle of a nation of long harassed and
persecuted slaves set free through our influence; our posterity’s share,
the golden memory of that fair deed. The game was in our hands. If it
had been played according to the American rules, Dewey would have sailed
away from Manila as soon as he had destroyed the Spanish fleet--after
putting up a sign on shore guaranteeing foreign property and life
against damage by the Filipinos, and warning the Powers that
interference with the emancipated patriots would be regarded as an act
unfriendly to the United States. The Powers cannot combine, in even a
bad cause, and the sign would not have been molested.

Dewey could have gone about his affairs elsewhere, and left the
competent Filipino army to starve out the little Spanish garrison and
send it home, and the Filipino citizens to set up the form of government
they might prefer, and deal with the friars and their doubtful
acquisitions according to Filipino ideas of fairness and justice--ideas
which have since been tested and found to be of as high an order as any
that prevail in Europe or America.

But we played the Chamberlain game, and lost the chance to add another
Cuba and another honorable deed to our good record.

The more we examine the mistake, the more clearly we perceive that it is
going to be bad for the Business. The Person Sitting in Darkness is
almost sure to say: “There is something curious about this--curious and
unaccountable. There must be two Americas: one that sets the captive
free, and one that takes a once-captive’s new freedom away from him, and
picks a quarrel with him with nothing to found it on; then kills him to
get his land.”

The truth is, the Person Sitting in Darkness _is_ saying things like
that; and for the sake of the Business we must persuade him to look at
the Philippine matter in another and healthier way. We must arrange his
opinions for him. I believe it can be done; for Mr. Chamberlain has
arranged England’s opinion of the South African matter, and done it most
cleverly and successfully. He presented the facts--some of the
facts--and showed those confiding people what the facts meant. He did it
statistically, which is a good way. He used the formula: “Twice 2 are
14, and 2 from 9 leaves 35.” Figures are effective; figures will
convince the elect.

Now, my plan is a still bolder one than Mr. Chamberlain’s, though
apparently a copy of it. Let us be franker than Mr. Chamberlain; let us
audaciously present the whole of the facts, shirking none, then explain
them according to Mr. Chamberlain’s formula. This daring truthfulness
will astonish and dazzle the Person Sitting in Darkness, and he will
take the Explanation down before his mental vision has had time to get
back into focus. Let us say to him:

“Our case is simple. On the 1st of May, Dewey destroyed the Spanish
fleet. This left the Archipelago in the hands of its proper and rightful
owners, the Filipino nation. Their army numbered 30,000 men, and they
were competent to whip out or starve out the little Spanish garrison;
then the people could set up a government of their own devising. Our
traditions required that Dewey should now set up his warning sign, and
go away. But the Master of the Game happened to think of another
plan--the European plan. He acted upon it. This was, to send out an
army--ostensibly to help the native patriots put the finishing touch
upon their long and plucky struggle for independence, but really to take
their land away from them and keep it. That is, in the interest of
Progress and Civilization. The plan developed, stage by stage, and quite
satisfactorily. We entered into a military alliance with the trusting
Filipinos, and they hemmed in Manila on the land side, and by their
valuable help the place, with its garrison of 8,000 or 10,000 Spaniards,
was captured--a thing which we could not have accomplished unaided at
that time. We got their help by--by ingenuity. We knew they were
fighting for their independence, and that they had been at it for two
years. We knew they supposed that we also were fighting in their worthy
cause--just as we had helped the Cubans fight for Cuban
independence--and we allowed them to go on thinking so. _Until Manila
was ours and we could get along without them._ Then we showed our hand.
Of course, they were surprised--that was natural; surprised and
disappointed; disappointed and grieved. To them it looked un-American;
uncharacteristic; foreign to our established traditions. And this was
natural, too; for we were only playing the American Game in public--in
private it was the European. It was neatly done, very neatly, and it
bewildered them. They could not understand it; for we had been so
friendly--so affectionate, even--with those simple-minded patriots! We,
our own selves, had brought back out of exile their leader, their hero,
their hope, their Washington--Aguinaldo; brought him in a warship, in
high honor, under the sacred shelter and hospitality of the flag;
brought him back and restored him to his people, and got their moving
and eloquent gratitude for it. Yes, we had been so friendly to them, and
had heartened them up in so many ways! We had lent them guns and
ammunition; advised with them; exchanged pleasant courtesies with them;
placed our sick and wounded in their kindly care; intrusted our Spanish
prisoners to their humane and honest hands; fought shoulder to shoulder
with them against “the common enemy” (our own phrase); praised their
courage, praised their gallantry, praised their mercifulness, praised
their fine and honorable conduct; borrowed their trenches, borrowed
strong positions which they had previously captured from the Spaniards;
petted them, lied to them--officially proclaiming that our land and
naval forces came to give them their freedom and displace the bad
Spanish Government--fooled them, used them until we needed them no
longer; then derided the sucked orange and threw it away. We kept the
positions which we had beguiled them of; by and by, we moved a force
forward and overlapped patriot ground--a clever thought, for we needed
trouble, and this would produce it. A Filipino soldier, crossing the
ground, where no one had a right to forbid him, was shot by our sentry.
The badgered patriots resented this with arms, without waiting to know
whether Aguinaldo, who was absent, would approve or not. Aguinaldo did
not approve; but that availed nothing. What we wanted, in the interest
of Progress and Civilization, was the Archipelago, unencumbered by
patriots struggling for independence; and War was what we needed. We
clinched our opportunity. It is Mr. Chamberlain’s case over again--at
least in its motive and intention; and we played the game as adroitly as
he played it himself.”

At this point in our frank statement of fact to the Person Sitting in
Darkness, we should throw in a little trade taffy about the Blessings of
Civilization--for a change, and for the refreshment of his spirit--then
go on with our tale:

“We and the patriots having captured Manila, Spain’s ownership
of the Archipelago and her sovereignty over it were at an
end--obliterated--annihilated--not a rag or shred of either remaining
behind. It was then that we conceived the divinely humorous idea of
_buying_ both of these specters from Spain! [It is quite safe to confess
this to the Person Sitting in Darkness, since neither he nor any other
sane person will believe it.] In buying those ghosts for twenty
millions, we also contracted to take care of the friars and their
accumulations. I think we also agreed to propagate leprosy and smallpox,
but as to this there is doubt. But it is not important; persons
afflicted with the friars do not mind other diseases.

“With our Treaty ratified, Manila subdued, and our Ghosts secured, we
had no further use for Aguinaldo and the owners of the Archipelago. We
forced a war, and we have been hunting America’s guest and ally through
the woods and swamps ever since.”

At this point in the tale, it will be well to boast a little of our war
work and our heroisms in the field, so as to make our performance look
as fine as England’s in South Africa; but I believe it will not be best
to emphasize this too much. We must be cautious. Of course, we must read
the war telegrams to the Person, in order to keep up our frankness; but
we can throw an air of humorousness over them, and that will modify
their grim eloquence a little, and their rather indiscret exhibitions of
gory exultation. Before reading to him the following display heads of
the dispatches of November 18, 1900, it will be well to practice on them
in private first, so as to get the right tang of lightness and gayety
into them:

                         “ADMINISTRATION WEARY OF
                         PROTRACTED HOSTILITIES!”

                       “REAL WAR AHEAD FOR FILIPINO
                               REBELS!”[10]


                          “WILL SHOW NO MERCY!”
                       “KITCHENER’S PLAN ADOPTED!”

Kitchener knows how to handle disagreeable people who are fighting for
their homes and their liberties, and we must let on that we are merely
imitating Kitchener, and have no national interest in the matter,
further than to get ourselves admired by the Great Family of Nations, in
which august company our Master of the Game has bought a place for us in
the back row.

Of course, we must not venture to ignore our General MacArthur’s
reports--oh, why do they keep on printing those embarrassing things?--we
must drop them trippingly from the tongue and take the chances:

  During the last ten months our losses have been 268 killed and 750
  wounded; Filipino loss, _three thousand two hundred and twenty-seven
  killed_, and 694 wounded.

We must stand ready to grab the Person Sitting in Darkness, for he will
swoon away at this confession, saying: “Good God! those ‘niggers’ spare
their wounded, and the Americans massacre theirs!”

We must bring him to, and coax him and coddle him, and assure him that
the ways of Providence are best, and that it would not become us to find
fault with them; and then, to show him that we are only imitators, not
originators, we must read the following passage from the letter of an
American soldier lad in the Philippines to his mother, published in
_Public Opinion_, of Decorah, Iowa, describing the finish of a
victorious battle:

“WE NEVER LEFT ONE ALIVE. IF ONE WAS WOUNDED, WE WOULD RUN OUR BAYONETS
THROUGH HIM.”

Having now laid all the historical facts before the Person Sitting in
Darkness, we should bring him to again, and explain them to him. We
should say to him:

“They look doubtful, but in reality they are not. There have been lies;
yes, but they were told in a good cause. We have been treacherous; but
that was only in order that real good might come out of apparent evil.
True, we have crushed a deceived and confiding people; we have turned
against the weak and the friendless who trusted us; we have stamped out
a just and intelligent and well-ordered republic; we have stabbed an
ally in the back and slapped the face of a guest; we have bought a
Shadow from an enemy that hadn’t it to sell; we have robbed a trusting
friend of his land and his liberty; we have invited our clean young men
to shoulder a discredited musket and do bandits’ work under a flag which
bandits have been accustomed to fear, not to follow; we have debauched
America’s honor and blackened her face before the world; but each detail
was for the best. We know this. The Head of every State and Sovereignty
in Christendom and 90 per cent of every legislative body in Christendom,
including our Congress and our fifty state legislatures, are members not
only of the church, but also of the Blessings-of-Civilization Trust.
This world-girdling accumulation of trained morals, high principles, and
justice cannot do an unright thing, an unfair thing, an ungenerous
thing, an unclean thing. It knows what it is about. Give yourself no
uneasiness; it is all right.”

Now then, that will convince the Person. You will see. It will restore
the Business. Also, it will elect the Master of the Game to the vacant
place in the Trinity of our national gods; and there on their high
thrones the Three will sit, age after age, in the people’s sight, each
bearing the Emblem of his service: Washington, the Sword of the
Liberator; Lincoln, the Slave’s Broken Chains; the Master, the Chains
Repaired.

It will give the Business a splendid new start. You will see.

Everything is prosperous, now; everything is just as we should wish it.
We have got the Archipelago, and we shall never give it up. Also, we
have every reason to hope that we shall have an opportunity before very
long to slip out of our congressional contract with Cuba and give her
something better in the place of it. It is a rich country, and many of
us are already beginning to see that the contract was a sentimental
mistake. But now--right now--is the best time to do some profitable
rehabilitating work--work that will set us up and make us comfortable,
and discourage gossip. We cannot conceal from ourselves that, privately,
we are a little troubled about our uniform. It is one of our prides; it
is acquainted with honor; it is familiar with great deeds and noble; we
love it, we revere it; and so this errand it is on makes us uneasy. And
our flag--another pride of ours, our chiefest! We have worshiped it so;
and when we have seen it in far lands--glimpsing it unexpectedly in that
strange sky, waving its welcome and benediction to us--we have caught
our breaths, and uncovered our heads, and couldn’t speak, for a moment,
for the thought of what it was to us and the great ideals it stood for.
Indeed, we _must_ do something about these things; it is easily managed.
We can have a special one--our states do it: we can have just our usual
flag, with the white stripes painted black and the stars replaced by the
skull and crossbones.

And we do not need that Civil Commission out there. Having no powers, it
has to invent them, and that kind of work cannot be effectively done by
just anybody; an expert is required. Mr. Croker can be spared. We do not
want the United States represented there, but only the Game.

By help of these suggested amendments, Progress and Civilization in that
country can have a boom, and it will take in the Persons who are Sitting
in Darkness, and we can resume Business at the old stand.

  distinctly.




                        TO MY MISSIONARY CRITICS
                    (_North American Review_, 1901)


I have received many newspaper cuttings; also letters from several
clergymen; also a note from the Rev. Dr. Judson Smith, Corresponding
Secretary of the American Board of Foreign Missions--all of a like
tenor; all saying, substantially, what is said in the cutting here
copied:

                    AN APOLOGY DUE FROM MR. CLEMENS

  The evidence of the past day or two should induce Mark Twain to make
  for the amen corner and formulate a prompt apology for his scathing
  attack on the Rev. Dr. Ament, the veteran Chinese missionary. The
  assault was based on a Peking dispatch to the New York _Sun_, which
  said that Dr. Ament had collected from the Chinese in various places
  damages thirteen times in excess of actual losses. So Mark Twain
  charged Mr. Ament with bullyragging, extortion, and things. A Peking
  dispatch to the _Sun_ yesterday, however, explains that the amount
  collected was not thirteen times the damage sustained, but _one-third
  in excess of the indemnities_, and that the blunder was due to a cable
  error in transmission. The 1-3d got converted into 13. Yesterday the
  Rev. Judson Smith, Secretary of the American Board, received a
  dispatch from Dr. Ament, calling attention to the cable blunder, and
  declaring that all the collections which he made were _approved by the
  Chinese officials_. The fractional amount that was collected in excess
  of actual losses, he explains, is being _used for the support of
  widows and orphans_.

  So collapses completely--and convulsively--Mark Twain’s sensational
  and ugly bombardment of a missionary whose character and services
  should have exempted him from such an assault.

  From the charge the underpinning has been knocked out. To Dr. Ament
  Mr. Clemens has done an injustice which is gross but unintentional. If
  Mark Twain is the man we take him to be he won’t be long in filing a
  retraction, plus an apology.

I have no prejudice against apologies. I trust I shall never withhold
one when it is due; I trust I shall never even have a disposition to do
so. These letters and newspaper paragraphs are entitled to my best
attention; respect for their writers and for the humane feeling which
has prompted their utterances requires this of me. It may be barely
possible that, if these requests for an apology had reached me before
the 20th of February, I might have had a sort of qualified chance to
apologize; but on that day appeared the two little cablegrams referred
to in the newspaper cutting copied above--one from the Rev. Dr. Smith to
the Rev. Dr. Ament, the other from Dr. Ament to Dr. Smith--and my small
chance died then. In my opinion, these cablegrams ought to have been
suppressed, for it seems clear that they give Dr. Ament’s case entirely
away. Still, that is only an opinion, and may be a mistake. It will be
best to examine the case from the beginning, by the light of the
documents connected with it.

                               EXHIBIT A

This is a dispatch from Mr. Chamberlain,[11] chief of the _Sun’s_
correspondence staff in Peking. It appeared in the _Sun_ last Christmas
Eve, and in referring to it hereafter I will call it the “C. E.
dispatch” for short:

  The Rev. Mr. Ament, of the American Board of Foreign Missions, has
  returned from a trip which he made for the purpose of collecting
  indemnities for damages done by Boxers. Everywhere he went he
  compelled the Chinese to pay. He says that all his native Christians
  are now provided for. He had seven hundred of them under his charge,
  and three hundred were killed. He has collected 300 taels for each of
  these murders, and has compelled full payment for all the property
  belonging to Christians that was destroyed. He also assessed fines
  amounting to thirteen times[12] the amount of the indemnity. This
  money will be used for the propagation of the Gospel.

  Mr. Ament declares that the compensation he has collected is moderate
  when compared with the amount secured by the Catholics, who demand, in
  addition to money, head for head. They collect 500 taels for each
  murder of a Catholic. In the Wen-Chiu country 680 Catholics were
  killed, and for this the European Catholics here demand 750,000
  strings of cash and 680 heads.

  In the course of a conversation Mr. Ament referred to the attitude of
  the missionaries toward the Chinese. He said:

  “I deny emphatically that the missionaries are vindictive, that they
  generally looted, or that they have done anything since the siege that
  the circumstances did not demand. I criticize the Americans. The soft
  hand of the Americans is not as good as the mailed fist of the
  Germans. If you deal with the Chinese with a soft hand they will take
  advantage of it.”

In an article addressed “To the Person Sitting in Darkness,” published
in the _North American Review_ for February, I made some comments upon
this C. E. dispatch.

In an Open Letter to me, from the Rev. Dr. Smith, published in the
_Tribune_ of February 15th, doubt is cast upon the authenticity of the
dispatch.

Up to the 20th of February, this doubt was an important factor in the
case: Dr. Ament’s brief cablegram, published on that date, took the
importance all out of it.

In the Open Letter, Dr. Smith quotes this passage from a letter from Dr.
Ament, dated November 13th. The italics are mine:

  _This_ time I proposed to settle affairs _without the aid of soldiers
  or_ legations.

This cannot mean two things, but only one: that, previously, he _had_
collected by armed force.

Also, in the Open Letter, Dr. Smith quotes some praises of Dr. Ament and
the Rev. Mr. Tewksbury, furnished by the Rev. Dr. Sheffield, and says:

  Dr. Sheffield is not accustomed to speak thus of _thieves_, or
  _extortioners_, or _braggarts_.

What can he mean by those vigorous expressions? Can he mean that the
first two would be applicable to a missionary who should collect from B,
with the “aid of soldiers,” indemnities possibly due by A, and upon
occasion go out looting?

                               EXHIBIT B

Testimony of George Lynch (indorsed as entirely trustworthy by the
_Tribune_ and the _Herald_), war correspondent in the Cuban and South
African wars, and in the march upon Peking for the rescue of the
legations. The italics are mine:

  When the _soldiers_ were prohibited from looting, no such prohibitions
  seemed to operate with the _missionaries_. For instance, the _Rev. Mr.
  Tewksbury held a great sale of looted goods, which lasted several
  days_.

  A day or two after the relief, when looking for a place to sleep in, I
  met the Rev. Mr. Ament, of the American Board of Foreign Missions. _He
  told me_ he was going to take possession of the house of a wealthy
  Chinaman who was an old enemy of his, as he had interfered much in the
  past with his missionary labors in Peking. A couple of days afterwards
  _he did so_, and held a _great sale of his enemy’s effects_. I bought
  a sable cloak at it for $125, and a couple of statues of Buddha. As
  the stock became depleted _it was replenished by the efforts of his
  converts, who were ransacking the houses in the neighborhood_.--New
  York _Herald_, February 18th.

It is Dr. Smith, not I, who has suggested that persons who act in this
way are “thieves and extortioners.”

Sir Robert Hart, in the _Fortnightly Review_ for January, 1901. This
witness has been for many years the most prominent and important
Englishman in China, and bears an irreproachable reputation for
moderation, fairness, and truth-speaking. In closing a description of
the revolting scenes which followed the occupation of Peking, when the
Christian armies (with the proud exception of the American soldiery, let
us be thankful for that) gave themselves up to a ruthless orgy of
robbery and spoliation, he says (the italics are mine):

  And even some _missionaries_ took such a _leading_ part in “spoiling
  the Egyptians” for the greater glory of God that a bystander was heard
  to say: “_For a century to come Chinese converts will consider looting
  and vengeance Christian virtues._”

It is Dr. Smith, not I, who has suggested that persons who act in this
way are “thieves and extortioners.” According to Mr. Lynch and Mr.
Martin (another war correspondent), Dr. Ament helped to spoil several of
those Egyptians. Mr. Martin took a photograph of the scene. It was
reproduced in the _Herald_. I have it.

In a brief reply to Dr. Smith’s Open Letter to me, I said this in the
_Tribune_. I am italicizing several words--for a purpose:

  Whenever he (Dr. Smith) can produce from the Rev. Mr. Ament an
  assertion that the _Sun’s_ character-blasting dispatch was not
  authorized _by him_, and whenever Dr. Smith can buttress Mr. Ament’s
  disclaimer with a confession from _Mr. Chamberlain_, the head of the
  Laffan News Service in China, that that dispatch was a false invention
  _and unauthorized_, the case against Mr. Ament will fall at once to
  the ground.

                               EXHIBIT E

Brief cablegrams, referred to above, which passed between Dr. Smith and
Dr. Ament, and were published on February 20th:

  Ament, Peking: Reported December 24 your collecting thirteen times
  actual losses; using for propagating the Gospel. Are these statements
  true? Cable specific answer.

                                                              SMITH.

  Statement untrue. Collected 1-3 for church expenses, additional actual
  damages; now supporting widows and orphans. Publication thirteen times
  blunder cable. All collections received approval Chinese officials,
  who are urging further settlements same line.

                                                              AMENT.

Only two questions are asked; “specific” answers required; no perilous
wanderings among the other details of the unhappy dispatch desired.

                               EXHIBIT F

Letter from Dr. Smith to me, dated March 8th. The italics are mine; they
tag inaccuracies of statement:

  Permit me to call your attention to the marked paragraphs in the
  inclosed papers, and to ask you to note their relation to the two
  conditions named in your letter to the New York _Tribune_ of February
  15th.

  The first is _Dr. Ament’s denial of the truth of the dispatch in the
  New York “Sun,”_ of December 24th, on which your criticisms of him in
  the _North American Review_ of February were founded. The second is a
  correction by the _“Sun’s”_ _special correspondent_ in Peking of the
  dispatch printed in the _Sun_ of December 24th.

  Since, as you state in your letter to the _Tribune_, “the case against
  Mr. Ament would fall to the ground” _if Mr. Ament denied the truth_ of
  the _Sun’s_ first dispatch, and _if the ‘Sun’s’ news agency_ in Peking
  also _declared that dispatch false_, and these two conditions _have
  thus been fulfilled_, I am sure that upon having these _facts_ brought
  to your attention you will gladly withdraw the criticisms that were
  _founded on a “cable blunder.”_

I think Dr. Smith ought to read me more carefully; then he would not
make so many mistakes. Within the narrow space of two paragraphs,
totaling eleven lines, he has scored nine departures from fact out of a
possible 9½. Now, is that parliamentary? I do not treat him like that.
Whenever I quote him, I am particular not to do him the least wrong, or
make him say anything he did not say.

(1) Mr. Ament doesn’t “deny the truth of the C. E. dispatch”; he merely
changes one of its phrases, without materially changing the meaning, and
(immaterially) corrects a cable blunder (which correction I accept). He
was asked no question about the other four fifths of the C. E. dispatch.
(2) I said nothing about “special” correspondents; I named the right and
responsible man--Mr. Chamberlain. The “correction” referred to is a
repetition of the one I have just accepted, which (immaterially) changes
“thirteen times” to “one third” extra tax. (3) I did not say anything
about “the _Sun’s_ news agency”; I said “Chamberlain.” I have every
confidence in Mr. Chamberlain, but I am not personally acquainted with
the others. (4) Once more--Mr. Ament didn’t “deny the truth” of the C.
E. dispatch, but merely made unimportant emendations of a couple of its
many details. (5) I did not say “if Mr. Ament denied the truth” of the
C. E. dispatch: I said, if he would assert that the dispatch was not
“authorized” _by him_. For example, I did not suppose that the charge
that the Catholic missionaries wanted 680 Chinamen beheaded was true;
but I did want to know if Dr. Ament personally authorized that statement
and the others, as coming from his lips. Another detail: one of my
conditions was that Mr. Chamberlain must not stop with confessing that
the C. E. was a “false invention,” he must also confess that it was
“_unauthorized_.” Dr. Smith has left out that large detail. (6) The
_Sun’s_ news agency did not “declare the C. E. dispatch false,” but
confined itself to correcting one unimportant detail of its long
list--the change of “13 times” to “one third” extra. (7) The “two
conditions” have not “been fulfilled”--far from it. (8) Those details
labeled “facts” are only fancies. (9) Finally, my criticisms were by no
means confined to that detail of the C. E. dispatch which we now accept
as having been a “cable blunder.”

Setting to one side these nine departures from fact, I find that what is
left of the eleven lines is straight and true. I am not blaming Dr.
Smith for these discrepancies--it would not be right, it would not be
fair. I make the proper allowances. He has not been a journalist, as I
have been--a trade wherein a person is brought to book by the rest of
the press so often for divergencies that, by and by, he gets to be
almost morbidly afraid to indulge in them. It is so with me. I always
have the disposition to tell what is not so; I was born with it; we all
have it. But I try not to do it now, because I have found out that it is
unsafe. But with the Doctor of course it is different.

                               EXHIBIT G

I wanted to get at the whole of the facts as regards the C. E. dispatch,
and so I wrote to China for them, when I found that the Board was not
going to do it. But I am not allowed to wait. It seemed quite within the
possibilities that a full detail of the facts might furnish me a chance
to make an apology to Mr. Ament--a chance which, I give you my word, I
would have honestly used, and not abused. But it is no matter. If the
Board is not troubled about the bulk of that lurid dispatch, why should
I be? I answered the apology-urging letters of several clergymen with
the information that I had written to China for the details, and said I
thought it was the only sure way of getting into a position to do fair
and full justice to all concerned; but a couple of them replied that it
was not a matter that could wait. That is to say, groping your way out
of a jungle in the dark with guesses and conjectures is better than a
straight march out in the sunlight of fact. It seems a curious idea.

However, those two clergymen were in a large measure right--from their
point of view and the Board’s; which is, putting it in the form of a
couple of questions:

1. _Did Dr. Ament collect the assessed damages and thirteen times over?_
The answer is: He did _not_. He collected only a _third_ over.

2. _Did he apply the third to the “propagation of the Gospel?”_ The
answer is this correction: He applied it to “church expenses.” Part or
all of the outlay, it appears, goes to “supporting widows and orphans.”
It may be that church expenses and supporting widows and orphans are not
part of the machinery for propagating the Gospel. I supposed they were,
but it isn’t any matter; I prefer this phrasing; it is not so blunt as
the other.

In the opinion of the two clergymen and of the Board, these two points
are _the only important ones_ in the whole C. E. dispatch.

I accept that. Therefore let us throw out the rest of the dispatch as
being no longer a part of Dr. Ament’s case.

                               EXHIBIT H

  The two clergymen and the Board are quite content with Dr. Ament’s
  answers upon the two points.

Upon the first point of the two, my own viewpoint may be indicated by a
question:

_Did Dr. Ament collect from B (whether by compulsion or simple demand)
even so much as a penny in payment for murders or depredations, without
knowing, beyond question, that B, and not another, committed the murders
or the depredations?_

Or, in other words:

_Did Dr. Ament ever, by chance or through ignorance, make the innocent
pay the debts of the guilty?_

In the article entitled “To the Person Sitting in Darkness,” I put
forward that point in a paragraph taken from Macallum’s (imaginary)
“History”:

                               EXHIBIT I

  When a white Boxer kills a Pawnee and destroys his property the other
  Pawnees do not trouble to seek _him_ out; they kill any white person
  that comes along; also, they make some white village pay deceased’s
  heirs the full cash value of deceased, together with full cash value
  of the property destroyed; they also make the village pay, in
  addition, _thirteen times_[13] the value of that property into a fund
  for the dissemination of the Pawnee religion, which they regard as the
  best of all religions for the softening and humanizing of the heart of
  man. It is their idea that it is only fair and right _that the
  innocent should be made to suffer for the guilty_, and that it is
  better that 90 and 9 innocent should suffer than that one guilty
  person should escape.

We all know that Dr. Ament did not bring suspected persons into a duly
organized court and try them by just and fair Christian and civilized
methods, but proclaimed his “conditions,” and collected damages from the
innocent and the guilty alike, without any court proceedings at all.[14]
That he himself, and not the villagers, made the “conditions,” we learn
from his letter of November 13th, already quoted from--the one in which
he remarked that, upon _that_ occasion he brought no soldiers with him.
The italics are mine:

  After our _conditions_ were known many villagers came of their own
  accord and brought their money with them.

Not all, but “many.” The Board really believes that those hunted and
harried paupers out there were not only willing to strip themselves to
pay Boxer damages, whether they owed them or not, but were sentimentally
eager to do it. Mr. Ament says, in his letter: “The villagers were
extremely grateful because I brought no foreign soldiers, and were glad
to settle on the terms proposed.” Some of those people know more about
theology than they do about human nature. I do not remember encountering
even a Christian who was “glad” to pay money he did not owe; and as for
a Chinaman doing it, why, dear me, the thing is unthinkable. We have all
seen Chinamen, many Chinamen, but not that kind. It is a new kind: an
invention of the Board--and “soldiers.”

                       CONCERNING THE COLLECTIONS

What was the “one third extra”? Money due? No. Was it a theft, then?
Putting aside the “one third extra,” what was the _remainder_ of the
exacted indemnity, if collected from persons not _known_ to owe it, and
without Christian and civilized forms of procedure? Was _it_ theft, was
it robbery? In America it would be that; in Christian Europe it would be
that. I have great confidence in Dr. Smith’s judgment concerning this
detail, and he calls it “theft and extortion”--even in China; for he was
talking about the “thirteen times” at the time that he gave it that
strong name.[15] It is his idea that, when you make guilty and innocent
villagers pay the appraised damages, and then make them pay thirteen
times that, besides, the _thirteen_ stand for “theft and extortion.”

Then what does _one third_ extra stand for? Will he give that one third
a name? Is it Modified Theft and Extortion? Is that it? The girl who was
rebuked for having borne an illegitimate child excused herself by
saying, “But it is such a _little_ one.”

When the “thirteen-times-extra” was alleged, it stood for theft and
extortion, in Dr. Smith’s eyes, and he was shocked. But when Dr. Ament
showed that he had taken only a _third_ extra, instead of thirteenfold,
Dr. Smith was relieved, content, happy. I declare I cannot imagine why.
That editor--quoted at the head of this article--was happy about it,
too. I cannot think why. He thought I ought to “make for the amen corner
and formulate a prompt apology.” To whom, and for what? It is too deep
for me.

To Dr. Smith, the “thirteenfold extra” clearly stood for “theft and
extortion,” and he was right, distinctly right, indisputably right. He
manifestly thinks that when it got scaled away down to a mere “one
third,” a little thing like that was something other than “theft and
extortion.” Why? Only the Board knows! I will try to explain this
difficult problem, so that the Board can get an idea of it. If a pauper
owes me a dollar, and I catch him unprotected and make him pay me
fourteen dollars, thirteen of it is “theft and extortion”; if I make him
pay only a dollar and thirty-three and a third cents the thirty-three
and a third cents are “theft and extortion” just the same. I will put it
in another way, still simpler. If a man owes me one dog--any kind of a
dog, the breed is of no consequence--and I----But let it go; the Board
would never understand it. It _can’t_ understand these involved and
difficult things.

But _if_ the Board could understand, then I could furnish some more
instruction--which is this. The one third, obtained by “theft and
extortion,” is _tainted money_, and cannot be purified even by defraying
“church expenses” and “supporting widows and orphans” with it. It has to
be restored to the people it was taken from.

Also, there is another view of these things. By our Christian code of
morals and law, the _whole_ $1.33 1-3, if taken from a man not formally
_proven_ to have committed the damage the dollar represents, is “theft
and extortion.” It cannot be honestly used for any purpose at all. It
must be handed back to the man it was taken from.

Is there no way, then, to justify these thefts and extortions and make
them clean and fair and honorable? Yes, there is. It can be done; it has
been done; it continues to be done--by revising the Ten Commandments and
bringing them down to date: for use in pagan lands. For example:

  _Thou shalt not steal_--except when it is the custom of the country.

This way out is recognized and _approved_ by all the best authorities,
including the Board. I will cite witnesses.

_The newspaper cutting, above_: “Dr. Ament declares that all the
collections which he made were approved by the _Chinese_ officials.” The
editor is satisfied.

_Dr. Ament’s cable to Dr. Smith_: “All collections received approval
_Chinese_ officials.” Dr. Ament is satisfied.

_Letters from eight clergymen_--all to the same effect: Dr. Ament merely
did as the _Chinese_ do. So they are satisfied.

_Mr. Ward, of the “Independent.”_

_The Rev. Dr. Washington Gladden._

I have mislaid the letters of these gentlemen and cannot quote their
words, but they are of the satisfied.

_The Rev. Dr. Smith_, in his Open Letter, published in the _Tribune:_
“The whole procedure [Dr. Ament’s] is in accordance with a custom among
the _Chinese_, of holding a village responsible for wrongs suffered in
that village, and especially making the head man of the village
accountable for wrongs committed there.” Dr. Smith is satisfied. Which
means that the Board is satisfied.

The “head man”! Why, then, this poor rascal, innocent or guilty, must
pay the whole bill, if he cannot squeeze it out of his poor-devil
neighbors. But, indeed, he can be depended upon to try, even to the
skinning them of their last brass farthing, their last rag of clothing,
their last ounce of food. He can be depended upon to get the indemnity
out of them, though it cost stripes and blows, blood-tears, and flesh.

THE TALE OF THE KING AND HIS TREASURER

How strange and remote and romantic and Oriental and Arabian-Nighty it
all seems--and is. It brings back the old forgotten tales, and we hear
the King say to his Treasurer:

“Bring me 30,000 gold tomauns.”

“Allah preserve us, Sire! the treasury is empty.”

“Do you hear? Bring the money--in ten days. Else, send me your head in a
basket.”

“I hear and obey.”

The Treasurer summons the head men of a hundred villages, and says to
one:

“Bring me a hundred gold tomauns.” To another, “Bring me five hundred.”
To another, “Bring a thousand. In ten days. Your head is the forfeit.”

“Your slaves kiss your feet! Ah, high and mighty lord, be merciful to
our hard-pressed villagers; they are poor, they are naked, they starve;
oh, these impossible sums! even the half----”

“Go! Grind it out of them, crush it out of them, turn the blood of the
fathers, the tears of the mothers, the milk of the babes to money--or
take the consequences. Have you heard?”

“His will be done, Who is the Fount of love and mercy and compassion,
Who layeth this heavy burden upon us by the hand of His anointed
servants--blessed be His holy Name! The father shall bleed, the mother
shall faint for hunger, the babe shall perish at the dry breast. The
chosen of God have commanded: it shall be as they say.”

I am not meaning to object to the substitution of pagan customs for
Christian, here and there and now and then, when the Christian ones are
inconvenient. No; I like it and admire it. I do it myself. And I admire
the alertness of the Board in watching out for chances to trade Board
morals for Chinese morals, and get the best of the swap; for I cannot
endure those people, they are yellow, and I have never considered yellow
becoming. I have always been like the Board--perfectly well-meaning, but
destitute of the Moral Sense. Now, one of the main reasons why it is so
hard to make the Board understand that there is no moral difference
between a big filch and a little filch, but only a legal one, is that
vacancy in its make-up. Morally, there are no degrees in stealing. The
Commandment merely says, “Thou shalt not _steal_,” and stops there. It
doesn’t recognize any difference between stealing a third and stealing
thirteenfold. If I could think of a way to put it before the Board in
such a plain and--

THE WATERMELONS

I have it, now. Many years ago, when I was studying for the gallows, I
had a dear comrade, a youth who was not in my line, but still a
thoroughly good fellow, though devious. He was preparing to qualify for
a place on the Board, for there was going to be a vacancy by
superannuation in about five years. This was down South, in the slavery
days. It was the nature of the negro then, as now, to steal watermelons.
They stole three of the melons of an adoptive brother of mine, the only
good ones he had. I suspected three of a neighbor’s negroes, but there
was no proof: and, besides, the watermelons in those negroes’ private
patches were all green and small, and not up to indemnity standard. But
in the private patches of three other negroes there were a number of
competent melons. I consulted with my comrade, the understudy of the
Board. He said that if I would approve his arrangements, he would
arrange. I said, “Consider me the Board; I approve: arrange.” So he took
a gun, and went and collected three large melons for my
brother-on-the-half-shell, and one over. I was greatly pleased, and
asked:

“Who gets the extra one?”

“Widows and orphans.”

“A good idea, too. Why didn’t you take thirteen?”

“It would have been wrong; a crime, in fact--Theft and Extortion.”

“What is the one third extra--the odd melon--the same?”

It caused him to reflect. But there was no result.

The justice of the peace was a stern man. On the trial, he found fault
with the scheme, and required us to explain upon what we based our
strange conduct--as he called it. The understudy said:

“On the custom of the niggers. They all do it.”

The justice forgot his dignity, and descended to sarcasm:

“Custom of the niggers! Are our morals so inadequate that we have to
borrow of niggers?” Then he said to the jury: “Three melons were owing;
they were collected from persons not proven to owe them; this is theft.
They were collected by compulsion; this is extortion. A melon was
added--for the widows and orphans. It was owed by no one. It is another
theft, another extortion. Return it whence it came, with the others. It
is not permissible, here, to apply to any object goods dishonestly
obtained--not even to the feeding of widows and orphans, for that would
be to put a shame upon charity and dishonor it.”

He said it in open court, before everybody, and to me it did not seem
very kind.

A clergyman, in a letter to me, reminds me, with a touch of reproach,
that “many of the missionaries are good men, kind-hearted, earnest,
devoted to their work.” Certainly they are. No one is disputing it.
Instead of “many,” he could have said “almost all,” and still said the
truth, no doubt. I know many missionaries; I have met them all about the
globe, and have known only one or two who could not fill that bill and
answer to that description. “Almost all” comes near to being a
proportion and a description applicable also to lawyers, authors,
editors, merchants, manufacturers--in fact, to most guilds and
vocations. Without a doubt, Dr. Ament did what he believed to be right,
and I concede that when a man is doing what he believes to be right,
there is argument on his side. I differ with Dr. Ament, but that is only
because he got his training from the Board and I got mine outside.
Neither of us is responsible, altogether.

RECAPITULATION

But there is no need to sum up. Mr. Ament has acknowledged the “one
third extra”--no other witness is necessary. The Rev. Dr. Smith has
carefully considered the act and labeled it with a stern name, and his
verdict seems to have no flaw in it. The morals of the act are Chinese,
but are approved by the Board, and by some of the clergy and some of the
newspapers, as being a valuable improvement upon Christian ones--which
leaves me with a closed mouth, though with a pain in my heart.

IS THE AMERICAN BOARD ON TRIAL?

Do I think that Dr. Ament and certain of his fellow missionaries are as
bad as their conduct? No, I do not. They are the product of their
training; and now that I understand the whole case, and where they got
their ideals, and that they are merely subordinates and subject to
authority, I comprehend that they are rather accessories than
principals, and that their acts only show faulty heads curiously
trained, not bad hearts. Mainly, as it seems to me, it is the American
Board that is on trial. And again, it is a case of the head, not of the
heart. That it has a heart which has never harbored an evil intention,
no one will deny, no one will question; the Board’s history can silence
any challenge on that score. The Board’s heart is not in court: it is
its head that is on trial.

It is a sufficiently strange head. Its ways baffle comprehension; its
ideas are like no one else’s; its methods are novelties to the practical
world; its judgments are surprises. When one thinks it is going to speak
and must speak, it is silent; when one thinks it ought to be silent and
must be silent, it speaks. Put your finger where you think it ought to
be, it is not there; put it where you think it ought not to be, there
you find it.

When its servant in China seemed to be charging himself with amazing
things, in a reputable journal--in a dispatch which was copied into many
other papers--the Board was as silent about it as any dead man could
have been who was informed that his house was burning over his head. An
exchange of cablegrams could have enabled it, within two days, to prove
to the world--possibly--that the damaging dispatch had not proceeded
from the mouth of its servant; yet it sat silent and asked no questions
about the matter.

It was silent during thirty-eight days. Then the dispatch came into
prominence again. It chanced that I was the occasion of it. A break in
the stillness followed. In what form? An exchange of cablegrams,
resulting in proof that the damaging dispatch had not been authorized?
No, in the form of an Open Letter by the Corresponding Secretary of the
American Board, the Rev. Dr. Smith, in which it was _argued_ that Dr.
Ament could not have said and done the things set forth in the dispatch.

Surely, this was bad politics. A repudiating telegram would have been
worth more than a library of argument.

An extension of the silence would have been better than the Open Letter,
I think. I thought so at the time. It seemed to me that mistakes enough
had been made and harm enough done. I thought it questionable policy to
publish the Letter, for I “did not think it likely that Dr. Ament would
disown the dispatch,” and I telegraphed that to the Rev. Dr. Smith.
Personally, I had nothing against Dr. Ament, and that is my attitude
yet.

Once more it was a good time for an extension of the silence. But no;
the Board has its own ways, and one of them is to do the unwise thing,
when occasion offers. After having waited fifty-six days, it cabled to
Dr. Ament. No one can divine why it did so then, instead of fifty-six
days earlier.[16] It got a fatal reply--and was not aware of it. That
was that curious confession about the “one third extra”; its
application, not to the “propagation of the Gospel,” but only to “church
expenses,” support of widows and orphans; and, on top of this
confession, that other strange one revealing the dizzying fact that our
missionaries, who went to China to teach Christian morals and justice,
had adopted pagan morals and justice in their place. _That cablegram was
dynamite._

It seems odd that the Board did not see that that revelation made the
case far worse than it was before; for there was a saving doubt,
before--a doubt which was a Gibraltar for strength, and should have been
carefully left undisturbed. Why did the Board allow that revelation to
get into print? Why did the Board not suppress it and keep still? But
no; in the Board’s opinion, this was once more the time for speech.
Hence Dr. Smith’s latest letter to me, suggesting that I speak also--a
letter which is a good enough letter, barring its nine defects, but is
another evidence that the Board’s head is not as good as its heart.

A missionary is a man who is pretty nearly all heart, else he would not
be in a calling which requires of him such large sacrifices of one kind
and another. He is made up of faith, zeal, courage, sentiment, emotion,
enthusiasm; and so he is a mixture of poet, devotee, and knight errant.
He exiles himself from home and friends and the scenes and associations
that are dearest to him; patiently endures discomforts, privations,
discouragements; goes with good pluck into dangers which he knows may
cost him his life; and when he must suffer death, willingly makes that
supreme sacrifice for his cause.

Sometimes the headpiece of that kind of a man can be of an inferior
sort, and error of judgment can result--as we have seen. Then, for his
protection, as it seems to me, he ought to have at his back a Board able
to know a blunder when it sees one, and prompt to bring him back upon
his right course when he strays from it. That is to say, I think the
captain of a ship ought to understand navigation. Whether he does or
not, he will have to take a captain’s share of the blame, if the crew
bring the vessel to grief.

  In civilized countries, if a mob destroy property in a town, the

  himself and his friends, and fleecing persons he holds a spite
  against--as in the Orient--and the citizen who is too poor to be a
  taxpayer pays no part of the fine at all.

Footnote 15:

  In his Open Letter, Dr. Smith cites Dr. Ament’s letter of November
  13th, which contains an account of Dr. Ament’s collecting tour; then
  Dr. Smith makes this comment: “Nothing is said of securing ‘thirteen
  times’ the amount of the losses.” Farther down, Dr. Smith quotes
  praises of Dr. Ament and his work (from a letter of the Rev. Dr.
  Sheffield), and adds this comment: “Dr. Sheffield is not accustomed to
  speak thus in praise of thieves, or extortioners, or braggarts.” The
  reference is to the “thirteen-times” extra tax.

                          THOMAS BRACKETT REED


He wore no shell. His ways were frank and open, and the road to his
large sympathies was straight and unobstructed. His was a nature which
invited affection--compelled it, in fact--and met it halfway. Hence he
was “Tom” to the most of his friends, and to half of the nation. The
abbreviating of such a man’s name is a patent of nobility, and is
conferred from the heart. Mr. Reed had a very strong and decided
character, and he may have had enemies; I do not know; if he had
them--outside of politics--they did not know the man. He was
transparently honest and honorable, there were no furtivenesses about
him, and whoever came to know him trusted him and was not disappointed.
He was wise, he was shrewd and alert, he was a clear and capable
thinker, a logical reasoner, and a strong and convincing speaker. His
manner was easy and engaging, his speeches sparkled with felicities of
phrasing thrown off without apparent effort, and when he needed the
happy help of humor he had a mine of it as deep and rich as Kimberly to
draw from. His services to his country were great, and they were
gratefully acknowledged.

I cannot remember back to a time when he was not “Tom” Reed to me, nor
to a time when he would have been offended at being so addressed by me.
I cannot remember back to a time when I could let him alone in an
after-dinner speech if he was present, nor to a time when he did not
take my extravagances concerning him and misstatements about him in good
part, nor yet to a time when he did not pay them back with usury when
his turn came. The last speech he made was at my birthday dinner at the
end of November, when naturally I was his text; my last word to him was
in a letter the next day; a day later I was illustrating a fantastic
article on Art with his portrait among others--a portrait now to be laid
reverently away among the jests that begin in humor and end in pathos.
These things happened only eight days ago, and now he is gone from us,
and the nation is speaking of him as one who _was_. It seems incredible,
impossible. Such a man, such a friend, seems to us a permanent
possession; his vanishing from our midst is unthinkable; as unthinkable
as was the vanishing of the Campanile, that had stood for a thousand
years, and was turned to dust in a moment.

I have no wish, at this time, to enter upon light and humorous
reminiscences connected with yachting voyages with Mr. Reed in northern
and southern seas, nor with other recreations in his company in other
places--they do not belong in this paper, they do not invite me, they
would jar upon me. I have only wished to say how fine and beautiful was
his life and character, and to take him by the hand and say good-by, as
to a fortunate friend who has done well his work and goes a pleasant
journey.




                           THE FINISHED BOOK
                      (On Finishing _Joan of Arc_)


                                                        PARIS, 1895.

Do you know that shock? I mean, when you come, at your regular hour,
into the sick room where you have watched for months, and find the
medicine bottles all gone, the night table removed, the bed stripped,
the furniture set stiffly to rights, the windows up, the room cold,
stark, vacant--and you catch your breath. Do you know that shock?

The man who has written a long book has that experience the morning
after he has revised it for the last time, seen the bearers convey it
from the house, and sent it away to the printer. He steps into his study
at the hour established by the habit of months--and he gets that little
shock. All the litter and the confusion are gone. The piles of dusty
reference books are gone from the chairs, the maps from the floor; the
chaos of letters, manuscripts, notebooks, paper knives, pipes, matches,
photographs, tobacco jars, and cigar boxes is gone from the writing
table. The furniture is back where it use to be in the long ago. The
housemaid, forbidden the place for five months, has been there, and
tidied it up, and scoured it clean, and made it repellent and awful.

I stand here this morning, contemplating this desolation, and I realize
that if I would bring back the spirit that made this hospital homelike
and pleasant to me, I must restore the aids to lingering dissolution to
their wonted places, and nurse another patient through and send it forth
for the last rites, with many or few to assist there, as may happen; and
that I will do.




                         AS REGARDS PATRIOTISM
                              (About 1900)


It is agreed, in this country, that if a man can arrange his religion so
that it perfectly satisfies his conscience, it is not incumbent upon him
to care whether the arrangement is satisfactory to anyone else or not.

In Austria and some other countries this is not the case. There the
state arranges a man’s religion for him, he has no voice in it himself.

Patriotism is merely a religion--love of country, worship of country,
devotion to the country’s flag and honor and welfare.

In absolute monarchies it is furnished from the throne, cut and dried,
to the subject; in England and America it is furnished, cut and dried,
to the citizen by the politician and the newspaper.

The newspaper-and-politician-manufactured Patriot often gags in private
over his dose; but he takes it, and keeps it on his stomach the best he
can. Blessed are the meek.

Sometimes, in the beginning of an insane shabby political upheaval, he
is strongly moved to revolt, but he doesn’t do it--he knows better. He
knows that his maker would find it out--the maker of his Patriotism, the
windy and incoherent six-dollar subeditor of his village newspaper--and
would bray out in print and call him a Traitor. And how dreadful that
would be. It makes him tuck his tail between his legs and shiver. We all
know--the reader knows it quite well--that two or three years ago nine
tenths of the human tails in England and America performed just that
act. Which is to say, nine tenths of the Patriots in England and America
turned traitor to keep from being called traitor. Isn’t it true? You
know it to be true. Isn’t it curious?

Yet it was not a thing to be very seriously ashamed of. A man can
seldom--very, very seldom--fight a winning fight against his training;
the odds are too heavy. For many a year--perhaps always--the training of
the two nations had been dead against independence in political thought,
persistently inhospitable toward patriotism manufactured on a man’s own
premises, Patriotism reasoned out in the man’s own head and fire-assayed
and tested and proved in his own conscience. The resulting Patriotism
was a shop-worn product procured at second hand. The Patriot did not
know just how or when or where he got his opinions, neither did he care,
so long as he was with what seemed the majority--which was the main
thing, the safe thing, the comfortable thing. Does the reader believe he
knows three men who have actual reasons for their pattern of
Patriotism--and can furnish them? Let him not examine, unless he wants
to be disappointed. He will be likely to find that his men got their
Patriotism at the public trough, and had no hand in its preparation
themselves.

Training does wonderful things. It moved the people of this country to
oppose the Mexican War; then moved them to fall in with what they
supposed was the opinion of the majority--majority Patriotism is the
customary Patriotism--and go down there and fight. Before the Civil War
it made the North indifferent to slavery and friendly to the slave
interest; in that interest it made Massachusetts hostile to the American
flag, and she would not allow it to be hoisted on her State House--in
her eyes it was the flag of a faction. Then by and by, training swung
Massachusetts the other way, and she went raging South to fight under
that very flag and against that aforetime protected interest of hers.

There is nothing that training cannot do. Nothing is above its reach or
below it. It can turn bad morals to good, good morals to bad; it can
destroy principles, it can recreate them; it can debase angels to men
and lift men to angelship. And it can do any one of these miracles in a
year--even in six months.

Then men can be trained to manufacture their own Patriotism. They can be
trained to labor it out in their own heads and hearts and in the privacy
and independence of their own premises. It can train them to stop taking
it by command, as the Austrian takes his religion.




                    DR. LOEB’S INCREDIBLE DISCOVERY

  Experts in biology will be apt to receive with some skepticism the
  announcement of Dr. Jacques Loeb of the University of California as to
  the creation of life by chemical agencies.... Doctor Loeb is a very
  bright and ingenious experimenter, but _a consensus of opinion among
  biologists_ would show that he is voted rather as a man of lively
  imagination than an inerrant investigator of natural phenomena.--New
  York _Times_, March 2d.


I wish I could be as young as that again. Although I seem so old, now, I
was once as young as that. I remember, as if it were but thirty or forty
years ago, how a paralyzing Consensus of Opinion accumulated from
Experts a-setting around, about brother experts who had patiently and
laboriously cold-chiseled their way into one or another of nature’s
safe-deposit vaults and were reporting that they had found something
valuable was a plenty for me. It settled it.

But it isn’t so now--no. Because, in the drift of the years I by and by
found out that a Consensus examines a new thing with its feelings rather
oftener than with its mind. You know, yourself, that that is so. Do
those people examine with feelings that are friendly to evidence? You
know they don’t. It is the other way about. They do the examining by the
light of their prejudices--now isn’t that true?

With curious results, yes. So curious that you wonder the Consensuses do
not go out of the business. Do you know of a case where a Consensus won
a game? You can go back as far as you want to and you will find history
furnishing you this (until now) unwritten maxim for your guidance and
profit: Whatever new thing a Consensus coppers (colloquial for “bets
against”), bet your money on that very card and do not be afraid.

There was that primitive steam engine--ages back, in Greek times: a
Consensus made fun of it. There was the Marquis of Worcester’s steam
engine, 250 years ago: a Consensus made fun of it. There was Fulton’s
steamboat of a century ago: a French Consensus, including the Great
Napoleon, made fun of it. There was Priestly, with his oxygen: a
Consensus scoffed at him, mobbed him, burned him out, banished him.
While a Consensus was proving, by statistics and things, that a
steamship could not cross the Atlantic, a steamship did it. A Consensus
consisting of all the medical experts in Great Britain made fun of
Jenner and inoculation. A Consensus consisting of all the medical
experts in France made fun of the stethoscope. A Consensus of all the
medical experts in Germany made fun of that young doctor (his name?
forgotten by all but doctors, now, revered now by doctors alone) who
discovered and abolished the cause of that awful disease, puerperal
fever; made fun of him, reviled him, hunted him, persecuted him, broke
his heart, killed him. Electric telegraph, Atlantic cable, telephone,
all “toys,” and of no practical value--verdict of the Consensuses.
Geology, palæontology, evolution--all brushed into space by a Consensus
of theological experts, comprising all the preachers in Christendom,
assisted by the Duke of Argyle and (at first) the other scientists. And
do look at Pasteur and his majestic honor roll of prodigious
benefactions! Damned--each and every one of them in its turn--by
frenzied and ferocious Consensuses of medical and chemical Experts
comprising, for years, every member of the tribe in Europe; damned
without even a casual _look_ at what he was doing--and he pathetically
imploring them to come and take at least one little look before making
the damnation eternal. They shortened his life by their malignities and
persecutions; and thus robbed the world of the further and priceless
services of a man who--along certain lines and within certain
limits--had done more for the human race than any other one man in all
its long history: a man whom it had taken the Expert brotherhood ten
thousand years to produce, and whose mate and match the brotherhood may
possibly not be able to bring forth and assassinate in another ten
thousand. The preacher has an old and tough reputation for bull-headed
and unreasoning hostility to new light; why, he is not “in it” with the
doctor! Nor, perhaps, with some of the other breeds of Experts that sit
around and get up the Consensuses and squelch the new things as fast as
they come from the hands of the plodders, the searchers, the inspired
dreamers, the Pasteurs that come bearing pearls to scatter in the
Consensus sty.

This is warm work! It puts my temperature up to 106 and raises my pulse
to the limit. It always works just so when the red rag of a Consensus
jumps my fence and starts across my pasture. I have been a Consensus
more than once myself, and I know the business--and its vicissitudes. I
am a compositor-expert, of old and seasoned experience; nineteen years
ago I delivered the final-and-for-good verdict that the linotype would
never be able to earn its own living nor anyone else’s: it takes
fourteen acres of ground, now, to accommodate its factories in England.
Thirty-five years ago I was an expert precious-metal quartz-miner. There
was an outcrop in my neighborhood that assayed $600 a ton--gold. But
every fleck of gold in it was shut up tight and fast in an intractable
and impersuadable base-metal shell. Acting as a Consensus, I delivered
the finality verdict that no human ingenuity would ever be able to set
free two dollars’ worth of gold out of a ton of that rock. The fact is,
I did not foresee the cyanide process. Indeed, I have been a Consensus
ever so many times since I reached maturity and approached the age of
discretion, but I call to mind no instance in which I won out.

These sorrows have made me suspicious of Consensuses. Do you know, I
tremble and the goose flesh rises on my skin every time I encounter one,
now. I sheer warily off and get behind something, saying to myself, “It
looks innocent and all right, but no matter, ten to one there’s a
cyanide process under that thing somewhere.”

Now as concerns this “creation of life by chemical agencies.” Reader,
take my advice: don’t you copper it. I don’t say bet on it; no, I only
say, don’t you copper it. As you see, there is a Consensus out against
it. If you find that you can’t control your passions; if you feel that
you have _got_ to copper something and can’t help it, copper the
Consensus. It is the safest way--all history confirms it. If you are
young, you will, of course, have to put up, on one side or the other,
for you will not be able to restrain yourself; but as for me, I am old,
and I am going to wait for a new deal.

_P.S._--In the same number of the _Times_ Doctor Funk says: “Man may be
as badly fooled by believing too little as by believing too much; the
hard-headed skeptic Thomas was the only disciple who was cheated.” Is
that the right and rational way to look at it? I will not be sure, for
my memory is faulty, but it has always been my impression that Thomas
was the only one who made an examination and proved a fact, while the
others were accepting, or discounting, the fact on trust--like any other
Consensus. If that is so, Doubting Thomas removed a doubt which must
otherwise have confused and troubled the world until now. Including
Doctor Funk. It seems to me that we owe that hard-headed--or
sound-headed--witness something more than a slur. Why does Doctor Funk
_examine_ into spiritism, and then throw stones at Thomas. Why doesn’t
he take it on trust? Has inconsistency become a jewel in Lafayette
Place?

                                      OLD-MAN-AFRAID-OF-THE-CONSENSUS.

_Extract from Adam’s Diary._--Then there was a Consensus about it. It
was the very first one. It sat six days and nights. It was then
delivered of the verdict that a world could not be made out of nothing;
that such small things as sun and moon and stars might, maybe, but it
would take years and years, if there was considerable many of them. Then
the Consensus got up and looked out of the window, and there was the
whole outfit spinning and sparkling in space! You never saw such a
disappointed lot.

                     THE DERVISH AND THE OFFENSIVE
                                STRANGER


_The Dervish_: I will say again, and yet again, and still again,
that a good deed----

_The Offensive Stranger_: Peace, and, O man of narrow vision! There
is no such thing as a good _deed_----

_The Dervish_: O shameless blasphe----

_The Offensive Stranger_: And no such thing as an evil deed. There
are good _impulses_, there are evil impulses, and that is all. Half
of the results of a good intention are evil; half the results of an
evil intention are good. No man can command the results, nor allot
them.

_The Dervish_: And so----

_The Offensive Stranger_: And so you shall praise men for their good
intentions, and not blame them for the evils resulting; you shall
blame men for their evil intentions, and not praise them for the
good resulting.

_The Dervish_: O maniac! will you say----

_The Offensive Stranger_: Listen to the law: From _every_ impulse,
whether good or evil, flow two streams; the one carries health, the
other carries poison. From the beginning of time this law has not
changed, to the end of time it will not change.

_The Dervish_: If I should strike thee dead in anger----

_The Offensive Stranger_: Or kill me with a drug which you hoped
would give me new life and strength----

_The Dervish_: Very well. Go on.

_The Offensive Stranger_: In either case the results would be the
same. Age-long misery of mind for you--an evil result; peace,
repose, the end of sorrow for me--a good result. Three hearts that
hold me dear would break; three pauper cousins of the third removed
would get my riches and rejoice; you would go to prison and your
friends would grieve, but your humble apprentice-priest would step
into your shoes and your fat sleek life and be happy. And are these
all the goods and all the evils that would flow from the
well-intended or ill-intended act that cut short my life, O
thoughtless one, O purblind creature? The good and evil results that
flow from _any_ act, even the smallest, breed on and on, century
after century, forever and ever and ever, creeping by inches around
the globe, affecting all its coming and going populations until the
end of time, until the final cataclysm!

_The Dervish_: Then, there being no such thing as a good deed----

_The Offensive Stranger_: Don’t I tell you there are good
_intentions_, and evil ones, and there an end? The _results_ are not
foreseeable. They are of both kinds, in all cases. It is the law.
Listen: this is far-Western history:

                           VOICES OUT OF UTAH


                                 I

_The White Chief_ (_to his people_): This wide plain was a desert.
By our Heaven-blest industry we have damned the river and utilized
its waters and turned the desert into smiling fields whose fruitage
makes prosperous and happy a thousand homes where poverty and hunger
dwelt before. How noble, how beneficent, is Civilization!

                                 II

_Indian Chief_ (_to his people_): This wide plain, which the Spanish
priests taught our fathers to irrigate, was a smiling field, whose
fruitage made our homes prosperous and happy. The white American has
damned our river, taken away our water for his own valley, and
turned our field into a desert; wherefore we starve.

_The Dervish_: I perceive that the good intention did really bring
both good and evil results in equal measure. But a single case
cannot prove the rule. Try again.

_The Offensive Stranger_: Pardon me, _all_ cases prove it. Columbus
discovered a new world and gave to the plodding poor and the
landless of Europe farms and breathing space and plenty and
happiness----

_The Dervish_: A good result.

_The Offensive Stranger_: And they hunted and harried the original
owners of the soil, and robbed them, beggared them, drove them from
their homes, and exterminated them, root and branch.

_The Dervish_: An evil result, yes.

_The Offensive Stranger_: The French Revolution brought desolation
to the hearts and homes of five million families and drenched the
country with blood and turned its wealth to poverty.

_The Dervish_: An evil result.

_The Offensive Stranger_: But every great and precious liberty
enjoyed by the nations of continental Europe to-day are the gift of
that Revolution.

_The Dervish_: A good result, I concede it.

_The Offensive Stranger_: In our well-meant effort to lift up the
Filipino to our own moral altitude with a musket, we have slipped on
the ice and fallen down to his.

_The Dervish_: A large evil result.

_The Offensive Stranger_: But as an offset we are a World Power.

_The Dervish_: Give me time. I must think this one over. Pass on.

_The Offensive Stranger_: By help of three hundred thousand soldiers
and eight hundred million dollars England has succeeded in her good
purpose of lifting up the unwilling Boers and making them better and
purer and happier than they could ever have become by their own
devices.

_The Dervish_: Certainly that is a good result.

_The Offensive Stranger_: But there are only eleven Boers left now.

_The Dervish_: It has the appearance of an evil result. But I will
think it over before I decide.

_The Offensive Stranger_: Take yet one more instance. With the best
intentions the missionary has been laboring in China for eighty
years.

_The Dervish_: The evil result is----

_The Offensive Stranger_: That nearly a hundred thousand Chinamen
have acquired our Civilization.

_The Dervish_: And the good result is----

_The Offensive Stranger_: That by the compassion of God four hundred
millions have escaped it.




                          INSTRUCTIONS IN ART
                   (With Illustrations by the Author)


The great trouble about painting a whole gallery of portraits at the
same time is, that the housemaid comes and dusts, and does not put
them back the way they were before, and so when the public flock to
the studio and wish to know which is Howells and which is Depew and
so on, you have to dissemble, and it is very embarrassing at first.
Still, you know they are there, and this knowledge presently gives
you more or less confidence, and you say sternly, “_This_ is
Howells,” and watch the visitor’s eye. If you see doubt there, you
correct yourself and try another. In time you find one that will
satisfy, and then you feel relief and joy, but you have suffered
much in the meantime; and you know that this joy is only temporary,
for the next inquirer will settle on another Howells of a quite
different aspect, and one which you suspect is Edward VII or
Cromwell, though you keep that to yourself, of course. It is much
better to label a portrait when you first paint it, then there is no
uncertainty in your mind and you can get bets out of the visitor and
win them.

I believe I have had the most trouble with a portrait which I
painted in installments--the head on one canvas and the bust on
another.

[Illustration: THE HEAD ON ONE CANVAS]

The housemaid stood the bust up sideways, and now I don’t know which
way it goes. Some authorities think it belongs with the breastpin at
the top, under the man’s chin; others think it belongs the reverse
way, on account of the collar, one of these saying, “A person can
wear a breastpin on his stomach if he wants to, but he can’t wear
his collar anywhere he dern pleases.” There is a certain amount of
sense in that view of it. Still, there is no way to determine the
matter for certain; when you join the installments, with the pin
under the chin, that seems to be right; then when you reverse it and
bring the collar under the chin it seems as right as ever; whichever
way you fix it the lines come together snug and convincing, and
either way you do it the portrait’s face looks equally surprised and
rejoiced, and as if it wouldn’t be satisfied to have it any way but
just that one; in fact, even if you take the bust away altogether
the face seems surprised and happy just the same--I have never seen
an expression before, which no vicissitudes could alter. I wish I
could remember who it is. It looks a little like Washington, but I
do not think it can be Washington, because he had as many ears on
one side as the other. You can always tell Washington by that; he
was very particular about his ears, and about having them arranged
the same old way all the time.

[Illustration: AND THE BUST ON ANOTHER]

By and by I shall get out of these confusions, and then it will be
plain sailing; but first-off the confusions were natural and not to
be avoided. My reputation came very suddenly and tumultuously when I
published my own portrait, and it turned my head a little, for
indeed there was never anything like it. In a single day I got
orders from sixty-two people not to paint their portraits, some of
them the most distinguished persons in the country--the President,
the Cabinet, authors, governors, admirals, candidates for office on
the weak side--almost everybody that was anybody, and it would
really have turned the head of nearly any beginner to get so much
notice and have it come with such a frenzy of cordiality. But I am
growing calm and settling down to business, now; and pretty soon I
shall cease to be flurried, and then when I do a portrait I shall be
quite at myself and able on the instant to tell it from the others
and pick it out when wanted.

I am living a new and exalted life of late. It steeps me in a sacred
rapture to see a portrait develop and take soul under my hand.
First, I throw off a study--just a mere study, a few apparently
random lines--and to look at it you would hardly ever suspect who it
was going to be; even I cannot tell, myself. Take this picture, for
instance:

  FIRST YOU THINK IT’S DANTE; NEXT YOU THINK IT’S EMERSON; THEN YOU
    THINK IT’S WAYNE MAC VEAGH. YET IT ISN’T ANY OF THEM; IT’S THE
    BEGINNINGS OF DEPEW
]

First you think it’s Dante; next you think it’s Emerson; then you
think it’s Wayne Mac Veagh. Yet it isn’t any of them; it’s the
beginnings of Depew. Now you wouldn’t believe Depew could be
devolved out of that; yet the minute it is finished here you have
him to the life, and you say, yourself, “If that isn’t Depew it
isn’t anybody.”

Some would have painted him speaking, but he isn’t always speaking,
he has to stop and think sometimes.

That is a _genre_ picture, as we say in the trade, and differs from
the encaustic and other schools in various ways, mainly technical,
which you wouldn’t understand if I should explain them to you. But
you will get the idea as I go along, and little by little you will
learn all that is valuable about Art without knowing how it
happened, and without any sense of strain or effort, and then you
will know what school a picture belongs to, just at a glance, and
whether it is an animal picture or a landscape. It is then that the
joy of life will begin for you.

When you come to examine my portraits of Mr. Joe Jefferson and the
rest, your eye will have become measurably educated by that time,
and you will recognize at once that no two of them are alike. I will
close the present chapter with an example of the nude, for your
instruction.

This creation is different from any of the other works. The others
are from real life, but this is an example of still-life; so called
because it is a portrayal of a fancy only, a thing which has no
actual and active existence. The purpose of a still-life picture is
to concrete to the eye the spiritual, the intangible, a something
which we feel, but cannot see with the fleshy vision--such as joy,
sorrow, resentment, and so on. This is best achieved by the
employment of that treatment which we call the impressionist, in the
trade. The present example is an impressionist picture, done in
distemper, with a chiaroscuro motif modified by monochromatic
technique, so as to secure tenderness of feeling and spirituality of
expression. At a first glance it would seem to be a Botticelli, but
it is not that; it is only a humble imitation of that great master
of longness and slimness and limbfulness.

[Illustration: THAT THING IN THE RIGHT HAND IS NOT A SKILLET; IT IS
A TAMBOURINE]

The work is imagined from Greek story, and represents Proserpine or
Persepolis, or one of those other Bacchantes doing the solemnities
of welcome before the altar of Isis upon the arrival of the annual
shipload of Athenian youths in the island of Minos to be sacrificed
in appeasement of the Dordonian Cyclops.

[Illustration: THE PORTRAIT REPRODUCES MR. JOSEPH JEFFERSON, THE
COMMON FRIEND OF THE HUMAN RACE]

The figure symbolizes solemn joy. It is severely Greek, therefore
does not call details of drapery or other factitious helps to its
aid, but depends wholly upon grace of action and symmetry of contour
for its effects. It is intended to be viewed from the south or
southeast, and I think that that is best; for while it expresses
more and larger joy when viewed from the east or the north, the
features of the face are too much foreshortened and wormy when
viewed from that point. That thing in the right hand is not a
skillet; it is a tambourine.

[Illustration: EITHER MR. HOWELLS OR MR. LAFFAN. I CANNOT TELL WHICH
BECAUSE THE LABEL IS LOST]

This creation will be exhibited at the Paris Salon in June, and will
compete for the _Prix de Rome_.

The above is a marine picture, and is intended to educate the eye in
the important matters of perspective and foreshortening. The
mountainous and bounding waves in the foreground, contrasted with
the tranquil ship fading away as in a dream the other side of the
fishing-pole, convey to us the idea of space and distance as no
words could do. Such is the miracle wrought by that wondrous device,
perspective.

The portrait reproduces Mr. Joseph Jefferson, the common friend of
the human race. He is fishing, and is not catching anything. This is
finely expressed by the moisture in the eye and the anguish of the
mouth. The mouth is holding back words. The pole is bamboo, the line
is foreshortened. This foreshortening, together with the smoothness
of the water away out there where the cork is, gives a powerful
impression of distance, and is another way of achieving a
perspective effect.

We now come to the next portrait, which is either Mr. Howells or Mr.
Laffan. I cannot tell which, because the label is lost. But it will
do for both, because the features are Mr. Howells’s, while the
expression is Mr. Laffan’s. This work will bear critical
examination.

The next picture is part of an animal, but I do not know the name of
it. It is not finished. The front end of it went around a corner
before I could get to it.

[Illustration: THE FRONT END OF IT WENT AROUND A CORNER BEFORE I
COULD GET TO IT]

[Illustration: THE BEST AND MOST WINNING AND ELOQUENT PORTRAIT MY
BRUSH HAS EVER PRODUCED]

We will conclude with the portrait of a lady in the style of
Raphael. Originally I started it out for Queen Elizabeth, but was
not able to do the lace hopper her head projects out of, therefore I
tried to turn it into Pocahontas, but was again baffled, and was
compelled to make further modifications, this time achieving
success. By spiritualizing it and turning it into the noble mother
of our race and throwing into the countenance the sacred joy which
her first tailor-made outfit infuses into her spirit, I was enabled
to add to my gallery the best and most winning and eloquent portrait
my brush has ever produced.

The most effective encouragement a beginner can have is the
encouragement which he gets from noting his own progress with an
alert and persistent eye. Save up your works and date them; as the
years go by, run your eye over them from time to time, and measure
your advancing stride. This will thrill you, this will nerve you,
this will inspire you as nothing else can.

It has been my own course, and to it I owe the most that I am to-day
in Art. When I look back and examine my first effort and then
compare it with my latest, it seems unbelievable that I have climbed
so high in thirty-one years. Yet so it is. Practice--that is the
secret. From three to seven hours a day. It is all that is required.
The results are sure; whereas indolence achieves nothing great.

  IT SEEMS UNBELIEVABLE THAT I HAVE CLIMBED SO HIGH IN THIRTY-ONE
    YEARS
]




                             SOLD TO SATAN
                                 (1904)


It was at this time that I concluded to sell my soul to Satan. Steel
was away down, so was St. Paul; it was the same with all the
desirable stocks, in fact, and so, if I did not turn out to be away
down myself, now was my time to raise a stake and make my fortune.
Without further consideration I sent word to the local agent, Mr.
Blank, with description and present condition of the property, and
an interview with Satan was promptly arranged, on a basis of 2½ per
cent, this commission payable only in case a trade should be
consummated.

I sat in the dark, waiting and thinking. How still it was! Then came
the deep voice of a far-off bell proclaiming midnight--Boom-m-m!
Boom-m-m! Boom-m-m!--and I rose to receive my guest, and braced
myself for the thunder crash and the brimstone stench which should
announce his arrival. But there was no crash, no stench. Through the
closed door, and noiseless, came the modern Satan, just as we see
him on the stage--tall, slender, graceful, in tights and trunks, a
short cape mantling his shoulders, a rapier at his side, a single
drooping feather in his jaunty cap, and on his intellectual face the
well-known and high-bred Mephistophelian smile.

But he was not a fire coal; he was not red, no! On the contrary. He
was a softly glowing, richly smoldering torch, column, statue of
pallid light, faintly tinted with a spiritual green, and out from
him a lunar splendor flowed such as one sees glinting from the
crinkled waves of tropic seas when the moon rides high in cloudless
skies.

He made his customary stage obeisance, resting his left hand upon
his sword hilt and removing his cap with his right and making that
handsome sweep with it which we know so well; then we sat down. Ah,
he was an incandescent glory, a nebular dream, and so much improved
by his change of color. He must have seen the admiration in my
illuminated face, but he took no notice of it, being long ago used
to it in faces of other Christians with whom he had had trade
relations.

... A half hour of hot toddy and weather chat, mixed with occasional
tentative feelers on my part and rejoinders of, “Well, I could
hardly pay _that_ for it, you know,” on his, had much modified my
shyness and put me so much at my ease that I was emboldened to feed
my curiosity a little. So I chanced the remark that he was
surprisingly different from the traditions, and I wished I knew what
it was he was made of. He was not offended, but answered with frank
simplicity:

“Radium!”

“That accounts for it!” I exclaimed. “It is the loveliest
effulgence I have ever seen. The hard and heartless glare of the
electric doesn’t compare with it. I suppose Your Majesty weighs
about--about----”

“I stand six feet one; fleshed and blooded I would weigh two hundred
and fifteen; but radium, like other metals, is heavy. I weigh nine
hundred-odd.”

I gazed hungrily upon him, saying to myself:

“What riches! what a mine! Nine hundred pounds at, say, $3,500,000 a
pound, would be--would be----” Then a treacherous thought burst into
my mind!

He laughed a good hearty laugh, and said:

“I perceive your thought; and what a handsomely original idea it
is!--to kidnap Satan, and stock him, and incorporate him, and water
the stock up to ten billions--just three times its actual value--and
blanket the world with it!” My blush had turned the moonlight to a
crimson mist, such as veils and spectralizes the domes and towers of
Florence at sunset and makes the spectator drunk with joy to see,
and he pitied me, and dropped his tone of irony, and assumed a grave
and reflective one which had a pleasanter sound for me, and under
its kindly influence my pains were presently healed, and I thanked
him for his courtesy. Then he said:

“One good turn deserves another, and I will pay you a compliment. Do
you know I have been trading with your poor pathetic race for ages,
and you are the first person who has ever been intelligent enough to
divine the large commercial value of my make-up.”

I purred to myself and looked as modest as I could.

“Yes, you are the first,” he continued. “All through the Middle Ages
I used to buy Christian souls at fancy rates, building bridges and
cathedrals in a single night in return, and getting swindled out of
my Christian nearly every time that I dealt with a priest--as
history will concede--but making it up on the lay square-dealer now
and then, as _I_ admit; but none of those people ever guessed where
the _real_ big money lay. You are the first.”

I refilled his glass and gave him another Cavour. But he was
experienced, by this time. He inspected the cigar pensively awhile;
then:

“What do you pay for these?” he asked.

“Two cents--but they come cheaper when you take a barrel.”

He went on inspecting; also mumbling comments, apparently to
himself:

“Black--rough-skinned--rumpled, irregular, wrinkled, barky, with
crispy curled-up places on it--burnt-leather aspect, like the shoes
of the damned that sit in pairs before the room doors at home of a
Sunday morning.” He sighed at thought of his home, and was silent a
moment; then he said, gently, “Tell me about this projectile.”

“It is the discovery of a great Italian statesman,” I said. “Cavour.
One day he lit his cigar, then laid it down and went on writing and
forgot it. It lay in a pool of ink and got soaked. By and by he
noticed it and laid it on the stove to dry. When it was dry he lit
it and at once noticed that it didn’t taste the same as it did
before. And so----”

“Did he say what it tasted like before?”

“No, I think not. But he called the government chemist and told him
to find out the source of that new taste, and report. The chemist
applied the tests, and reported that the source was the presence of
sulphate of iron, touched up and spiritualized with vinegar--the
combination out of which one makes ink. Cavour told him to introduce
the brand in the interest of the finances. So, ever since then this
brand passes through the ink factory, with the great result that
both the ink and the cigar suffer a sea change into something new
and strange. This is history, Sire, not a work of the imagination.”

So then he took up his present again, and touched it to the
forefinger of his other hand for an instant, which made it break
into flame and fragrance--but he changed his mind at that point and
laid the torpedo down, saying, courteously:

“With permission I will save it for Voltaire.”

I was greatly pleased and flattered to be connected in even this
little way with that great man and be mentioned to him, as no doubt
would be the case, so I hastened to fetch a bundle of fifty for
distribution among others of the renowned and lamented--Goethe, and
Homer, and Socrates, and Confucius, and so on--but Satan said he had
nothing against those. Then he dropped back into reminiscences of
the old times once more, and presently said:

“They knew nothing about radium, and it would have had no value for
them if they had known about it. In twenty million years it has had
no value for your race until the revolutionizing steam-and-machinery
age was born--which was only a few years before you were born
yourself. It was a stunning little century, for sure, that
nineteenth! But it’s a poor thing compared to what the twentieth is
going to be.”

By request, he explained why he thought so.

“Because power was so costly, then, and everything goes by
power--the steamship, the locomotive, and everything else. Coal, you
see! You have to have it; no steam and no electricity without it;
and it’s such a waste--for you burn it up, and it’s gone! But
radium--that’s another matter! With my nine hundred pounds you could
light the world, and heat it, and run all its ships and machines and
railways a hundred million years, and not use up five pounds of it
in the whole time! And then----”

“Quick--my soul is yours, dear Ancestor; take it--we’ll start a
company!”

But he asked my age, which is sixty-eight, then politely sidetracked
the proposition, probably not wishing to take advantage of himself.
Then he went on talking admiringly of radium, and how with its own
natural and inherent heat it could go on melting its own weight of
ice twenty-four times in twenty-four hours, and keep it up forever
without losing bulk or weight; and how a pound of it, if exposed in
this room, would blast the place like a breath from hell, and burn
me to a crisp in a quarter of a minute--and was going on like that,
but I interrupted and said:

“But _you_ are here, Majesty--nine hundred pounds--and the
temperature is balmy and pleasant. I don’t understand.”

“Well,” he said, hesitatingly, “it is a secret, but I may as well
reveal it, for these prying and impertinent chemists are going to
find it out sometime or other, anyway. Perhaps you have read what
Madame Curie says about radium; how she goes searching among its
splendid secrets and seizes upon one after another of them and
italicizes its specialty; how she says ‘the compounds of radium are
_spontaneously luminous_’--require no coal in the production of
light, you see; how she says, ‘a glass vessel containing radium
_spontaneously charges itself with electricity_’--no coal or water
power required to generate it, you see; how she says ‘radium
possesses the remarkable property of _liberating heat spontaneously
and continuously_’--no coal required to fire-up on the world’s
machinery, you see. She ransacks the pitch-blende for its
radioactive substances, and captures three and labels them; one,
which is embodied with bismuth, she names polonium; one, which is
embodied with barium, she names radium; the name given to the third
was actinium. Now listen; she says ‘_the question now was to
separate the polonium from the bismuth_ ... this is the task that
has occupied us for years and has been a most difficult one.’ For
years, you see--for _years_. That is their way, those plagues, those
scientists--peg, peg, peg--dig, dig, dig--plod, plod, plod. I wish I
could catch a cargo of them for my place; it would be an economy.
Yes, for years, you see. They never give up. Patience, hope, faith,
perseverance; it is the way of all the breed. Columbus and the rest.
In radium this lady has added a new world to the planet’s
possessions, and matched--Columbus--and his peer. She has set
herself the task of divorcing polonium and bismuth; when she
succeeds she will have done--what, should you say?”

“Pray name it, Majesty.”

“It’s another new world added--a gigantic one. I will explain; for
you would never divine the size of it, and she herself does not
suspect it.”

“Do, Majesty, I beg of you.”

“Polonium, freed from bismuth and made independent, is the one and
only power that can control radium, restrain its destructive forces,
tame them, reduce them to obedience, and make them do useful and
profitable work for your race. Examine my skin. What do you think of
it?”

“It is delicate, silky, transparent, thin as a gelatine
film--exquisite, beautiful, Majesty!”

“It is made of polonium. All the rest of me is radium. If I should
strip off my skin the world would vanish away in a flash of flame
and a puff of smoke, and the remnants of the extinguished moon would
sift down through space a mere snow-shower of gray ashes!”

I made no comment, I only trembled.

“You understand, now,” he continued. “I burn, I suffer within, my
pains are measureless and eternal, but my skin protects you and the
globe from harm. Heat is power, energy, but is only useful to man
when he can control it and graduate its application to his needs.
You cannot do that with radium, now; it will not be prodigiously
useful to you until polonium shall put the slave whip in your hand.
I can release from my body the radium force in any measure I please,
great or small; at my will I can set in motion the works of a lady’s
watch or destroy a world. You saw me light that unholy cigar with my
finger?”

I remembered it.

“Try to imagine how minute was the fraction of energy released to do
that small thing! You are aware that everything is made up of
restless and revolving molecules?--everything--furniture, rocks,
water, iron, horses, men--everything that exists.”

“Yes.”

“Molecules of scores of different sizes and weights, but none of
them big enough to be seen by help of any microscope?”

“Yes.”

“And that each molecule is made up of thousands of separate and
never-resting little particles called atoms?”

“Yes.”

“And that up to recent times the smallest atom known to science was
the hydrogen atom, which was a thousand times smaller than the atom
that went to the building of any other molecule?”

“Yes.”

“Well, the radium atom from the positive pole is 5,000 times smaller
than _that_ atom! This unspeakably minute atom is called an
_electron_. Now then, out of my long affection for you and for your
lineage, I will reveal to you a secret--a secret known to no
scientist as yet--the secret of the firefly’s light and the
glowworm’s; it is produced by a single electron imprisoned in a
polonium atom.”

“Sire, it is a wonderful thing, and the scientific world would be
grateful to know this secret, which has baffled and defeated all its
searchings for more than two centuries. To think!--a single
electron, 5,000 times smaller than the invisible hydrogen atom, to
produce that explosion of vivid light which makes the summer night
so beautiful!”

“And consider,” said Satan; “it is the only instance in all nature
where radium exists in a pure state unencumbered by fettering
alliances; where polonium enjoys the like emancipation; and where
the pair are enabled to labor together in a gracious and beneficent
and effective partnership. Suppose the protecting polonium envelope
were removed; the radium spark would flash but once and the firefly
would be consumed to vapor! Do you value this old iron letterpress?”

“No, Majesty, for it is not mine.”

“Then I will destroy it and let you see. I lit the ostensible cigar
with the heat energy of a single electron, the equipment of a single
lightning bug. I will turn on twenty thousand electrons now.”

He touched the massive thing and it exploded with a cannon crash,
leaving nothing but vacancy where it had stood. For three minutes
the air was a dense pink fog of sparks, through which Satan loomed
dim and vague, then the place cleared and his soft rich moonlight
pervaded it again. He said:

“You see? The radium in 20,000 lightning bugs would run a
racing-mobile forever. There’s no waste, no diminution of it.” Then
he remarked in a quite casual way, “We use nothing but radium at
home.”

I was astonished. And interested, too, for I have friends there, and
relatives. I had always believed--in accordance with my early
teachings--that the fuel was soft coal and brimstone. He noticed the
thought, and answered it.

“Soft coal and brimstone is the tradition, yes, but it is an error.
We could use it; at least we could make out with it after a fashion,
but it has several defects: it is not cleanly, it ordinarily makes
but a temperate fire, and it would be exceedingly difficult, if even
possible, to heat it up to standard, Sundays; and as for the supply,
all the worlds and systems could not furnish enough to keep us going
halfway through eternity. Without radium there could be no hell;
certainly not a satisfactory one.”

“Why?”

“Because if we hadn’t radium we should have to dress the souls in
some other material; then, of course, they would burn up and get out
of trouble. They would not last an hour. You know that?”

“Why--yes, now that you mention it. But I supposed they were dressed
in their natural flesh; they look so in the pictures--in the Sistine
Chapel and in the illustrated books, you know.”

“Yes, our damned look as they looked in the world, but it isn’t
flesh; flesh could not survive any longer than that copying press
survived--it would explode and turn to a fog of sparks, and the
result desired in sending it there would be defeated. Believe me,
radium is the only wear.”

“I see it now,” I said, with prophetic discomfort, “I know that you
are right, Majesty.”

“I am. I speak from experience. You shall see, when you get there.”

He said this as if he thought I was eaten up with curiosity, but it
was because he did not know me. He sat reflecting a minute, then he
said:

“I will make your fortune.”

It cheered me up and I felt better. I thanked him and was all
eagerness and attention.

“Do you know,” he continued, “where they find the bones of the
extinct moa, in New Zealand? All in a pile--thousands and thousands
of them banked together in a mass twenty feet deep. And do you know
where they find the tusks of the extinct mastodon of the
Pleistocene? Banked together in acres off the mouth of the Lena--an
ivory mine which has furnished freight for Chinese caravans for five
hundred years. Do you know the phosphate beds of our South? They are
miles in extent, a limitless mass and jumble of bones of vast
animals whose like exists no longer in the earth--a cemetery, a
mighty cemetery, that is what it is. All over the earth there are
such cemeteries. Whence came the instinct that made those families
of creatures go to a chosen and particular spot to die when sickness
came upon them and they perceived that their end was near? It is a
mystery; not even science has been able to uncover the secret of it.
But there stands the fact. Listen, then. For a million years there
has been a firefly cemetery.”

Hopefully, appealingly, I opened my mouth--he motioned me to close
it, and went on:

“It is in a scooped-out bowl half as big as this room on the top of
a snow summit of the Cordilleras. That bowl is level full--of what?
Pure firefly radium and the glow and heat of hell? For countless
ages myriads of fireflies have daily flown thither and died in that
bowl and been burned to vapor in an instant, each fly leaving as its
contribution its only indestructible particle, its single electron
of pure radium. There is energy enough there to light the whole
world, heat the whole world’s machinery, supply the whole world’s
transportation power from now till the end of eternity. The massed
riches of the planet could not furnish its value in money. You are
mine, it is yours; when Madame Curie isolates polonium, clothe
yourself in a skin of it and go and take possession!”

Then he vanished and left me in the dark when I was just in the act
of thanking him. I can find the bowl by the light it will cast upon
the sky; I can get the polonium presently, when that illustrious
lady in France isolates it from the bismuth. Stock is for sale.
Apply to Mark Twain.




                            THAT DAY IN EDEN
                      (Passage from Satan’s Diary)


Long ago I was in the bushes near the Tree of Knowledge when the Man
and the Woman came there and had a conversation. I was present, now,
when they came again after all these years. They were as
before--mere boy and girl--trim, rounded, slender, flexible, snow
images lightly flushed with the pink of the skies, innocently
unconscious of their nakedness, lovely to look upon, beautiful
beyond words.

I listened again. Again as in that former time they puzzled over
those words, Good, Evil, Death, and tried to reason out their
meaning; but, of course, they were not able to do it. Adam said:

“Come, maybe we can find Satan. He might know these things.”

Then I came forth, still gazing upon Eve and admiring, and said to
her:

“You have not seen me before, sweet creature, but I have seen you. I
have seen all the animals, but in beauty none of them equals you.
Your hair, your eyes, your face, your flesh tints, your form, the
tapering grace of your white limbs--all are beautiful, adorable,
perfect.”

It gave her pleasure, and she looked herself over, putting out a
foot and a hand and admiring them; then she naïvely said:

“It is a joy to be so beautiful. And Adam--he is the same.”

She turned him about, this way and that, to show him off, with such
guileless pride in her blue eyes, and he--he took it all as just
matter of course, and was innocently happy in it, and said, “When I
have flowers on my head it is better still.”

Eve said, “It is true--you shall see,” and she flitted hither and
thither like a butterfly and plucked flowers, and in a moment laced
their stems together in a glowing wreath and set it upon his head;
then tiptoed and gave it a pat here and there with her nimble
fingers, with each pat enhancing its grace and shape, none knows
how, nor why it should so result, but in it there is a law
somewhere, though the delicate art and mystery of it is her secret
alone, and not learnable by another; and when at last it was to her
mind she clapped her hands for pleasure, then reached up and kissed
him--as pretty a sight, taken altogether, as in my experience I have
seen.

Presently, to the matter in hand. The meaning of those words--would
I tell her?

Certainly none could be more willing, but how was I to do it? I
could think of no way to make her understand, and I said so. I said:

“I will try, but it is hardly of use. For instance--what is pain?”

“Pain? I do not know.”

“Certainly. How should you? Pain is not of your world; pain is
impossible to you; you have never experienced a physical pain.
Reduce that to a formula, a principle, and what have we?”

“What have we?”

“This: Things which are outside of our orbit--our own particular
world--things which by our constitution and equipment we are unable
to see, or feel, or otherwise experience--_cannot be made
comprehensible to us in words_. There you have the whole thing in a
nutshell. It is a principle, it is axiomatic, it is a law. Now do
you understand?”

The gentle creature looked dazed, and for all result she was
delivered of this vacant remark:

“What is axiomatic?”

She had missed the point. Necessarily she would. Yet her effort was
success for me, for it was a vivid confirmation of the truth of what
I had been saying. Axiomatic was for the present a thing outside of
the world of her experience, therefore it had no meaning for her. I
ignored her question and continued:

“What is fear?”

“Fear? I do not know.”

“Naturally. Why should you? You have not felt it, you cannot feel
it, it does not belong in your world. With a hundred thousand words
I should not be able to make you understand what fear is. How then
am I to explain death to you? You have never seen it, it is foreign
to your world, it is impossible to make the word mean anything to
you, so far as I can see. In a way, it is a sleep----”

“Oh, I know what that is!”

“But it is a sleep only in a way, as I said. It is more than a
sleep.”

“Sleep is pleasant, sleep is lovely!”

“But death is a long sleep--very long.”

“Oh, all the lovelier! Therefore I think nothing could be better
than death.”

I said to myself, “Poor child, some day you may know what a pathetic
truth you have spoken; some day you may say, out of a broken heart,
‘Come to me, O Death the compassionate! steep me in the merciful
oblivion, O refuge of the sorrowful, friend of the forsaken and the
desolate!’” Then I said aloud, “But this sleep is eternal.”

The word went over her head. Necessarily it would.

“Eternal. What is eternal?”

“Ah, that also is outside of your world, as yet. There is no way to
make you understand it.”

It was a hopeless case. Words referring to things outside of her
experience were a foreign language to her, and meaningless. She was
like a little baby whose mother says to it, “Don’t put your finger
in the candle flame; it will burn you.” Burn--it is a foreign word
to the baby, and will have no terrors for it until experience shall
have revealed its meaning. It is not worth while for mamma to make
the remark, the baby will goo-goo cheerfully, and put its finger in
the pretty flame--once. After these private reflections I said again
that I did not think there was any way to make her understand the
meaning of the word eternal. She was silent awhile, turning these
deep matters over in the unworn machinery of her mind; then she gave
up the puzzle and shifted her ground, saying:

“Well, there are those other words. What is good, and what is evil?”

“It is another difficulty. They, again, are outside of your world;
they have place in the moral kingdom only. You have no morals.”

“What are morals?”

“A system of law which distinguishes between right and wrong, good
morals and bad. These things do not exist for you. I cannot make it
clear; you would not understand.”

“But try.”

“Well, obedience to constituted authority is a moral law. Suppose
Adam should forbid you to put your child in the river and leave it
there overnight--would you put the child there?”

She answered with a darling simplicity and guilelessness:

“Why, yes, if I wanted to.”

“There, it is just as I said--you would not know any better; you
have no idea of duty, command, obedience; they have no meaning for
you. In your present estate you are in no possible way responsible
for anything you do or say or think. It is impossible for you to do
wrong, for you have no more notion of right and wrong than the other
animals have. You and they can do only right; whatever you and they
do is right and innocent. It is a divine estate, the loftiest and
purest attainable in heaven and in earth. It is the angel gift. The
angels are wholly pure and sinless, for they do not know right from
wrong, and all the acts of such are blameless. No one can do wrong
without knowing how to distinguish between right and wrong.”

“Is it an advantage to know?”

“Most certainly not! That knowledge would remove all that is divine,
all that is angelic, from the angels, and immeasurably degrade
them.”

“Are there any persons that know right from wrong?”

“Not in--well, not in heaven.”

“What gives that knowledge?”

“The Moral Sense.”

“What is that?”

“Well--no matter. Be thankful that you lack it.”

“Why?”

“Because it is a degradation, a disaster. Without it one cannot do
wrong; with it, one can. Therefore it has but one office, only
one--to teach how to do wrong. It can teach no other thing--no other
thing whatever. It is the _creator_ of wrong; wrong cannot exist
until the Moral Sense brings it into being.”

“How can one acquire the Moral Sense?”

“By eating of the fruit of the Tree, here. But why do you wish to
know? Would you like to have the Moral Sense?”

She turned wistfully to Adam:

“Would you like to have it?”

He showed no particular interest, and only said:

“I am indifferent. I have not understood any of this talk, but if
you like we will eat it, for I cannot see that there is any
objection to it.”

Poor ignorant things, the command of refrain had meant nothing to
them, they were but children, and could not understand untried
things and verbal abstractions which stood for matters outside of
their little world and their narrow experience. Eve reached for an
apple!--oh, farewell, Eden and your sinless joys, come poverty and
pain, hunger and cold and heartbreak, bereavement, tears and shame,
envy, strife, malice and dishonor, age, weariness, remorse; then
desperation and the prayer for the release of death, indifferent
that the gates of hell yawn beyond it!

She tasted--the fruit fell from her hand.

It was pitiful. She was like one who wakens slow and confusedly out
of a sleep. She gazed half vacantly at me, then at Adam, holding her
curtaining fleece of golden hair back with her hand; then her
wandering glance fell upon her naked person. The red blood mounted
to her cheek, and she sprang behind a bush and stood there crying,
and saying:

“Oh, my modesty is lost to me--my unoffending form is become a shame
to me!” She moaned and muttered in her pain, and dropped her head,
saying, “I am degraded--I have fallen, oh, so low, and I shall never
rise again.”

Adam’s eyes were fixed upon her in a dreamy amazement, for he could
not understand what had happened, it being outside his world as yet,
and her words having no meaning for one void of the Moral Sense. And
now his wonder grew: for, unknown to Eve, her hundred years rose
upon her, and faded the heaven of her eyes and the tints of her
young flesh, and touched her hair with gray, and traced faint sprays
of wrinkles about her mouth and eyes, and shrunk her form, and
dulled the satin luster of her skin.

All this the fair boy saw: then loyally and bravely he took the
apple and tasted it, saying nothing.

The change came upon him also. Then he gathered boughs for both and
clothed their nakedness, and they turned and went their way, hand in
hand and bent with age, and so passed from sight.




                               EVE SPEAKS


                                 I

They drove us from the Garden with their swords of flame, the fierce
cherubim. And what had we done? We meant no harm. We were ignorant,
and did as any other children might do. We could not know it was
wrong to disobey the command, for the words were strange to us and
we did not understand them. We did not know right from wrong--how
should we know? We could not, without the Moral Sense; it was not
possible. If we had been given the Moral Sense first--ah, that would
have been fairer, that would have been kinder; then we should be to
blame if we disobeyed. But to say to us poor ignorant children words
which we could not understand, and then punish us because we did not
do as we were told--ah, how can that be justified? We knew no more
then than this littlest child of mine knows now, with its four
years--oh, not so much, I think. Would I say to it, “If thou
touchest this bread I will overwhelm thee with unimaginable
disaster, even to the dissolution of thy corporeal elements,” and
when it took the bread and smiled up in my face, thinking no harm,
as not understanding those strange words, would I take advantage of
its innocence and strike it down with the mother hand it trusted?
Whoso knoweth the mother heart, let him judge if it would do that
thing. Adam says my brain is turned by my troubles and that I am
become wicked. I am as I am; I did not make myself.

They drove us out. Drove us out into this harsh wilderness, and shut
the gates against us. We that had meant no harm. It is three months.
We were ignorant then; we are rich in learning, now--ah, how rich!
We know hunger, thirst, and cold; we know pain, disease, and grief;
we know hate, rebellion, and deceit; we know remorse, the conscience
that prosecutes guilt and innocence alike, making no distinction; we
know weariness of body and spirit, the unrefreshing sleep, the rest
which rests not, the dreams which restore Eden, and banish it again
with the waking; we know misery; we know torture and the heartbreak;
we know humiliation and insult; we know indecency, immodesty, and
the soiled mind; we know the scorn that attaches to the transmitted
image of God exposed unclothed to the day; we know fear; we know
vanity, folly, envy, hypocrisy; we know irreverence; we know
blasphemy; we know right from wrong, and how to avoid the one and do
the other; we know all the rich product of the Moral Sense, and it
is our possession. Would we could sell it for one hour of Eden and
white purity; would we could degrade the animals with it!

We have it all--that treasure. All but death. Death.... Death. What
may that be?

Adam comes.

“Well?”

“He still sleeps.”

That is our second-born--our Abel.

“He has slept enough for his good, and his garden suffers for his
care. Wake him.”

“I have tried and cannot.”

“Then he is very tired. Let him sleep on.”

“I think it is his hurt that makes him sleep so long.”

I answer: “It may be so. Then we will let him rest; no doubt the
sleep is healing it.”

                                 II

It is a day and a night, now, that he has slept. We found him by his
altar in his field, that morning, his face and body drenched in
blood. He said his eldest brother struck him down. Then he spoke no
more and fell asleep. We laid him in his bed and washed the blood
away, and were glad to know the hurt was light and that he had no
pain; for if he had had pain he would not have slept.

It was in the early morning that we found him. All day he slept that
sweet, reposeful sleep, lying always on his back, and never moving,
never turning. It showed how tired he was, poor thing. He is so good
and works so hard, rising with the dawn and laboring till the dark.
And now he is overworked; it will be best that he tax himself less,
after this, and I will ask him; he will do anything I wish.

All the day he slept. I know, for I was always near, and made dishes
for him and kept them warm against his waking. Often I crept in and
fed my eyes upon his gentle face, and was thankful for that blessed
sleep. And still he slept on--slept with his eyes wide; a strange
thing, and made me think he was awake at first, but it was not so,
for I spoke and he did not answer. He always answers when I speak.
Cain has moods and will not answer, but not Abel.

I have sat by him all the night, being afraid he might wake and want
his food. His face was very white; and it changed, and he came to
look as he had looked when he was a little child in Eden long ago,
so sweet and good and dear. It carried me back over the abyss of
years, and I was lost in dreams and tears--oh, hours, I think. Then
I came to myself; and thinking he stirred, I kissed his cheek to
wake him, but he slumbered on and I was disappointed. His cheek was
cold. I brought sacks of wool and the down of birds and covered him,
but he was still cold, and I brought more. Adam has come again, and
says he is not yet warm. I do not understand it.

                                III

We cannot wake him! With my arms clinging about him I have looked
into his eyes, through the veil of my tears, and begged for one
little word, and he will not answer. Oh, is it that long sleep--is
it death? And will he wake no more?

                         FROM SATAN’S DIARY

Death has entered the world, the creatures are perishing; one of The
Family is fallen; the product of the Moral Sense is complete. The
Family think ill of death--they will change their minds.




                         SAMUEL ERASMUS MOFFETT
                            AUGUST 16, 1908

                    HIS CHARACTER AND HIS DEATH

_August 16th._--Early in the evening of the first day of this month
the telephone brought us a paralyzing shock: my nephew, Samuel E.
Moffett, was drowned. It was while sea bathing. The seas were
running high and he was urged not to venture out, but he was a
strong swimmer and not afraid. He made the plunge with confidence,
his frightened little son looking on. Instantly he was helpless. The
great waves tossed him hither and thither, they buried him, they
struck the life out of him. In a minute it was all over.

He was forty-eight years old, he was at his best, physically and
mentally, and was well on his way toward earned distinction. He was
large-minded and large-hearted, there was no blot nor fleck upon his
character, his ideals were high and clean, and by native impulse and
without effort he lived up to them.

He had been a working journalist, an editorial writer, for nearly
thirty years, and yet in that exposed position had preserved his
independence in full strength and his principles undecayed. Several
years ago he accepted a high place on the staff of _Collier’s
Weekly_ and was occupying it when he died.

In an early chapter of my _Autobiography_, written three years ago,
I have told how he wrote from San Francisco, when he was a stripling
and asked me to help him get a berth on a daily paper there; and how
he submitted to the severe conditions I imposed, and got the berth
and kept it sixteen years.

As child and lad his health was delicate, capricious, insecure, and
his eyesight affected by a malady which debarred him from book study
and from reading. This was a bitter hardship for him, for he had a
wonderful memory and a sharp hunger for knowledge. School was not
for him, yet while still a little boy he acquired an education, and
a good one. He managed it after a method of his own devising: he got
permission to listen while the classes of the normal school recited
their abstruse lessons and black-boarded their mathematics. By
questioning the little chap it was found that he was keeping up with
the star scholars of the school.

In those days he paid us a visit in Hartford. It was when he was
about twelve years old. I was laboriously constructing an
ancient-history game at the time, to be played by my wife and
myself, and I was digging the dates and facts for it out of
cyclopædias, a dreary and troublesome business. I had sweated blood
over that work and was pardonably proud of the result, as far as I
had gone. I showed the child my mass of notes, and he was at once as
excited as I should have been over a Sunday-school picnic at his
age. He wanted to help, he was eager to help, and I was as willing
to let him as I should have been to give away an interest in a
surgical operation that I was getting tired of. I made him free of
the cyclopædias, but he never consulted them--he had their contents
in his head. All alone he built and completed the game rapidly and
without effort.

Away back in ’80 or ’81 when the grand eruption of Krakatoa, in the
Straits of Sunda, occurred, the news reached San Francisco late in
the night--too late for editors to hunt for information about that
unknown volcano in cyclopædias and write it up exhaustively and
learnedly in time for the first edition. The managing editor said,
“Send to Moffett’s home; rout him out and fetch him; he will know
all about it; he won’t need the cyclopædia.” Which was true. He came
to the office and swiftly wrote it all up without having to refer to
books.

I will take a few paragraphs from the article about him in
_Collier’s Weekly_:

  If you wanted to know any fact about any subject it was quicker to
  go to him than to books of reference. His good nature made him the
  martyr of interruptions. In the middle of a sentence, in a hurry
  hour, he would look up happily, and whether the thing you wanted
  was railroad statistics or international law, he would bring it
  out of one of the pigeonholes in his brain. A born dispenser of
  the light, he made the giving of information a privilege and a
  pleasure on all occasions.

  This cyclopædic faculty was marvelous because it was only a small
  part of his equipment which became invaluable in association with
  other gifts. A student and a humanist, he delighted equally in
  books and in watching all the workings of a political convention.

  For any one of the learned professions he had conspicuous ability.
  He chose that which, in the cloister of the editorial rooms, makes
  fame for others. Any judge or Cabinet Minister of our time may
  well be proud of a career of such usefulness as his. Men with such
  a quality of mind as Moffett’s are rare.

  Anyone who discussed with him the things he advocated stood a
  little awed to discover that here was a man who had carefully
  thought out what would be best for all the people in the world two
  or three generations hence, and guided his work according to that
  standard. This was the one broad subject that covered all his
  interests; in detail they included the movement for universal
  peace about which he wrote repeatedly; so small a thing as a plan
  to place flowers on the window sills and fire escapes of New York
  tenement houses enlisted not only the advocacy of his pen, but his
  direct personal presence and co-operation; again and again, in his
  department in this paper, he gave indorsement and aid to similar
  movements, whether broad or narrow in their scope--the saving of
  the American forests, fighting tuberculosis, providing free meals
  for poor school children in New York, old-age pensions, safety
  appliances for protecting factory employees, the beautifying of
  American cities, the creation of inland waterways, industrial
  peace.

He leaves behind him wife, daughter, and son--inconsolable mourners.
The son is thirteen, a beautiful human creature, with the broad and
square face of his father and his grandfather, a face in which one
reads high character and intelligence. This boy will be
distinguished, by and by, I think.

In closing this slight sketch of Samuel E. Moffett I wish to dwell
with lingering and especial emphasis upon the dignity of his
character and ideals. In an age when we would rather have money than
health, and would rather have another man’s money than our own, he
lived and died unsordid; in a day when the surest road to national
greatness and admiration is by showy and rotten demagoguery in
politics and by giant crimes in finance, he lived and died a
gentleman.




                             THE NEW PLANET

  (The astronomers at Harvard have observed “perturbations in the
  orbital movement of Neptune,” such as might be caused by the
  presence of a new planet in the vicinity.)


I believe in the new planet. I was eleven years old in 1846,
when Leverrier and Adams and Mary Somerville discovered Neptune
through the disturbance and discomfort it was causing Uranus.
“Perturbations,” they call that kind of disturbance. I had been
having those perturbations myself, for more than two months; in
fact, all through watermelon time, for they used to keep dogs in
some of the patches in those days. You notice that these recent
perturbations are considered remarkable because they perturbate
through three seconds of arc, but really that is nothing: often
I used to perturbate through as much as half an hour if it was a
dog that was attending to the perturbating. There isn’t any
Neptune that can outperturbate a dog; and I know, because I am
not speaking from hearsay. Why, if there was a planet two
hundred and fifty thousand “light-years” the other side of
Neptune’s orbit, Professor Pickering would discover it in a
minute if it could perturbate equal to a dog. Give me a dog
every time, when it comes to perturbating. You let a dog jump
out at you all of a sudden in the dark of the moon, and you will
see what a small thing three seconds of arc is: the shudder that
goes through you then would open the seams of Noah’s Ark itself,
from figurehead to rudder post, and you would drop that melon
the same as if you had never had any but just a casual interest
in it. I know about these things, because this is not tradition
I am writing, but history.

Now then, notice this. About the end of August, 1846, a change came
over me and I resolved to lead a better life, so I reformed; but it
was just as well, anyway, because they had got to having guns and
dogs both. Although I was reformed, the perturbations did not stop!
Does that strike you? They did not stop, they went right on and on
and on, for three weeks, clear up to the 23d of September; then
Neptune was discovered and the whole mystery stood explained. It
shows that I am so sensitively constructed that I perturbate when
any other planet is disturbed. This has been going on all my life.
It only happens in the watermelon season, but that has nothing to do
with it, and has no significance: geologists and anthropologists and
horticulturists all tell me it is only ancestral and hereditary, and
that is what I think myself. Now then, I got to perturbating again,
this summer--all summer through; all through watermelon time: and
_where_, do you think? Up here on my farm in Connecticut. Is that
significant? Unquestionably it is, for you couldn’t raise a
watermelon on this farm with a derrick.

That perturbating was caused by the new planet. That Washington
Observatory may throw as much doubt as it wants to, it cannot affect
me, because I know there _is_ a new planet. I know it because I
don’t perturbate for nothing. There has got to be a dog or a planet,
one or the other; and there isn’t any dog around here, so there’s
_got_ to be a planet. I hope it is going to be named after me; I
should just love it if I can’t have a constellation.




                      MARJORIE FLEMING, THE WONDER
                                 CHILD


Marjorie has been in her tiny grave a hundred years; and still the
tears fall for her, and will fall. What an intensely human little
creature she was! How vividly she lived her small life; how
impulsive she was; how sudden, how tempestuous, how tender, how
loving, how sweet, how loyal, how rebellious, how repentant, how
wise, how unwise, how bursting with fun, how frank, how free, how
honest, how innocently bad, how natively good, how charged with
quaint philosophies, how winning, how precious, how adorable--and
how perennially and indestructibly interesting! And all this
exhibited, proved, and recorded before she reached the end of her
ninth year and “fell on sleep.”

Geographically considered, the lassie was a Scot; but in fact she
had no frontiers, she was the world’s child, she was the human race
in little. It is one of the prides of my life that the first time I
ever heard her name it came from the lips of Dr. John Brown--his
very own self--Dr. John Brown of Edinburgh--Dr. John Brown of _Rab
and His Friends_--Dr. John Brown of the beautiful face and the sweet
spirit, whose friends loved him with a love that was worship--Dr.
John Brown, who was Marjorie’s biographer, and who had clasped an
aged hand that had caressed Marjorie’s fifty years before, thus
linking me with that precious child by an unbroken chain of
handshakes, for I had shaken hands with Dr. John. This was in
Edinburgh thirty-six years ago. He gave my wife his little biography
of Marjorie, and I have it yet.

Is Marjorie known in America? No--at least to only a few. When Mr.
L. MacBean’s new and enlarged and charming biography[17] of her was
published five years ago it was sent over here in sheets, the market
not being large enough to justify recomposing and reprinting it on
our side of the water. I find that there are even cultivated
Scotchmen among us who have not heard of Marjorie Fleming.

She was born in Kirkcaldy in 1803, and she died when she was eight
years and eleven months old. By the time she was five years old she
was become a devourer of various kinds of literature--both heavy and
light--and was also become a quaint and free-spoken and charming
little thinker and philosopher whose views were a delightful jumble
of first-hand cloth of gold and second-hand rags.

When she was six she opened up that rich mine, her journals, and
continued to work it by spells during the remainder of her brief
life. She was a pet of Walter Scott, from the cradle, and when he
could have her society for a few hours he was content, and required
no other. Her little head was full of noble passages from
Shakespeare and other favorites of hers, and the fact that she could
deliver them with moving effect is proof that her elocution was a
born gift with her, and not a mechanical reproduction of somebody
else’s art, for a child’s parrot-work does not move. When she was a
little creature of seven years, Sir Walter Scott “would read ballads
to her in his own glorious way, the two getting wild with excitement
over them; and he would take her on his knee and make her repeat
Constance’s speeches in _King John_ till he swayed to and fro,
sobbing his fill.” [Dr. John Brown.]

“_Sobbing his fill_”--that great man--over that little thing’s
inspired interpretations. It is a striking picture; there is no mate
to it. Sir Walter said of her:

“She’s the most extraordinary creature I ever met with, and her
repeating of Shakespeare overpowers me as nothing else does.”

She spent the whole of her little life in a Presbyterian heaven; yet
she was not affected by it; she could not have been happier if she
had been in the other heaven.

She was made out of thunderstorms and sunshine, and not even her
little perfunctory pieties and shop-made holiness could squelch her
spirits or put out her fires for long. Under pressure of a pestering
sense of duty she heaves a shovelful of trade godliness into her
journals every little while, but it does not offend, for none of it
is her own; it is all borrowed, it is a convention, a custom of her
environment, it is the most innocent of hypocrisies, and this
tainted butter of hers soon gets to be as delicious to the reader as
are the stunning and worldly sincerities she splatters around it
every time her pen takes a fresh breath. The adorable child! she
hasn’t a discoverable blemish in her make-up anywhere.

Marjorie’s first letter was written before she was six years old; it
was to her cousin, Isa Keith, a young lady of whom she was
passionately fond. It was done in a sprawling hand, ten words to the
page--and in those foolscap days a page was a spacious thing:

“MY DEAR ISA--

“I now sit down on my botom to answer all the kind & beloved letters
which you was so so good as to write to me. This is the first time I
ever wrote a letter in my life.

“Miss Potune, a lady of my acquaintance, praises me dreadfully. I
repeated something out of Deen Swift & she said I was fit for the
stage, & you may think I was primmed up with majestick Pride, but
upon my word I felt myself turn a little birsay--birsay is a word
which is a word that William composed which is as you may suppose a
little enraged. This horid fat Simpliton says that my Aunt is
beautifull which is intirely impossible for that is not her nature.”

Frank? Yes, Marjorie was that. And during the brief moment that she
enchanted this dull earth with her presence she was the
bewitchingest speller and punctuator in all Christendom.

The average child of six “prints” its correspondence in rickety and
reeling Roman capitals, or dictates to mamma, who puts the little
chap’s message on paper. The sentences are labored, repetitious, and
slow; there are but three or four of them; they deal in information
solely, they contain no ideas, they venture no judgments, no
opinions; they inform papa that the cat has had kittens again; that
Mary has a new doll that can wink; that Tommy has lost his top; and
will papa come soon and bring the writer something nice? But with
Marjorie it is different.

She needs no amanuensis, she puts her message on paper herself; and
not in weak and tottering Roman capitals, but in a thundering hand
that can be heard a mile and be read across the square without
glasses. And she doesn’t have to study, and puzzle, and search her
head for something to say; no, she had only to connect the pen with
the paper and turn on the current; the words spring forth at once,
and go chasing after each other like leaves dancing down a stream.
For she has a faculty, has Marjorie! Indeed yes; when she sits down
on her bottom to do a letter, there isn’t going to be any lack of
materials, nor of fluency, and neither is her letter going to be
wanting in pepper, or vinegar, or vitriol, or any of the other
condiments employed by genius to save a literary work of art from
flatness and vapidity. And as for judgments and opinions, they are
as commodiously in her line as they are in the Lord Chief Justice’s.
They have weight, too, and are convincing: for instance, for
thirty-six years they have damaged that “horid Simpliton” in my
eyes; and, more than that, they have even imposed upon me--and most
unfairly and unwarrantably--an aversion to the horid fat Simpliton’s
name; a perfectly innocent name, and yet, because of the prejudice
against it with which this child has poisoned my mind for a
generation I cannot see “Potune” on paper and keep my gorge from
rising.

In her journals Marjorie changes her subject whenever she wants
to--and that is pretty often. When the deep moralities pay her a
passing visit she registers them. Meantime if a cherished love
passage drifts across her memory she shoves it into the midst of the
moralities--it is nothing to her that it may not feel at home there:

“We should not be happy at the death of our fellow creatures, for
they love life like us love your neighbor & he will love you
Bountifulness and Mercifulness are always rewarded. In my travels I
met with a handsome lad named Charles Balfour Esge [Esqr.] and from
him I got offers of marage--ofers of marage did I say? nay plainly
[he] loved me. Goodness does not belong to the wicked but badness
dishonor befals wickedness but not virtue, no disgrace befals virtue
perciverence overcomes almost al difficulties no I am rong in saying
almost I should say always as it is so perciverence is a virtue my
Csosin says pacience is a cristain virtue, which is true.”

She is not copying these profundities out of a book, she is getting
them out of her memory; her spelling shows that the book is not
before her. The easy and effortless flow of her talk is a marvelous
thing in a baby of her age. Her interests are as wide and varied as
a grown person’s: she discusses all sorts of books, and fearlessly
delivers judgment upon them; she examines whomsoever crosses the
field of her vision, and again delivers a verdict; she dips into
religion and history, and even into politics; she takes a shy at the
news of the day, and comments upon it; and now and then she drops
into poetry--into rhyme, at any rate.

Marjorie would not intentionally mislead anyone, but she has just
been making a remark which moves me to hoist a danger-signal for the
protection of the modern reader. It is this one: “_In my travels._”
Naturally we are apt to clothe a word with its present-day
meaning--the meaning we are used to, the meaning we are familiar
with; and so--well, you get the idea: some words that are giants
to-day were very small dwarfs a century ago, and if we are not
careful to take that vast enlargement into account when we run
across them in the literatures of the past, they are apt to convey
to us a distinctly wrong impression. To-day, when a person says “_in
my travels_” he means that he has been around the globe nineteen or
twenty times, and we so understand him; and so, when Marjorie says
it, it startles us for a moment, for it gives us the impression that
_she_ has been around it fourteen or fifteen times; whereas, such is
not at all the case. She has traveled prodigiously for _her_ day,
but not for ours. She had “traveled,” altogether, three miles by
land and eight by water--per ferryboat. She is fairly and justly
proud of it, for it is the exact equivalent, in grandeur and
impressiveness, in the case of a child of our day, to two trips
across the Atlantic and a thousand miles by rail.

False Key &c &c Persons of the parlement house are as I think caled
Advocakes Mr Cay & Mr Crakey has that honour. This has been a very
mild winter. Mr Banestors Budget is to-night I hope it will be a
good one. A great many authors have expressed themselfs too
sentimentaly.... The Mercandile Afares are in a perilous situation
sickness & a delicante frame I have not & I do not know what it is,
but Ah me perhaps I shall have it.[18] Grandure reigns in
Edinburgh.... Tomson is a beautifull author and Pope but nothing is
like Shakepear of which I have a little knolegde of. An unfortunate
death James the 5 had for he died of greif Macbeth is a pretty
composition but awful one Macbeth is so bad & wicked, but Lady
Macbeth is so hardened in guilt she does not mind her sins & faults
No.

“... A sailor called here to say farewell, it must be dreadful to
leave his native country where he might get a wife or perhaps me,
for I love him very much & with all my heart, but O I forgot
Isabella forbid me to speak about love.... I wish everybody would
follow her example & be as good as pious & virtious as she is & they
would get husbands soon enough, love is a parithatick [pathetic]
thing as well as troublesome & tiresome but O Isabella forbid me to
speak about it.”

But the little rascal can’t _keep_ from speaking about it, because
it is her supreme interest in life; her heart is not capacious
enough to hold all the product that is engendered by the
ever-recurring inflaming spectacle of man-creatures going by, and
the surplus is obliged to spill over; Isa’s prohibitions are no
sufficient dam for such a discharge.

“Love I think is the fasion for everybody is marring [marrying]....
Yesterday a marrade man named Mr John Balfour Esg [Esq.] offered to
kiss me, & offered to marry me though the man was espused
[espoused], & his wife was present & said he must ask her permission
but he did not, I think he was ashamed or confounded before 3
gentleman Mr Jobson and two Mr Kings.”

I must make room here for another of Marjorie’s second-hand
high-morality outbreaks. They give me a sinful delight which I ought
to grieve at, I suppose, but I can’t seem to manage it:

“James Macary is to be transported for murder in the flower of his
youth O passion is a terible thing for it leads people from sin to
sin at last it gets so far as to come to greater crimes than we
thought we could comit and it must be dreadful to leave his native
country and his friends and to be so disgraced and affronted.”

That is Marjorie talking shop, dear little diplomat--to please and
comfort mamma and Isa, no doubt.

This wee little child has a marvelous range of interests. She reads
philosophies, novels, baby books, histories, the mighty poets--reads
them with burning interest, and frankly and freely criticizes them
all; she revels in storms, sunsets, cloud effects, scenery of
mountain, plain, ocean, and forest, and all the other wonders of
nature, and sets down her joy in them all; she loves people, she
detests people, according to mood and circumstances, and delivers
her opinion of them, sometimes seasoned with attar of roses,
sometimes with vitriol; in games, and all kinds of childish play she
is an enthusiast; she adores animals, adores them all; none is too
forlorn to fail of favor in her friendly eyes, no creature so humble
that she cannot find something in it on which to lavish her
caressing worship.

“I am going to-morrow to a delightfull place, Braehead by name,
belonging to Mrs. Crraford [Crauford], where there is ducks cocks
hens bobblyjocks 2 dogs 2 cats and swine which is delightful. I
think it is shocking to think that the dog and cat should bear them
and they are drowned after all.”

She is a dear child, a bewitching little scamp; and never dearer, I
think, than when the devil has had her in possession and she is
breaking her stormy little heart over the remembrance of it:

“I confess I have been very more like a little young divil than a
creature for when Isabella went up stairs to teach me religion and
my multiplication and to be good and all my other lessons I stamped
with my foot and threw my new hat which she had made on the ground
and was sulky and was dreadfully passionate, but she never whiped me
but said Marjory go into another room and think what a great crime
you are committing letting your temper git the better of you. But I
went so sulkily that the devil got the better of me but she never
never never whips me so that I think I would be the better of it &
the next time that I behave ill I think she should do it for she
never does it.... Isabella has given me praise for checking my
temper for I was sulky even when she was kneeling an whole hour
teaching me to write.”

The wise Isabella, the sweet and patient Isabella! It is just a
hundred years now (May, 1909) since the grateful child made that
golden picture of you and laid your good heart bare for distant
generations to see and bless; a hundred years--but if the picture
endures a thousand it will still bring you the blessing, and with it
the reverent homage that is your due. You had the seeing eye and the
wise head. A fool would have punished Marjorie and wrecked her, but
you held your hand, as knowing that when her volcanic fires went
down she would repent, and grieve, and punish herself, and be saved.

Sometimes when Marjorie was miraculously good, she got a penny for
it, and once when she got an entire sixpence, she recognized that it
was wealth. This wealth brought joy to her heart. Why? Because she
could spend it on somebody else! We who know Marjorie would know
that without being told it. I am sorry--often sorry, often
grieved--that I was not there and looking over her shoulder when she
was writing down her valued penny rewards: I would have said, “Save
that scrap of manuscript, dear; make a will, and leave it to your
posterity, to save them from want when penury shall threaten them; a
day will come when it will be worth a thousand guineas, and a later
day will come when it will be worth five thousand; here you are,
rejoicing in copper farthings, and don’t know that your magic pen is
showering gold coin all over the paper.” But I was not there to say
it; those who were there did not think to say it; and so there is
not a line of that quaint precious cacography in existence to-day.

I have adored Marjorie for six-and-thirty years; I have adored her
in detail, I have adored the whole of her; but above all other
details--just a little above all other details--I have adored her
because she detested that odious and confusing and unvanquishable
and unlearnable and shameless invention, the multiplication table:

“I am now going to tell you the horible and wretched plaege [plague]
that my multiplication gives me you can’t conceive it the most
Devilish thing is 8 times 8 & 7 times 7 it is what nature itself
cant endure.”

I stand reverently uncovered in the presence of that holy verdict.

Here is that person again whom I so dislike--and for no reason at
all except that my Marjorie doesn’t like her:

“Miss Potune is very fat she pretends to be very learned she says
she saw a stone that dropt from the skies, but she is a good
christian.”

Of course, stones have fallen from the skies, but I don’t believe
this “horid fat Simpliton” had ever seen one that had done it; but
even if she had, it was none of her business, and she could have
been better employed than in going around exaggerating it and
carrying on about it and trying to make trouble with a little child
that had never done _her_ any harm.

“... The Birds do chirp the Lambs do leap and Nature is clothed with
the garments of green yellow, and white, purple, and red.

“... There is a book that is called the Newgate Calender that
contains all the Murders: all the Murders did I say, nay all Thefts
& Forgeries that ever were committed & fills me with horror &
consternation.”

Marjorie is a diligent little student, and her education is always
storming along and making great time and lots of noise:

“Isabella this morning taught me some French words one of which is
bon suar the interpretation is good morning.”

It slanders Isabella, but the slander is not intentional. The main
thing to notice is that big word, “interpretation.” Not many
children of Marjorie’s age can handle a five syllable team in that
easy and confident way. It is observable that she frequently employs
words of an imposingly formidable size, and is manifestly quite
familiar with them and not at all afraid of them.

“Isa is teaching me to make Simecolings nots of interrigations
periods & commas &c. As this is Sunday I will meditate uppon
senciable & Religious subjects first I should be very thankful I am
not a beggar as many are.”

That was the “first.” She didn’t get to her second subject, but got
side-tracked by a saner interest, and used her time to better
purpose.

“It is melancholy to think, that I have so many talents, & many
there are that have not had the attention paid to them that I have,
& yet they contrive to be better then me.

“... Isabella is far too indulgent to me & even the Miss Crafords
say that they wonder at her patience with me & it is indeed true for
my temper is a bad one.”

The daring child wrote a (synopsized) history of Mary Queen of Scots
and of five of the royal Jameses in rhyme--but never mind, we have
no room to discuss it here. Nothing was entirely beyond her literary
jurisdiction; if it had occurred to her that the laws of Rome needed
codifying she would have taken a chance at it.

Here is a sad note:

“My religion is greatly falling off because I dont pray with so much
attention when I am saying my prayers and my character is lost
a-mong the Breahead people I hope I will be religious again but as
for regaining my character I despare of it.”

When religion and character go, they leave a large vacuum. But there
are ways to fill it:

“I’ve forgot to say, but I’ve four lovers, the other one is Harry
Watson, a very delightful boy.... James Keith hardly ever Spoke to
me, he said Girl! make less noise.... Craky hall ... I walked to
that delightfull place with a delightful young man beloved by all
his friends and espacialy by me his loveress but I must not talk any
longer about him for Isa said it is not proper for to speak of
gentalman but I will never forget him....

“The Scythians tribe live very coarsely for a Gluton Introduced to
Arsaces the Captain of the Army, 1 man who Dressed hair & another
man who was a good cook but Arsaces said that he would keep 1 for
brushing his horses tail and the other to fead his pigs....

“On Saturday I expected no less than three well-made bucks, the
names of whom is here advertised. Mr. Geo. Crakey [Cragie], and Wm.
Keith and Jn Keith--the first is the funniest of every one of them.
Mr. Crakey and I walked to Craky-hall [Craigiehall] hand and hand in
Innocence and matitation sweet thinking on the kind love which flows
in our tender hearted mind which is overflowing with majestic
pleasure no one was ever so polite to me in the hole state of my
existence. Mr. Craky you must know is a great Buck and pretty
good-looking.”

For a purpose, I wish the reader to take careful note of these
statistics:

“I am going to tell you of a melancholy story. A young turkie of 2
or 3 months old, would you believe it, the father broke its leg, &
he killed another! I think he ought to be transported or hanged.”

Marjorie wrote some verses about this tragedy--I think. I cannot be
quite certain it is this one, for in the verses there are three
deaths, whereas these statistics do not furnish so many. Also in the
statistics the father of the deceased is indifferent about the loss
he has sustained, whereas in the verses he is not. Also in the third
verse, the _mother_, too, exhibits feeling, whereas in the two
closing verses of the poem she--at least it seems to be she--is
indifferent. At least it looks like indifference to me, and I
believe it _is_ indifference:

           “Three turkeys fair their last have breathed,
           And now this world forever leaved;
           Their father, and their mother too,
           They sighed and weep as well as you;
           Indeed, the rats their bones have cranched.
           Into eternity theire launched.
           A direful death indeed they had,
           As wad put any parent mad;
           But she was more than usual calm,
           She did not give a single dam.”

The naughty little scamp! I mean, for not leaving out the _l_ in the
word “Calm,” so as to perfect the rhyme. It seems a pity to damage
with a lame rhyme a couplet that is otherwise without a blemish.

Marjorie wrote four journals. She began the first one in January,
1809, when she was just six years old, and finished it five months
later, in June.

She began the second in the following month, and finished it six
months afterward (January, 1810), when she was just seven.

She began the third one in April, 1810, and finished it in the
autumn.

She wrote the fourth in the winter of 1810-11, and the last entry in
it bears date July 19, 1811, and she died exactly five months later,
December 19th, aged eight years and eleven months. It contains her
rhymed Scottish histories.

Let me quote from Dr. John Brown:

“The day before her death, Sunday, she sat up in bed, worn and thin,
her eye gleaming as with the light of a coming world, and with a
tremulous, old voice repeated a long poem by Burns--heavy with the
shadow of death, and lit with the fantasy of the judgment seat--the
publican’s prayer in paraphrase, beginning:

         “‘Why am I loth to leave this earthly scene?
             Have I so found it full of pleasing charms?
         Some drops of joy, with draughts of ill between,
             Some gleams of sunshine ’mid renewing storms.’

“It is more affecting than we care to say to read her mother’s and
Isabella Keith’s letters written immediately after her death. Old
and withered, tattered and pale, they are now; but when you read
them, how quick, how throbbing with life and love! how rich in that
language of affection which only women, and Shakespeare, and Luther
can use--that power of detaining the soul over the beloved object
and its loss.”

Fifty years after Marjorie’s death her sister, writing to Dr. Brown,
said:

“My mother was struck by the patient quietness manifested by
Marjorie during this illness, unlike her ardent, impulsive nature;
but love and poetic feeling were unquenched. When Dr. Johnstone
rewarded her submissiveness with a sixpence, the request speedily
followed that she might get out ere New Year’s Day came. When asked
why she was so desirous of getting out, she immediately rejoined:
‘Oh, I am so anxious to buy something with my sixpence for my dear
Isa Keith.’ Again, when lying very still, her mother asked her if
there was anything she wished: ‘Oh yes, if you would just leave the
room door open a wee bit, and play the _Land o’ the Leal_, and I
will lie and _think_ and enjoy myself’ (this is just as stated to me
by her mother and mine). Well, the happy day came, alike to parents
and child, when Marjorie was allowed to come forth from the nursery
to the parlor. It was Sabbath evening, and after tea. My father, who
idolized this child, and never afterward in my hearing mentioned her
name, took her in his arms; and while walking her up and down the
room she said: ‘Father, I will repeat something to you; what would
you like?’ He said, ‘Just choose for yourself, Maidie.’ She
hesitated for a moment between the paraphrase, ‘Few are thy days and
full of woe,’ and the lines of Burns already quoted, but decided on
the latter; a remarkable choice for a child. The repeating of these
lines seemed to stir up the depths of feeling in her soul. She asked
to be allowed to write a poem. There was a doubt whether it would be
right to allow her, in case of hurting her eyes. She pleaded
earnestly, ‘Just this once’; the point was yielded, her slate was
given her, and with great rapidity she wrote an address of fourteen
lines ‘To my loved cousin on the author’s recovery.’”

The cousin was Isa Keith.

“She went to bed apparently well, awoke in the middle of the night
with the old cry of woe to a mother’s heart, ‘My head, my head!’
Three days of the dire malady, ‘water in the head,’ followed, and
the end came.”

                            ADAM’S SOLILOQUY

  (The spirit of Adam is supposed to be visiting New York City
  inspecting the dinosaur at the Museum of Natural History)

                               (1905)

                                 I

It is strange ... very strange. _I_ do not remember this creature.
(_After gazing long and admiringly._) Well, it is wonderful! The
mere _skeleton_ fifty-seven feet long and sixteen feet high! Thus
far, it seems, they’ve found only this sample--without doubt a
merely medium-sized one; a person could not step out here into the
Park and happen by luck upon the largest horse in America; no, he
would happen upon one that would look small alongside of the biggest
Normandy. It is quite likely that the biggest dinosaur was ninety
feet long and twenty feet high. It would be five times as long as an
elephant; an elephant would be to it what a calf is to an elephant.
The bulk of the creature! The weight of him! As long as the longest
whale, and twice the substance in him! And all good wholesome pork,
most likely; meat enough to last a village a year.... Think of a
hundred of them in line, draped in shining cloth of gold!--a
majestic thing for a coronation procession. But expensive, for he
would eat much; only kings and millionaires could afford him.

I have no recollection of him; neither Eve nor I had heard of him
until yesterday. We spoke to Noah about him; he colored and changed
the subject. Being brought back to it--and pressed a little--he
confessed that in the matter of stocking the Ark the stipulations
had not been carried out with absolute strictness--that is, in minor
details, unessentials. There were some irregularities. He said the
boys were to blame for this--the boys mainly, his own fatherly
indulgence partly. They were in the giddy heyday of their youth at
the time, the happy springtime of life; their hundred years sat upon
them lightly, and--well, he had once been a boy himself, and he had
not the heart to be too exacting with them. And so--well, they did
things they shouldn’t have done, and he--to be candid, he winked.
But on the whole they did pretty faithful work, considering their
age. They collected and stowed a good share of the really useful
animals; and also, when Noah was not watching, a multitude of
useless ones, such as flies, mosquitoes, snakes, and so on, but they
did certainly leave ashore a good many creatures which might
possibly have had value some time or other, in the course of time.
Mainly these were vast saurians a hundred feet long, and monstrous
mammals, such as the megatherium and that sort, and there was really
some excuse for leaving them behind, for two reasons: (1) it was
manifest that some time or other they would be needed as fossils for
museums and (2) there had been a miscalculation, the Ark was smaller
than it should have been, and so there wasn’t room for those
creatures. There was actually fossil material enough all by
itself to freight twenty-five Arks like that one. As for the
dinosaur----But Noah’s conscience was easy; it was not named in his
cargo list and he and the boys were not aware that there was such a
creature. He said he could not blame himself for not knowing about
the dinosaur, because it was an American animal, and America had not
then been discovered.

Noah went on to say, “I did reproach the boys for not making the
most of the room we had, by discarding trashy animals and
substituting beasts like the mastodon, which could be useful to man
in doing heavy work such as the elephant performs, but they said
those great creatures would have increased our labors beyond our
strength, in the matter of feeding and watering them, we being
short-handed. There was something in that. We had no pump; there was
but one window; we had to let down a bucket from that, and haul it
up a good fifty feet, which was very tiresome; then we had to carry
the water downstairs--fifty feet again, in cases where it was for
the elephants and their kind, for we kept them in the hold to serve
for ballast. As it was, we lost many animals--choice animals that
would have been valuable in menageries--different breeds of lions,
tigers, hyenas, wolves, and so on; for they wouldn’t drink the water
after the salt sea water got mixed with the fresh. But we never lost
a locust, nor a grasshopper, nor a weevil, nor a rat, nor a cholera
germ, nor any of that sort of beings. On the whole, I think we did
very well, everything considered. We were shepherds and farmers; we
had never been to sea before; we were ignorant of naval matters, and
I know this for certain, that there is more difference between
agriculture and navigation than a person would think. It is my
opinion that the two trades do not belong together. Shem thinks the
same; so does Japheth. As for what Ham thinks, it is not important.
Ham is biased. You find me a Presbyterian that isn’t, if you think
you can.”

He said it aggressively; it had in it the spirit of a challenge. I
avoided argument by changing the subject. With Noah, arguing is a
passion, a disease, and it is growing upon him; has been growing
upon him for thirty thousand years, and more. It makes him
unpopular, unpleasant; many of his oldest friends dread to meet him.
Even strangers soon get to avoiding him, although at first they are
glad to meet him and gaze at him, on account of his celebrated
adventure. For a time they are proud of his notice, because he is so
distinguished; but he argues them to rags, and before long they
begin to wish, like the rest, that something had happened to the
Ark.

                                 II

(_On the bench in the Park, midafternoon, dreamily noting the drift,
of the human species back and forth._) To think--this multitude is
but a wee little fraction of the earth’s population! And all blood
kin to me, every one! Eve ought to have come with me; this would
excite her affectionate heart. She was never able to keep her
composure when she came upon a relative; she would try to kiss every
one of these people, black and white and all. (_A baby wagon
passes._) How little change one can notice--none at all, in fact. I
remember the first child well----Let me see ... it is three hundred
thousand years ago come Tuesday. This one is just like it. So
between the first one and the last one there is really nothing to
choose. The same insufficiency of hair, the same absence of teeth,
the same feebleness of body and apparent vacancy of mind, the same
general unattractiveness all around. Yet Eve worshiped that early
one, and it was pretty to see her with it. This latest one’s mother
worships _it_; it shows in her eyes--it is the very look that used
to shine in Eve’s. To think that so subtle and intangible a thing as
a _look_ could flit and flash from face to face down a procession
three hundred thousand years long and remain the same, without shade
of change! Yet here it is, lighting this young creature’s face just
as it lighted Eve’s in the long ago--the newest thing I have seen in
the earth, and the oldest. Of course, the dinosaur----But that is in
another class.

She drew the baby wagon to the bench and sat down and began to shove
it softly back and forth with one hand while she held up a newspaper
with the other and absorbed herself in its contents. Presently,
“My!” she exclaimed; which startled me, and I ventured to ask her,
modestly and respectfully, what was the matter. She courteously
passed the paper to me and said--pointing with her finger:

“There--it reads like fact, but I don’t know.”

It was very embarrassing. I tried to look at my ease, and
nonchalantly turned the paper this and that and the other way, but
her eye was upon me and I felt that I was not succeeding. Pretty
soon she asked, hesitatingly:

“Can’t--can’t--you--read?”

I had to confess that I couldn’t. It filled her with wonder. But it
had one pleasant effect--it interested her in me, and I was
thankful, for I was getting lonesome for some one to talk to and
listen to. The young fellow who was showing me around--on his own
motion, I did not invite him--had missed his appointment at the
Museum, and I was feeling disappointed, for he was good company.
When I told the young woman I could not read, she asked me another
embarrassing question:

“Where are you from?”

I skirmished--to gain time and position. I said:

“Make a guess. See how near you can come.”

She brightened, and exclaimed:

“I shall dearly like it, sir, if you don’t mind. If I guess right
will you tell me?”

“Yes.”

“Honor bright?”

“Honor bright? What is that?”

She laughed delightedly and said:

“That’s a good start! I was _sure_ that that phrase would catch you.
I know one thing, now, all right. I know----”

“What do you know?”

“That you are not an American. And you aren’t, _are_ you?”

“No. You are right. I’m not--honor bright, as you say.”

She looked immensely pleased with herself, and said:

“I reckon I’m not always smart, but _that_ was smart, anyway. But
not so _very_, after all, because I already knew--believed I
knew--that you were a foreigner, by another sign.”

“What was that?”

“Your accent.”

She was an accurate observer; I do speak English with a heavenly
accent, and she had detected the foreign twang in it. She ran
charmingly on, most naïvely and engagingly pleased with her triumph:

“The minute you said, ‘See ’ow near you can come to it,’ I said to
myself, ‘Two to one he is a foreigner, and ten to one he’s English.’
Now that _is_ your nationality, _isn’t_ it?”

I was sorry to spoil her victory, but I had to do it: “Ah--you’ll
have to guess again.”

“What--you are not an Englishman?”

“No--honor bright.”

She looked me searchingly over, evidently communing with
herself--adding up my points, then she said:

“Well, you don’t _look_ like an Englishman, and that is true.” After
a little she added, “The fact is, you don’t look like _any_
foreigner--not quite like ... like _anybody_ I’ve seen before. I
will guess some more.”

She guessed every country whose name she could think of and grew
gradually discouraged. Finally she said:

“You must be the Man Without a Country--the one the story tells
about. You don’t seem to have any nationality at all. How did you
come to come to America? Have you any kinfolks here?”

“Yes--several.”

“Oh, then you came to see _them_.”

“Partly--yes.”

She sat awhile, thinking, then:

“Well, I’m not going to give up quite yet. Where do you live when
you are at home--in a city, or in the country?”

“Which do you think?”

“Well, I don’t quite know. You _do_ look a little countrified, if
you don’t mind my saying it; but you look a little citified,
too--not much, but a little, although you can’t read, which is very
curious, and you are not used to newspapers. Now _my_ guess is that
you live mainly in the country when you are at home, and not very
much in the city. Is that right?”

“Yes, quite right.”

“Oh, good! Now I’ll take a fresh start.”

Then she wore herself to the bone, naming cities. No success. Next
she wanted me to help her a little with some “pointers,” as she
phrased it. Was my city large? Yes. Was it very large? Yes. Did they
have mobiles there? No. Electric light? No. Railroads, hospitals,
colleges, cops? No.

“Why, then, it’s not civilized! Where _can_ that place be? Be good
and tell me just one peculiarity of it--then maybe I can guess.”

“Well, then, just one; it has gates of pearl.”

“Oh, go along! That’s the New Jerusalem. It isn’t fair to joke.
Never mind. I’ll guess it yet--it will come into my head pretty
soon, just when I’m not expecting it. Oh, I’ve got an idea! Please
talk a little in your own language--that’ll be a good pointer.” I
accommodated her with a sentence or two. She shook her head
despondently.

“No,” she said, “it doesn’t sound human. I mean, it doesn’t sound
like any of these other foreigners. It’s pretty enough--it’s quite
pretty, I think--but I’m sure I’ve not heard it before. Maybe if you
were to pronounce your name----  What _is_ your name, if you’ll be
so good?”

“Adam.”

“Adam?”

“Yes.”

“But Adam _what_?”

“That is all--just Adam.”

“Nothing at all but just that? Why, how curious! There’s plenty of
Adams; how can they tell you from the rest?”

“Oh, that is no trouble. I’m the only one there is, there where I’m
from.”

“Upon my word! Well, it beats the band! It reminds a person of the
old original. That was his name, too, and he hadn’t any but
that--just like you.” Then, archly, “You’ve heard of him, I
suppose?”

“Oh yes! Do you know him? Have you ever seen him?”

“_Seen_ him? Seen _Adam_? Thanks to goodness, no! It would scare me
into fits.”

“I don’t see why.”

“You don’t?”

“No.”

“_Why_ don’t you see why?”

“Because there is no sense in a person being scared of his kin.”

“_Kin?_”

“Yes. Isn’t he a distant relative of yours?”

She thought it was prodigiously funny, and said it was perfectly
true, but _she_ never would have been bright enough to think of it.
I found it a new and most pleasant sensation to have my wit admired,
and was about to try to do some more when that young fellow came. He
planted himself on the other side of the young woman and began a
vapid remark about the weather, but she gave him a look that
withered him and got stiffly up and wheeled the baby away.




                      BIBLE TEACHING AND RELIGIOUS
                                PRACTICE


Religion had its share in the changes of civilization and national
character, of course. What share? The lion’s. In the history of the
human race this has always been the case, will always be the case,
to the end of time, no doubt; or at least until man by the slow
processes of evolution shall develop into something really fine and
high--some billions of years hence, say.

The Christian’s Bible is a drug store. Its contents remain the same;
but the medical practice changes. For eighteen hundred years these
changes were slight--scarcely noticeable. The practice was
allopathic--allopathic in its rudest and crudest form. The dull and
ignorant physician day and night, and all the days and all the
nights, drenched his patient with vast and hideous doses of the most
repulsive drugs to be found in the store’s stock; he bled him,
cupped him, purged him, puked him, salivated him, never gave his
system a chance to rally, nor nature a chance to help. He kept him
religion sick for eighteen centuries, and allowed him not a well day
during all that time. The stock in the store was made up of about
equal portions of baleful and debilitating poisons, and healing and
comforting medicines; but the practice of the time confined the
physician to the use of the former; by consequence, he could only
damage his patient, and that is what he did.

Not until far within our century was any considerable change in the
practice introduced; and then mainly, or in effect only, in Great
Britain and the United States. In the other countries to-day, the
patient either still takes the ancient treatment or does not call
the physician at all. In the English-speaking countries the changes
observable in our century were forced by that very thing just
referred to--the revolt of the patient against the system; they were
not projected by the physician. The patient fell to doctoring
himself, and the physician’s practice began to fall off. He modified
his method to get back his trade. He did it gradually, reluctantly;
and never yielded more at a time than the pressure compelled. At
first he relinquished the daily dose of hell and damnation, and
administered it every other day only; next he allowed another day to
pass; then another and presently another; when he had restricted it
at last to Sundays, and imagined that now there would surely be a
truce, the homœopath arrived on the field and made him abandon hell
and damnation altogether, and administered Christ’s love, and
comfort, and charity and compassion in its stead. These had been in
the drug store all the time, gold labeled and conspicuous among the
long shelfloads of repulsive purges and vomits and poisons, and so
the practice was to blame that they had remained unused, not the
pharmacy. To the ecclesiastical physician of fifty years ago, his
predecessor for eighteen centuries was a quack; to the
ecclesiastical physician of to-day, his predecessor of fifty years
ago was a quack. To the every-man-his-own-ecclesiastical-doctor
of--when?--what will the ecclesiastical physician of to-day be?
Unless evolution, which has been a truth ever since the globes,
suns, and planets of the solar system were but wandering films of
meteor dust, shall reach a limit and become a lie, there is but one
fate in store for him.

The methods of the priest and the parson have been very curious,
their history is very entertaining. In all the ages the Roman Church
has owned slaves, bought and sold slaves, authorized and encouraged
her children to trade in them. Long after some Christian peoples had
freed their slaves the Church still held on to hers. If any could
know, to absolute certainty, that all this was right, and according
to God’s will and desire, surely it was she, since she was God’s
specially appointed representative in the earth and sole authorized
and infallible expounder of his Bible. There were the texts; there
was no mistaking their meaning; she was right, she was doing in this
thing what the Bible had mapped out for her to do. So unassailable
was her position that in all the centuries she had no word to say
against human slavery. Yet now at last, in our immediate day, we
hear a Pope saying slave trading is wrong, and we see him sending an
expedition to Africa to stop it. The texts remain: it is the
practice that has changed. Why? Because the world has corrected the
Bible. The Church never corrects it; and also never fails to drop in
at the tail of the procession--and take the credit of the
correction. As she will presently do in this instance.

Christian England supported slavery and encouraged it for two
hundred and fifty years, and her Church’s consecrated ministers
looked on, sometimes taking an active hand, the rest of the time
indifferent. England’s interest in the business may be called a
Christian interest, a Christian industry. She had her full share in
its revival after a long period of inactivity, and this revival was
a Christian monopoly; that is to say, it was in the hands of
Christian countries exclusively. English parliaments aided the slave
traffic and protected it; two English kings held stock in
slave-catching companies. The first regular English slave
hunter--John Hawkins, of still revered memory--made such successful
havoc, on his second voyage, in the matter of surprising and burning
villages, and maiming, slaughtering, capturing, and selling their
unoffending inhabitants, that his delighted queen conferred the
chivalric honor of knighthood on him--a rank which had acquired its
chief esteem and distinction in other and earlier fields of
Christian effort. The new knight, with characteristic English
frankness and brusque simplicity, chose as his device the figure of
a negro slave, kneeling and in chains. Sir John’s work was the
invention of Christians, was to remain a bloody and awful monopoly
in the hands of Christians for a quarter of a millennium, was to
destroy homes, separate families, enslave friendless men and women,
and break a myriad of human hearts, to the end that Christian
nations might be prosperous and comfortable, Christian churches be
built, and the gospel of the meek and merciful Redeemer be spread
abroad in the earth; and so in the name of his ship, unsuspected but
eloquent and clear, lay hidden prophecy. She was called _The Jesus_.

But at last in England, an illegitimate Christian rose against
slavery. It is curious that when a Christian rises against a rooted
wrong at all, he is usually an illegitimate Christian, member of
some despised and bastard sect. There was a bitter struggle, but in
the end the slave trade had to go--and went. The Biblical
authorization remained, but the practice changed.

Then--the usual thing happened; the visiting English critic among us
began straightway to hold up his pious hands in horror at our
slavery. His distress was unappeasable, his words full of bitterness
and contempt. It is true we had not so many as fifteen hundred
thousand slaves for him to worry about, while his England still
owned twelve millions, in her foreign possessions; but that fact did
not modify his wail any, or stay his tears, or soften his censure.
The fact that every time we had tried to get rid of our slavery in
previous generations, but had always been obstructed, balked, and
defeated by England, was a matter of no consequence to him; it was
ancient history, and not worth the telling.

Our own conversion came at last. We began to stir against slavery.
Hearts grew soft, here, there, and yonder. There was no place in the
land where the seeker could not find some small budding sign of pity
for the slave. No place in all the land but one--the pulpit. It
yielded at last; it always does. It fought a strong and stubborn
fight, and then did what it always does, joined the procession--at
the tail end. Slavery fell. The slavery text remained; the practice
changed, that was all.

During many ages there were witches. The Bible said so. The Bible
commanded that they should not be allowed to live. Therefore the
Church, after doing its duty in but a lazy and indolent way for
eight hundred years, gathered up its halters, thumb-screws, and
firebrands, and set about its holy work in earnest. She worked hard
at it night and day during nine centuries and imprisoned, tortured,
hanged, and burned whole hordes and armies of witches, and washed
the Christian world clean with their foul blood.

Then it was discovered that there was no such thing as witches, and
never had been. One does not know whether to laugh or to cry. Who
discovered that there was no such thing as a witch--the priest, the
parson? No, these never discover anything. At Salem, the parson
clung pathetically to his witch text after the laity had abandoned
it in remorse and tears for the crimes and cruelties it has
persuaded them to do. The parson wanted more blood, more shame, more
brutalities; it was the unconsecrated laity that stayed his hand. In
Scotland the parson killed the witch after the magistrate had
pronounced her innocent; and when the merciful legislature proposed
to sweep the hideous laws against witches from the statute book, it
was the parson who came imploring, with tears and imprecations, that
they be suffered to stand.

There are no witches. The witch text remains; only the practice has
changed. Hell fire is gone, but the text remains. Infant damnation
is gone, but the text remains. More than two hundred death penalties
are gone from the law books, but the texts that authorized them
remain.

Is it not well worthy of note that of all the multitude of texts
through which man has driven his annihilating pen he has never once
made the mistake of obliterating a good and useful one? It does
certainly seem to suggest that if man continues in the direction of
enlightenment, his religious practice may, in the end, attain some
semblance of human decency.




                             THE WAR PRAYER
                           (Dictated 1904-05)


It was a time of great and exalting excitement. The country was up
in arms, the war was on, in every breast burned the holy fire of
patriotism; the drums were beating, the bands playing, the toy
pistols popping, the bunched firecrackers hissing and spluttering;
on every hand and far down the receding and fading spread of roofs
and balconies a fluttering wilderness of flags flashed in the sun;
daily the young volunteers marched down the wide avenue gay and fine
in their new uniforms, the proud fathers and mothers and sisters and
sweethearts cheering them with voices choked with happy emotion as
they swung by; nightly the packed mass meetings listened, panting,
to patriot oratory which stirred the deepest deeps of their hearts,
and which they interrupted at briefest intervals with cyclones of
applause, the tears running down their cheeks the while; in the
churches the pastors preached devotion to flag and country, and
invoked the God of Battles, beseeching His aid in our good cause in
outpouring of fervid eloquence which moved every listener. It was
indeed a glad and gracious time, and the half dozen rash spirits
that ventured to disapprove of the war and cast a doubt upon its
righteousness straightway got such a stern and angry warning that
for their personal safety’s sake they quickly shrank out of sight
and offended no more in that way.

Sunday morning came--next day the battalions would leave for the
front; the church was filled; the volunteers were there, their young
faces alight with martial dreams--visions of the stern advance, the
gathering momentum, the rushing charge, the flashing sabers, the
flight of the foe, the tumult, the enveloping smoke, the fierce
pursuit, the surrender!--them home from the war, bronzed heroes,
welcomed, adored, submerged in golden seas of glory! With the
volunteers sat their dear ones, proud, happy, and envied by the
neighbors and friends who had no sons and brothers to send forth to
the field of honor, there to win for the flag, or, failing, die the
noblest of noble deaths. The service proceeded; a war chapter from
the Old Testament was read; the first prayer was said; it was
followed by an organ burst that shook the building, and with one
impulse the house rose, with glowing eyes and beating hearts, and
poured out that tremendous invocation--

           “God the all-terrible! Thou who ordainest,
           Thunder thy clarion and lightning thy sword!”

Then came the “long” prayer. None could remember the like of it for
passionate pleading and moving and beautiful language. The burden of
its supplication was, that an ever-merciful and benignant Father of
us all would watch over our noble young soldiers, and aid, comfort,
and encourage them in their patriotic work; bless them, shield them
in the day of battle and the hour of peril, bear them in His mighty
hand, make them strong and confident, invincible in the bloody
onset; help them to crush the foe, grant to them and to their flag
and country imperishable honor and glory--

An aged stranger entered and moved with slow and noiseless step up
the main aisle, his eyes fixed upon the minister, his long body
clothed in a robe that reached to his feet, his head bare, his white
hair descending in a frothy cataract to his shoulders, his seamy
face unnaturally pale, pale even to ghastliness. With all eyes
following him and wondering, he made his silent way; without
pausing, he ascended to the preacher’s side and stood there,
waiting. With shut lids the preacher, unconscious of his presence,
continued his moving prayer, and at last finished it with the words,
uttered in fervent appeal, “Bless our arms, grant us the victory, O
Lord our God, Father and Protector of our land and flag!”

The stranger touched his arm, motioned him to step aside--which the
startled minister did--and took his place. During some moments he
surveyed the spellbound audience with solemn eyes, in which burned
an uncanny light; then in a deep voice he said:

“I come from the Throne--bearing a message from Almighty God!” The
words smote the house with a shock; if the stranger perceived it he
gave no attention. “He has heard the prayer of His servant your
shepherd, and will grant it if such shall be your desire after I,
His messenger, shall have explained to you its import--that is to
say, its full import. For it is like unto many of the prayers of
men, in that it asks for more than he who utters it is aware
of--except he pause and think.

“God’s servant and yours has prayed his prayer. Has he paused and
taken thought? Is it one prayer? No, it is two--one uttered, the
other not. Both have reached the ear of Him Who heareth all
supplications, the spoken and the unspoken. Ponder this--keep it in
mind. If you would beseech a blessing upon yourself, beware! lest
without intent you invoke a curse upon a neighbor at the same time.
If you pray for the blessing of rain upon your crop which needs it,
by that act you are possibly praying for a curse upon some
neighbor’s crop which may not need rain and can be injured by it.

“You have heard your servant’s prayer--the uttered part of it. I am
commissioned of God to put into words the other part of it--that
part which the pastor--and also you in your hearts--fervently prayed
silently. And ignorantly and unthinkingly? God grant that it was so!
You heard these words: ‘Grant us the victory, O Lord our God!’ That
is sufficient. The _whole_ of the uttered prayer is compact into
those pregnant words. Elaborations were not necessary. When you have
prayed for victory you have prayed for many unmentioned results
which follow victory--_must_ follow it, cannot help but follow it.
Upon the listening spirit of God the Father fell also the unspoken
part of the prayer. He commandeth me to put it into words. Listen!

“O Lord our Father, our young patriots, idols of our hearts, go
forth to battle--be Thou near them! With them--in spirit--we also go
forth from the sweet peace of our beloved firesides to smite the
foe. O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds
with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale
forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the
guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to
lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to
wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief;
help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to
wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and
hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames of summer and the icy
winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee
for the refuge of the grave and denied it--for our sakes who adore
Thee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their
bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way with
their tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded
feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source of
Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that are
sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen.”

(_After a pause._) “Ye have prayed it; if ye still desire it, speak!
The messenger of the Most High waits.”

It was believed afterward that the man was a lunatic, because there
was no sense in what he said.




                           CORN-PONE OPINIONS
                           (Written in 1900)


Fifty years ago, when I was a boy of fifteen and helping to inhabit
a Missourian village on the banks of the Mississippi, I had a friend
whose society was very dear to me because I was forbidden by my
mother to partake of it. He was a gay and impudent and satirical and
delightful young black man--a slave--who daily preached sermons from
the top of his master’s woodpile, with me for sole audience. He
imitated the pulpit style of the several clergymen of the village,
and did it well, and with fine passion and energy. To me he was a
wonder. I believed he was the greatest orator in the United States
and would some day be heard from. But it did not happen; in the
distribution of rewards he was overlooked. It is the way, in this
world.

He interrupted his preaching, now and then, to saw a stick of wood;
but the sawing was a pretense--he did it with his mouth; exactly
imitating the sound the bucksaw makes in shrieking its way through
the wood. But it served its purpose; it kept his master from coming
out to see how the work was getting along. I listened to the sermons
from the open window of a lumber room at the back of the house. One
of his texts was this:

“You tell me whar a man gits his corn pone, en I’ll tell you what
his ’pinions is.“

I can never forget it. It was deeply impressed upon me. By my
mother. Not upon my memory, but elsewhere. She had slipped in upon
me while I was absorbed and not watching. The black philosopher’s
idea was that a man is not independent, and cannot afford views
which might interfere with his bread and butter. If he would
prosper, he must train with the majority; in matters of large
moment, like politics and religion, he must think and feel with the
bulk of his neighbors, or suffer damage in his social standing and
in his business prosperities. He must restrict himself to corn-pone
opinions--at least on the surface. He must get his opinions from
other people; he must reason out none for himself; he must have no
first-hand views.

I think Jerry was right, in the main, but I think he did not go far
enough.

1. It was his idea that a man conforms to the majority view of his
locality by calculation and intention.

This happens, but I think it is not the rule.

2. It was his idea that there is such a thing as a first-hand
opinion; an original opinion; an opinion which is coldly reasoned
out in a man’s head, by a searching analysis of the facts involved,
with the heart unconsulted, and the jury room closed against outside
influences. It may be that such an opinion has been born somewhere,
at some time or other, but I suppose it got away before they could
catch it and stuff it and put it in the museum.

I am persuaded that a coldly-thought-out and independent verdict
upon a fashion in clothes, or manners, or literature, or politics,
or religion, or any other matter that is projected into the field of
our notice and interest, is a most rare thing--if it has indeed ever
existed.

A new thing in costume appears--the flaring hoopskirt, for
example--and the passers-by are shocked, and the irreverent laugh.
Six months later everybody is reconciled; the fashion has
established itself; it is admired, now, and no one laughs. Public
opinion resented it before, public opinion accepts it now, and is
happy in it. Why? Was the resentment reasoned out? Was the
acceptance reasoned out? No. The instinct that moves to conformity
did the work. It is our nature to conform; it is a force which not
many can successfully resist. What is its seat? The inborn
requirement of self-approval. We all have to bow to that; there are
no exceptions. Even the woman who refuses from first to last to wear
the hoopskirt comes under that law and is its slave; she could not
wear the skirt and have her own approval; and that she _must_ have,
she cannot help herself. But as a rule our self-approval has its
source in but one place and not elsewhere--the approval of other
people. A person of vast consequences can introduce any kind of
novelty in dress and the general world will presently adopt
it--moved to do it, in the first place, by the natural instinct to
passively yield to that vague something recognized as authority, and
in the second place by the human instinct to train with the
multitude and have its approval. An empress introduced the
hoopskirt, and we know the result. A nobody introduced the bloomer,
and we know the result. If Eve should come again, in her ripe
renown, and reintroduce her quaint styles--well, we know what would
happen. And we should be cruelly embarrassed, along at first.

The hoopskirt runs its course and disappears. Nobody reasons about
it. One woman abandons the fashion; her neighbor notices this and
follows her lead; this influences the next woman; and so on and so
on, and presently the skirt has vanished out of the world, no one
knows how nor why; nor cares, for that matter. It will come again,
by and by; and in due course will go again.

Twenty-five years ago, in England, six or eight wine glasses stood
grouped by each person’s plate at a dinner party, and they were
used, not left idle and empty; to-day there are but three or four in
the group, and the average guest sparingly uses about two of them.
We have not adopted this new fashion yet, but we shall do it
presently. We shall not think it out; we shall merely conform, and
let it go at that. We get our notions and habits and opinions from
outside influences; we do not have to study them out.

Our table manners, and company manners, and street manners change
from time to time, but the changes are not reasoned out; we merely
notice and conform. We are creatures of outside influences; as a
rule we do not think, we only imitate. We cannot invent standards
that will stick; what we mistake for standards are only fashions,
and perishable. We may continue to admire them, but we drop the use
of them. We notice this in literature. Shakespeare is a standard,
and fifty years ago we used to write tragedies which we couldn’t
tell from--from somebody else’s; but we don’t do it any more, now.
Our prose standard, three quarters of a century ago, was ornate and
diffuse; some authority or other changed it in the direction of
compactness and simplicity, and conformity followed, without
argument. The historical novel starts up suddenly, and sweeps the
land. Everybody writes one, and the nation is glad. We had
historical novels before; but nobody read them, and the rest of us
conformed--without reasoning it out. We are conforming in the other
way, now, because it is another case of everybody.

The outside influences are always pouring in upon us, and we are
always obeying their orders and accepting their verdicts. The Smiths
like the new play; the Joneses go to see it, and they copy the Smith
verdict. Morals, religions, politics, get their following from
surrounding influences and atmospheres, almost entirely; not from
study, not from thinking. A man must and will have his own approval
first of all, in each and every moment and circumstance of his
life--even if he must repent of a self-approved act the moment after
its commission, in order to get his self-approval _again_: but,
speaking in general terms, a man’s self-approval in the large
concerns of life has its source in the approval of the peoples about
him, and not in a searching personal examination of the matter.
Mohammedans are Mohammedans because they are born and reared among
that sect, not because they have thought it out and can furnish
sound reasons for being Mohammedans; we know why Catholics are
Catholics; why Presbyterians are Presbyterians; why Baptists are
Baptists; why Mormons are Mormons; why thieves are thieves; why
monarchists are monarchists; why Republicans are Republicans and
Democrats, Democrats. We know it is a matter of association and
sympathy, not reasoning and examination; that hardly a man in the
world has an opinion upon morals, politics, or religion which he got
otherwise than through his associations and sympathies. Broadly
speaking, there are none but corn-pone opinions. And broadly
speaking, corn-pone stands for self-approval. Self-approval is
acquired mainly from the approval of other people. The result is
conformity. Sometimes conformity has a sordid business interest--the
bread-and-butter interest--but not in most cases, I think. I think
that in the majority of cases it is unconscious and not calculated;
that it is born of the human being’s natural yearning to stand well
with his fellows and have their inspiring approval and praise--a
yearning which is commonly so strong and so insistent that it cannot
be effectually resisted, and must have its way.

A political emergency brings out the corn-pone opinion in fine force
in its two chief varieties--the pocketbook variety, which has its
origin in self-interest, and the bigger variety, the sentimental
variety--the one which can’t bear to be outside the pale; can’t bear
to be in disfavor; can’t endure the averted face and the cold
shoulder; wants to stand well with his friends, wants to be smiled
upon, wants to be welcome, wants to hear the precious words, “_He’s_
on the right track!” Uttered, perhaps by an ass, but still an ass of
high degree, an ass whose approval is gold and diamonds to a smaller
ass, and confers glory and honor and happiness, and membership in
the herd. For these gauds many a man will dump his life-long
principles into the street, and his conscience along with them. We
have seen it happen. In some millions of instances.

Men think they think upon great political questions, and they do;
but they think with their party, not independently; they read its
literature, but not that of the other side; they arrive at
convictions, but they are drawn from a partial view of the matter in
hand and are of no particular value. They swarm with their party,
they feel with their party, they are happy in their party’s
approval; and where the party leads they will follow, whether for
right and honor, or through blood and dirt and a mush of mutilated
morals.

In our late canvass half of the nation passionately believed that in
silver lay salvation, the other half as passionately believed that
that way lay destruction. Do you believe that a tenth part of the
people, on either side, had any rational excuse for having an
opinion about the matter at all? I studied that mighty question to
the bottom--came out empty. Half of our people passionately believe
in high tariff, the other half believe otherwise. Does this mean
study and examination, or only feeling? The latter, I think. I have
deeply studied that question, too--and didn’t arrive. We all do no
end of feeling, and we mistake it for thinking. And out of it we get
an aggregation which we consider a boon. Its name is Public Opinion.
It is held in reverence. It settles everything. Some think it the
Voice of God.

                              THE END

                                FOREWORD


Beginning his preface to the “Uniform Edition” of his works, Mark Twain
wrote:

“So far as I remember, I have never seen an Author’s Preface which had
any purpose but one—to furnish reasons for the publication of the book.
Prefaces wear many disguises, call themselves by various names, and
pretend to come on various businesses, but I think that upon examination
we are quite sure to find that their errand is always the same: they are
there to apologize for the book; in other words, furnish reasons for its
publication. This often insures brevity.”

Accepting the above as gospel (as necessarily we must, in this book,)
one is only required here to furnish a few more or less plausible
excuses for its existence. Very well, then, we can think of two:

First: To prove to those who have read Mark Twain sparingly, or know him
mainly from hearsay, that he was something more than a mere fun-maker.

Second: To provide for those who have read largely of his work something
of its essence, as it were—put up in a form which may be found
convenient when one has not time, or inclination, to search the volumes.

These are the excuses—now, an added word as to method: The examples have
been arranged chronologically, so that the reader, following them in
order, may note the author’s evolution—the development of his humor, his
observation, his philosophy and his literary style. They have been
selected with some care, in the hope that those who know the author best
may consider him fairly represented.

Feeling now that this little volume is sufficiently explained, the
compiler begs to offer it, without further extenuation, to all who do
honor to the memory of our foremost laughing philosopher.

                _FROM_ “SKETCHES NEW AND OLD” (1865–67)


                       ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS

“Moral Statistician.”—I don’t want any of your statistics; I took your
whole batch and lit my pipe with it. I hate your kind of people. You are
always ciphering out how much a man’s health is injured, and how much
his intellect is impaired, and how many pitiful dollars and cents he
wastes in the course of ninety-two years’ indulgence in the fatal
practice of smoking; and in the equally fatal practice of drinking
coffee; and in playing billiards occasionally; and in taking a glass of
wine at dinner, etc., etc., etc. And you are always figuring out how
many women have been burned to death because of the dangerous fashion of
wearing expansive hoops, etc., etc., etc. You never see more than one
side of the question. You are blind to the fact that most old men in
America smoke, and drink coffee, although, according to your theory,
they ought to have died young; and that hearty old Englishmen drink wine
and survive it, and portly old Dutchmen both drink and smoke freely, and
yet grow older and fatter all the time. And you never try to find out
how much solid comfort, relaxation, and enjoyment a man derives from
smoking in the course of a lifetime (which is worth ten times the money
he would save by letting it alone), nor the appalling aggregate of
happiness lost in a lifetime by your kind of people from _not_ smoking.
Of course you can save money by denying yourself all those little
vicious enjoyments for fifty years; but then what can you do with it?
What use can you put it to? Money can’t save your infinitesimal soul.
All the use that money can be put to is to purchase comfort and
enjoyment in this life; therefore, as you are an enemy to comfort and
enjoyment, where is the use of accumulating cash? It won’t do for you to
say that you can use it to better purpose in furnishing a good table,
and in charities, and in supporting tract societies, because you know
yourself that you people who have no petty vices are never known to give
away a cent, and that you stint yourselves so in the matter of food that
you are always feeble and hungry. And you never dare to laugh in the
daytime for fear some poor wretch, seeing you in a good humor, will try
to borrow a dollar of you; and in church you are always down on your
knees, with your eyes buried in the cushion, when the contribution box
comes around; and you never give the revenue officers a full statement
of your income. Now you know all these things yourself, don’t you? Very
well, then, what is the use of your stringing out your miserable lives
to a lean and withered old age? What is the use of your saving money
that is so utterly worthless to you? In a word, why don’t you go off
somewhere and die, and not be always trying to seduce people into
becoming as “ornery” and unloveable as you are yourselves, by your
villainous “moral statistics”? Now I don’t approve of dissipation, and I
don’t indulge in it, either; but I haven’t a particle of confidence in a
man who has no redeeming petty vices, and so I don’t want to hear from
you any more. I think you are the very same man who read me a long
lecture last week about the degrading vice of smoking cigars, and then
came back, in my absence, with your reprehensible fireproof gloves on,
and carried off my beautiful parlor stove.

“Young Author.”—Yes, Agassiz _does_ recommend authors to eat fish,
because the phosphorus in it makes brain. So far you are correct. But I
cannot help you to a decision about the amount you need to eat—at least,
not with certainty. If the specimen composition you send is about your
fair usual average, I should judge that perhaps a couple of whales would
be all you would want for the present. Not the largest kind, but simply
good, middling-sized whales.


                   HOW I EDITED AN AGRICULTURAL PAPER

In about half an hour an old gentleman, with a flowing beard and a fine
but rather austere face, entered, and sat down at my invitation. He
seemed to have something on his mind. He took off his hat and set it on
the floor, and got out of it a red silk handkerchief and a copy of our
paper.

He put the paper on his lap, and while he polished his spectacles with
his handkerchief, he said, “Are you the new editor?”

I said I was.

“Have you ever edited an agricultural paper before?”

“No,” I said; “this is my first attempt.”

“Very likely. Have you had any experience in agriculture, practically?”

“No; I believe I have not.”

“Some instinct told me,” said the old gentleman, putting on his
spectacles and looking over them at me with asperity, while he folded
his paper into a convenient shape. “I wish to read you what must have
made me have that instinct. It was this editorial. Listen, and see if it
was you that wrote it:

“Turnips should never be pulled, it injures them. It is much better to
send a boy up and let him shake the tree.”

“Now, what do you think of that?—for I really suppose you wrote it?”

“Think of it? Why, I think it is good. I think it is sense. I have no
doubt that every year millions and millions of bushels of turnips are
spoiled in this township alone by being pulled in a half-ripe condition,
when, if they had sent a boy up to shake the tree——”

“Shake your grandmother! Turnips don’t grow on trees!”

“Oh, they don’t don’t they? Well, who said they did? The language was
intended to be figurative, wholly figurative. Anybody that knows
anything will know that I meant that the boy should shake the vine.”

Then this old person got up and tore his paper all into small shreds,
and stamped on them, and broke several things with his cane, and said I
did not know as much as a cow; and then went out and banged the door
after him, and, in short, acted in such a way that I fancied he was
displeased about something. But not knowing what the trouble was, I
could not be any help to him.




                _FROM_ “THE INNOCENTS ABROAD” (1867–68)


                          ON KEEPING A JOURNAL

At certain periods it becomes the dearest ambition of a man to keep a
faithful record of his performances, in a book; and he dashes at his
work with an enthusiasm that imposes on him the notion that keeping a
journal is the veriest pastime in the world, and the pleasantest. But if
he only lives twenty-one days, he will find out that only those rare
natures that are made up of pluck, endurance, devotion to duty for
duty’s sake, and invincible determination, may hope to venture upon so
tremendous an enterprise as the keeping of a journal and not sustain a
shameful defeat.... If you wish to inflict a heartless and malignant
punishment upon a young person, pledge him to keep a journal a year.


                      THE “QUAKER CITY” IN A STORM

And the last night of the seven was the stormiest of all. There was no
thunder, no noise but the pounding bows of the ship, the keen whistling
of the gale through the cordage, and the rush of the seething waters.
But the vessel climbed aloft as if she would climb to heaven—then paused
an instant that seemed a century, and plunged headlong down again, as
from a precipice. The sheeted sprays drenched the decks like rain. The
blackness of darkness was everywhere. At long intervals a flash of
lightning clove it with a quivering line of fire, that revealed a
heaving world of water where was nothing before, kindled the dusky
cordage to glittering silver, and lit up the faces of the men with a
ghastly lustre!

Fear drove many on deck that were used to avoiding the night winds and
the spray. Some thought the vessel could not live through the night, and
it seemed less dreadful to stand out in the midst of the wild tempest
and _see_ the peril that threatened than to be shut up in the sepulchral
cabins, under the dim lamps, and imagine the horrors that were abroad on
the ocean. And once out—once where they could see the ship struggling in
the strong grasp of the storm—once where they could hear the shriek of
the winds, and face the driving spray and look out upon the majestic
picture the lightnings disclosed, they were prisoners to a fierce
fascination they could not resist, and so remained. It was a wild
night—and a very, very long one.


                         THE BEAUTIFUL STRANGER

While we stood admiring the cloud-capped peaks and the lowlands robed in
misty gloom, a finer picture burst upon us and chained every eye like a
magnet—a stately ship, with canvas piled on canvas till she was one
towering mass of bellying sail. She came speeding over the sea like a
great bird. Africa and Spain were forgotten. All homage was for the
beautiful stranger. While everybody gazed, she swept superbly by and
flung the Stars and Stripes to the breeze! Quicker than thought hats and
handkerchiefs flashed in the air, and a cheer went up! She was beautiful
before—she was radiant now. Many a one on her decks knew then for the
first time how tame a sight his country’s flag is at home compared with
what it is in a foreign land. To see it is to see a vision of home
itself and all its idols, and feel a thrill that would stir a very river
of sluggish blood!


                                TANGIER

What a funny old town it is! It seems like profanation to laugh and jest
and bandy the frivolous chat of our day amid its hoary relics. Only the
stately phraseology and the measured speech of the sons of the Prophet
are suited to a venerable antiquity like this. Here is a crumbling wall
that was old when Columbus discovered America; was old when Peter the
Hermit roused the knightly men of the Middle Ages to arm for the first
Crusade; was old when Charlemagne and his paladins beleaguered enchanted
castles and battled with giants and genii in the fabled days of the
olden time; was old when Christ and his disciples walked the earth;
stood where it stands to-day when the lips of Memnon were vocal, and men
bought and sold in the streets of ancient Thebes!


                           AMERICAN BEAUTIES

I will conclude this chapter with a remark that I am sincerely proud to
be able to make—and glad, as well, that my comrades cordially indorse
it, to wit: by far the handsomest women we have seen in France were born
and reared in America.

I feel, now, like a man who has redeemed a failing reputation and shed
luster upon a dimmed escutcheon, by a single just deed done at the
eleventh hour.

Let the curtain fall, to slow music.


                            AN EARLY MEMORY

It is hard to forget repulsive things. I remember yet how I ran off from
school once when I was a boy, and then, pretty late at night, concluded
to climb into the window of my father’s office and sleep on a lounge,
because I had a delicacy about going home and getting thrashed. As I lay
on the lounge and my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, I fancied I
could see a long, dusky, shapeless thing stretched upon the floor. A
cold shiver went through me. I turned my face to the wall. That did not
answer. I was afraid that the thing would creep over and seize me in the
dark. I turned back and stared at it for minutes and minutes—they seemed
hours. It appeared to me that the lagging moonlight never, never would
get to it. I turned to the wall and counted twenty, to pass the feverish
time away. I looked—the pale square was nearer. I turned again and
counted fifty—it was almost touching it. With desperate will I turned
again and counted one hundred, and faced about, all in a tremble. A
white human hand lay in the moonlight! Such an awful sinking at the
heart—such a sudden gasp for breath. I felt—I cannot tell _what_ I felt.
When I recovered strength enough, I faced the wall again. But no boy
could have remained so, with that mysterious hand behind him. I counted
again, and looked—the most of a naked arm was exposed. I put my hands
over my eyes and counted until I could stand it no longer, and then—the
pallid face of a man was there, with the corners of the mouth drawn
down, and the eyes fixed and glassy in death! I raised to a sitting
posture and glowered on the corpse till the light crept down the bare
breast,—line by line—inch by inch—past the nipple,—and then it disclosed
a ghastly stab!

I went away from there. I do not say that I went away in any sort of a
hurry, but I simply went——that is sufficient. I went out at the window,
and I carried the sash along with me. I did not need the sash, but it
was handier to take it than it was to leave it, and so I took it. I was
not scared, but I was considerably agitated.

When I reached home, they whipped me, but I enjoyed it. It seemed
perfectly delightful. That man had been stabbed near the office that
afternoon, and they carried him in there to doctor him, but he only
lived an hour. I have slept in the same room with him often, since
then—in my dreams.


                        AT THE AMBROSIAN LIBRARY

We saw a manuscript of Virgil, with annotations in the handwriting of
Petrarch, the gentleman who loved another man’s Laura, and lavished upon
her all through life a love which was a clear waste of the raw material.
It was sound sentiment, but bad judgment. It brought both parties fame,
and created a fountain of commiseration for them in sentimental breasts
that is running yet. But who says a word in behalf of poor Mr. Laura? (I
do not know his other name.) Who glorifies him? Who bedews him with
tears? Who writes poetry about him? Nobody. How do you suppose _he_
liked the state of things that has given the world so much pleasure?...
Let the world go on fretting about Laura and Petrarch if it will; but as
for me, my tears and my lamentations shall be lavished upon the unsung
defendant.

We saw also an autograph letter of Lucrezia Borgia, a lady for whom I
have always entertained the highest respect, on account of her rare
histrionic capabilities, her opulence in solid gold goblets made of
gilded wood, her high distinction as an operatic screamer, and the
facility with which she could order a sextuple funeral and get the
corpses ready for it. We saw one single coarse yellow hair from
Lucrezia’s head, likewise. It awoke emotions, but we still live. In this
same library we saw some drawings by Michael Angelo (these Italians call
him Mickel Angelo), and Leonardo da Vinci. (They spell it Vinci and
pronounce it Vinchy; foreigners always spell better than they
pronounce.) We reserve our opinion of these sketches.


                           OUR NEED OF REPOSE

Just in this one matter lies the main charm of life in Europe—comfort.
In America, we hurry—which is well; but when the day’s work is done, we
go on thinking of losses and gains, we plan for the morrow, we even
carry our business cares to bed with us, and toss and worry over them
when we ought to be restoring our racked bodies and brains with sleep.
We burn up our energies with these excitements, and either die early or
drop into a lean and mean old age at a time of life which they call a
man’s prime in Europe. When an acre of ground has produced long and
well, we let it lie fallow and rest for a season; we take no man clear
across the continent in the same coach he started in—the coach is
stabled somewhere on the plains and its heated machinery allowed to cool
for a few days; when a razor has seen long service and refuses to hold
an edge, the barber lays it away for a few weeks, and the edge comes
back of its own accord. We bestow thoughtful care upon inanimate
objects, but none upon ourselves. What a robust people, what a nation of
thinkers we might be, if we would only lay ourselves on the shelf
occasionally, and renew our edges!

I do envy these Europeans the comfort they take. When the work of the
day is done, they forget it.


                                 VENICE

It was a long, long ride. But toward evening, as we sat silent and
hardly conscious of where we were—subdued into that meditative calm that
comes so surely after a conversational storm—some one shouted:

“VENICE!”

And sure enough, afloat on the placid sea a league away, lay a great
city with its towers and domes and steeples drowsing in a golden midst
of sunset.

The venerable Mother of the Republics is scarce a fit subject for
flippant speech or the idle gossiping of tourists. It seems a sort of
sacrilege to disturb the glamour of old romance that pictures her to us
softly from afar off as through a tinted mist, and curtains her ruin and
her desolation from our view. One ought, indeed, to turn away from her
rags, her poverty, and her humiliation, and think of her only as she was
when she sunk the fleets of Charlemagne; when she humbled Frederick
Barbarossa or waved her victorious banners above the battlements of
Constantinople.

There was music everywhere—choruses, string bands, brass bands, flutes,
everything. I was so surrounded, walled in with music, magnificence, and
loveliness, that I became inspired with the spirit of the scene, and
sang one tune myself. However, when I observed that the other gondolas
had sailed away, and my gondolier was preparing to go overboard, I
stopped.

In the glare of the day, there is little poetry about Venice, but under
the charitable moon her stained palaces are white again, their battered
sculptures are hidden in shadows, and the old city seems crowned once
more with the grandeur that was hers five hundred years ago. It is easy,
then, in fancy, to people these silent canals with plumed gallants and
fair ladies—with Shylocks in gaberdine and sandals, venturing loans upon
the rich argosies of Venetian commerce—with Othellos and Desdemonas,
with Iagos and Roderigos—with noble fleets and victorious legions
returning from the wars. In the treacherous sunlight we see Venice
decayed, forlorn, poverty-stricken, and commerceless—forgotten and
utterly insignificant. But in the moonlight, her fourteen centuries of
greatness fling their glories about her, and once more is she the
princeliest among the nations of the earth.

Yes, I think we have seen all Venice. We have seen in these old churches
a profusion of costly and elaborate sepulchre ornamentation such as we
never dreamt of before. We have stood in the dim religious light of
these hoary sanctuaries, in the midst of long ranks of dusty monuments
and effigies of the great dead of Venice, until we seemed drifting back,
back, back, into the solemn past, and looking upon the scenes and
mingling with the people of a remote antiquity. We have been in a
half-waking sort of a dream all the time. I do not know how else to
describe the feeling. A part of our being has remained still in the
nineteenth century, while another part of it has seemed in some
unaccountable way walking among the phantoms of the tenth.

We have seen famous pictures until our eyes are weary with looking at
them and refuse to find interest in them any longer.... We have striven
hard to learn. We have had some success. We have mastered some things,
possibly of trifling import in the eyes of the learned, but to us they
give pleasure, and we take as much pride in our little acquirements as
do others who have learned far more, and we love to display them full as
well. When we see a monk going about with a lion and looking tranquilly
up to heaven, we know that that is St. Mark. When we see a monk with a
book and a pen, looking tranquilly up to heaven, trying to think of a
word, we know that that is St. Matthew. When we see a monk sitting on a
rock, looking tranquilly up to heaven, with a human skull beside him,
and without other baggage, we know that that is St. Jerome. Because we
know that he always went flying light in the matter of baggage. When we
see a party looking tranquilly up to heaven, unconscious that his body
is shot through and through with arrows, we know that that is St.
Sebastian. When we see other monks looking tranquilly up to heaven, but
having no trademark, we always ask who those parties are. We do this
because we humbly wish to learn....

And so, having satisfied ourselves, we depart to-morrow, and leave the
venerable Queen of the Republics to summon her vanished ships, and
marshal her shadowy armies, and know again in dreams the pride of her
old renown.


                                AT PISA

The Baptistery, which is a few years older than the Leaning Tower, is a
stately rotunda of huge dimensions, and was a costly structure. In it
hangs the lamp whose measured swing suggested to Galileo the pendulum.
It looked an insignificant thing to have conferred upon the world of
science and mechanics such a mighty extension of their dominions as it
has. Pondering, in its suggestive presence, I seemed to see a crazy
universe of swinging disks, the toiling children of this sedate parent.
He appeared to have an intelligent expression about him of knowing that
he was not a lamp at all; that he was a Pendulum; a pendulum disguised,
for prodigious and inscrutable purposes of his own deep devising, and
not a common pendulum either, but the old original patriarchal
Pendulum—the Abraham Pendulum of the world.


                          CHRISTIAN PERSUASION

How times have changed, between the older ages and the new! Some
seventeen or eighteen centuries ago, the ignorant men of Rome were wont
to put Christians in the arena of the Coliseum yonder, and turn the wild
beasts in upon them, for show. It was for a lesson as well. It was to
teach the people to abhor and fear the new doctrine the followers of
Christ were teaching. The beasts tore the victims limb from limb and
made poor mangled corpses of them in the twinkling of an eye. But when
the Christians came into power, when the holy Mother Church became
mistress of the barbarians, she taught them the error of their ways by
no such means. No, she put them in this pleasant Inquisition and pointed
to the Blessed Redeemer, who was so gentle and so merciful toward all
men, and they urged the barbarians to love him; and they did all they
could to persuade them to love and honor him—first by twisting their
thumbs out of joint with a screw; then by nipping their flesh with
pincers—red-hot ones, because they are the most comfortable in cold
weather; then by skinning them alive a little, and finally by roasting
them in public. They always convinced those barbarians. The true
religion, properly administered, as the good Mother Church used to
administer it, is very, very soothing. It is wonderfully persuasive
also. There is a great difference between feeding parties to wild beasts
and stirring up their finer feelings in an Inquisition. One is the
system of degraded barbarians, the other of enlightened civilized
people. It is a great pity the playful Inquisition is no more.


                      TAKING IT OUT OF THE GUIDES

I never felt so fervently thankful, so soothed, so tranquil, so filled
with a blessed peace, as I did yesterday when I learned that Michael
Angelo was dead.

But we have taken it out of this guide. He has marched us through miles
of pictures and sculpture in the vast corridors of the Vatican; and
through miles of pictures and sculpture in twenty other palaces; he has
shown us the great picture in the Sistine Chapel, and frescoes enough to
fresco the heavens—pretty much all done by Michael Angelo. So with him
we have played that game which has vanquished so many guides for
us—imbecility and idiotic questions. These creatures never suspect—they
have no idea of a sarcasm.

He shows us a figure and says: “Statoo brunzo.” (Bronze statue).

We look at it indifferently and the doctor asks: “By Michael Angelo?”

“No—not know who.”

Then he shows us the ancient Roman Forum. The doctor asks: “Michael
Angelo?”

A stare from the guide. “No—a thousan’ year before he is born.”

Then an Egyptian obelisk. Again: “Michael Angelo?”

“Oh, mon dieu, genteelman! Zis is TWO thousan’ year before he is born.”

He grows so tired of that unceasing question sometimes, that he dreads
to show us anything at all. The wretch has tried all the ways he can
think of to make us comprehend that Michael Angelo is only responsible
for the creation of a _part_ of the world, but somehow he has not
succeeded yet. Relief for overtasked eyes and brain from study and
sightseeing is necessary, or we shall become idiotic, sure enough.
Therefore this guide must continue to suffer. If he does not enjoy it,
so much the worse for him. We do.

In this place I might as well jot down a chapter concerning those
necessary nuisances, European guides. Many a man has wished in his heart
he could do without his guide; but knowing he could not, has wished he
could get some amusement out of him as a remuneration for the affliction
of his society. We accomplished this latter matter, and if our
experience can be made useful to others they are welcome to it.

Guides know about enough English to tangle everything up so that a man
can make neither head nor tail of it. They know their story by heart—the
history of every statue, painting, cathedral, or other wonder they show
you. They know it and tell it as a parrot would—and if you interrupt,
and throw them off the track, they have to go back and begin over again.
All their lives long, they are employed in showing strange things to
foreigners and listening to their bursts of admiration. It is human
nature to take delight in exciting admiration. It is what prompts
children to say “smart” things, and to do absurd ones, and in other ways
“show off” when company is present. It is what makes gossips turn out in
rain and storm to go and be the first to tell a startling bit of news.
Think, then, what a passion it becomes with a guide, whose privilege it
is, every day, to show to strangers wonders that throw them into perfect
ecstasies of admiration! He gets so that he could not by any possibility
live in a soberer atmosphere. After we discovered this, we _never_ went
into ecstasies any more—we never admired anything—we never showed any
but impassible faces and stupid indifference in the presence of the
sublimest wonders a guide had to display. We had found their weak point.
We have made good use of it ever since. We have made some of those
people savage, at times, but we have never lost our own serenity.

The doctor asks the questions, generally, because he can keep his
countenance, and look more like an inspired idiot, and throw more
imbecility into the tone of his voice than any man that lives. It comes
natural to him.

The guides in Genoa are delighted to secure an American party, because
Americans have so much wonder, and deal so much in sentiment and emotion
before any relic of Columbus. Our guide there fidgeted about as if he
had swallowed a spring mattress. He was full of animation—full of
impatience. He said:

“Come wis me, genteelmen!—come! I show you ze letter writing by
Christopher Colombo! write it himself!—write it wis his own hand!—come!”

He took us to the municipal palace. After much impressive fumbling of
keys and opening of locks, the stained and aged document was spread
before us. The guide’s eyes sparkled. He danced about us and tapped the
parchment with his finger:

“What I tell you, genteelmen! Is it not so? See! handwriting Christopher
Colombo!—write it himself!”

We looked indifferent—unconcerned. The doctor examined the document very
deliberately, during a painful pause. Then he said, without any show of
interest:

“Ah—Ferguson—what—what did you say was the name of the party who wrote
this?”

“Christopher Colombo! ze great Christopher Colombo.”

Another deliberate examination.

“Ah—did he write it himself, or—or how?”

“He write it himself!—Christopher Colombo! he’s own handwriting, write
by himself!”

Then the doctor laid the document down and said:

“Why, I have seen boys in America only fourteen years old that could
write better than that.”

“But zis is ze great Christo——”

“I don’t care who it is! It’s the worst writing I ever saw. Now you
mustn’t think you can impose on us because we are strangers. We are not
fools, by a good deal. If you have got any specimens of penmanship of
real merit, trot them out!—and if you haven’t, drive on!”

We drove on. The guide was considerably shaken up, but he made one more
venture. He had something which he thought would overcome us. He said:

“Ah, genteelmen, you come wis me! I show you beautiful, oh, magnificent
bust Christopher Colombo!—splendid, grand, magnificent!”

He brought us before the beautiful bust—for it _was_ beautiful—and
sprang back and struck an attitude:

“Ah, look, genteelmen!—beautiful, grand,—bust Christopher
Colombo!—Beautiful bust, beautiful pedestal!”

The doctor put up his eyeglass—procured for such occasions:

“Ah—what did you say this gentleman’s name was?”

“Christopher Colombo! ze great Christopher Colombo!”

“Christopher Colombo—the great Christopher Colombo. Well what did _he_
do?”

“Discover America!—discover America, oh, ze devil!”

“Discover America. No—that statement will hardly wash. We are just from
America ourselves. We heard nothing about it. Christopher
Colombo—pleasant name—is—is he dead?”

“Oh, corpo di Baccho!—three hundred year!”

“What did he die of?”

“I do not know!—I cannot tell.”

“Smallpox, think?”

“I do not know, genteelmen!—I do not know _what_ he die of!”

“Measles, likely?”

“Maybe—maybe—I do not know—I think he die of somethings.”

“Parents living?”

“Im-posseeble!”

“Ah—which is the bust and which is the pedestal?”

“Santa Maria!—_zis_ ze bust!—_zis_ ze pedestal!”

“Ah, I see, I see—happy combination—very happy combination, indeed.
Is—is this the first time this gentleman was ever on a bust?”

That joke was lost on the foreigner—guides cannot master subtleties of
the American joke.

We have made it interesting for this Roman guide. Yesterday we spent
three or four hours in the Vatican again, that wonderful world of
curiosities. We came very near expressing interest, sometimes—even
admiration—it was very hard to keep from it. We succeeded though.
Nobody else ever did, in the Vatican museums. The guide was
bewildered—nonplussed. He walked his legs off, nearly, hunting up
extraordinary things, and exhausted all his ingenuity on us, but it
was a failure; we never showed any interest in anything. He had
reserved what he considered to be his greatest wonder till the last—a
royal Egyptian mummy; the best-preserved in the world, perhaps. He
took us there. He felt so sure, this time, that some of his old
enthusiasm came back to him:

“See, genteelmen!—Mummy! Mummy!”

The eyeglass came up as calmly, as deliberately as ever.

“Ah,—Ferguson—what did I understand you to say the gentleman’s name
was?”

“Name?—he got no name! Mummy!—’Gyptian mummy!”

“Yes, yes. Born here?”

“No! _’Gyptian_ mummy!”

“Ah, just so. Frenchman, I presume?”

“No!—_Not_ Frenchman, not Roman!—born in Egypta!”

“Born in Egypta. Never heard of Egypta before. Foreign locality, likely.
Mummy—mummy. How calm he is—how self-possessed. Is, ah—is he dead?”

“Oh, SACRE BLEU, been dead three thousan’ year!”

The doctor turned on him savagely:

“Here, now, what do you mean by such conduct as this! Playing us for
Chinamen because we are strangers and trying to learn. Trying to impose
your vile second-hand carcasses on _us_!—thunder and lightning, I’ve a
notion to—to—if you’ve got a nice _fresh_ corpse, fetch him out!—or, by
George, we’ll brain you!”

We make it exceedingly interesting for this Frenchman. However, he has
paid us back, partly, without knowing it. He came to the hotel this
morning to ask if we were up, and he endeavored as well as he could to
describe us, so that the landlord would know which persons he meant. He
finished with the casual remark that we were lunatics. The observation
was so innocent and so honest that it amounted to a very good thing for
a guide to say.

There is one remark (already mentioned) which never yet has failed to
disgust these guides. We use it always, when we can think of nothing
else to say. After they have exhausted their enthusiasm pointing out to
us and praising the beauties of some ancient bronze image or
broken-legged statue, we look at it stupidly and in silence for five,
ten, fifteen minutes—as long as we can hold out, in fact—and then ask:

“Is—is he dead?”


                            A SURFEIT OF ART

When I was a schoolboy and was to have a new knife, I could not make up
my mind as to which was the prettiest in the showcase, and I did not
think any of them were particularly pretty; and so I chose with a heavy
heart. But when I looked at my purchase, at home, where no glittering
blades came into composition with it, I was astonished to see how
handsome it was. To this day my new hats look better out of the shop
than they did in it, with other new hats. It begins to dawn upon me now,
that possibly, what I have been taking for uniform ugliness in the
galleries may be uniform beauty, after all. I honestly hope it is, to
others, but certainly it is not to me. Perhaps the reason I used to
enjoy going to the Academy of Fine Arts in New York was because there
were but a few hundred paintings in it, and it did not surfeit me to go
through the list. I suppose the Academy was bacon and beans in the
Forty-Mile Desert, and a European gallery is a state dinner of thirteen
courses. One leaves no sign after him of the one dish, but the thirteen
frighten away his appetite and give him no satisfaction.

There is one thing I am certain of, though. With all the Michael
Angelos, the Raphaels, the Guidos, and the other old masters, the
sublime history of Rome remains unpainted! They painted Virgins enough,
and Popes enough, and saintly scarecrows enough, to people Paradise,
almost, and these things are all they did paint. “Nero fiddling o’er
burning Rome,” the assassination of Caesar, the stirring spectacle of a
hundred thousand people bending forward with rapt interest, in the
coliseum, to see two skilful gladiators hacking away each other’s lives,
a tiger springing upon a kneeling martyr—these and a thousand other
matters which we read of with a living interest, must be sought for only
in books—not among the rubbish left by the old masters—who are no more,
I have the satisfaction of informing the public.


                               AT POMPEII

Everywhere, you see things that make you wonder how old these old houses
were before the night of destruction came—things, too, which bring back
those long-dead inhabitants and place them living before your eyes. For
instance: The steps (two feet thick—lava blocks) that lead up out of the
school, and the same kind of steps that lead up into the dress circle of
the principal theater, are almost worn through! For ages the boys
hurried out of that school, and for ages their parents hurried into that
theater, and the nervous feet that have been dust and ashes for eighteen
centuries have left their record for us to read to-day. I imagined I
could see crowds of gentlemen and ladies thronging into the theater,
with tickets for secured seats in their hands, and on the wall I read
the imaginary placard, in infamous grammar, “POSITIVELY NO FREE LIST,
EXCEPT MEMBERS OF THE PRESS!” Hanging about the doorway (I fancied) were
slouchy Pompeiian street boys uttering slang and profanity, and keeping
a wary eye out for checks. I entered the theater, and sat down in one of
the long rows of stone benches in the dress circle, and looked at the
place for the orchestra, and the ruined stage, and around at the wide
sweep of empty boxes, and thought to myself, “This house won’t pay.” I
tried to imagine the music in full blast, the leader of the orchestra
beating time, and the “versatile” So-and-So (who had “just returned from
a most successful tour in the provinces to play his last and farewell
engagement of positively six nights only, in Pompeii, previous to his
departure for Herculaneum”) charging around the stage and piling the
agony mountains high—but I could not do it with such a “house” as that;
those empty benches tied my fancy down to dull reality. I said, these
people that ought to be here have been dead, and still, and moldering to
dust for ages and ages, and will never care for the trifles and follies
of life any more forever—“Owing to circumstances, etc., etc., there will
not be any performance to-night.” Close down the curtains. Put out the
lights.


                                  FAME

After browsing among the stately ruins of Rome, of Baiae, of Pompeii,
and after glancing down the long marble ranks of battered and nameless
imperial heads that stretch down the corridors of the Vatican, one thing
strikes me with a force it never had before: the unsubstantial,
unlasting character of fame. Men lived long lives, in the olden time,
and struggled feverishly through them, toiling like slaves, in oratory,
in generalship, or in literature, and then laid them down and died,
happy in the possession of an enduring history and a deathless name.
Well, twenty little centuries flutter away, and what is left of these
things? A crazy inscription on a block of stone, which snuffy
antiquaries bother over and tangle up and make nothing out of but a bare
name (which they spell wrong)—no history, no tradition, no
poetry—nothing that can give it even a passing interest. What may be
left of General Grant’s great name forty centuries hence? This—in the
Encyclopedia for A.D. 5868, possibly.

“Uriah S. (or Z.) Grant—popular poet of ancient times in the Aztec
provinces of the United States of British America. Some authors say
flourished about A.D. 742; but the learned Ah-ah Foo-foo states that he
was a contemporary of Scharkspyre, the English poet, and flourished
about A.D. 1328, some three centuries _after_ the Trojan war instead of
before it. He wrote ‘Rock me to Sleep, Mother,’”

These thoughts sadden me. I will to bed.


                       ATHENS FROM THE ACROPOLIS

The full moon was riding high in the cloudless heavens now. We sauntered
carelessly and unthinkingly to the edge of the lofty battlements of the
citadel, and looked down—a vision! And such a vision! Athens by
moonlight! The prophet that thought the splendors of the New Jerusalem
were revealed to him, surely saw this instead! It lay in the level plain
right under our feet—all spread abroad like a picture—and we looked down
upon it as we might have looked from a balloon. We saw no semblance of a
street, but every house, every window, every clinging vine, every
projection, was as distinct and sharply marked as if the time were
noonday; and yet there was no glare, no glitter, nothing harsh or
repulsive—the noiseless city was flooded with the mellowest light that
ever streamed from the moon, and seemed like some living creature
wrapped in peaceful slumber. On its further side was a little temple,
whose delicate pillars and ornate front glowed with a rich luster that
chained the eye like the spell; and nearer by, the palace of the king
reared its creamy walls out of the midst of a great garden of shrubbery
that was flecked all over with a random shower of amber lights—a spray
of golden sparks that lost their brightness in the glory of the moon,
and glinted softly upon the sea of dark foliage like the pallid stars of
the milky way. Overhead the stately columns, majestic still in their
ruin—under foot the dreaming city—in the distance the silver sea—not on
the broad earth is there another picture half so beautiful!

As we turned and moved again through the temple, I wished that the
illustrious men who had sat in it in the remote ages could visit it
again and reveal themselves to our curious eyes—Plato, Aristotle,
Demosthenes, Socrates, Phocion, Pythagoras, Euclid, Pindar, Xenophon,
Herodotus, Praxiteles and Phidias, Zeuxis the painter. What a
constellation of celebrated names! But more than all, I wished that old
Diogenes, groping so patiently with his lantern, searching so zealously
for one solitary honest man in all the world, might meander along and
stumble on our party. I ought not to say it, maybe, but still I suppose
he would have put out his light.


                             CONSTANTINOPLE

Commercial morals, especially, are bad. There is no gainsaying that.
Greek, Turkish, and Armenian morals consist only in attending church
regularly on the appointed Sabbaths, and in breaking the ten
commandments all the balance of the week. It comes natural to them to
lie and cheat in the first place, and then they go on and improve on
nature until they arrive at perfection. In recommending his son to a
merchant as a valuable salesman, a father does not say he is a nice,
moral, upright boy, and goes to Sunday-school and is honest, but he
says, “This boy is worth his weight in broad pieces of a hundred—for
behold, he will cheat whomsoever hath dealings with him, and from the
Euxine to the waters of Marmora there abideth not so gifted a liar!” How
is that for a recommendation? The missionaries tell me that they hear
encomiums like that passed upon people every day. They say of a person
they admire, “Ah, he is a charming swindler, and a most exquisite liar!”


                           TURKISH JOURNALISM

The newspaper business has its inconveniences in Constantinople. Two
Greek papers and one French one were suppressed here within a few days
of each other. No victories of the Cretans are allowed to be printed.
From time to time the Grand Vizier sends a notice to the various editors
that the Cretan insurrection is entirely suppressed, and although that
editor knows better, he still has to print the notice. The Levant Herald
is too fond of speaking praisefully of Americans to be popular with the
Sultan, who does not relish our sympathy with the Cretans, and therefore
that paper has to be particularly circumspect in order to keep out of
trouble. Once the editor, forgetting the official notice in his paper
that the Cretans were crushed out, printed a letter of a very different
tenor, from the American Consul in Crete, and was fined two hundred and
fifty dollars for it. Shortly he printed another from the same source
and was imprisoned three months for his pains. I think I could get the
assistant editorship of the Levant Herald, but I am going to try to
worry along without it.


                               THE CAMEL

By half-past six we were under way, and all the Syrian world seemed to
be under way also. The road was filled with mule trains and long
processions of camels. This reminds me that we have been trying for some
time to think what a camel looks like, and now we have made it out. When
he is down on all his knees, flat on his breast to receive his load, he
looks something like a goose, swimming; and when he is upright he looks
like an ostrich with an extra set of legs. Camels are not beautiful, and
their long under lip gives them an exceedingly “gallus” expression. They
have immense flat, forked cushions of feet, that make a track in the
dust like a pie with a slice cut out of it. They are not particular
about their diet. They would eat a tombstone if they could bite it. A
thistle grows about here which has needles on it that would pierce
through leather, I think; if one touches you, you can find relief in
nothing but profanity. The camels eat these. They show by their actions
that they enjoy them. I suppose it would be a real treat to a camel to
have a keg of nails for supper.


                             AT NOAH’S TOMB

Noah’s tomb is built of stone, and is covered with a long stone
building. Bucksheesh let us in. The building had to be long, because the
grave of the honored old navigator is two hundred and ten feet long
itself! It is only about four feet high, though. He must have cast a
shadow like a lightning-rod. The proof that this is the genuine spot
where Noah was buried can only be doubted by uncommonly incredulous
people. The evidence is pretty straight. Shem, the son of Noah, was
present at the burial, and showed the place to his descendants, who
transmitted the knowledge to their descendants, and the lineal
descendants of these introduced themselves to us to-day. It was pleasant
to make the acquaintance of members of so respectable a family. It was a
thing to be proud of. It was the next thing to being acquainted with
Noah himself.


                                DAMASCUS

Damascus dates back anterior to the days of Abraham, and is the oldest
city in the world. It was founded by Uz, the grandson of Noah. “The
early history of Damascus is shrouded in the mists of a hoary
antiquity.” Leave the matters written of in the first eleven chapters of
the Old Testament out, and no recorded event has occurred in the world
but Damascus was in existence to receive the news of it. Go back as far
as you will into the vague past, there was always a Damascus. In the
writings of every century for more than four thousand years, its name
has been mentioned, and its praises sung. To Damascus, years are only
moments, decades are only flitting trifles of time. She measures time,
not by days and months and years, but by the empires she has seen rise
and prosper and crumble to ruin. She is a type of immortality. She saw
the foundations of Baalbec, and Thebes, and Ephesus laid; she saw these
villages grow into mighty cities, and amaze the world with their
grandeur—and she has lived to see them desolate, deserted, and given
over to the owls and the bats. She saw the Israelitish empire exalted,
and she saw it annihilated. She saw Greece rise, and flourish two
thousand years, and die. In her old age she saw Rome built; she saw it
overshadow the world with its power; she saw it perish. The few hundreds
of years of Genoese and Venetian might and splendor were, to grave old
Damascus, only a trifling scintillation hardly worth remembering.
Damascus has seen all that has ever occurred on earth, and still she
lives. She has looked upon the dry bones of a thousand empires and will
see the tombs of a thousand more before she dies. Though another claims
the name, old Damascus is by right the Eternal City.


                               AT BANIAS

It seems curious enough to us to be standing on ground that was once
actually pressed by the feet of the Saviour. The situation is suggestive
of a reality and a tangibility that seem at variance with the vagueness
and mystery and ghostliness that one naturally attaches to the character
of a god. I cannot comprehend yet that I am sitting where a god has
stood, and looking upon the brook and the mountains which that god
looked upon, and am surrounded by dusky men and women whose ancestors
saw him, and even talked with him, face to face, and carelessly, just as
they would have done with any other stranger. I cannot comprehend this;
the gods of my understanding have been always hidden in clouds, and very
far away.


                         A HEALER IN PALESTINE

As soon as the tribe found out that we had a doctor in our party, they
began to flock in from all quarters. Dr. B., in the charity of his
nature, had taken a child from a wagon who sat near by, and put some
sort of a wash upon its diseased eyes. That woman went off and started
the whole nation, and it was a sight to see them swarm! The lame, the
halt, the blind, the leprous—all the distempers that are bred of
indolence, dirt, and iniquity—were represented in the congress in ten
minutes, and still they came! Every woman that had a sick baby brought
it along, and every woman that hadn’t, borrowed one. What reverent and
what worshiping looks they bent upon that dread, mysterious power, the
Doctor! They watched him take his phials out; they watched him measure
the particles of white powder; they watched him add drops of one
precious liquid, and drops of another; they lost not the slightest
movement; their eyes were riveted upon him with a fascination that
nothing could distract. I believe they thought he was gifted like a god.
When each individual got his portion of medicine, his eyes were radiant
with joy—notwithstanding by nature they are a thankless and impassive
race—and upon his face was written the unquestioning faith that nothing
on earth could prevent the patient from getting well, now.

Christ knew how to preach to these simple, superstitious,
disease-tortured creatures: He healed the sick. They flocked to our poor
human doctor this morning when the fame of what he had done to the sick
child went abroad in the land, and they worshiped him with their eyes
while they did not know as yet whether there was virtue in his simples
or not. The ancestors of these—people precisely like them in color,
dress, manners, costumes, simplicity—flocked in vast multitudes after
Christ, and when they saw Him make the afflicted whole with a word, it
is no wonder they worshiped Him. No wonder His deeds were the talk of
the nation. No wonder the multitude that followed Him was so great that
at one time—thirty miles from here—they had to let a sick man down
through the roof because no approach could be made to the door; no
wonder His audiences were so great at Galilee that He had to preach from
a ship removed a little distance from the shore; no wonder that even in
the desert places about Bethsaida, five thousand invaded His solitude,
and He had to feed them by a miracle or else see them suffer for their
confiding faith and devotion; no wonder when there was a great commotion
in a city in those days, one neighbor explained it to another in words
to this effect: “They say that Jesus of Nazareth is come!”


                               THE BIBLE

It is hard to make a choice of the most beautiful passage in a book
which is so gemmed with beautiful passages, as the Bible; but it is
certain that not many things within its lids may take rank above the
exquisite story of Joseph. Who taught those ancient writers their
simplicity of language, their felicity of expression, their pathos, and,
above all, their faculty of sinking themselves entirely out of sight of
the reader and making the narrative stand out alone and seem to tell
itself? Shakespeare is always present when one reads his book; Macaulay
is present when we follow the march of his stately sentences; but the
Old Testament writers are hidden from view.


                            GALILEE AT NIGHT

In the starlight, Galilee has no boundaries but the broad compass of the
heavens, and is a theater meet for great events; meet for the birth of a
religion able to save a world; and meet for the stately figure appointed
to stand upon its stage and proclaim its high decrees. But in the
sunlight, one says: Is it for the deeds which were done and the words
which were spoken in this little acre of rocks and sand eighteen
centuries gone, that the bells are ringing to-day in the remote islands
of the sea and far and wide over continents that clasp the circumference
of the huge globe?


                          DISTANCE IN THE EAST

In Constantinople you ask, “How far is it to the Consulate?” and they
answer, “About ten minutes.” “How far is it to the Lloyds’ Agency?”
“Quarter of an hour.” “How far is it to the lower bridge?” “Four
minutes.” I cannot be positive about it, but I think that there, when a
man orders a pair of pantaloons, he says he wants them a quarter of a
minute in the legs and nine seconds around the waist.


                          A PLEASANT INCIDENT

I cannot think of anything now more certain to make one shudder, than to
have a soft-footed camel sneak up behind him and touch him on the ear
with its cold, flabby under lip. A camel did this for one of the boys,
who was drooping over his saddle in a brown study. He glanced up and saw
the majestic apparition hovering above him, and made frantic efforts to
get out of the way, but the camel reached out and bit him on the
shoulder before he accomplished it. This was the only pleasant incident
of the journey.


                             SACRED MARVELS

Imagination labors best in distant fields. I doubt if any man can stand
in the Grotto of the Annunciation and people with the phantom images of
his mind its too tangible walls of stone.

They showed us a broken granite pillar, depending from the roof, which
they said was hacked in two by the Moslem conquerors of Nazareth, in the
vain hope of pulling down the sanctuary. But the pillar remained
miraculously suspended in the air, and, unsupported itself, supported
then and still supports the roof. By dividing this statement up among
eight, it was found not difficult to believe it.

These gifted Latin monks never do anything by halves. If they were to
show you the Brazen Serpent that was elevated in the wilderness, you
could depend upon it that they had on hand the pole it was elevated on
also, and even the hole it stood in. They have got the “Grotto” of the
Annunciation here; and just as convenient to it as one’s throat is to
his mouth, they have also the Virgin’s Kitchen, and even her
sitting-room, where she and Joseph watched the infant Saviour play with
Hebrew toys, eighteen hundred years ago. All under one roof, and all
clean, spacious, comfortable “grottoes.” It seems curious that
personages intimately connected with the Holy Family always lived in
grottoes—in Nazareth, in Bethlehem, in imperial Ephesus—and yet nobody
else in their day and generation thought of doing anything of the kind.
If they ever did, their grottoes are all gone, and I suppose we ought to
wonder at the peculiar marvel of the preservation of these I speak of.
When the Virgin fled from Herod’s wrath, she hid in a grotto in
Bethlehem, and the same is there to this day. The slaughter of the
innocents in Bethlehem was done in a grotto; the Saviour was born in a
grotto—both are shown to pilgrims yet. It is exceedingly strange that
these tremendous events all happened in grottoes—and exceedingly
fortunate, likewise, because the strongest houses must crumble to ruin
in time, but a grotto in the living rock will last forever.


                            AT ADAM’S GRAVE

The tomb of Adam! How touching it was, here in a land of strangers, far
away from home, and friends, and all who cared for me, thus to discover
the grave of a blood relation. True, a distant one, but still a
relation. The unerring instinct of nature thrilled its recognition. The
fountain of my filial affection was stirred to its profoundest depths,
and I gave way to tumultuous emotion. I leaned upon a pillar and burst
into tears. I deem it no shame to have wept over the grave of my poor
dead relative. Let him who would sneer at my emotion close this volume
here, for he will find little to his taste in my journeyings through the
Holy Land. Noble old man—he did not live to see me—he did not live to
see his child. And I—I—alas, I did not live to see _him_. Weighed down
by sorrow and disappointment, he died before I was born—six thousand
brief summers before I was born. But let us try to bear it with
fortitude. Let us trust that he is better off where he is. Let us take
comfort in the thought that his loss is our eternal gain.


                           THE WANDERING JEW

And so we came at last to another wonder, of deep and abiding
interest—the veritable house where the unhappy wretch once lived who has
been celebrated in song and story for more than eighteen hundred years
as the Wandering Jew. On the memorable day of the Crucifixion he stood
in this old doorway with his arms akimbo, looking out upon the
struggling mob that was approaching, and when the weary Saviour would
have sat down and rested him a moment, pushed him rudely away and said,
“Move on!” The Lord said, “Move on, thou, likewise,” and the command has
never been revoked from that day to this. All men know now that the
miscreant upon whose head that just curse fell has roamed up and down
the wide world, for ages and ages, seeking rest and never finding
it—courting death but always in vain—longing to stop, in city, in
wilderness, in desert solitudes, yet hearing always that relentless
warning to march—march on! They say—do these hoary traditions—that when
Titus sacked Jerusalem and slaughtered eleven hundred thousand Jews in
her streets and byways, the Wandering Jew was seen always in the
thickest of the fight, and that when battle-axes gleamed in the air, he
bowed his head beneath them; when swords flashed their deadly
lightnings, he sprang in their way; he bared his breast to whizzing
javelins, to hissing arrows, to any and to every weapon that promised
death and forgetfulness, and rest. But it was useless—he walked forth
out of the carnage without a wound. And it is said that five hundred
years afterwards he followed Mahomet when he carried destruction to the
cities of Arabia, and then turned against him, hoping in this way to win
the death of a traitor. His calculations were wrong again. No quarter
was given to any living creature but one, and that was the only one of
all the host that did not want it. He sought death five hundred years
later, in the wars of the Crusades, and offered himself to famine and
pestilence at Ascalon. He escaped again—he could not die. These repeated
annoyances could have at last but one effect—they shook his confidence.
Since then the Wandering Jew has carried on a kind of desultory toying
with the most promising of the aids and implements of destruction, but
with small hope, as a general thing. He has speculated some in cholera
and railroads and has taken almost a lively interest in infernal
machines and patent medicines. He is old, now, and grave, as becomes an
age like his; he indulges in no light amusements save that he goes
sometimes to executions, and is fond of funerals.


                                BEDOUINS

We had had a glimpse, from a mountain top, of the Dead Sea, lying like a
blue shield in the plain of the Jordan, and now we were marching down a
close, flaming, rugged, desolate defile, where no living creature could
enjoy life, except, perhaps, a salamander. It was such a dreary,
repulsive, horrible solitude! It was the “wilderness” where John
preached, with camel’s hair about his loins—raiment enough—but he never
could have got his locusts and wild honey here. We were moping along
down through this dreadful place, every man in the rear. Our guards—two
gorgeous young Arab sheiks, with cargoes of swords, guns, pistols, and
daggers on board—were loafing ahead.

“Bedouins!”

Every man shrunk up and disappeared in his clothes like a mud-turtle. My
first impulse was to dash forward and destroy the Bedouins. My second
was to dash to the rear to see if there were any coming in that
direction. I acted on the latter impulse. So did all the others. If any
Bedouins had approached us, then, from that point of compass, they would
have paid dearly for their rashness. We all remarked that, afterwards.
There would have been scenes of riot and bloodshed there that no pen
could describe. I know that, because each man told what he would have
done, individually; and such a medley of strange and unheard-of
inventions of cruelty you could not conceive of. One man said he had
calmly made up his mind to perish where he stood, if need be, but never
yield an inch; he was going to wait, with deadly patience, till he could
count the stripes on the first Bedouin’s jacket, and then count them and
let him have it. Another was going to sit still till the first lance
reached within an inch of his breast, and then dodge it and seize it. I
forbear to tell what he was going to do to that Bedouin that owned it.
It makes my blood run cold to think of it.


                             A SMITTEN LAND

Palestine sits in sackcloth and ashes. Over it broods the spell of a
curse that has withered its fields and fettered its energies. Where
Sodom and Gomorrah reared their domes and towers, that solemn sea now
floods the plain, in whose bitter waters no living thing exists—over
whose waveless surface the blistering air hangs motionless and
dead—about whose borders nothing grows but weeds, and scattering tufts
of cane, and that treacherous fruit that promises refreshment to
parching lips, but turns to ashes at the touch. Nazareth is forlorn;
about that ford of Jordan where the hosts of Israel entered the Promised
Land with songs of rejoicing, one finds only a squalid camp of fantastic
Bedouins of the desert; Jericho the accursed lies a moldering ruin
to-day, even as Joshua’s miracle left it more than three thousand years
ago; Bethlehem and Bethany, in their poverty and their humiliation, have
nothing about them now to remind one that they once knew the high honor
of the Saviour’s presence; the hallowed spot where the shepherds watched
their flocks by night, and where the angels sang “Peace on earth, good
will to men,” is untenanted by any living creature, and unblessed by any
feature that is pleasant to the eye. Renowned Jerusalem itself, the
stateliest name in history, has lost all its ancient grandeur, and is
become a pauper village; the riches of Solomon are no longer there to
compel the admiration of visiting Oriental queens; the wonderful temple,
which was the pride and glory of Israel, is gone, and the Ottoman
crescent is lifted above the spot where, on that most memorable day in
the annals of the world, they reared the Holy Cross. The noted Sea of
Galilee, where Roman fleets once rode at anchor and the disciples of the
Saviour sailed in their ships, was long ago deserted by the devotees of
war and commerce, and its borders are a silent wilderness; Capernaum is
a shapeless ruin; Magdala is the home of beggared Arabs; Bethsaida and
Chorazin have vanished from the earth, and the “desert places” round
about them, where thousands of men once listened to the Saviour’s voice
and ate the miraculous bread, sleep in the hush of a solitude that is
inhabited only by birds of prey and skulking foxes.

Palestine is desolate and unlovely. And why should it be otherwise? Can
the _curse_ of the Deity beautify a land?


                               THE SPHINX

After years of waiting, it was before me at last. The great face was so
sad, so earnest, so longing, so patient. There was a dignity not of
earth in its mien, and in its countenance a benignity such as never
anything human wore. It was stone, but seemed sentient. If ever image of
stone thought, it was thinking. It was looking toward the verge of the
landscape, yet looking _at_ nothing—nothing but distance and vacancy. It
was looking over and beyond everything of the present, and far into the
past. It was gazing out over the ocean of Time—over lines of
century-waves which, further and further receding, closed nearer and
nearer together, and blended at last into one unbroken tide, away toward
the horizon of remote antiquity. It was thinking of the wars of departed
ages; of the empires it had seen created and destroyed; of the nations
whose birth it had witnessed, whose progress it had watched, whose
annihilation it had noted; of the joy and sorrow, the life and death,
the grandeur and decay, of five thousand slow revolving years. It was
the type of an attribute of man—of a faculty of his heart and brain. It
was MEMORY—RETROSPECTION—wrought into visible, tangible form. All who
know what pathos there is in memories of days that are accomplished and
faces that have vanished—albeit only a trifling score of years gone
by—will have some appreciation of the pathos that dwells in these grave
eyes that look so steadfastly back upon the things they knew before
History was born—before tradition had being—things that were, and forms
that moved, in a vague era which even Poetry and Romance scarce know
of—and passed one by one away and left the stony dreamer solitary in the
midst of a strange new age, and uncomprehended scenes.

The Sphinx is grand in its loneliness; it is imposing in its magnitude;
it is impressive in the mystery that hangs over its story. And there is
that in the overshadowing majesty of this eternal figure of stone, with
its accusing memory of the deeds of all ages, which reveals to one
something of what he shall feel when he shall stand at last in the awful
presence of God.


                       MEMORIES OF THE PILGRIMAGE

We shall remember something of pleasant France; and something also of
Paris, though it flashed upon us a splendid meteor, and was gone again,
we hardly knew how or where. We shall remember, always, how we saw
majestic Gibraltar glorified with the rich coloring of a Spanish sunset
and swimming in a sea of rainbows. In fancy we shall see Milan again,
and her stately cathedral with its marble wilderness of graceful spires.
And Padua—Verona—Como, jeweled with stars; and patrician Venice, afloat
on her stagnant flood—silent, desolate, haughty—scornful of her humbled
state—wrapping herself in memories of her lost fleets, of battle and
triumph, and all the pageantry of a glory that is departed.

We cannot forget Florence—Naples—nor the foretaste of heaven that is in
the delicious atmosphere of Greece—and surely not Athens and the broken
temples of the Acropolis. Surely not venerable Rome—nor the green plain
that compasses her round about, contrasting its brightness with her gray
decay—nor the ruined arches that stand apart in the plain and clothe
their looped and windowed raggedness with vines. We shall remember St.
Peter’s; not as one sees it when he walks the streets of Rome and
fancies all her domes are just alike, but as he sees it leagues away,
when every meaner edifice has faded out of sight and that one dome looms
superbly up in the flush of sunset, full of dignity and grace, strongly
outlined as a mountain.

We shall remember Constantinople and the Bosporus—the colossal
magnificence of Baalbec—the Pyramids of Egypt—the prodigious form, the
benignant countenance of the Sphinx—Oriental Smyrna—sacred
Jerusalem—Damascus, the “Pearl of the East,” the pride of Syria, the
fabled Garden of Eden, the home of princes and genii of the Arabian
Nights, the oldest metropolis on the earth, the one city in all the
world that has kept its name and held its place and looked serenely on
while the Kingdoms and Empires of four thousand years have risen to
life, enjoyed their little season of pride and pomp and then vanished
and been forgotten!




                          _FROM_ “ROUGHING IT”


                             STARTING WEST
                               (1870–71)

We were six days going from St. Louis to “St. Joe”—a trip that was so
dull, and sleepy, and eventless that it has left no more impression on
my memory than if its duration had been six minutes instead of that many
days. No record is left in my mind, now, concerning it, but a confused
jumble of savage looking snags, which we deliberately walked over with
one wheel or the other; and of reefs which we butted and butted, and
then retired from and climbed over in some softer place; and of
sand-bars which we roosted on occasionally, and rested, and then got out
our crutches and sparred over. In fact, the boat might almost as well
have gone to St. Joe by land, for she was walking most of the time,
anyhow—climbing over reefs and clambering over snags patiently and
laboriously all day long. The captain said she was a “bully” boat, and
all she wanted was more “shear” and a bigger wheel. I thought she wanted
a pair of stilts, but I had the deep sagacity not to say so.


                      GEORGE BEMIS AND “THE ALLEN”

Mr. George Bemis was dismally formidable. George Bemis was our fellow
traveler. We had never seen him before. He wore in his belt an old
original “Allen” revolver, such as irreverent people called a
“pepper-box.” Simply drawing the trigger back, cocked and fired the
pistol. As the trigger came back, the hammer would begin to rise and the
barrel to turn over, and presently down would drop the hammer, and away
would speed the ball. To aim along the turning barrel and hit the thing
aimed at was a feat which was probably never done with an “Allen” in the
world. But George’s was a reliable weapon, nevertheless, because, as one
of the stage-drivers afterwards said, “If she didn’t get what she went
after, she would fetch something else.”


And so she did. She went after a deuce of spades nailed against a tree,
once, and fetched a mule standing about thirty yards to the left of it.
Bemis did not want the mule; but the owner came out with a
double-barreled shot-gun and persuaded him to buy it, anyhow.


                           THE OVERLAND STAGE

Our coach was a great swinging and swaying stage, of the most sumptuous
description—an imposing cradle on wheels. It was drawn by six handsome
horses, and by the side of the driver sat the “conductor,” the
legitimate captain of the craft; for it was his business to take charge
and care of the mails, baggage, express matter, and passengers. We three
were the only passengers, this trip. We sat on the back seat, inside.
About all the rest of the coach was full of mail bags—for we had three
days’ delayed mails with us. Almost touching our knees, a perpendicular
wall of mail matter rose up to the roof. There was a great pile of it
strapped on top of the stage, and both the fore and hind boots were
full. We had twenty-seven hundred pounds of it aboard, the driver
said—“a little for Brigham, and Carson, and ’Frisco, but the heft of it
for the Injuns, which is powerful troublesome ’thout they get plenty of
truck to read.” But as he just then got up a fearful convulsion of his
countenance which was suggestive of a wink being swallowed by an
earthquake, we guessed that his remark was intended to be facetious, and
to mean that we would unload the most of our mail matter somewhere on
the plains and leave it to the Indians, or whosoever wanted it.

We changed horses every ten miles, all day long, and fairly flew over
the hard level road. We jumped out and stretched our legs every time the
coach stopped, and so the night found us still vivacious and unfatigued.


                         MORNING ON THE PLAINS

Another night of alternate tranquillity and turmoil. But morning came,
by and by. It was another glad awakening to fresh breezes, vast expanses
of level greensward, bright sunlight, an impressive solitude, utterly
without visible human beings or human habitations, and an atmosphere of
such amazing magnifying properties that trees that seemed close at hand
were more than three miles away. We resumed undress uniform, climbed
a-top of the flying coach, dangled our legs over the side, shouted
occasionally at our frantic mules, merely to see them lay their ears
back and scamper faster, tied our hats on to keep our hair from blowing
away, and leveled an outlook over the world-wide carpet about us for
things new and strange to gaze at. Even at this day it thrills me
through and through to think of the life, the gladness and the wild
sense of freedom that used to make the blood dance in my veins on those
fine overland mornings.


                               THE CAYOTE

The cayote is a long, slim, sick and sorry-looking skeleton, with a gray
wolf-skin stretched over it, a tolerably bushy tail that forever sags
down with a despairing expression of forsakenness and misery, a furtive
and evil eye, and a long, sharp face, with slightly lifted lip and
exposed teeth. He has a general slinking expression all over. The cayote
is a living, breathing allegory of Want. He is _always_ hungry. He is
always poor, out of luck and friendless. The meanest creatures despise
him, and even the fleas would desert him for a velocipede. He is so
spiritless and cowardly that even while his exposed teeth are pretending
a threat, the rest of his face is apologizing for it. And he is _so_
homely!—so scrawny, and ribby, and coarse-haired, and pitiful. When he
sees you he lifts his lip and lets a flash of his teeth out, and then
turns a little out of the course he was pursuing, depresses his head a
bit, and strikes a long, soft-footed trot through the sagebrush,
glancing over his shoulder at you, from time to time, till he is about
out of easy pistol range, and then he stops and takes a deliberate
survey of you; he will trot fifty yards and stop again—another fifty and
stop again; and finally the gray of his gliding body blends with the
gray of the sagebrush, and he disappears. All this is when you make no
demonstration against him; but if you do, he develops a livelier
interest in his journey, and instantly electrifies his heels and puts
such a deal of real estate between himself and your weapon, that by the
time you have raised the hammer you see that you need a minie rifle, and
by the time you have got him in line you need a rifled cannon, and by
the time you have “drawn a bead” on him you see well enough that nothing
but an unusually long-winded streak of lightning could reach him where
he is now. But if you start a swift-footed dog after him, you will enjoy
it ever so much—especially if it is a dog that has a good opinion of
himself, and has been brought up to think he knows something about
speed. The cayote will go swinging gently off on that deceitful trot of
his, and every little while he will smile a fraudful smile over his
shoulder that will fill that dog entirely full of encouragement and
worldly ambition, and make him lay his head still lower to the ground,
and stretch his neck further to the front, and pant more fiercely, and
stick his tail out straighter behind, and move his furious legs with a
yet wilder frenzy, and leave a broader and broader, and higher and
denser cloud of desert sand smoking behind, and marking his long wake
across the level plain! And all this time the dog is only a short twenty
feet behind the cayote, and to save the soul of him he cannot understand
why it is that he cannot get perceptibly closer; and he begins to get
aggravated, and it makes him madder and madder to see how gently the
cayote glides along and never pants or sweats or ceases to smile; and he
grows still more and more incensed to see how shamefully he has been
taken in by an entire stranger, and what an ignoble swindle that long,
calm, soft-footed trot is; and next he notices that he is getting
fagged, and that the cayote actually has to slacken speed a little to
keep from running away from him—and _then_ that town-dog is mad in
earnest, and he begins to strain and weep and swear, and paw the sand
higher than ever, and reach for the cayote with concentrated and
desperate energy. This “spurt” finds him six feet behind the gliding
enemy, and two miles from his friends. And then, in the instant that a
wild new hope is lighting up his face, the cayote turns and smiles
blandly upon him once more, and with a something about it which seems to
say, “Well, I shall have to tear myself away from you, bud—business is
business, and it will not do for me to be fooling along this way all
day”—and forthwith there is a rushing sound, and the sudden splitting of
a long crack through the atmosphere, and behold that dog is solitary and
alone in the midst of a vast solitude!


                             THE PONY RIDER

In a little while all interest was taken up in stretching our necks and
watching for the “pony-rider”—the fleet messenger who sped across the
continent from St. Joe to Sacramento, carrying letters nineteen hundred
miles in eight days! Think of that for perishable horse and human flesh
and blood to do! The pony-rider was usually a little bit of a man,
brimful of spirit and endurance. No matter what time of the day or night
his watch came on, and no matter whether it was winter or summer,
raining, snowing, hailing, or sleeting, or whether his “beat” was a
level straight road or a crazy trail over mountain crags and precipices,
or whether it led through peaceful regions that swarmed with hostile
Indians, he must be always ready to leap into the saddle and be off like
the wind! There was no idling-time for a pony-rider on duty. He rode
fifty miles without stopping by daylight, moonlight, starlight, or
through the blackness of darkness—just as it happened. He rode a
splendid horse that was born for a racer and fed and lodged like a
gentleman; kept him at his utmost speed for ten miles, and then, as he
came crashing up to the station where stood two men holding fast a
fresh, impatient steed, the transfer of rider and mail-bag was made in
the twinkling of an eye, and away flew the eager pair and were out of
sight before the spectator could get hardly the ghost of a look. Both
rider and horse went “flying light.” The rider’s dress was thin, and
fitted close; he wore a “roundabout,” and a skull-cap, and tucked his
pantaloons into his boot tops like a race-rider. He carried no arms—he
carried nothing that was not absolutely necessary, for even the postage
on his literary freight was worth _five dollars a letter_. He got but
little frivolous correspondence to carry—his bag had business letters in
it, mostly. His horse was stripped of all unnecessary weight, too. He
wore a little wafer of a racing-saddle, and no visible blanket. He wore
light shoes, or none at all. The little flat mail-pockets strapped under
the rider’s thighs would each hold about the bulk of a child’s primer.
They held many and many an important business chapter and newspaper
letter, but these were written on paper as airy and thin as gold-leaf,
nearly, and thus bulk and weight were economized. The stage-coach
traveled about a hundred to a hundred and twenty-five miles a day
(twenty-four hours), the pony-rider about two hundred and fifty. There
were about eighty pony-riders in the saddle all the time, night and day,
stretching in a long, scattering procession from Missouri to California,
forty flying eastward, and forty toward the west, and among them making
four hundred gallant horses earn a stirring livelihood and see a deal of
scenery every single day in the year.

We had had a consuming desire, from the beginning, to see a pony-rider,
but somehow or other all that passed us and all that met us managed to
streak by in the night, and so we heard only a whiz and a hail, and the
swift phantom of the desert was gone before we could get our heads out
of the windows. But now we were expecting one along every moment, and
would see him in broad daylight. Presently the driver exclaims:

“HERE HE COMES.”

Every neck is stretched further, and every eye strained wider. Away
across the endless dead level of the prairie a black speck appears
against the sky, and it is plain that it moves. Well, I should think so!
In a second or two it becomes a horse and rider, rising and falling,
rising and falling,—sweeping toward us nearer and nearer—growing more
and more distinct, more and more sharply defined—nearer and still
nearer, and the flutter of the hoofs comes faintly to the ear—another
instant a whoop and a hurrah from our upper deck, a wave of the rider’s
hand, but no reply, and a man and horse burst past our excited faces,
and go winging away like a belated fragment of a storm!

So sudden is it all, and so like a flash of unreal fancy, that but for
the flake of white foam left quivering and perishing on a mail-sack
after the vision had flashed by and disappeared, we might have doubted
whether we had seen any actual horse and man at all, maybe.


                             INDIAN COUNTRY

We had now reached a hostile Indian country, and during the afternoon we
passed Laparelle Station, and enjoyed great discomfort all the time we
were in the neighborhood, being aware that many of the trees we dashed
by at arm’s length concealed a lurking Indian or two. During the
preceding night an ambushed savage had sent a bullet through the
pony-rider’s jacket, but he had ridden on, just the same, because
pony-riders were not allowed to stop and inquire into such things except
when killed. As long as they had life enough in them they had to stick
to the horse and ride, even if the Indians had been waiting for them a
week, and were entirely out of patience. About two hours and a half
before we arrived at Laparelle Station, the keeper in charge of it had
fired four times at an Indian, but he said with an injured air that the
Indian had “skipped around so’s to spile everything—and ammunition’s
blamed skurse, too.” The most natural inference conveyed by his manner
of speaking was, that in “skipping around,” the Indian had taken an
unfair advantage.... We shut the blinds down very tightly that first
night in the hostile Indian country, and lay on our arms. We slept on
them some, but most of the time we only lay on them. We did not talk
much, but kept quiet and listened. It was an inky-black night, and
occasionally rainy. We were among woods and rocks, hills and gorges—so
shut in, in fact, that when we peeped through a chink in a curtain, we
could discern nothing. The driver and conductor on top were still, too,
or only spoke at long intervals, in low tones, as is the way of men in
the midst of invisible dangers. We listened to raindrops pattering on
the roof; and the grinding of the wheels through the muddy gravel; and
the low wailing of the wind; and all the time we had that absurd sense
upon us, inseparable from travel at night in a close-curtained vehicle,
the sense of remaining perfectly still in one place, notwithstanding the
jolting and swaying of the vehicle, the trampling of the horses, and the
grinding of the wheels. We listened a long time, with intent faculties
and bated breath; every time one of us would relax, and draw a long sigh
of relief and start to say something, a comrade would be sure to utter a
sudden “Hark!” and instantly the experimenter was rigid and listening
again.


                      AT THE SUMMIT OF THE ROCKIES

And now, at last, we were fairly in the renowned SOUTH PASS, and
whirling gaily along, high above the common world. We were perched upon
the extreme summit of the great range of the Rocky Mountains, toward
which we had been climbing, patiently climbing, ceaselessly climbing,
for days and nights together—and about us was gathered a convention of
Nature’s kings that stood ten, twelve, and even thirteen thousand feet
high—grand old fellows who would have to stoop to see Mount Washington,
in the twilight. We were in such an airy elevation above the creeping
populations of the earth, that now and then when the obstructing crags
stood out of the way it seemed that we could look around and abroad and
contemplate the whole great globe, with its dissolving views of
mountains, seas, and continents stretching away through the mystery of
the summer haze.


                          INCIDENTS BY THE WAY

At the Green River station we had breakfast—hot biscuits, fresh antelope
steaks, and coffee—the only decent meal we tasted between the United
States and Great Salt Lake City and the only one we were ever really
thankful for. Think of the monotonous execrableness of the thirty that
went before it, to leave this one simple breakfast looming up in my
memory like a shot-tower after all these years have gone by!

At five p. m. we reached Fort Bridger, one hundred and seventeen miles
from the South Pass, and one thousand and twenty-five miles from St.
Joseph. Fifty-two miles further on, near the head of Echo Canyon, we met
sixty United States soldiers from Camp Floyd. The day before, they had
fired upon three hundred or four hundred Indians, whom they supposed
gathered together for no good purpose. In the fight that had ensued,
four Indians were captured, and the main body chased four miles, but
nobody killed. This looked like business. We had a notion to get out and
join the sixty soldiers, but upon reflecting that there were four
hundred of the Indians, we concluded to go on and join the Indians.


                            MORMON BEAUTIES

Our stay in Salt Lake City amounted to only two days, and therefore we
had no time to make the customary inquisition into the workings of
polygamy and get up the usual statistics and deductions preparatory to
calling the attention of the nation at large once more to the matter. I
had the will to do it. With the gushing self-sufficiency of youth I was
feverish to plunge in headlong and achieve a great reform here—until I
saw the Mormon women. Then I was touched. My heart was wiser than my
head. It warmed toward these poor, ungainly, and pathetically “homely”
creatures, and as I turned to hide the generous moisture in my eyes, I
said, “No—the man that marries one of them has done an act of Christian
charity which entitles him to the kindly applause of mankind, not harsh
censure—and the man that marries sixty of them has done a deed of
open-handed generosity so sublime that the nations should stand
uncovered in his presence and worship in silence.”


                           THE ALKALI DESERT

The poetry was all in the anticipation—there is none in the reality.
Imagine a vast, waveless ocean stricken dead and turned to ashes;
imagine this solemn waste tufted with ash-dusted sage-bushes; imagine
the lifeless silence and solitude that belong to such a place; imagine a
coach, creeping like a bug through the midst of this shoreless level,
and sending up tumbled volumes of dust as if it were a bug that went by
steam; imagine this aching monotony of toiling and plowing kept up hour
after hour, and the shore still as far away as ever, apparently; imagine
team, driver, coach and passengers so deeply coated with ashes that they
are all one colorless color; imagine ash-drifts roosting above mustaches
and eyebrows like snow accumulations on boughs and bushes. This is the
reality of it.

The sun beats down with dead, blistering, relentless malignity; the
perspiration is welling from every pore in man and beast, but scarcely a
sign of it finds its way to the surface—it is absorbed before it gets
there; there is not the faintest breath of air stirring; there is not a
merciful shred of cloud in all the brilliant firmament; there is not a
living creature visible in any direction whither one searches the blank
level that stretches its monotonous miles on every hand; there is not a
sound—not a sigh—not a whisper—not a buzz, or a whir of wings, or
distant pipe of bird—not even a sob from the lost souls that doubtless
people that dead air.


                         ARRIVAL IN CARSON CITY

By and by Carson City was pointed out to us. It nestled in the edge of a
great plain and was a sufficient number of miles away to look like an
assemblage of mere white spots in the shadow of a grim range of
mountains overlooking it, whose summits seemed lifted clear out of
companionship and consciousness of earthly things.

We arrived, disembarked, and the stage went on. It was a “wooden” town;
its population two thousand souls. The main street consisted of four or
five blocks of little frame stores which were too high to sit down on,
but not too high for various other purposes; in fact hardly high enough.
They were packed close together, side by side, as if room were scarce in
that mighty plain. The sidewalk was of boards that were more or less
loose and inclined to rattle when walked upon. In the middle of the
town, opposite the stores, was the “plaza,” which is native to all towns
beyond the Rocky Mountains—a large, unfenced, level vacancy, with a
liberty pole in it, and very useful as a place for public auctions,
horse trades, and mass meetings, and likewise for teamsters to camp in.
Two other sides of the plaza were faced by stores, offices and stables.
The rest of Carson City was pretty scattering.

We were introduced to several citizens, at the stage-office and on the
way up to the Governor’s from the hotel—among others, to a Mr. Harris,
who was on horseback; he began to say something, but interrupted himself
with the remark:

“I’ll have to get you to excuse me a minute; yonder is the witness that
swore I helped to rob the California coach—a piece of impertinent
intermeddling, sir, for I am not even acquainted with the man.”

Then he rode over and began to rebuke the stranger with a six-shooter,
and the stranger began to explain with another. When the pistols were
emptied, the stranger resumed his work (mending a whip-lash), and Mr.
Harris rode by with a polite nod, homeward bound, with a bullet through
one of his lungs, and several through his hips; and from them issued
little rivulets of blood that coursed down the horse’s sides and made
the animal look quite picturesque. I never saw Harris shoot a man after
that but it recalled to mind that first day in Carson.


                               LAKE TAHOE

Three months of camp life on Lake Tahoe would restore an Egyptian mummy
to his pristine vigor, and give him an appetite like an alligator. I do
not mean the oldest and driest mummies, of course, but the fresher ones.
The air up there in the clouds is very pure and fine, bracing and
delicious. And why shouldn’t it be?—it is the same the angels breathe. I
think that hardly any amount of fatigue can be gathered together that a
man cannot sleep off in one night on the sand by its side. Not under a
roof, but under the sky; it seldom or never rains there in the summer
time. I know a man who went there to die. But he made a failure of it.
He was a skeleton when he came, and could barely stand. He had no
appetite, and did nothing but read tracts and reflect on the future.
Three months later he was sleeping out-of-doors regularly, eating all he
could hold, three times a day, and chasing game over mountains three
thousand feet high for recreation. And he was a skeleton no longer, but
weighed part of a ton. This is no fancy sketch, but the truth. His
disease was consumption. I confidently commend his experience to other
skeletons.

... As soon as we had eaten breakfast we got in the boat and skirted
along the lake shore about three miles and disembarked. We liked the
appearance of the place, and so we claimed some three hundred acres of
it and stuck our “notice” on a tree. It was yellow pine timber land—a
dense forest of trees a hundred feet high and from one to five feet
through at the butt. It was necessary to fence our property or we could
not hold it. That is to say, it was necessary to cut down trees here and
there and make them fall in such a way as to form a sort of enclosure
(with pretty wide gaps in it). We cut down three trees apiece, and found
it such heart-breaking work that we decided to “rest our case” on those;
if they held the property, well and good; if they didn’t, let the
property spill out through the gaps and go; it was no use to work
ourselves to death merely to save a few acres of land. Next day we came
back to build a house—for a house was also necessary, in order to hold
the property. We decided to build a substantial log-house and excite the
envy of the Brigade boys; but by the time we had cut and trimmed the
first log it seemed unnecessary to be so elaborate, and so we concluded
to build it of saplings. However, two saplings duly cut and trimmed,
compelled recognition of the fact that a still modester architecture
would satisfy the law, and so we concluded to build a “brush” house. We
devoted the next day to this work, but we did so much “sitting around”
and discussing that by the middle of the afternoon we had achieved only
a half way sort of affair which one of us had to watch while the other
cut brush, lest if both turned our backs we might not be able to find it
again, it had such a strong family resemblance to the surrounding
vegetation. But we were satisfied with it.... We slept in the sand close
to the water’s edge, between two protecting boulders, which took care of
the stormy night winds for us. We never took any paregoric to make us
sleep. At the first break of dawn we were always up and running
footraces to tone down excess of physical vigor and exuberance of
spirits. That is, Johnny was—but I held his hat. While smoking the pipe
of peace after breakfast we watched the sentinel peaks put on the glory
of the sun, and followed the conquering light as it swept among the
shadows, and set the captive crags and forests free. We watched the
tinted pictures grow and brighten upon the water till every little
detail of forest, precipice, and pinnacle was wrought in and finished,
and the miracle of the enchanter complete. Then to “business.”

That is, drifting around in the boat. We were on the north shore. There,
the rocks on the bottom are sometimes gray, sometimes white. This gives
the marvelous transparency of the water a fuller advantage than it has
elsewhere on the lake. We usually pushed out a hundred yards or so from
the shore and then lay down on the thwarts in the sun, and let the boat
drift by the hour whither it would. We seldom talked. It interrupted the
Sabbath stillness, and marred the dreams, the luxurious rest and
indolence brought.... So singularly clear was the water, that where it
was only twenty or thirty feet deep the bottom was so perfectly distinct
that the boat seemed floating in air! Yes, where it was even _eighty_
feet deep. Every little pebble was distinct, every speckled trout, every
hand’s-breadth of sand. Often, as we lay on our faces, a granite
boulder, as large as a village church, would start out of the bottom
apparently, and seem climbing up rapidly to the surface, till presently
it threatened to touch our faces, and we could not resist the impulse to
seize the oar and avert the danger. But the boat would float on, and the
boulder descend again, and then we could see that when we had been
exactly above it, it must still have been twenty or thirty feet below
the surface. Down through the transparency of these great depths, the
water was not _merely_ transparent, but dazzlingly, brilliantly so. All
objects seen through it had a bright, strong vividness, not only of
outline, but of every minute detail, which they would not have had when
seen simply through the same depth of atmosphere. So empty and airy did
all spaces seem below us, and so strong was the sense of floating high
aloft in mid-nothingness, that we called these boat-excursions
“balloon-voyages.” ... Sometimes, on lazy afternoons, we lolled on the
sand in camp, and smoked pipes and read some old well-worn novels. At
night, by the camp-fire, we played euchre and seven-up to strengthen the
mind—and played them with cards so greasy and defaced that only a whole
summer’s acquaintance with them could enable the student to tell the ace
of clubs from the jack of diamonds.

We never slept in our “house.” It never occurred to us, for one thing;
and besides, it was built to hold the ground, and that was enough. We
did not wish to strain it.


                           SELLING OUT A MINE

The Gould & Curry claim comprised twelve hundred feet, and it all
belonged originally to the two men whose name it bears. Mr. Curry owned
two-thirds of it—and he said that he sold it out for twenty-five hundred
dollars in cash, and an old plug horse that ate up his market value in
hay and barley in seventeen days by the watch. And he said that Gould
sold out for a pair of second-hand government blankets and a bottle of
whisky that killed nine men in three hours, and that an unoffending
stranger that smelt the cork was disabled for life. Four years afterward
the mine thus disposed of was worth in the San Francisco market seven
million six hundred thousand dollars in gold coin.


                         BUCK FANSHAW’S FUNERAL

There was a grand time over Buck Fanshaw when he died. He was a
representative citizen. He had “killed his man”—not in his own quarrel,
it is true, but in defence of a stranger unfairly beset by numbers. He
had kept a sumptuous saloon. He had been the proprietor of a dashing
helpmeet whom he could have discarded without the formality of a
divorce. He had a high position in the fire department and had been a
very Warwick in politics. When he died there was great lamentation
throughout the town, but especially in the vast bottom stratum of
society.

On the inquest it was shown that Buck Fanshaw, in the delirium of a
wasting typhoid fever, had taken arsenic, shot himself through the body,
cut his throat, and jumped out of a four-story window and broken his
neck—and after due deliberation, the jury, sad and tearful, but with
intelligence unblinded by its sorrow, brought in a verdict of death “by
the visitation of God.” What could the world do without juries?

Prodigious preparations were made for the funeral. All the vehicles in
town were hired, all the saloons put in mourning, all the municipal and
fire-company flags hung at half-mast, and all the firemen ordered to
muster in uniform and bring their machines duly draped in black. Now—let
it be remarked in parenthesis—as all the people of the earth had
representative adventures in the Silverland, and as each adventurer had
brought the slang of his nation or of his locality with him, the
combination made the slang of Nevada the richest and the most infinitely
varied and copious that had ever existed anywhere in the world, perhaps,
except in the mines of California in the “early days.” Slang was the
language of Nevada. It was hard to preach a sermon without it, and be
understood. Such phrases as “You bet!” “Oh, no, I reckon not.” “No Irish
need apply,” and a hundred others, became so common as to fall from the
lips of a speaker unconsciously—and very often when they did not touch
the subject under discussion and consequently failed to mean anything.

After Buck Fanshaw’s inquest, a meeting of the short-haired brotherhood
was held, for nothing could be done on the Pacific coast without a
public meeting and an expression of sentiment. Regretful resolutions
were passed and various committees appointed; among others, a committee
of one was deputed to call on the minister, a fragile, gentle, spiritual
new fledgling from an Eastern theological seminary, and as yet
unacquainted with the ways of the mines. The committeeman, “Scotty”
Briggs, made his visit; and in after days it was worth something to hear
the minister tell about it. Scotty was a stalwart rough, whose customary
suit, when on weighty official business, like committee work, was a fire
helmet, flaming red flannel shirt, patent leather belt with spanner and
revolver attached, coat hung over arm, and pants stuffed into boot tops.
He formed something of a contrast to the pale theological student. It is
fair to say of Scotty, however, in passing, that he had a warm heart,
and a strong love for his friends, and never entered into a quarrel when
he could reasonably keep out of it. Indeed, it was commonly said that
when ever one of Scotty’s fights was investigated, it always turned out
that it had originally been no affair of his, but out of native
good-heartedness he had dropped in of his own accord to help the man who
was getting the worst of it. He and Buck Fanshaw were bosom friends, for
years, and had often taken adventurous “potluck” together. On one
occasion, they had thrown off their coats and taken the weaker side in a
fight among strangers, and after gaining a hard earned victory, turned
and found that the men they were helping had deserted early and not only
that, but had stolen their coats and made off with them! But to return
to Scotty’s visit to the minister. He was on a sorrowful mission, now,
and his face was the picture of woe. Being admitted to the presence he
sat down before the clergyman, placed his fire hat on an unfinished
manuscript sermon under the minister’s nose, took from it a red silk
handkerchief, wiped his brow and heaved a sigh of dismal impressiveness,
explanatory of his business. He choked, and even shed tears; but with an
effort he mastered his voice and said in lugubrious tones:

“Are you the duck that runs the gospel-mill next door?”

“Am I the—pardon me, I believe I do not understand?”

With another sigh and a half-sob, Scotty rejoined:

“Why, you see, we are in a bit of trouble, and the boys thought maybe
you would give us a lift, if we’d tackle you—that is, if I’ve got the
rights of it and you are the head clerk of the doxology-works next
door.”

“I am the shepherd in charge of the flock whose fold is next door.”

“The which?”

“The spiritual adviser of the little company of believers whose
sanctuary adjoins these premises.”

Scotty scratched his head, reflected a moment, and then said:

“You rather hold over me, pard. I reckon I can’t call that hand. Ante
and pass the buck.”

“How? I beg pardon. What did I understand you to say?”

“Well, you’ve ruther got the bulge on me. Or may’be we’ve both got the
bulge, somehow. You don’t smoke me and I don’t smoke you. You see, one
of the boys has passed in his checks, and we want to give him a good
send-off, and so the thing I’m on now is to roust out somebody to jerk a
little chin-music for us and waltz him through handsome.”

“My friend, I seem to grow more and more bewildered. Your observations
are wholly incomprehensible to me. Cannot you simplify them in some way?
At first I thought perhaps I understood you, but I grope now. Would it
not expedite matters if you restricted yourself to categorical
statements of facts, unencumbered with obstructive accumulations of
metaphor and allegory?”

Another pause, and more reflection. Then, said Scotty:

“I’ll have to pass, I judge.”

“How?”

“You’ve raised me out, pard.”

“I still fail to catch your meaning.”

“Why, that last lead of yourn is too many for me—that’s the idea. I
can’t neither trump nor follow suit.”

The clergyman sank back in his chair perplexed. Scotty leaned his head
on his hand and gave himself up to thought. Presently his face came up,
sorrowful, but confident.

“I’ve got it now, so’s you can savvy,” he said. “What we want is a
gospel-sharp. See?”

“A what?”

“Gospel-sharp. Parson.”

“Oh! Why did you not say so before? I am a clergyman—a parson.”

“Now you talk! You see my blind and straddle it like a man. Put it
there!”—extending a brawny paw, which closed over the minister’s small
hand and gave it a shake indicative of fraternal sympathy and fervent
gratification.

“Now we’re all right, pard. Let’s start fresh. Don’t you mind my
shuffling a little—becuz we’re in a power of trouble. You see, one of
the boys has gone up the flume——”

“Gone where?”

“Up the flume—throwed up the sponge, you understand.”

“Thrown up the sponge?”

“Yes—kicked the bucket——”

“Ah—has departed to that mysterious country from whose bourne no
traveler returns.”

“Return! I reckon not. Why, pard, he’s _dead!_”

“Yes, I understand.”

“Oh, you do? Well I thought maybe you might be getting tangled some
more. Yes, you see he’s dead again——”

“_Again!_ Why, has he ever been dead before?”

“Dead before? No! Do you reckon a man has got as many lives as a cat?
But you bet you, he’s awful dead now, poor old boy, and I wish I’d never
seen this day. I don’t want no better friend than Buck Fanshaw. I knowed
him by the back; and when I know a man and like him, I freeze to him—you
hear _me_. Take him all round, pard, there never was a bullier man in
the mines. No man ever knowed Buck Fanshaw to go back on a friend. But
it’s all up, you know, it’s all up. It _ain’t_ no use. They’ve scooped
him.”

“Scooped him?”

“Yes—death has. Well, well, well, we’ve got to give him up. Yes, indeed.
It’s a kind of a hard world, after all, _ain’t_ it? But pard, he was a
rustler! You ought to see him get started once. He was a bully boy with
a glass eye! Just spit in his face and give him room according to his
strength, and it was just beautiful to see him peel and go in. He was
the worst son of a thief that ever drawed breath. Pard, he was _on_ it!
He was on it bigger than an Injun!”

“On it? On what?”

“On the shoot. On the shoulder. On the fight, you understand. _He_
didn’t give a continental for _any_ body. _Beg_ your pardon, friend, for
coming so near saying a cuss-word—but you see I’m on an awful strain, in
this palaver, on account of having to cramp down and draw everything so
mild. But we’ve got to give him up. There ain’t any getting around that,
I don’t reckon. Now if we can get you to help plant him——”

“Preach the funeral discourse? Assist at the obsequies?”

“Obs’quies is good. Yes. That’s it—that’s our little game. We are going
to get the thing up regardless, you know. He was always nifty himself,
and so you bet you his funeral ain’t going to be no slouch—solid silver
door-plate on his coffin, six plumes on the hearse, and one nigger on
the box in a biled shirt and a plug hat—how’s that for high? And we’ll
take care of _you_ pard. We’ll fix you all right. There’ll be a kerridge
for you; and whatever you want, you just ’scape out and we’ll ’tend to
it. We’ve got a shebang fixed up for you to stand behind, in No. 1’s
house, and don’t you be afraid. Just go in and toot your horn, if you
don’t sell a clam. Put Buck through as bully as you can, pard, for
anybody that knowed him will tell you that he was one of the whitest men
that was ever in the mines. You can’t draw it too strong. He never could
stand it to see things going wrong. He’s done more to make this town
quiet and peaceable than any man in it. I’ve seen him lick four Greasers
in eleven minutes, myself. If a thing wanted regulating, _he_ warn’t a
man to go browsing around for somebody to do it, but he would prance in
and regulate it himself. He warn’t a Catholic. Scasely. He was down on
’em. His word was ‘No Irish need apply!’ But it didn’t make no
difference about that when it came down to what a man’s rights was—and
so, when some roughs jumped the Catholic boneyard and started in to
stake out town lots in it he _went_ for ’em! And he _cleaned_ ’em, too!
I was there, pard, and I seen it myself.”

“That was very well, indeed—at least the impulse was—whether the act was
strictly defensible or not. Had deceased any religious convictions? That
is to say, did he feel a dependence upon, or acknowledge allegiance to a
higher power?”

More reflection.

“I reckon you’ve stumped me again, pard. Could you say it over once
more, and say it slow?”

“Well, to simplify it somewhat, was he, or rather had he ever been
connected with any organization sequestered for secular concerns and
devoted to self-sacrifice in the interests of morality?”

“All down but nine—set ’em up on the other alley, pard.”

“What did I understand you to say?”

“Why, you’re most too many for me, you know. When you get in with your
left I hunt grass every time. Every time you draw, you fill; but I don’t
seem to have any luck. Let’s have a new deal.”

“How? Begin again?”

“That’s it.”

“Very well. Was he a good man, and——”

“There—I see that; don’t put up another chip till I look at my hand. A
good man, says you? Pard, it ain’t no name for it. He was the best man
that ever—pard, you would have doted on that man. He could lam any
galoot of his inches in America. It was him that put down the riot last
election before it got a start; and everybody said he was the only man
that could have done it. He waltzed in with a spanner in one hand and a
trumpet in the other, and sent fourteen men home on a shutter in less
than three minutes. He had that riot all broke up and prevented nice
before anybody ever got a chance to strike a blow. He was always for
peace, and he would _have_ peace—he could not stand disturbances. Pard,
he was a great loss to this town. It would please the boys if you would
chip in something like that and do him justice. Here once when the Micks
got to throwing stones through the Methodis’ Sunday-school windows, Buck
Fanshaw, all of his own notion, shut up his saloon and took a couple of
six-shooters and mounted guard over the Sunday-school. Says he, ‘No
Irish need Apply!’ And they didn’t. He was the bulliest man in the
mountains, pard! He could run faster, jump higher, hit harder, and hold
more tanglefoot whisky without spilling than any man in seventeen
counties. Put that in, pard—it’ll please the boys more than anything you
could say. And you can say, pard, that he never shook his mother.”

“Never shook his mother?”

“That’s it—any of the boys will tell you so.”

“Well, but why _should_ he shake her?”

“That’s what _I_ say—but some people does.”

“Not people of any repute.”

“Well, some that averages pretty so-so.”

“In my opinion the man that would offer personal violence to his own
mother ought to——”

“Cheese it, pard; you’ve banked your ball clean outside the string. What
I was drivin’ at, was, that he never _throwed_ off on his mother—don’t
you see? No indeedy. He give her a house to live in, and town lots, and
plenty of money; and he looked after her and took care of her all the
time; and when she was down with the smallpox I’m d—d if he didn’t set
up nights and nuss her himself! _Beg_ your pardon for saying it, but it
hopped out too quick for yours truly. You’ve treated me like a
gentleman, pard, and I ain’t the man to hurt your feelings intentional.
I think you’re white. I think you’re a square man, pard. I like you, and
I’ll lick any man that don’t. I’ll lick him till he can’t tell himself
from a last year’s corpse! Put it _there_!” (Another fraternal
hand-shake—and exit).

The obsequies were all that “the boys” could desire. Such a marvel of
funeral pomp had never been seen in Virginia. The plumed hearse, the
dirge-breathing brass bands, the closed marts of business, the flags
drooping at half-mast, the long, plodding procession of uniformed secret
societies, military battalions and fire companies, draped engines,
carriages of officials, and citizens in vehicles and on foot, attracted
multitudes of spectators to the sidewalks, roofs, and windows; and for
years afterward, the degree of grandeur attained by any civic display in
Virginia was determined by comparison with Buck Fanshaw’s funeral.

Scotty Briggs, as a pall-bearer and a mourner, occupied a prominent
place at the funeral, and when the sermon was finished and the last
sentence of the prayer for the dead man’s soul ascended, he responded in
a low voice, but with feeling:

“AMEN. No Irish need apply.”


                           AN ABANDONED TOWN

We lived in a small cabin on a verdant hillside, and there were not five
other cabins in view over the wide expanse of hill and forest. Yet a
flourishing city of two or three thousand population had occupied this
grassy dead solitude during the flush times of twelve or fifteen years
before, and where our cabin stood had once been the heart of the teaming
hive, the center of the city. When the mines gave out the town fell into
decay, and in a few years wholly disappeared—streets, dwellings, shops,
everything—and left no sign. The grassy slopes were as green and smooth
and desolate of life as if they had never been disturbed. The mere
handful of miners still remaining had seen the town spring up, spread,
grow, and flourish in its pride; and they had seen it sicken and die,
and pass away like a dream. With it their hopes had died, and their zest
of life. They had long ago resigned themselves to their exile, and
ceased to correspond with their distant friends or turn longing eyes
toward their distant homes. They had accepted banishment, forgotten the
world and been forgotten of the world. They were far from telegraphs and
railroads, and they stood, as it were, in a living grave, dead to the
events that stirred the globe’s great populations, dead to the common
interests of men, isolated and outcast from brotherhood with their kind.
It was the most singular, and almost the most touching and melancholy
exile that fancy can imagine.


                           A HAWAIIAN TEMPLE

Near by is an interesting ruin—the meager remains of an ancient temple—a
place where human sacrifices were offered up in those old by-gone days
when the simple child of nature, yielding momentarily to sin when sorely
tempted, acknowledged his error when calm reflection had shown it to
him, and came forward with noble frankness and offered up his
grandmother as an atoning sacrifice—in those old days when the luckless
sinner could keep on cleansing his conscience and achieving periodical
happiness as long as his relations held out; long, long before the
missionaries braved a thousand privations to come and make them
permanently miserable by telling them how beautiful and how blissful a
place heaven is, and how nearly impossible it is to get there; and
showed the poor native how dreary a place perdition is and what
unnecessarily liberal facilities there are for going to it; showed him
how, in his ignorance, he had gone and fooled away all his kinsfolk to
no purpose; showed him what rapture it is to work all day long for fifty
cents to buy food for next day with, as compared with fishing for a
pastime and lolling in the shade through eternal summer, and eating of
the bounty that nobody labored to provide but Nature. How sad it is to
think of the multitudes who have gone to their graves in this beautiful
island and never knew there was a hell.


                          A HAWAIIAN STATESMAN

The President is the King’s father. He is an erect, strongly built,
massive-featured, white-haired, tawny old gentleman of eighty years of
age, or thereabouts. He was simply but well dressed, in a blue cloth
coat and white vest, and white pantaloons, without spot, dust, or
blemish upon them. He bears himself with a calm, stately dignity, and is
a man of noble presence. He was a young man and a distinguished warrior
under that terrific fighter, Kamehameha I., more than half a century
ago. A knowledge of his career suggested some such thought as this:
“This man, naked as the day he was born, and war-club and spear in hand,
has charged at the head of a horde of savages against other hordes of
savages more than a generation and a half ago, and reveled in slaughter
and carnage; has worshiped wooden images on his devout knees; has seen
hundreds of his race offered up in heathen temples as sacrifices to
wooden idols, at a time when no missionary’s foot had ever pressed this
soil, and he had never heard of the white man’s God; has believed his
enemy could secretly pray him to death; has seen the day, in his
childhood, when it was a crime punishable by death for a man to eat with
his wife, or for a plebeian to let his shadow fall upon the king—and now
look at him an educated Christian; neatly and handsomely dressed; a
high-minded, elegant gentleman; a traveler, in some degree, and one who
has been the honored guest of royalty in Europe; a man practiced in
holding the reins of an enlightened government, and well versed in the
politics of his country and in general, practical information. Look at
him, sitting there presiding over the deliberations of a legislative
body, among whom are white men—a grave, dignified, statesmanlike
personage, and as seemingly natural and fitted to the place as if he had
been born in it and had never been out of it in his lifetime. How the
experiences of this old man’s eventful life shame the cheap inventions
of romance!”


                           HAWAIIAN RELIGION

Quite a broad tract of land near the temple, extending from the sea to
the mountain, was sacred to the god Lono in olden times—so sacred that
if a common native set his sacrilegious foot upon it, it was judicious
for him to make his will, because his time had come. He might go around
it by water, but he could not cross it. It was well sprinkled with pagan
temples and stocked with awkward, homely idols carved out of logs of
wood. There was a temple devoted to prayers for rain—and with fine
sagacity it was placed at a point so well up on the mountain side that
if you prayed there twenty-four times a day for rain you would be likely
to get it every time. You would seldom get to your Amen before you would
have to hoist your umbrella.


                        THE CRATER OF HALEAKALA

Presently, vagrant white clouds came drifting along, high over the sea
and the valley; then they came in couples and groups; then in imposing
squadrons; gradually joining their forces, they banked themselves
solidly together, a thousand feet under us, and _totally shut out land
and ocean_—not a vestige of _anything_ was left in view, but just a
little of the rim of the crater, circling away from the pinnacle whereon
we sat (for a ghostly procession of wanderers from the filmy hosts
without had drifted through a chasm in the crater wall and filed round
and round, and gathered and sunk and blended together till the abyss was
stored to the brim with a fleecy fog). Thus banked, motion ceased, and
silence reigned. Clear to the horizon, league on league, the snowy floor
stretched without a break—not level, but in rounded folds, with shallow
creases between, and here and there stately piles of vapory architecture
lifting themselves aloft out of the common plain—some near at hand, some
in the middle distances, and others relieving the monotony of the remote
solitudes. There was little conversation, for the impressive scene
overawed speech. I felt like the Last Man, neglected of the judgment,
and left pinnacled in mid-heaven, a forgotten relic of a vanished world.




                     _FROM_ “THE GILDED AGE” (1873)


                      COLONEL SELLER’S GREAT IDEA

Washington was not able to ignore the cold entirely. He was nearly as
close to the stove as he could get, and yet he could not persuade
himself that he felt the slightest heat, notwithstanding the isinglass
door was still gently and serenely glowing. He tried to get a trifle
closer to the stove, and the consequence was he tripped the supporting
poker and the stove-door tumbled to the floor. And then there was a
revelation—there was nothing in the stove but a lighted tallow candle!

The poor youth blushed and felt as if he must die with shame. But the
Colonel was only disconcerted for a moment—he straightaway found his
voice again:

“A little idea of my own, Washington—one of the greatest things in the
world! You must write and tell your father about it—don’t forget that,
now. I have been reading up some European scientific reports—friend of
mine, Count Fugier sent them to me—sends me all sorts of things from
Paris—he thinks the world of me, Fugier does. Well, I saw that the
Academy of France had been testing the properties of heat, and they came
to the conclusion that it was a non-conductor or something like that,
and of course its influence must necessarily be deadly in nervous
organizations with excitable temperaments, especially where there is any
tendency toward rheumatic affections. Bless you, I saw in a moment what
was the matter with us, and says I, out goes your fires!—no more slow
torture and certain death for me, sir. What you want is the _appearance_
of heat, not the heat itself—that’s the idea. Well, how to do it was the
next thing. I just put my head to work, pegged away a couple of days,
and here you are! Rheumatism? Why a man can’t any more start a case of
rheumatism in this house than he can shake an opinion out of a mummy!
Stove with a candle in it and transparent door—that’s it—it has been the
salvation of this family. Don’t you fail to write your father about it,
Washington. And tell him the idea is mine—I’m no more conceited than
most people, I reckon, but you know it is human nature for a man to want
credit for a thing like that.”


                    COLONEL SELLERS LETS HIMSELF OUT

The supper at Colonel Sellers’s was not sumptuous, in the beginning, but
it improved on acquaintance. That is to say, that what Washington
regarded at first sight as mere lowly potatoes, presently became
awe-inspiring agricultural productions that had been reared in some
ducal garden beyond the sea, under the sacred eye of the duke himself,
who had sent them to Sellers; the bread was from corn which could be
grown in only one favored locality in the earth and only a favored few
could get it; the Rio coffee, which at first seemed execrable to the
taste, took to itself an improved flavor when Washington was told to
drink it slowly and not hurry what should be a lingering luxury in order
to be fully appreciated—it was from the private stores of a Brazilian
nobleman with an unrememberable name. The Colonel’s tongue was a
magician’s wand that turned dried apples into figs and water into wine
as easily as it could change a hovel into a palace and present poverty
into imminent future riches.

Washington slept in a cold bed in a carpetless room and woke up in a
palace in the morning; at least the palace lingered during the moment
that he was rubbing his eyes and getting his bearings—and then it
disappeared and he recognized that the Colonel’s inspiring talk had been
influencing his dreams. Fatigue had made him sleep late; when he entered
the sitting-room he noticed that the old haircloth sofa was absent; when
he sat down to breakfast the Colonel tossed six or seven dollars in
bills on the table, counted them over, said he was a little short and
must call upon his banker; then returned the bills to his wallet with
the indifferent air of a man who is used to money. The breakfast was not
an improvement upon the supper, but the Colonel talked it up and
transformed it into an oriental feast. By and by, he said:

“I intend to look out for you, Washington, my boy. I hunted up a place
for you yesterday, but I am not referring to that, now—that is a mere
livelihood—mere bread and butter; but when I say I mean to look out for
you I mean something very different. I mean to put things in your way
that will make a mere livelihood a trifling thing. I’ll put you in a way
to make more money than you’ll ever know what to do with. You’ll be
right here where I can put my hand on you when anything turns up. I’ve
got some prodigious operations on foot; but I’m keeping quiet; mum’s the
word; your old hand don’t go around pow-wowing and letting everybody see
his k’yards and find out his little game. But all in good time,
Washington, all in good time. You’ll see. Now, there’s an operation in
corn that looks well. Some New York men are trying to get me to go into
it—buy up all the growing crops and just boss the market when they
mature—ah, I tell you, it’s a great thing. And it only costs a trifle;
two millions or two and a half will do it. I haven’t exactly promised
yet—there’s no hurry—the more indifferent I seem, you know, the more
anxious those fellows will get. And then there is the hog
speculation—that’s bigger still. We’ve got quiet men at work” (he was
very impressive here), “mousing around, to get propositions out of all
the farmers in the whole West and Northwest for the hog crop, and other
agents quietly getting propositions and terms out of all the
manufactories—and don’t you see, if we can get all the hogs and all the
slaughter-houses into our hands on the dead quiet—whew! it would take
three ships to carry the money. I’ve looked into the thing—calculated
all the chances for and all the chances against, and though I shake my
head and hesitate and keep on thinking, apparently, I’ve got my mind
made up that if the thing can be done on a capital of six millions,
that’s the horse to put up money on! Why, Washington—but what’s the use
of talking about it—any man can see that there’s whole Atlantic oceans
of cash in it, gulfs and bays thrown in. But there’s a bigger thing than
that, yet—a bigger——”

“Why, Colonel, you can’t want anything bigger!” said Washington, his
eyes blazing. “Oh, I wish I could go into either of those speculations—I
only wish I had money—I wish I wasn’t cramped and kept down and fettered
with poverty, and such prodigious chances lying right here in sight! Oh,
it is a fearful thing to be poor. But don’t throw away those things—they
are so splendid that I can see how sure they are. Don’t throw them away
for something still better and maybe fail in it! I wouldn’t, Colonel. I
would stick to these. I wish father were here and were his old self
again. Oh, he never in his life had such chances as these are. Colonel,
you _can’t_ improve on these—no man can improve on them!”

A sweet, compassionate smile played about the Colonel’s features, and he
leaned over the table with the air of a man who is “going to show you”
and do it without the least trouble:

“Why Washington, my boy, these things are nothing. They _look_ large—of
course they look large to a novice—but to a man who has been all his
life accustomed to large operations—pshaw! They’re well enough to while
away an idle hour with, or furnish a bit of employment that will give a
trifle of idle capital a chance to earn its bread while it is waiting
for something to _do_, but—now just listen a moment—just let me give you
an idea of what we old veterans of commerce call ‘business.’ Here’s the
Rothschilds’ proposition—this is between you and me, you understand——”

Washington nodded three or four times impatiently, and his glowing eyes
said, “Yes, yes—hurry—I understand——”

“——for I wouldn’t have it get out for a fortune. They want me to go in
with them on the sly—agent was here two weeks ago about it—go in on the
sly” (voice down to an impressive whisper, now) “and buy up a hundred
and thirteen wildcat banks in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, and
Missouri—notes of these banks are at all sorts of discount now—average
discount of the hundred and thirteen is forty-four per cent.—buy them
all up, you see, and then all of a sudden let the cat out of the bag!
Whiz! the stock of every one of those wildcats would spin up to a
tremendous premium before you could turn a handspring—profit on the
speculation not a dollar less than forty millions!” (An eloquent pause
while the marvelous vision settled into W.’s focus.) “Where’s your hogs
now! Why, my dear innocent boy, we would just sit down on the front
doorsteps and peddle banks like lucifer matches!”

Washington finally got his breath and said:

“Oh, it is perfectly wonderful! Why couldn’t these things have happened
in father’s day. And I—it’s of no use—they simply lie before my face and
mock me. There is nothing for me to do but to stand helpless and see
other people reap the astonishing harvest.”

“Never mind, Washington, don’t you worry. I’ll fix you. There’s plenty
of chances. How much money have you got?”

In the presence of so many millions, Washington could not keep from
blushing when he had to confess that he had but eighteen dollars in the
world.

“Well, all right—don’t despair. Other people had been obliged to begin
with less. I have a small idea that may develop into something for us
both, all in good time. Keep your money close and add to it. I’ll make
it breed. I’ve been experimenting (to pass away the time) on a little
preparation for curing sore eyes—a kind of decoction nine-tenths water
and the other tenth drugs that don’t cost more than a dollar a barrel;
I’m still experimenting; there’s one ingredient wanted yet to perfect
the thing, and somehow I can’t just manage to hit upon the thing that’s
necessary, and I don’t dare talk with a chemist, of course. But I’m
progressing, and before many weeks I wager the country will ring with
the fame of Beriah Sellers’ Infallible Imperial Oriental Optic Liniment
and Salvation for Sore Eyes—the Medical Wonder of the Age! Small bottles
fifty cents, large ones a dollar. Average cost, five and seven cents for
the two sizes. The first year sell, say, ten thousand bottles in
Missouri, seven thousand in Iowa, three thousand in Arkansas, four
thousand in Kentucky, six thousand in Illinois, and say twenty-five
thousand in the rest of the country. Total, fifty-five thousand bottles;
profit clear of all expenses, twenty thousand dollars at the very lowest
calculation. All the capital needed is to manufacture the first two
thousand bottles—say a hundred and fifty dollars—then the money would
begin to flow in. The second year, sales would reach 200,000
bottles—clear profit, say, $75,000—and in the meantime the great factory
would be building in St. Louis, to cost, say, $100,000. The third year
we could easily sell 1,000,000 bottles in the United States and——”

“Oh, splendid!” said Washington. “Let’s commence right away—let’s——”

“——1,000,000 bottles in the United States—profit at least $350,000—and
_then_ it would begin to be time to turn our attention toward the _real_
idea of the business.”

“The _real_ idea of it! Ain’t $350,000 a year pretty real——”

“Stuff! Why, what an infant you are, Washington—what a guileless,
shortsighted, easily-contented innocent you are, my poor little
country-bred know-nothing! Would I go to all that trouble and bother for
the poor crumbs a body might pick up in _this_ country? Now do I look
like a man who—does my history suggest that I am a man who deals in
trifles, contents himself with the narrow horizon that hems in the
common herd, sees no further than the end of his nose? Now, _you_ know
that that is not me. Couldn’t be me. _You_ ought to know that if I throw
my time and abilities into a patent medicine, it’s a patent medicine
whose field of operations is the solid earth! its clients the swarming
nations that inhabit it! Why what is the republic of America for an
eye-water country? Lord bless you, it is nothing but a barren highway
that you’ve got to cross to get _to_ the true eye-water market! Why,
Washington, in the Oriental countries people swarm like the sands of the
desert; every square mile of land upholds its thousands upon thousands
of struggling human creatures—and every separate and individual devil of
them’s got the ophthalmia! It’s as natural to them as noses are, and
sin. It’s born with them, it stays with them, that’s all that some of
them have left when they die. Three years of introductory trade in the
Orient and what will be the result? Why, our headquarters would be in
Constantinople and our hindquarters in Further India! Factories and
warehouses in Cairo, Ispahan, Bagdad, Damascus, Jerusalem, Yedo, Peking,
Bangkok, Delhi, Bombay, and Calcutta! Annual income—well, God only knows
how many millions and millions apiece!”

Washington was so dazed, so bewildered—his heart and his eyes had
wandered so far away among the strange lands beyond the seas, and such
avalanches of coin and currency had fluttered and jingled confusedly
down before him, that he was now as one who had been whirling round and
round for a time, and stopping all at once, finds his surroundings still
whirling and all objects a dancing chaos. However, little by little the
Sellers family cooled down and crystallized into shape, and the poor
room lost its glitter and resumed its poverty. Then the youth found his
voice and begged Sellers to drop everything and hurry up the eye-water;
and he got out his eighteen dollars and tried to force it upon the
Colonel—pleaded with him to take it—implored him to do it. But the
Colonel would not; said he would not need the capital (in his native
magnificent way he called that eighteen dollars capital) till the
eye-water was an accomplished fact. He made Washington easy in his mind,
though, by promising that he would call for it just as soon as the
invention was finished, and he added the glad tidings that nobody but
just they two should be admitted to a share in the speculation.

When Washington left the breakfast table he worshiped that man.




               _FROM_ “ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER” (1874–5)


                       A SPECULATION IN WHITEWASH

Saturday morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and
fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if
the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in
every face and a spring in every step. The locust trees were in bloom
and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond
the village and above it, was green with vegetation, and it lay just far
enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.

Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a
long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and
a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board
fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a
burden. Sighing he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost
plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant
whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed
fence, and sat down on a tree box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at
the gate with a tin pail, and singing “Buffalo Gals.” Bringing water
from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom’s eyes, before,
but now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company
at the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there
waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarreling, fighting,
skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred
and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an
hour—and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:

“Say, Jim, I’ll fetch the water if you’ll whitewash some.”

Jim shook his head and said:

“Can’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an’ git dis water
an’ not stop foolin’ ’roun’ wid anybody. She say she spec Mars Tom gwine
to ax me to whitewash, an’ so she tole me go ’long an’ ’tend to my own
business—she ’lowed _she’d_ ’tend to de whitewashin’.”

“Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That’s the way she always talks.
Gimme the bucket—I won’t be gone only a minute. _She_ won’t ever know.”

“Oh, I dasn’t Mars Tom. Ole missis she’d take an’ tar de head off’n me.
’Deed she would.”

“_She!_ She never licks anybody—whacks ’em over the head with her
thimble—and who cares for that, I’d like to know. She talks awful, but
talk don’t hurt—anyway it don’t if she don’t cry. Jim, I’ll give you a
marvel. I’ll give you a white alley!”

Jim began to waver.

“White alley, Jim! And it’s a bully taw.”

“My! Dat’s a mighty gay marvel, _I_ tell you! But Mars Tom I’s powerful
afraid ole missis——”

“And besides, if you will I’ll show you my sore toe.”

Jim was only human—this attraction was too much for him. He put down his
pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing
interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he was
flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was
whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with
a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.

But Tom’s energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had
planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys
would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and
they would make a world of fun of him for having to work—the very
thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and
examined it—bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange
of _work_, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of
pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and
gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless
moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great,
magnificent inspiration.

He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in
sight presently—the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been
dreading. Ben’s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump—proof enough that his
heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and
giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned
ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As
he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned
far over to starboard and rounded to, ponderously and with laborious
pomp and circumstance—for he was personating the “Big Missouri,” and
considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was the boat and
captain and engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing
on his own hurricane deck; giving the orders and executing them: “Stop
her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!” The headway ran almost out and he drew up
slowly toward the sidewalk.

“Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!” His arms straightened and stiffened
down his sides.

“Set her back on the starboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!
Chow!” His right hand, meantime, describing stately circles—for it was
representing a forty-foot wheel.

“Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow chow!”
The left hand began to describe circles.

“Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on
the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow!
Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! _Lively_ now!
Come—out with your spring-line—what’re you about there! Take a turn
round that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now—let her
go! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! _Sh’t! sh’t! sh’t!”_
(trying the gauge-cocks).

Tom went on whitewashing—paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared
a moment and then said:

“Hi-_yi. You’re_ up a stump, ain’t you!”

No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then
he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as
before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom’s mouth watered for the
apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said—

“Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?”

Tom wheeled suddenly and said:

“Why, it’s you Ben! I warn’t noticing.”

“Say—_I’m_ going in a swimming, _I_ am. Don’t you wish you could? But of
course you’d ruther _work_—wouldn’t you? Course you would!”

Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:

“What do you call work?”

“Why, ain’t _that_ work?”

Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:

“Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain’t. All I know, is, it suits Tom
Sawyer.”

“Oh, come, now, you don’t mean to let on that you _like_ it?”

The brush continued to move.

“Like it? Well, I don’t see why I oughtn’t to like it. Does a boy get a
chance to whitewash a fence every day?”

That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom
swept his brush daintily—added a touch here and there—criticised the
effect again—Ben watching every move and getting more and more
interested, more and more absorbed. Presently he said:

“Say, Tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.”

Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:

“No—no—I reckon it wouldn’t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly’s awful
particular about this fence—right here on the street, you know—but if it
was the back fence I wouldn’t mind and _she_ wouldn’t. Yes, she’s awful
particular about this fence; it’s got to be done very careful; I reckon
there ain’t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do the
way it’s got to be done.”

“No—is that so? Oh come, now—lemme just try. Only just a little—I’d let
_you_, if you was me, Tom.”

“Ben, I’d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly—well, Jim wanted to do
it, but she wouldn’t let him. Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn’t let
Sid. Now don’t you see how I’m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence
and anything was to happen to it——”

“Oh, shucks, I’ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say—I’ll give you
the core of my apple.”

“Well, here—— No, Ben, now don’t. I’m afeard——”

“I’ll give you _all_ of it!”

Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his
heart. And while the late steamer “Big Missouri” worked and sweated in
the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,
dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more
innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every
little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time
Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a
kite, in good repair; and when _he_ played out, Johnny Miller bought in
for a dead rat and a string to swing it with—and so on, and so on, hour
after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a poor
poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in
wealth. He had beside the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part
of a jew’s-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool
cannon, a key that wouldn’t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a
glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six
fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a
dog-collar—but no dog—the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel,
and a dilapidated old window-sash.

He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while—plenty of company—and
the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn’t run out of
whitewash, he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.


                           TOM FALLS IN LOVE

As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new
girl in the garden—a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow hair
plaited into two long tails, white summer frock and embroidered
pantalettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A
certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a
memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction; he
had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor
little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had
confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest
boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time
she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is
done.

He worshiped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had
discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and
began to “show off” in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win
her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time; but
by and by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic
performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending
her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it,
grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet a while longer. She halted a
moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great
sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up, right
away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she
disappeared.


                                  HUCK

Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps
in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to
school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could
go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it
suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he
pleased; he was always the first that went barefoot in the spring and
the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put on
clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything that
goes to make life precious, that boy had. So thought every harassed,
hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.


                          THE PIRATES’ ISLAND

They built a fire against the side of a great log, twenty or thirty
steps within the somber depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon
in the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn “pone” stock
they had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild
free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,
far from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to
civilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy
glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the
varnished foliage and festooning vines.

Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the
eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the
Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.
The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had
more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly,
and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them
kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at
all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they
might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from Heaven....

When Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and
rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool
gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the
deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not a
sound obtruded upon great Nature’s meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood
upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire,
and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck
still slept.


                          TOM LEARNS TO SMOKE

After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to learn to
smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to try, too.
So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never smoked
anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they “bit” the tongue,
and were not considered manly anyway.

Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,
charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste,
and they gagged a little, but Tom said:

“Why, it’s just as easy! If I’d a knowed _this_ was all, I’d a learnt
long ago.”

“So would I,” said Joe. “It’s just nothing.”

“Why, many a time I’ve looked at people smoking, and thought ‘well, I
wish I could do that’; but I never thought I could,” said Tom.

“That’s just the way with me, hain’t it, Huck? You’ve heard me talk just
that way—haven’t you Huck? I’ll leave it to Huck if I haven’t.”

“Yes—heaps of times,” said Huck.

“Well, I have too,” said Tom; “oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the
slaughter-house. Don’t you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and
Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don’t you remember,
Huck, ’bout me saying that?”

“Yes, that’s so,” said Huck. “That was the day after I lost a white
alley. No, ’twas the day before.”

“There—I told you so,” said Tom. “Huck recollects it.”

“I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,” said Joe. “_I_ don’t feel
sick.”

“Neither do I,” said Tom. “_I_ could smoke it all day. But I bet you
Jeff Thatcher couldn’t.”

“Jeff Thatcher! Why, he’d keel over just with two draws. Just let him
try it once. _He’d_ see!”

“I bet he would. And Johnny Miller—I wish I could see Johnny Miller
tackle it once.”

“Oh, don’t _I_!” said Joe, “Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn’t any
more do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch _him_.”

“’Deed it would, Joe. Say—I wish the boys could see us now.”

“So do I.”

“Say—boys, don’t say anything about it, and sometime when they’re
around, I’ll come up to you and say ‘Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.’
And you’ll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn’t anything, you’ll
say, ‘Yes, I got my _old_ pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain’t
very good.’ And I’ll say, ‘Oh, that’s all right, if it’s _strong_
enough.’ And then you’ll out with the pipes, and we’ll light up just as
ca’m, and then just see ’em look!”

“By jings, that’ll be gay, Tom! I wish it was _now_!”

“So do I! And when we tell ’em we learned when we was off pirating,
won’t they wish they’d been along?”

“Oh, I reckon not! I’ll just _bet_ they will!”

So the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and grow
disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvelously
increased. Every pore inside the boys’ cheeks became a spouting
fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues
fast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their
throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings
followed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,
now. Joe’s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom’s followed. Both
fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and
main. Joe said feebly:

“I’ve lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.”

Tom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:

“I’ll help you. You go over that way and I’ll hunt around by the spring.
No, you needn’t come, Huck—we can find it.”

So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,
and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both
very pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had
had any trouble they had got rid of it.

They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,
and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare
theirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well—something they ate
at dinner had disagreed with them.




               _FROM_ “THE STOLEN WHITE ELEPHANT” (1878)


                         DESCRIBING AN ELEPHANT

“There are cases in detective history to show that criminals have been
detected through peculiarities in their appetites. Now, what does this
elephant eat? and how much?”

“Well, as to _what_ he eats—he will eat _anything_. He will eat a man,
he will eat a Bible—he will eat anything _between_ a man and a Bible.”

“Good—very good, indeed, but too general. Details are necessary—details
are the only valuable thing in our trade. Very well—as to men: At one
meal—or, if you prefer, during one day—how many men will he eat, if
fresh?”

“He would not care whether they were fresh or not; at a single meal he
would eat five ordinary men.”

“Very good; five men; we will put that down. What nationalities would he
prefer?”

“He is indifferent about nationalities. He prefers acquaintances, but is
not prejudiced against strangers.”

“Very good. Now, as to Bibles. How many Bibles would he eat at a meal?”

“He would eat an entire edition.”

“Now that is more exact. I will put that down. Very well; he likes men
and Bibles; so far, so good. What else will he eat? I want particulars.”

“He will leave Bibles to eat bricks, he will leave bricks to eat
bottles, he will leave bottles to eat clothing, he will leave clothing
to eat cats, he will leave cats to eat oysters, he will leave oysters to
eat ham, he will leave ham to eat sugar, he will leave sugar to eat pie,
he will leave pie to eat potatoes, he will leave potatoes to eat bran,
he will leave bran to eat hay, he will leave hay to eat oats, he will
leave oats to eat rice, for he was mainly raised on it. There is nothing
whatever that he will not eat but European butter, and he would eat that
if he could taste it.”

“Very good. General quantity at a meal—say about——”

“Well, anywhere from a quarter to a half a ton.”

“And he drinks——”

“Everything that is fluid. Milk, water, whisky, molasses, castor oil,
camphene, carbolic acid—it is no use to go into particulars; whatever
fluid occurs to you set it down. He will drink anything that is fluid,
except European coffee.”




                    _FROM_ “A TRAMP ABROAD” (1878–9)


                                 WAGNER

One day we took the train and went down to Mannheim to see King Lear
played in German. It was a mistake. We sat in our seats three whole
hours and never understood anything but the thunder and lightning; and
even that was reversed to suit German ideas, for the thunder came first
and the lightning followed after.... Another time we went to Mannheim
and attended a shivaree—otherwise an opera—the one called Lohengrin. The
banging and slamming and booming and crashing were something beyond
belief. The racking and pitiless pain of it remains stored up in my
memory alongside the memory of the time that I had my teeth fixed. There
were circumstances which made it necessary for me to stay through the
four hours to the end, and I stayed; but the recollection of that long,
dragging, relentless season of suffering is indestructible. To have to
endure it in silence, and sitting still, made it all the harder. I was
in a railed compartment with eight or ten strangers, of the two sexes,
and this compelled repression; yet at times the pain was so exquisite
that I could hardly keep the tears back. At those times, as the howlings
and wailings and shriekings of the singers, and the ragings and roarings
and explosions of the vast orchestra rose higher and higher, and wilder
and wilder, and fiercer and fiercer, I could have cried if I had been
alone. Those strangers would not have been surprised to see a man do
such things who was being gradually skinned, but they would have
marveled at it here, and made remarks about it, no doubt, whereas there
was nothing in the present case which was an advantage over being
skinned. There was a wait of half an hour at the end of the first act,
and I could have gone out and rested during that time, but I could not
trust myself to do it, for I felt that I should desert and stay out.
There was another wait of half an hour toward nine o’clock, but I had
gone through so much by that time that I had no spirit left, and so had
no desire but to be let alone.

I do not wish to suggest that the rest of the people there were like me,
for, indeed, they were not. Whether it was that they naturally liked
that noise, or whether it was that they had learned to like it by
getting used to it, I did not at that time know; but they did like
it—this was plain enough. While it was going on they sat and looked rapt
and grateful as cats do when one strokes their backs; and whenever the
curtain fell they rose to their feet, in one solid mighty multitude, and
the air was snowed thick with waving handkerchiefs, and hurricanes of
applause swept the place. This was not comprehensible to me. Of course,
there were many people there who were not under compulsion to stay; yet
the tiers were as full at the close as they had been at the beginning.
This showed that the people liked it....

I suppose there are two kinds of music—one kind which one feels, just as
an oyster might, and another sort which requires a higher faculty, a
faculty which must be assisted and developed by teaching. Yet if base
music gives certain of us wings, why should we want any other? But we
do. We want it because the higher and better like it. But we want it
without giving it the necessary time and trouble; so we climb into that
upper tier, that dress circle, by a lie; we _pretend_ we like it. I know
several of that sort of people—and I propose to be one of them myself
when I get home with my fine European education.


                         MIDNIGHT ENTERTAINMENT

At last all sleepiness forsook me. I recognized the fact that I was
hopelessly and permanently wide-awake. Wide-awake, and feverish and
thirsty. When I had lain tossing there as long as I could endure it, it
occurred to me that it would be a good idea to dress and go out in the
great square and take a refreshing wash in the fountain, and smoke and
reflect there until the remnant of the night was gone.

I believed I could dress in the dark without waking Harris. I had
banished my shoes after the mouse, but my slippers would do for a summer
night. So I rose softly, and gradually got on everything—down to one
sock. I couldn’t seem to get on the track of that sock, any way I could
fix it. But I had to have it; so I went down on my hands and knees, with
one slipper on and the other in my hand, and began to paw gently around
and rake the floor, but with no success. I enlarged my circle, and went
on pawing and raking. With every pressure of my knee, how the floor
creaked! and every time I chanced to rake against any article, it seemed
to give out thirty-five or thirty-six times more noise than it would
have in the daytime. In those cases I always stopped and held my breath
till I was sure Harris had not awakened—then I crept along again. I
moved on and on, but I could not find the sock; I could not seem to find
anything but furniture. I could not remember that there was much
furniture in the room when I went to bed, but the place was alive with
it now—especially chairs—chairs everywhere—had a couple of families
moved in, in the meantime? And I never could seem to glance on one of
those chairs, but always struck it full and square with my head. My
temper rose, by steady and sure degrees, and as I pawed on and on, I
fell to making vicious comments under my breath.

Finally, with a venomous access of irritation, I said I would leave
without the sock; so I rose up and made straight for the door—as I
supposed—and suddenly confronted my dim spectral image in the mirror. It
startled the breath out of me, for an instant; it was also showed me
that I was lost, and had no sort of idea where I was. When I realized
this, I was so angry that I had to sit down on the floor and take hold
of something to keep from lifting the roof off with an explosion of
opinion. If there had been only one mirror, it might possibly have
helped to locate me; but there were two, and two were as bad as a
thousand; besides, these were on opposite sides of the room. I could see
the dim blur of the windows, but in my turned-around condition they were
exactly where they ought not to be, and so they only confused me instead
of helping me.

I started to get up, and knocked down an umbrella; it made a noise like
a pistol-shot when it struck that hard, slick, carpetless floor; I
grated my teeth and held my breath—Harris did not stir. I set the
umbrella slowly and carefully against the wall, but as soon as I took my
hand away, its heel slipped from under it and down it came again with
another bang. I shrunk together and listened a moment in silent fury—no
harm done, everything quiet. With the most painstaking care and nicety I
stood the umbrella up once more, took my hand away, and down it came
again.

I have been strictly reared, but if it had not been so dark and solemn
and awful there in that lonely, vast room, I do believe I should have
said something then which could not have been put in a Sunday-school
book without injuring the sale of it. If my reasoning powers had not
been already sapped dry by my harassments, I would have known better
than to try to set an umbrella on end on one of those glassy German
floors in the dark; it can’t be done in the daytime without four
failures to one success. I had one comfort, though—Harris was yet still
and silent—he had not stirred.

The umbrella could not locate me—there were four standing around the
room, and all alike. I thought I would feel along the wall and find the
door in that way. I rose up and began this operation, but raked down a
picture. It was not a large one, but it made noise enough for a
panorama. Harris gave out no sound, but I felt that if I experimented
any further with the pictures I should be sure to wake him. Better give
up trying to get out. Yes, I would find King Arthur’s Round Table once
more—I had already found it several times—and used it for a base of
departure on an exploring tour for my bed; if I could find my bed I
could find my water-pitcher. I would quench my raging thirst and turn
in. So I started on my hands and knees, because I could go faster that
way, and with more confidence, too, and not knock things down. By and by
I found the table—with my head—rubbed the bruise a little, then rose up
and started, with hands abroad and fingers spread, to balance myself. I
found a chair; then the wall; then another chair; then a sofa; then an
alpenstock, then another sofa; this confounded me, for I had thought
there was only one sofa. I hunted up the table again and took a fresh
start; found some more chairs.

It occurred to me, now, as it ought to have done before, that as the
table was round, it was therefore no value as a place to aim from; so I
moved off once more and at random among the wilderness of chairs and
sofas—wandered off into unfamiliar regions, and presently knocked a
candlestick off a mantelpiece and knocked off a lamp, grabbed at the
lamp and knocked off a water-pitcher with a rattling crash, and thought
to myself, “I’ve found you at last—I judged I was close upon you.”
Harris shouted “murder,” and “thieves,” and finished with “I’m
absolutely drowned.”

The crash had roused the house. Mr. X. pranced in, in his long
night-garment, with a candle, young Z. after him with another candle; a
procession swept in at another door, with candles and lanterns—landlord
and two German guests in their nightgowns, and a chambermaid in hers.

I looked around; I was at Harris’s bed, a sabbath day’s journey from my
own. There was only one sofa; it was against the wall; there was only
one chair where a body could get at it—I had been revolving around it
like a planet, and colliding with it like a comet half the night.

I explained how I had been employing myself, and why. Then the
landlord’s party left, and the rest of us set about our preparations for
breakfast, for the dawn was ready to break. I glanced furtively at my
pedometer, and found I had made 47 miles. But I did not care, for I had
come out for a pedestrian tour anyway.


                           FOREIGN QUOTATIONS

I have a prejudice against people who print things in a foreign language
and add no translation. When I am the reader, and the author considers
me able to do the translating myself, he pays me quite a nice
compliment—but if he would do the translating for me I would try to get
along without the compliment.


                         REFLECTIONS ON THE ANT

Now and then, while we rested, we watched the laborious ant at his work.
I found nothing new in him—certainly nothing to change my opinion of
him. It seems to me that in the matter of intellect the ant must be a
strangely overrated bird. During many summers, now, I have watched him,
when I ought to have been in better business, and I have not yet come
across a living ant that seemed to have any more sense than a dead one.
I refer to the ordinary ant, of course; I have had no experience of
those wonderful Swiss and African ones which vote, keep drilled armies,
hold slaves, and dispute about religion. Those particular ants may be
all that the naturalist paints them, but I am persuaded that the average
ant is a sham. I admit his industry, of course; he is the hardest
working creature in the world—when anybody is looking—but his
leather-headedness is the point I make against him. He goes out
foraging, he makes a capture, and then what does he do? Go home? No—he
goes anywhere but home. He doesn’t know where home is. His home may be
only three feet away,—no matter, he can’t find it. He makes his capture,
as I have said; it is generally something which can be of no sort of use
to himself or anybody else; it is usually seven times bigger than it
ought to be; he lifts it bodily up in the air by main force and starts;
not toward home, but in the opposite direction; not calmly and wisely,
but with a frantic haste which is wasteful of his strength; he fetches
up against a pebble, and instead of going around it, he climbs over it
backwards dragging his booty after him, tumbles down on the other side,
jumps up in a passion, kicks the dust off his clothes, moistens his
hands, grabs his property viciously, yanks it this way, then that,
shoves it ahead of him a moment, turns tail and lugs it after him
another moment, gets madder and madder, then presently hoists it into
the air and goes tearing away in an entirely new direction; comes to a
weed; it never occurs to him to go around it; no, he must climb it; and
he does climb it, dragging his worthless property to the top—which is as
bright a thing to do as it would be for me to carry a sack of flour from
Heidelberg to Paris by way of Strasburg steeple; when he gets up there
he finds that that is not the place; takes a cursory glance at the
scenery and either climbs down again or tumbles down, and starts off
once more—as usual in a new direction. At the end of half an hour, he
fetches up within six inches of the place he started from and lays his
burden down; meantime he has been over all the ground for two yards
around, and climbed all the weeds and pebbles he came across. Now he
wipes the sweat from his brow, strokes his limbs, and then marches
aimlessly off, in as violent a hurry as ever. He traverses a good deal
of zig-zag country, and by and by stumbles on his same booty again. He
does not remember ever having seen it before; he looks around to see
which is not the way home, grabs his bundle and starts; he goes through
the same adventures he had before; finally stops to rest, and a friend
comes along. Evidently the friend remarks that a last year’s grasshopper
leg is a very noble acquisition, and inquires where he got it. Evidently
the proprietor does not remember exactly where he did get it, but thinks
he got it “around here somewhere.” Evidently the friend contracts to
help him freight it home. Then, with a judgment peculiarly antic (pun
not intentional), they take hold of opposite ends of that grasshopper
leg and begin to tug with all their might in opposite directions.
Presently they take a rest and confer together. They decide that
something is wrong, they can’t make out what. Then they go at it again,
just as before. Same result. Mutual recriminations follow. Evidently
each accuses the other of being an obstructionist. They warm up, and the
dispute ends in a fight. They lock themselves together and chew each
other’s jaws for a while; then they roll and tumble on the ground till
one loses a horn or a leg and has to haul off for repairs. They make up
and go to work again in the same old insane way, but the crippled ant is
at a disadvantage; tug as he may, the other one drags off the booty and
him at the end of it. Instead of giving up, he hangs on, and gets his
shins bruised against every obstruction that comes in the way. By and
by, when that grasshopper leg has been dragged all over the same old
ground once more, it is finally dumped at about the spot where it
originally lay, the two perspiring ants inspect it thoughtfully and
decide that dried grasshopper legs are a poor sort of property after
all, and then each starts off in a different direction to see if he
can’t find an old nail or something else that is heavy enough to afford
entertainment and at the same time valueless enough to make an ant want
to own it.


                        FOREIGN QUOTATIONS AGAIN

When really learned men write books for other learned men to read, they
are justified in using as many learned words as they please—their
audience will understand them; but a man that writes a book for the
general public to read is not justified in disfiguring his pages with
untranslated foreign expressions. It is an insolence toward the majority
of the purchasers, for it is a very frank and impudent way of saying,
“Get the translations made yourself, if you want them; this book is not
written for the ignorant classes.” There are men who know a foreign
language so well and have used it so long in their daily life that they
seem to discharge whole volleys of it into their English writings
unconsciously, and so they omit to translate, as much as half the time.
That is a great cruelty to nine out of ten of the man’s readers. What is
the excuse for this? The writer would say he only uses the foreign
language where the delicacy of his point cannot be conveyed in English.
Very well, then he writes his best things for the tenth man, and he
ought to warn the other nine not to buy his book. However, the excuse he
offers is at least an excuse; but there is another set of men who ...
know a _word_ here and there, of a foreign language, or a few beggarly
little three-word phrases, filched from the back of the dictionary, and
these they are continually peppering into their literature, with a
pretense of knowing that language—what excuse can they offer? The
foreign words and phrases which they use have their exact equivalents in
a nobler language—English; yet they think they “adorn their page” when
they say _Strasse_ for street, and _Bahnhof_ for railway station, and so
on—flaunting these fluttering rags of poverty in the reader’s face, and
imagining he will be ass enough to take them for the sign of untold
riches held in reserve.


                              THE JUNGFRAU

There was something subduing in the influence of that silent and solemn
and awful presence; one seemed to meet the immutable, the
indestructible, the eternal, face to face, and to feel the trivial and
fleeting nature of his own existence the more sharply by the contrast.
One had the sense of being under the brooding contemplation of a spirit,
not an inert mass of rocks and ice—a spirit which had looked down,
through the slow drift of the ages, upon a million vanished races of
men, and judged them; and would judge a million more—and still be there,
watching, unchanged and unchangeable, after all life should be gone and
the earth have become a vacant desolation.

While I was feeling these things, I was groping, without knowing it,
toward an understanding of what the spell is which people find in the
Alps, and in no other mountains—that strange, deep, nameless influence,
which once felt, cannot be forgotten—once felt, leaves always behind it
a restless longing to feel it again—a longing which is like
homesickness; a grieving, haunting yearning, which will plead, implore,
and persecute till it has its will. I met dozens of people, imaginative
and unimaginative, cultivated and uncultivated, who had come from far
countries and roamed through the Swiss Alps year after year—they could
not explain why. They had come first, they said, out of idle curiosity,
because everybody talked about it; they had come since because they
could not help it, and they should keep on coming, while they lived, for
the same reason; they had tried to break their chains and stay away, but
it was futile; now, they had no desire to break them. Others came nearer
formulating what they felt: they said they could find perfect rest and
peace nowhere else when they were troubled; all frets and worries and
chafings sank to sleep in the presence of the benignant serenity of the
Alps: the Great Spirit of the Mountain breathed his own peace upon their
hurt minds and sore hearts, and healed them; they could not think base
thoughts or do mean and sordid things here, before the visible throne of
God.


                        CLIMBING THE GEMMI PASS

When we began that ascent, we could see a microscopic chalet perched
away up against heaven on what seemed to be the highest mountain near
us. It was on our right, across the narrow head of the valley. But when
we got up abreast it on its own level, mountains were towering high
above on every hand, and we saw that its altitude was just about that of
the little Gasternthal which we had visited the evening before. Still it
seemed a long way up in the air, in that waste and lonely wilderness of
rocks. It had an unfenced grass-plot in front of it which seemed about
as big as a billiard table, and this grass plot slanted so sharply
downwards, and was so brief, and ended so exceedingly soon at the verge
of the absolute precipice, that it was a shuddery thing to think of a
person’s venturing to trust his foot on an incline so situated at all.
Suppose a man stepped on an orange peel in that yard; there would be
nothing for him to seize; nothing could keep him from rolling; five
revolutions would bring him to the edge, and over he would go. What a
frightful distance he would fall!—for there are very few birds that fly
as high as his starting-point. He would strike and bounce, two or three
times, on his way down, but this would be no advantage to him. I would
as soon take an airing on the slant of a rainbow as in such a front
yard. I would rather, in fact, for the distance down would be about the
same, and it is pleasanter to slide than to bounce.


                         DESCENT OF GEMMI PASS

We began our descent, now, by the most remarkable road I have ever seen.
It wound in corkscrew curves down the face of the colossal precipice—a
narrow way, with always the solid rock wall at one elbow, and
perpendicular nothingness at the other. We met an everlasting procession
of guides, porters, mules, litters, and tourists climbing up this steep
and muddy path, and there was no room to spare when you had to pass a
tolerably fat mule. I always took the inside, when I heard or saw the
mule coming, and flattened myself against the wall. I preferred the
inside, of course, but I should have had to take it anyhow, because the
mule prefers the outside. A mule’s preference—on a precipice—is a thing
to be respected. Well, his choice is always the outside. His life is
mostly devoted to carrying bulky panniers and packages which rest
against his body—therefore he is habituated to taking the outside edge
of mountain paths, to keep his bundles from rubbing against rocks or
banks on the other. When he goes into the passenger business he absurdly
clings to his old habit, and keeps one leg of his passenger always
dangling over the great deeps of the lower world while that passenger’s
heart is in the highlands, so to speak. More than once I saw a mule’s
hind foot cave out over the outer edge and send earth and rubbish into
the bottomless abyss; and I noticed that upon these occasions the rider,
whether male or female, looked tolerably unwell.

There was one place where an 18–inch breadth of light masonry had been
added to the verge of the path, and as there was a very sharp turn,
here, a panel of fencing had been set up there at some ancient time, as
a protection. This panel was old and gray and feeble, and the light
masonry had been loosened by recent rains. A young American girl came
along on a mule, and in making the turn the mule’s hind foot caved all
the loose masonry and one of the fence posts overboard; the mule gave a
violent lurch inboard to save himself, and succeeded in the effort, but
the girl turned as white as the snow of Mont Blanc for a moment.

The path here was simply a groove cut in the face of the precipice;
there was a four-foot breadth of solid rock under the traveler, and a
four-foot breadth of solid rock just above his head, like the roof of a
narrow porch; he could look out from this gallery and see a sheer
summitless and bottomless wall of rock before him, across a gorge or
crack a biscuit’s toss in width—but he could not see the bottom of his
own precipice unless he lay down and projected his nose over the edge. I
did not do this, because I did not wish to soil my clothes.


                              ALP CLIMBING

There is probably no pleasure equal to the pleasure of climbing a
dangerous Alp; but it is a pleasure which is confined strictly to people
who can find pleasure in it. I have not jumped to this conclusion; I
have traveled to it per gravel train, so to speak. I have thought the
whole thing out, and am quite sure I am right. A born climber’s appetite
for climbing is hard to satisfy; when it comes upon him he is like a
starving man with a feast before him; he may have other business on
hand, but it must wait. Mr. Girdlestone had had his usual summer holiday
in the Alps, and had spent it in the usual way, hunting for unique
chances to break his neck; his vacation was over, and his luggage packed
for England, but all of a sudden a hunger had come upon him to climb the
tremendous Weisshorn once more, for he had heard of a new and utterly
impossible route up it. His baggage was unpacked at once, and now he and
a friend, laden with knapsacks, ice-axes, coils of rope, and canteens of
milk, were just setting out. They would spend the night high up among
the snows, somewhere, and get up at two in the morning and finish the
enterprise. I had a strong desire to go with them, but forced it down—a
feat which Mr. Girdlestone, with all his fortitude, could not do.


                            THE OLD MASTERS

We visited the picture galleries and the other regulation “sights” of
Milan—not because I wanted to write about them again, but to see if I
had learned anything in twelve years. I afterwards visited the great
galleries of Rome and Florence for the same purpose. I found I had
learned one thing. When I wrote about the Old Masters before, I said the
copies were better than the originals. That was a mistake of large
dimensions. The Old Masters were still unpleasing to me, but they were
truly divine contrasted with the copies. The copy is to the original as
the pallid, smart, inane new waxwork group is to the vigorous, earnest,
dignified group of living men and women whom it professes to duplicate.
There is a mellow richness, a subdued color, in the old pictures, which
is to the eye what muffled and mellowed sound is to the ear. That is the
merit which is most loudly praised in the old picture, and is the one
which the copy most conspicuously lacks, and which the copyist must not
hope to compass. It was generally conceded by the artists with whom I
talked, that that subdued splendor, that mellow richness, is imparted to
the picture by _age_. Then why should we worship the Old Master for it,
who didn’t impart it, instead of worshiping Old Time, who did? Perhaps
the picture was a clanging bell, until time muffled it and sweetened it.

In conversation with an artist in Venice, I asked,

“What is it that people see in Old Masters? I have been in the Doge’s
palace and I saw several acres of very bad drawing, very bad
perspective, and very incorrect proportions. Paul Veronese’s dogs do not
resemble dogs; all the horses look like bladders on legs; one man had a
_right_ leg on the left side of his body; in the large picture where the
Emperor (Barbarossa?) is prostrate before the Pope, there are three men
in the foreground who are over thirty feet high, if one may judge by the
size of a kneeling little boy in the center of the foreground; and
according to the same scale, the Pope is 7 feet high and the Doge is a
shriveled dwarf of 4 feet.”

The artist said:

“Yes, the Old Masters often drew badly; they did not care much for truth
and exactness in minor details; but after all, in spite of bad drawing,
bad perspective, bad proportions, and a choice of subjects which no
longer appeal to people as strongly as they did three hundred years ago,
there is a _something_ about their pictures which is divine—a something
which is above and beyond the art of any epoch since—a something which
would be the despair of artists but that they never hope or expect to
attain it, and therefore do not worry about it.”

That is what he said—and he said what he believed; and not only
believed, but felt.

Reasoning—especially reasoning without technical knowledge—must be put
aside, in cases of this kind. It cannot assist the inquirer. It will
lead him, in the most logical progression, to what, in the eyes of the
artists, would be a most illogical conclusion. Thus: bad drawing, bad
proportions, bad perspective, indifference to truthful detail, color
which gets its merit from time, and not from the artist—these things
constitute the Old Master; conclusion, the Old Master was a bad painter,
the Old Master was not an Old Master at all, but an Old Apprentice. Your
friend the artist will grant your premises, but deny your conclusion; he
will maintain that notwithstanding this formidable list of confessed
defects, there is still a something that is divine and unapproachable
about the Old Master, and that there is no arguing the fact away by any
system of reasoning whatever.

I can believe that. There are women who have an indefinable charm in
their faces which makes them beautiful to their intimates; but a cold
stranger who tried to reason the matter out and find this beauty would
fail. He would say of one of these women: This chin is too short, this
nose is too long, this forehead is too high, this hair is too red, this
complexion is too pallid, the perspective of the entire composition is
incorrect; conclusion, the woman is not beautiful. But her nearest
friend might say, and say truly, “Your premises are right, your logic is
faultless, but your conclusion is wrong, nevertheless; she is an Old
Master—she is beautiful, but only to such as know her; it is a beauty
which cannot be formulated, but it is there just the same.”

I found more pleasure in contemplating the Old Masters this time than I
did when I was in Europe in former years, but still it was a calm
pleasure; there was nothing overheated about it.




               _FROM_ “LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI” (1874–5)


                         THE PERMANENT AMBITION

When I was a boy, there was but one permanent ambition among my comrades
in our village on the west bank of the Mississippi River. That was to be
a steamboatman. We had transient ambitions of other sorts, but they were
only transient. When a circus came and went, it left us all burning to
become clowns; the first negro minstrel show that ever came to our
section left us all suffering to try that kind of life; now and then we
had a hope that, if we lived and were good, God would permit us to be
pirates. These ambitions faded out, each in its turn; but the ambition
to be a steamboatman always remained.

My father was a justice of the peace, and I supposed he possessed the
power of life and death over all men, and could hang anybody that
offended him. This was distinction enough for me as a general thing; but
the desire to be a steamboatman kept intruding, nevertheless. I first
wanted to be a cabin-boy, so that I could come out with a white apron on
and shake a tablecloth over the side, where all my old comrades could
see me; later I thought I would rather be the deckhand who stood on the
end of the stage-plank with the coil of rope in his hand, because he was
particularly conspicuous. But these were only day-dreams—they were too
heavenly to be contemplated as real possibilities. By and by one of our
boys went away. He was not heard of for a long time. At last he turned
up as apprentice engineer or “striker” on a steamboat. This thing shook
the bottom out of all my Sunday-school teachings. That boy had been
notoriously worldly, and I just the reverse; yet he was exalted to this
eminence, and I left in obscurity and misery.

This creature’s career could produce but one result, and it speedily
followed. Boy after boy managed to get on the river. The minister’s son
became an engineer. The doctor’s and the postmaster’s sons became “mud
clerks”; the wholesale liquor dealer’s son became a barkeeper on a boat;
four sons of the chief merchant, and two sons of the county judge,
became pilots. Pilot was the grandest position of all. The pilot, even
in those days of trivial wages, had a princely salary—from a hundred and
fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars a month, and no board to pay. Two
months of his wages would pay a preacher’s salary for a year. Now some
of us were left disconsolate. We could not get on the river—at least our
parents would not let us.

So, by and by, I ran away. I said I would never come home again till I
was a pilot and could come in glory.


                       FIRST LESSONS IN PILOTING

The boat backed out from New Orleans at four in the afternoon, and it
was “our watch” until eight. Mr. Bixby, my chief, “straightened her up,”
ploughed her along past the sterns of the other boats that lay at the
Levee, and then said, “Here, take her; shave those steamships as close
as you’d peel an apple.” I took the wheel, and my heart-beat fluttered
up into the hundreds; for it seemed to me that we were about to scrape
the side of every ship in the line, we were so close. I held my breath
and began to claw the boat away from the danger; and I had my own
opinion of the pilot who had known no better than to get us into such
peril, but I was too wise to express it. In half a minute I had a wide
margin of safety intervening between the _Paul Jones_ and the ships; and
within ten seconds more I was set aside in disgrace, and Mr. Bixby was
going into danger again and flaying me alive with abuse of my cowardice.
I was stung, but I was obliged to admire the easy confidence with which
my chief loafed from side to side of his wheel, and trimmed the ships so
closely that disaster seemed ceaselessly imminent. When he had cooled a
little he told me that the easy water was close ashore and the current
outside, and therefore we must hug the bank, up-stream, to get the
benefit of the former, and stay well out, down-stream, to take advantage
of the latter. In my own mind I resolved to be a down-stream pilot and
leave the up-streaming to people dead to prudence.

Now and then Mr. Bixby called my attention to certain things. Said he,
“This is Six-Mile Point.” I assented. It was pleasant enough
information, but I could not see the bearing of it. I was not conscious
that it was a matter of any interest to me. Another time he said, “This
is Nine-Mile Point.” Later he said, “This is Twelve-Mile Point.” They
were all about level with the water’s edge; they all looked about alike
to me; they were monotonously unpicturesque. I hoped Mr. Bixby would
change the subject. But no; he would crowd up around a point, hugging
the shore with affection, and then say: “The slack water ends here,
abreast this bunch of China-trees; now we cross over.” So he crossed
over. He gave me the wheel once or twice, but I had no luck. I either
came near chipping off the edge of a sugar plantation, or I yawed too
far from shore, and so dropped back into disgrace again and got abused.

The watch was ended at last, and we took supper and went to bed. At
midnight the glare of a lantern shone in my eyes, and the night watchman
said:

“Come, turn out!”

And then he left. I could not understand this extraordinary procedure;
so I presently gave up trying to, and dozed off to sleep. Pretty soon
the watchman was back again, and this time he was gruff. I was annoyed.
I said:

“What do you want to come bothering around here in the middle of the
night for? Now, as like as not, I’ll not get to sleep again to-night.”

The watchman said:

“Well, if this ain’t good, I’m blessed.”

The “off-watch” was just turning in, and I heard some brutal laughter
from them, and such remarks as, “Hello, watchman! ain’t the new cub
turned out yet? He’s delicate likely. Give him some sugar in a rag, and
send for the chambermaid to sing ‘Rock-a-bye Baby,’ to him.”

About this time Mr. Bixby appeared on the scene. Something like a minute
later I was climbing the pilot-house steps with some of my clothes on
and the rest in my arms. Mr. Bixby was close behind, commenting. Here
was something fresh—this thing of getting up in the middle of the night
to go to work. It was a detail in piloting that had never occurred to me
at all. I knew that boats ran all night, but somehow I had never
happened to reflect that somebody had to get up out of a warm bed to run
them. I began to fear that piloting was not quite so romantic as I had
imagined it was; there was something very real and worklike about this
new phase of it.

It was rather a dingy night, although a fair number of stars were out.
The big mate was at the wheel, and he had the old tub pointed at a star
and was holding her straight up the middle of the river. The shores on
either hand were not much more than half a mile apart, but they seemed
wonderfully far away and ever so vague and indistinct. The mate said:

“We’ve got to land at Jones’s plantation, sir.”

The vengeful spirit in me exulted. I said to myself, “I wish you joy of
your job, Mr. Bixby; you’ll have a good time finding Mr. Jones’s
plantation such a night as this; and I hope you never _will_ find it as
long as you live.”

Mr. Bixby said to the mate:

“Upper end of the plantation, or the lower?”

“Upper.”

“I can’t do it. The stumps there are out of the water at this stage.
It’s no great distance to the lower, and you’ll have to get along with
that.”

“All right, sir. If Jones don’t like it, he’ll have to lump it, I
reckon.”

And then the mate left. My exultation began to cool and my wonder to
come up. Here was a man who not only proposed to find this plantation on
such a night, but to find either end of it you preferred. I dreadfully
wanted to ask a question, but I was carrying about as many short answers
as my cargo-room would admit of, so I held my peace. All I desired to
ask Mr. Bixby was the simple question whether he was ass enough to
really imagine he was going to find that plantation on a night when all
plantations were exactly alike, and all the same color. But I held in. I
used to have fine inspirations of prudence in those days.

Mr. Bixby made for the shore and soon was scraping it, just the same as
if it had been daylight. And not only that but singing:

             “Father in heaven, the day is declining,” etc.

It seemed to me that I had put my life into the keeping of a peculiarly
reckless outcast. Presently he turned on me and said:

“What’s the name of the first point above New Orleans?”

I was gratified to be able to answer promptly, and I did. I said I
didn’t know.

“Don’t _know_?”

This manner jolted me. I was down at the foot again, in a moment. But I
had to say just what I had said before.

“Well, you’re a smart one!” said Mr. Bixby. “What’s the name of the
_next_ point?”

Once more I didn’t know.

“Well, this beats anything. Tell me the name of any point or place I
told you.”

I studied a while and decided that I couldn’t.

“Look here! What do you start out from, above Twelve-Mile Point, to
cross over?”

“I—I—don’t know.”

“You—you—don’t know?” mimicking my drawling manner of speech. “What _do_
you know?”

“I—I—nothing, for certain.”

“By the great Cæsar’s ghost, I believe you! You’re the stupidest
dunderhead I ever saw or ever heard of, so help me Moses! The idea of
_you_ being a pilot—_you_! Why you don’t know enough to pilot a cow down
a lane.”

Oh, but his wrath was up! He was a nervous man, and he shuffled from one
side of his wheel to the other as if the floor was hot. He would boil a
while to himself, and then overflow and scald me again.

“Look here! What do you suppose I told you the names of those points
for?”

I tremblingly considered a moment, and the devil of temptation provoked
me to say:

“Well—to—to—be entertaining, I thought.”

This was a red flag to the bull. He raged and stormed so (he was
crossing the river at the time) that I judge it made him blind, because
he ran over the steering-gear of a trading-scow. Of course the traders
sent up a volley of red-hot profanity. Never was a man so grateful as
Mr. Bixby was; because he was brimful, and here were subjects who could
_talk back_. He threw open a window, thrust his head out and such an
eruption followed as I never had heard before. The fainter and farther
away the scowmen’s curses drifted, the higher Mr. Bixby lifted his voice
and the weightier his adjectives grew. When he closed the window he was
empty. You could have drawn a seine through his system and not caught
curses enough to disturb your mother with. Presently he said to me in
the gentlest way:

“My boy, you must get a little memorandum book; and every time I tell
you a thing, put it down right away. There’s only one way to be a pilot,
and that is to get this entire river by heart. You have to know it just
like A B C.”

That was a dismal revelation to me; for my memory was never loaded with
anything but blank cartridges. However, I did not feel discouraged long.
I judged that it was best to make allowances, for doubtless Mr. Bixby
was “stretching.” Presently he pulled a rope and struck a few strokes on
the big bell. The stars were all gone now, and the night was as black as
ink. I could hear the wheels churn along the bank, but I was not
entirely certain that I could see the shore. The voice of the invisible
watchman called up from the hurricane deck:

“What’s this, sir?”

“Jones’s plantation.”

I said to myself, “I wish that I might venture to offer a small bet that
it isn’t,” But I did not chirp. I only waited to see. Mr. Bixby handled
the engine bells, and in due time the boat’s nose came to the land, a
torch glowed from the forecastle, a man skipped ashore, a darkey’s voice
on the bank said, “Gimme de k’yarpet bag, Mass’ Jones,” and the next
moment we were standing up the river again, all serene. I reflected
deeply a while, and then said—but not aloud—“Well, the finding of that
plantation was the luckiest accident that ever happened; but it couldn’t
happen again in a hundred years.”


                           PERPLEXING LESSONS

At the end of what seemed a tedious while, I had managed to pack my head
full of islands, towns, bars, “points,” and bends, and a curiously
inanimate mass of lumber it was, too. However, inasmuch as I could shut
my eyes and reel off a good long string of these names without leaving
out more than ten miles of river in every fifty, I began to feel that I
could take a boat down to New Orleans if I could make her skip those
little gaps. But of course my complacency could hardly get start enough
to lift my nose a trifle into the air, before Mr. Bixby would think of
something to fetch it down again. One day he turned on me suddenly with
this settler:

“What is the shape of Walnut Bend?”

He might as well have asked me my grandmother’s opinion of protoplasm. I
reflected respectfully, and then said I didn’t know it had any
particular shape. My gunpowdery chief went off with a bang, of course,
and then went on loading and firing until he was out of adjectives.

I had learned long ago that he only carried just so many rounds of
ammunition and was sure to subside into a very placable and even
remorseful old smoothbore as soon as they were all gone. That word “old”
is merely affectionate; he was not more than thirty-four. I waited. By
and by he said:

“My boy, you’ve got to know the _shape_ of the river perfectly. It is
all there is left to steer by on a very dark night. Everything else is
blotted out and gone. But mind you, it hasn’t the same shape in the
night that it has in the daytime.”

“How on earth am I ever going to learn it then?”

“How do you follow a hall at home in the dark? Because you know the
shape of it. You can’t see it.”

“Do you mean to say that I’ve got to know all the million trifling
variations of shape in the banks of this interminable river as well as I
know the shape of the front hall at home?”

“On my honor, you’ve got to know them _better_ than any man ever did
know the shapes of the halls in his own house.”

“I wish I was dead!”

“Now, I don’t want to discourage you, but——”

“Well, pile it on me; I might as well have it now as another time.”

“You see, this has got to be learned; there isn’t any getting around it.
A clear starlight night throws such heavy shadows that, if you didn’t
know the shape of a shore perfectly, you would claw away from every
bunch of timber, because you would take the black shadow of it for a
solid cape; and you see you would be getting scared to death every
fifteen minutes by the watch. You would be fifty yards from shore all
the time when you ought to be within fifty feet of it. You can’t see a
snag in one of those shadows, but you know exactly where it is, and the
shape of the river tells you when you are coming to it. Then there’s
your pitch-dark night; the river is a very different shape on a
pitch-dark night from what it is on a starlight night. All shores seem
to be straight lines, then, and mighty dim ones, too; and you’d _run_
them for straight lines, only you know better. You boldly drive your
boat right into what seems to be a solid, straight wall (you knowing
very well that in reality there is a curve there), and that wall falls
back and makes way for you. Then there’s your gray mist. You take a
night when there’s one of these grisly drizzly, gray mists, and then
there isn’t _any_ particular shape to a shore. A gray mist would tangle
the head of the oldest man that ever lived. Well, then, different kinds
of _moonlight_ change the shape of the river in different ways. You
see——”

“Oh, don’t say any more, please! Have I got to learn the shape of the
river according to all these five hundred thousand different ways? If I
tried to carry all that cargo in my head it would make me
stoop-shouldered.”

“_No!_ you only learn the shape of _the_ river; and you learn it with
such absolute certainty that you can always steer by the shape that’s
_in your head_, and never the one that’s before your eyes.”

“Very well, I’ll try it; but, after I have learned it, can I depend on
it? Will it keep the same form and not go fooling around?”

Before Mr. Bixby could answer, Mr. W. came in to take the watch and he
said:

“Bixby, you’ll have to look out for President’s Island, and all that
country clear away up above the Old Hen and Chickens. The banks are
caving and the shape of the shore changing like everything. Why you
wouldn’t know the point above 40. You can go up inside the old sycamore
snag, now.”

So that question was answered. Here were leagues of shore changing
shape. My spirits were down in the mud again. Two things seemed pretty
apparent to me. One was, that in order to be a pilot a man has got to
learn more than any one man ought to be allowed to know; and the other
was, that he must learn it all over again in a different way every
twenty-four hours.

That night we had the watch until twelve. Now it was an ancient river
custom for the two pilots to chat a bit when the watch changed. While
the relieving pilot put on his gloves and lit his cigar, his partner,
the retiring pilot, would say something like this:

“I judge the upper bar is making down a little at Hale’s Point; had
quarter twain with the lower lead and mark twain with the other.”

“Yes, I thought it was making down a little, last trip. Meet any boats?”

“Met one abreast the head of 21, but she was away over hugging the bar,
and I couldn’t make her out entirely. I took her for the _Sunny
South_—hadn’t any skylight forward of the chimneys.”

And so on. And as the relieving pilot took the wheel his partner would
mention that we were in such-and-such a bend, and say we were abreast of
such a man’s woodyard or plantation. This was courtesy; I supposed it
was _necessity_. But Mr. W. came on watch full twelve minutes late on
this particular night—a tremendous breach of etiquette; in fact, it is
the unpardonable sin among pilots. So Mr. Bixby gave him no greeting
whatever, but simply surrendered the wheel and marched out of the
pilot-house without a word. I was appalled; it was a villainous night
for blackness, we were in a particularly wide and blind part of the
river, where there was no shape or substance to anything, and it seemed
incredible that Mr. Bixby should have left that poor fellow to kill the
boat trying to find out where he was. But I resolved that I would stand
by him anyway. He should find that he was not wholly friendless. So I
stood around, and waited to be asked where we were. But Mr. W. plunged
on serenely through the solid firmament of black cats that stood for an
atmosphere and never opened his mouth. “He is a proud devil!” thought I;
“here is a limb of Satan that would rather send us all to destruction
than put himself under obligations to me, because I am not yet one of
the salt of the earth and privileged to snub captains and lord it over
everything dead and alive in a steamboat.” I presently climbed up on the
bench; I did not think it was safe to go to sleep while this lunatic was
on watch.

However, I must have gone to sleep in the course of time, because the
next thing I was aware of was the fact that day was breaking, Mr. W.
gone, and Mr. Bixby at the wheel again. So it was four o’clock and all
well—but me; I felt like a skinful of dry bones, and all of them trying
to ache at once.

Mr. Bixby asked me what I had stayed up there for. I confessed that it
was to do Mr. W. a benevolence—tell him where he was. It took five
minutes for the entire preposterousness of the thing to filter into Mr.
Bixby’s system, and then I judged it filled him nearly up to the chin;
because he paid me a compliment—and not much of a one either. He said:

“Well, taking you by and large, you seem to be more different kinds of
an ass than any creature I ever saw before. What did you suppose he
wanted to know for?”

I said I thought it might be a convenience to him.

“Convenience! D——nation! Didn’t I tell you that a man’s got to know the
river in the night the same as he’d know his front hall?”

“Well, I can follow the front hall in the dark if I know it _is_ the
front hall; but suppose you set me down in the middle of it in the dark
and did not tell me which hall it is; how am I to know?”

“Well, you’ve _got_ to, on the river!”

“All right. Then I’m glad I never said anything to Mr. W.”

“I should say so! Why, he’d have slammed you through the window and
utterly ruined a hundred dollars’ worth of window-sash and stuff.”

I was glad this damage had been saved, for it would have made me
unpopular with the owners. They always hated anybody who had the name of
being careless and injuring things.

I went to work now to learn the shape of the river; and of all the
eluding and ungraspable objects that ever I tried to get mind or hands
on, that was the chief. I would fasten my eyes upon a sharp, wooded
point that projected far into the river some miles ahead of me, and go
laboriously photographing its shape into my brain; and just as I was
beginning to succeed to my satisfaction, we would draw up toward it and
the exasperating thing would begin to melt away and fold back into the
bank! If there had been a conspicuous dead tree standing up in the very
point of the cape, I would find that tree inconspicuously merged into
the general forest, and occupying the middle of a straight shore, when I
got abreast of it! No prominent hill would stick to its shape long
enough for me to make up my mind what its form really was, but it was as
dissolving and changeful as if it had been a mountain of butter in the
hottest corner of the tropics. Nothing ever had the same shape when I
was coming down-stream that it had borne when I went up. I mentioned
these little difficulties to Mr. Bixby. He said:

“That’s the very main virtue of the thing. If the shapes didn’t change
every three seconds they wouldn’t be of any use. Take this place where
we are now, for instance. As long as that hill over yonder is only one
hill, I can boom right along the way I’m going; but the moment it splits
at the top and forms a V, I know I’ve got to scratch to starboard in a
hurry, or I’ll bang this boat’s brains out against a rock; and then the
moment one of the prongs of the V swings behind the other, I’ve got to
waltz to larboard again, or I’ll have a misunderstanding with a snag
that would snatch the keelson out of this steamboat as neatly as if it
were a sliver in your hand. If that hill didn’t change its shape on bad
nights there would be an awful steamboat graveyard around here inside of
a year.”

It was plain that I had got to learn the shape of the river in all the
different ways that could be thought of,—upside down, wrong end first,
inside out, fore-and-aft, and “thortships,”—and then know what to do on
gray nights when it hadn’t any shape at all. So I set about it. In the
course of time I began to get the best of this knotty lesson, and my
self-complacency moved to the front once more. Mr. Bixby was all fixed,
and ready to start it to the rear again. He opened on me in this
fashion:

“How much water did we have in the middle crossing at Hole-in-the-Wall,
trip before last?”

I considered this an outrage. I said:

“Every trip, down and up, the leadsmen are singing through that tangled
place for three-quarters of an hour on a stretch. How do you reckon I
can remember such a mess as that?”

“My boy, you’ve got to remember it. You’ve got to remember the exact
spot and the exact marks the boat lay in when we had the shoalest water,
in every one of the five hundred shoal places between St. Louis and New
Orleans; and you mustn’t get the shoal soundings and marks of one trip
mixed up with the shoal soundings and marks of another, either, for
they’re not often twice alike. You must keep them separate.”

When I came to myself again, I said:

“When I get so that I can do that, I’ll be able to raise the dead, and
then I won’t have to pilot a steamboat to make a living. I want to
retire from this business. I want a slush-bucket and a brush; I’m only
fit for a roustabout. I haven’t got brains enough to be a pilot; and if
I had I wouldn’t have strength enough to carry them around unless I went
on crutches.”

“Now, drop that! When I say I’ll learn a man the river, I mean it. And
you can depend on it, I’ll learn him or kill him.”


                           A TEST OF COURAGE

The growth of courage in the pilot-house is steady all the time, but it
does not reach a high and satisfactory condition until sometime after
the young pilot has been “standing his own watch” alone and under the
staggering weight of all the responsibilities connected with the
position. When an apprentice has become pretty thoroughly acquainted
with the river, he goes clattering along so fearlessly with his
steamboat, night or day, that he presently begins to imagine that it is
_his_ courage that animates him; but the first time the pilot steps out
and leaves him to his own devices he finds out it was the other man’s.
He discovers that the article has been left out of his own cargo
altogether. The whole river is bristling with exigencies in a moment; he
is not prepared for them; he does not know how to meet them; all his
knowledge forsakes him; and within fifteen minutes he is as white as a
sheet and scared almost to death. Therefore, pilots wisely train these
cubs by various strategic tricks to look danger in the face a little
more calmly. A favorite way of theirs is to play a friendly swindle upon
the candidate.

Mr. Bixby served me in this fashion once, and for years afterward I used
to blush, even in my sleep, when I thought of it. I had become a good
steersman; so good, indeed, that I had all the work to do on our watch,
night and day. Mr. Bixby seldom made a suggestion to me; all he ever did
was to take the wheel on particularly bad nights or in particularly bad
crossings, land the boat when she needed to be landed, play gentleman of
leisure nine-tenths of the watch, and collect the wages. The lower river
was about bank-full, and if anybody had questioned my ability to run any
crossing between Cairo and New Orleans without help or instruction, I
should have felt irreparably hurt. The idea of being afraid of any
crossing in the lot, in the _daytime_, was a thing too preposterous for
contemplation. Well, one matchless summer’s day I was bowling down the
bend above Island 66, brim full of self-conceit and carrying my nose as
high as a giraffe’s, when Mr. Bixby said:

“I am going below a while. I suppose you know the next crossing?”

This was almost an affront. It was about the plainest and simplest
crossing in the whole river. One couldn’t come to any harm, whether he
ran it right or not; and as for depth, there never had been any bottom
there. I knew all this perfectly well.

“Know how to _run_ it? Why, I can run it with my eyes shut.”

“How much water is there in it?”

“Well, that is an odd question. I couldn’t get bottom there with a
church steeple.”

“You think so, do you?”

The very tone of the question shook my confidence. That was what Mr.
Bixby was expecting. He left, without saying anything more. I began to
imagine all sorts of things. Mr. Bixby, unknown to me, of course, sent
somebody down to the forecastle with some mysterious instructions to the
leadsmen, another messenger was sent to whisper among the officers, and
then Mr. Bixby went into hiding behind a smoke-stack where he could
observe results. Presently the captain stepped out on the hurricane
deck; next the chief mate appeared; then a clerk. Every moment or two a
straggler was added to my audience; and before I got to the head of the
island I had fifteen or twenty people assembled down there under my
nose. I began to wonder what the trouble was. As I started across, the
captain glanced aloft at me and said, with a sham uneasiness in his
voice:

“Where is Mr. Bixby?”

“Gone below, sir.”

But that did the business for me. My imagination began to construct
dangers out of nothing, and they multiplied faster than I could keep the
run of them. All at once I imagined I saw shoal water ahead! The wave of
coward agony that surged through me then came near dislocating every
joint in me. All my confidence in that crossing vanished. I seized the
bell-rope; dropped it, ashamed; seized it again; dropped it once more;
clutched it tremblingly once again, and pulled it so feebly that I could
hardly hear the stroke myself. Captain and mate sang out instantly, and
both together:

“Starboard lead there! and quick about it!” This was another shock. I
began to climb the wheel like a squirrel; but I would hardly get the
boat started to port before I would see new dangers on that side, and
away I would spin to the other; only to find perils accumulating to
starboard, and be crazy to get to port again. Then came the leadsman’s
sepulchral cry:

“D-e-e-p four!”

Deep four in a bottomless crossing! The terror of it took my breath
away.

“M-a-r-k three! M-a-r-k three! Quarter-less-three! Half twain!”

This was frightful! I seized the bell-rope and stopped the engines.

“Quarter twain! Quarter twain! _Mark_ twain!”

I was helpless. I did not know what in the world to do. I was quaking
from head to foot, and I could have hung my hat on my eyes, they stuck
out so far.

“Quarter-_less_-twain! Nine-and-a-half!”

We were _drawing_ nine! My hands were in a nerveless flutter. I could
not ring a bell intelligibly with them. I flew to the speaking-tube and
shouted to the engineer:

“Oh, Ben, if you love me, _back_ her! Quick, Ben! Oh, back the immortal
_soul_ out of her!”

I heard the door close gently. I looked around, and there stood Mr.
Bixby, smiling, a bland, sweet smile. Then the audience on the hurricane
deck sent up a thundergust of humiliating laughter. I saw it all, now,
and I felt meaner than the meanest man in human history. I laid in the
lead, set the boat in her marks, came ahead on the engines, and said:

“It was a fine trick to play on an orphan, _wasn’t_ it? I suppose I’ll
never hear the last of how I was ass enough to heave the lead at the
head of 66.”

“Well, no, you won’t, maybe. In fact I hope you won’t; for I want you to
learn something by that experience. Didn’t you know there was no bottom
in that crossing?”

“Yes, sir, I did.”

“Very well, then. You shouldn’t have allowed me or anybody else to shake
your confidence in that knowledge. Try to remember that. And another
thing: when you get into a dangerous place, don’t turn coward. That
isn’t going to help matters any.”

It was a good enough lesson, but pretty hardly learned. Yet about the
hardest part of it was that for months I so often had to hear a phrase
which I had conceived a particular distaste for. It was, “Oh, Ben, if
you love me, back her!”




              _FROM_ “THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER” (1877–80)


                     BIRTHS OF HIGH AND LOW DEGREE

In the ancient city of London, on a certain autumn day, in the second
quarter of the sixteenth century, a boy was born to a poor family of the
name of Canty, who did not want him. On the same day another English
child was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him.
All England wanted him, too. England had so longed for him, and hoped
for him, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the
people went nearly mad for joy. Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed
each other and cried. Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich
and poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they
kept this up for days and nights together. By day, London was a sight to
see, with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and
splendid pageants marching along. By night it was again a sight to see,
with its great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of revelers
making merry around them. There was no talk in all England but of the
new baby, Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in silks and
satins, unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that great lords
and ladies were tending him and watching over him—and not caring,
either. But there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty, lapped in
his poor rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had just come
to trouble with his presence.


                             THE CANTY HOME

The house which Tom’s father lived in was up a foul little pocket called
Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane. It was small, decayed, and rickety,
but it was packed full of wretchedly poor families. Canty’s tribe
occupied a room on the third floor. The mother and father had a sort of
bedstead in the corner; but Tom, his grandmother, and his two sisters,
Bet and Nan, were not restricted—they had all the floor to themselves,
and might sleep where they chose. There were the remains of a blanket or
two, and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw, but these could not
rightly be called beds, for they were not organized; they were kicked
into a general pile mornings, and selections made from the mass at
night, for service.


                             LONDON BRIDGE

This structure, which had stood for six hundred years, and had been a
noisy and populous thoroughfare all that time, was a curious affair, for
a closely packed rank of stores and shops, with family quarters
overhead, stretched along both sides of it, from one bank of the river
to the other. The Bridge was a sort of a town to itself; it had its inn,
its beer houses, its bakeries, its haberdasheries, its food markets, its
manufacturing industries and even its church. It looked upon the two
neighbors which it linked together—London and Southwark—as being well
enough, as suburbs, but not otherwise particularly important. It was a
close corporation, so to speak; it was a narrow town, of a single street
a fifth of a mile long, its population was but a village population, and
everybody in it knew all his fellow townsmen intimately, and had known
their fathers and mothers before them—and all their little family
affairs into the bargain. It had its aristocracy, of course—its fine old
families of butchers, and bakers, and what-not, who had occupied the
same old premises for five or six hundred years, and knew the great
history of the Bridge from beginning to end, and all its strange
legends; and who always talked bridgy talk, and thought bridgy thoughts,
and lied in a long, level, direct, substantial bridgy way.


                            TOM CANTY, KING

He opened his eyes—the richly clad First Lord of the Bedchamber was
kneeling by his couch. The gladness of the lying dream faded away—the
poor boy recognized that he was still a captive and a king. The room was
filled with courtiers clothed in purple mantles—the mourning
color[1]—and with noble servants of the monarch. Tom sat up in bed and
gazed out from the heavy silken curtains upon this fine company.

The weighty business of dressing began, and one courtier after another
knelt and paid his court and offered to the little king his condolences
upon his heavy loss, while the dressing proceeded. In the beginning, a
shirt was taken up by the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who passed it to the
First Lord of the Buckhounds, who passed it to the Second Gentleman of
the Bedchamber, who passed it to the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest, who
passed it to the Third Groom of the Stole, who passed it to the
Chancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, who passed it to the Master
of the Wardrobe, who passed it to Norroy King-at-Arms, who passed it to
the Constable of the Tower, who passed it to the Chief Steward of the
Household, who passed it to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, who passed it
to the Lord High Admiral of England, who passed it to the Archbishop of
Canterbury, who passed it to the First Lord of the Bedchamber, who took
what was left of it and put it on Tom. Poor little wondering chap, it
reminded him of passing buckets at a fire....

A secretary of state presented an order of the Council appointing the
morrow at eleven for the reception of the foreign ambassadors, and
desired the king’s assent.

Tom turned an inquiring look toward Hertford, who whispered:

“Your majesty will signify consent. They come to testify their royal
masters’ sense of the heavy calamity which hath visited your grace and
the realm of England.”

Tom did as he was bidden. Another secretary began to read a preamble
concerning the expenses of the late king’s household, which had amounted
to £28,000 during the preceding six months—a sum so vast that it made
Tom Canty gasp; he gasped again when the fact appeared that £20,000 of
this money were still owing and unpaid; and once more when it appeared
that the king’s coffers were about empty, and his twelve hundred
servants much embarrassed for lack of the wages due them. Tom spoke out,
with lively apprehension.

“We be going to the dogs, ’tis plain. ’Tis meet and necessary that we
take a smaller house and set the servants at large, sith they be of no
value but to make delay, and trouble one with offices that harass the
spirit and shame the soul, they misbecoming any but a doll, that hath
nor brains nor hands to help itself withal. I remember me of a small
house that standeth over against the fish-market, by Billingsgate——”

A sharp pressure upon Tom’s arm stopped his foolish tongue and sent a
blush to his face; but no countenance there betrayed any sign that this
strange speech had been remarked or given concern.


                       THE LITTLE KING IN PRISON

Hendon’s[2] arts all failed with the king—he could not be comforted, but
a couple of women who were chained near him, succeeded better. Under
their gentle ministrations he found peace and learned a degree of
patience. He was very grateful, and came to love them dearly and to
delight in the sweet and soothing influence of their presence. He asked
them why they were in prison, and when they said they were Baptists, he
smiled and inquired:

“Is that a crime to be shut up for in a prison? Now I grieve, for I
shall lose ye—they will not keep ye long for such a little thing.”

They did not answer; and something in their faces made him uneasy. He
said, eagerly:

“You do not speak—be good to me, and tell me—there will be no other
punishment? Prithee, tell me there is no fear of that.”

They tried to change the topic, but his fears were aroused, and he
pursued it:

“Will they scourge thee? No, no, they would not be so cruel! Say they
would not. Come, they _will_ not, will they?”

The women betrayed confusion and distress, but there was no avoiding an
answer, so one of them said, in a voice choked with emotion:

“Oh, thou’lt break our hearts, thou gentle spirit! God will help us to
bear our——”

“It is a confession!” the king broke in. “Then they _will_ scourge thee,
the stony-hearted wretches. But oh, thou must not weep, I cannot bear
it. Keep up thy courage—I shall come to my own in time to save thee from
this bitter thing and I will do it!”

When the king awoke in the morning, the women were gone.

“They are saved!” he said, joyfully; then added, despondently, “but woe
is me!—for they were my comforters.”

Each of them had left a shred of ribbon pinned to his clothing, in token
of remembrance. He said he would keep these things always; and that soon
he would seek out these dear good friends of his and take them under his
protection.

Just then the jailer came in with some subordinates and commanded that
the prisoners be conducted to the jail-yard. The king was overjoyed—it
would be a blessed thing to see the blue sky and breathe the fresh air
once more. He fretted and chafed at the slowness of the officers, but
his turn came at last and he was released from his staple and ordered to
follow the other prisoners, with Hendon.

The court, or quadrangle, was stone-paved, and open to the sky. The
prisoners entered it through a massive archway of masonry, and were
placed in file, standing, with their backs against the wall. A rope was
stretched in front of them, and they were also guarded by their
officers. It was a chill and lowering morning, and a light snow which
had fallen during the night whitened the great empty space and added to
the general dismalness of its aspect. Now and then a wintry wind
shivered through the place and sent the snow eddying hither and thither.

In the center of the court stood two women, chained to posts. A glance
showed the king that these were his good friends. He shuddered, and said
to himself, “Alack, they are not gone free, as I had thought. To think
that such as these should know the lash!—in England! Ay, there’s the
shame of it—not in Heathenesse, but Christian England! They will be
scourged; and I, whom they have comforted and kindly entreated, must
look on and see the great wrong done; it is strange, so strange! that I,
the very source of power in this broad realm, am helpless to protect
them. But let these miscreants look well to themselves, for there is a
day coming when I will require of them a heavy reckoning for this work.
For every blow they strike now they shall feel a hundred then.”

A great gate swung open and a crowd of citizens poured in. They flocked
around the two women, and hid them from the king’s view. A clergyman
entered and passed through the crowd, and he also was hidden. The king
now heard talking, back and forth, as if questions were being asked and
answered, but he could not make out what was said. Next there was a deal
of bustle and preparation, and much passing and repassing of officials
through that part of the crowd that stood on the further side of the
women; and while this proceeded a deep hush gradually fell upon the
people.

Now, by command, the masses parted and fell aside, and the king saw a
spectacle that froze the marrow in his bones. Fagots had been piled
about the two women, and a kneeling man was lighting them!

The women bowed their heads, and covered their faces with their hands;
the yellow flames began to climb upward among the snapping and crackling
fagots, and wreaths of blue smoke to stream away on the wind; the
clergyman lifted his hands and began a prayer—just then two young girls
came flying through the great gate, uttering piercing screams, and threw
themselves upon the women at the stake. Instantly they were torn away by
the officers, and one of them was kept in a tight grip, but the other
broke loose, saying she would die with her mother; and before she could
be stopped she had flung her arms about her mother’s neck again. She was
torn away once more, and with her gown on fire. Two or three men held
her, and the burning portion of her gown was snatched off and thrown
flaming aside, she struggling all the while to free herself, and saying
she would be alone in the world now, and begging to be allowed to die
with her mother. Both the girls screamed continually, and fought for
freedom; but suddenly this tumult was drowned under a volley of
heart-piercing shrieks of mortal agony. The king glanced from the
frantic girls to the stake, then turned away and leaned his ashen face
against the wall, and looked no more. He said, “That which I have seen,
in that one little moment, will never go out from my memory, but will
abide there; and I shall see it all the days, and dream of it all the
nights, till I die. Would God I had been blind!”

Hendon was watching the king. He said to himself, with satisfaction,
“His disorder mendeth; he hath changed, and groweth gentler. If he had
followed his wont, he would have stormed at these varlets, and said he
was king, and commanded that the women be turned loose unscathed. Soon
his delusion will pass away and be forgotten, and his poor mind will be
whole again. God speed the day!”

That same day several prisoners were brought in to remain over night,
who were being conveyed, under guard, to various places in the kingdom,
to undergo punishment for crimes committed. The king conversed with
these,—he had made it a point, from the beginning, to instruct himself
for the kingly office by questioning prisoners whenever the opportunity
offered—and the tale of their woes wrung his heart. One of them was a
poor half-witted woman who had stolen a yard or two of cloth from a
weaver—she was to be hanged for it. Another was a man who had been
accused of stealing a horse; he said the proof had failed, and he had
imagined that he was safe from the halter; but no—he was hardly free
before he was arraigned for killing a deer in the king’s park; this was
proved against him, and now he was on his way to the gallows. There was
a tradesman’s apprentice whose case particularly distressed the king;
this youth said he found a hawk one evening that had escaped from its
owner, and he took it home with him, imagining himself entitled to it;
but the court convicted him of stealing it, and sentenced him to death.

The king was furious over these inhumanities, and wanted Hendon to break
jail and fly with him to Westminster, so that he could mount his throne
and hold out his scepter in mercy over these unfortunate people and save
their lives. “Poor child,” sighed Hendon, “these woeful tales have
brought his malady upon him again—alack, but for this evil hap, he would
have been well in a little time.”

Among these prisoners was an old lawyer—a man with a strong face and a
dauntless mien. Three years past, he had written a pamphlet against the
Lord Chancellor, accusing him of injustice, and had been punished for it
by the loss of his ears in the pillory and degradation from the bar, and
in addition had been fined £3,000 and sentenced to imprisonment for
life. Lately he had repeated his offense; and in consequence was now
under sentence to lose _what remained of his ears_, pay a fine of
£5,000, be branded on both cheeks, and remain in prison for life.

“These be honorable scars,” he said, and turned back his gray hair and
showed the mutilated stubs of what had once been his ears.

The king’s eyes burned with passion. He said: “None believe in
me—neither wilt thou. But no matter—within the compass of a month thou
shalt be free; and more, the laws that have dishonored thee, and shamed
the English name, shall be swept from the statute books. The world is
made wrong, kings should go to school to their own laws at times, and so
learn mercy.”


                          TOM CANTY THE FIRST

Whilst the true king wandered about the land, poorly clad, poorly fed,
cuffed and derided by tramps one while, herding with thieves and
murderers in a jail another, and called idiot and impostor by all
impartially, the mock King Tom Canty enjoyed a quite different
experience.

When we saw him last, royalty was just beginning to have a bright side
for him. This bright side went on brightening more and more every day;
in a very little while it was become almost all sunshine and
delightfulness. He lost his fears! his misgivings faded out and died;
his embarrassments departed, and gave place to an easy and confident
bearing.

He ordered my Lady Elizabeth and my Lady Jane Gray into his presence
when he wanted to play or talk, and dismissed them when he was done with
them, with the air of one familiarly accustomed to such performances. It
no longer confused him to have these lofty personages kiss his hand at
parting.

He came to enjoy being conducted to bed in state at night, and dressed
with intricate and solemn ceremony in the morning. It came to be a proud
pleasure to march to dinner attended by a glittering procession of
officers of state and gentlemen-at-arms; insomuch, indeed, that he
doubled his guard of gentlemen-at-arms, and made them a hundred. He
liked to hear the bugles sounding down the long corridors, and the
distant voices responding, “Way for the king!”

He even learned to enjoy sitting in throned state in council, and
seeming to be something more than the Lord Protector’s mouthpiece. He
liked to receive great ambassadors and their gorgeous trains, and listen
to the affectionate messages they brought from illustrious monarchs who
called him “brother.”

Oh, happy Tom Canty, late of Offal Court!


                           TOM IS RECOGNIZED

The great pageant moved on, and still on, under one triumphal arch after
another, and past a bewildering succession of spectacular and symbolical
tableaux, each of which typified and exalted some virtue, or talent, or
merit, of the little king’s. Throughout the whole of Cheapside, from
every penthouse and window, hung banners and streamers; and the richest
carpets, stuffs, and cloth-of-gold tapestried the streets,—specimens of
the great wealth of the stores within; and the splendor of this
throughfare was equaled in the other streets, and in some even
surpassed.

“And all these wonders and these marvels are to welcome me—me!” murmured
Tom Canty.

The mock king’s cheeks were flushed with excitement, his eyes were
flashing, his senses swam in a delirium of pleasure. At this point, just
as he was raising his hand to fling another rich largess, he caught
sight of a pale, astounded face which was strained forward out of the
second rank of the crowd, its intense eyes riveted upon him. A sickening
consternation struck through him; he recognized his mother! and up flew
his hand, palm outward, before his eyes,—that old involuntary gesture,
born of a forgotten episode, and perpetuated by habit. In an instant
more she had torn her way out of the press, and past the guards, and was
at his side. She embraced his leg, she covered it with kisses, she
cried, “O, my child, my darling!” lifting toward him a face that was
transfigured with joy and love. The same instant an officer of the
King’s Guard snatched her away with a curse, and sent her reeling back
whence she came, with a vigorous impulse from his strong arm. The words,
“I do not know you, woman!” were falling from Tom Canty’s lips when this
piteous thing occurred; but it smote him to the heart to see her treated
so; and as she turned for a last glimpse of him, whilst the crowd was
swallowing her from his sight, she seemed so wounded, so broken-hearted,
that a shame fell upon him which consumed his pride to ashes, and
withered his stolen royalty. His grandeurs were stricken valueless; they
seemed to fall away from him like rotten rags.

The procession moved on, and still on, through ever augmenting splendors
and ever augmenting tempests of welcome; but to Tom Canty they were as
if they had not been. He neither saw nor heard. Royalty had lost its
grace and sweetness; its pomps were become a reproach. Remorse was
eating his heart out. He said, “Would God I were free of my captivity!”




         _FROM_ “THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN” (1876–83)


            HUCK AND NIGGER JIM[3] START ON THEIR LONG DRIFT

When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the
cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;
so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug
wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things
dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above
the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps were out of
reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a
layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for
to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather
or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra
steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag
or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern
on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat
coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn’t have
to light it for the up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they
call a “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks
being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn’t always run
the channel, but hunted easy water.

This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current
that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked, and
we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of
solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking
up at the stars, and we didn’t ever feel like talking loud, and it
warn’t often that we laughed—only a little kind of a low chuckle. We had
mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us
at all—that night, nor the next, nor the next.

Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,
nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The
fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.
In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand
people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful
spread of lights at two o’clock that still night. There warn’t a sound
there; everybody was asleep.

Every night now I used to slip ashore toward ten o’clock at some little
village, and buy ten or fifteen cents’ worth of meal or bacon or other
stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn’t roosting
comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when
you get a chance, because if you don’t want him yourself you can easy
find somebody that does, and a good deed aint ever forgot. I never see
pap when he didn’t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to
say, anyway.


                  THE GRANGERFORD-SHEPHERDSON FEUD[4]

Col. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman all over;
and so was his family. He was well born, as the saying is, and that’s
worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said,
and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our
town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn’t no more quality
than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and
had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was
clean-shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the
thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high
nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep
back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as
you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was gray and straight
and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every day of
his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made
out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he
wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. He carried a mahogany
cane with a silver head to it. There warn’t no frivolishness about him,
not a bit, and he warn’t ever loud. He was as kind as he could be—you
could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence. Sometimes he
smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like
a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his
eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter
was afterwards. He didn’t ever have to tell anybody to mind their
manners—everybody was always good-mannered where he was. Everybody loved
to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always—I mean he made it
seem like good weather. When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful
dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn’t nothing go
wrong for a week.

When him and the old lady came down in the morning all the family got up
out of their chairs and give them good day, and didn’t set down again
till _they_ had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where
the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and
he held it in his hand and waited till Tom’s and Bob’s was mixed, and
then they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and madam”; and _they_
bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank,
all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and
the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and
give it to me and Buck,[5] and we drank to the old people too.

Bob was the oldest and Tom next—tall, beautiful men with very broad
shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. They
dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and
wore broad Panama hats.

Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud
and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn’t stirred up; but
when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,
like her father. She was beautiful.

So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. She was
gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.

Each person had their own nigger to wait on them—Buck too. My nigger had
a monstrous easy time, because I warn’t used to having anybody do
anything for me, but Buck’s was on the jump most of the time.

This was all there was of the family now, but there used to be
more—three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.

The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.
Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or
fifteen miles around, and stay five or six days, and have such
junketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the
woods daytimes, and balls at the house nights. These people was mostly
kinfolks of the family. The men brought their guns with them. It was a
handsome lot of quality, I tell you.

There was another clan of aristocracy around there—five or six
families—mostly of the name of Shepherdson. They was as high-toned and
well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords. The
Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat-landing, which was
about two miles above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with
a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on
their fine horses.

One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse
coming. We was crossing the road. Buck says:

“Quick! Jump for the woods!”

We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves. Pretty
soon a splendid young man came galloping down the road, setting his
horse easy and looking like a soldier. He had his gun across his pommel.
I had seen him before. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I heard Buck’s
gun go off at my ear, and Harney’s hat tumbled off from his head. He
grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid. But we
didn’t wait. We started through the woods on a run. The woods warn’t
thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet, and twice I
seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away the way he
came—to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn’t see. We never stopped
running till we got home. The old gentleman’s eyes blazed a minute—’twas
pleasure, mainly, I judged—then his face sort of smoothed down, and he
says, kind of gentle:

“I don’t like that shooting from behind a bush. Why didn’t you step into
the road, my boy?”

“The Shepherdsons don’t, father. They always take advantage.”

Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling
his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped. The two young
men looked dark, but never said nothing. Miss Sophia she turned pale,
but the color come back when she found the man warn’t hurt.

Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by
ourselves, I says:

“Did you want to kill him, Buck?”

“Well, I bet I did.”

“What did he do to you?”

“Him? He never done nothing to me.”

“Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?”

“Why, nothing—only it’s on account of the feud.”

“What’s a feud?”

“Why, where was you raised? Don’t you know what a feud is?”

“Never heard of it before—tell me about it.”

“Well,” says Buck, “a feud is this way: A man has a quarrel with another
man, and kills him; then that other man’s brother kills _him_; then the
other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the _cousins_
chip in—and by and by everybody’s killed off, and there ain’t no more
feud. But it’s kind of slow, and takes a long time.”

“Has this one been going on long, Buck?”

“Well, I should _reckon_! It started thirty year ago, or som’ers along
there. There was trouble ’bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle
it; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the man
that won the suit—which he would naturally do, of course. Anybody
would.”

“What was the trouble about, Buck?—land?”

“I reckon maybe—I don’t know.”

“Well, who done the shooting? Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?”

“Laws, how do _I_ know? It was so long ago.”

“Don’t anybody know?”

“Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they
don’t know now what the row was about in the first place.”

“Has there been many killed, Buck?”

“Yes; right smart chance of funerals. But they don’t always kill. Pa’s
got a few buckshot in him; but he don’t mind it ’cuz he don’t weigh
much, anyway. Bob’s been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom’s been
hurt once or twice.”

“Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?”

“Yes, we got one and they got one. ’Bout three months ago my cousin Bud,
fourteen years old, was riding through the woods on t’other side of the
river, and didn’t have no weapon with him, which was blame’ foolishness,
and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind him, and sees
old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin’ after him with his gun in his hand and
his white hair a-flying in the wind; and ’stead of jumping off and
taking to the brush, Bud ’lowed he could outrun him; so they had it, nip
and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all the time; so
at last Bud seen it warn’t any use, so he stopped and faced around so as
to have the bullet-holes in front, you know, and the old man he rode up
and shot him down. But he didn’t get much chance to enjoy his luck, for
inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.”

“I reckon that old man a coward, Buck.”

“I reckon he _warn’t_ a coward. Not by a blame’ sight. There ain’t a
coward amongst them Shepherdsons—not a one. And there ain’t no cowards
amongst the Grangerfords either. Why, that old man kep’ up his end in a
fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come out
winner. They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got behind
a little woodpile, and kep’ his horse before him to stop the bullets;
but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old
man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them. Him and his
horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the Grangerfords had
to be _fetched_ home—and one of ’em was dead, and another died the next
day. No, sir; if a body’s out hunting for cowards he don’t want to fool
away any time amongst them Shepherdsons becuz they don’t breed any of
that _kind_.”

Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody
a-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept them
between their knees or stood them handy against the wall. The
Shepherdsons done the same. It was pretty ornery preaching—all about
brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was a
good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such a
powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and
preforeordestination, and I don’t know what all, that it did seem to me
to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.

About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their
chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. Buck and a
dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. I went up to
our room, and judged I would take a nap myself. I found that sweet Miss
Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took me in
her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her, and I
said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and not
tell anybody, and I said I would. Then she said she’d forgot her
Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books,
and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say
nothing to nobody. I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the
road, and there warn’t anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two,
for there warn’t any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor
in summertime because it’s cool. If you notice, most folks don’t go to
church only when they’ve got to; but a hog is different.

Says I to myself, something’s up; it ain’t natural for a girl to be in
such a sweat about a Testament. So I give it a shake, and out drops a
little piece of paper with “_Half-past two_” wrote on it with a pencil.
I ransacked it, but couldn’t find anything else. I couldn’t make
anything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I
got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me.
She pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament
till she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad;
and before a body could think she grabbed me and gave me a squeeze, and
said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. She was
mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it
made her powerful pretty. I was a good deal astonished, but when I got
my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I
had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing,
and I told her “no, only coarse-hand,” and then she said the paper
warn’t anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and
play now.

I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon
I noticed that my nigger was following along behind. When we was out of
sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes
a-running and says:

“Mars Jawge,[6] if you’ll come down into de swamp I’ll show you a whole
stack o’ water-moccasins.”

Thinks I, that’s mighty curious; he said that yesterday. He oughter to
know a body don’t love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for
them. What is he up to, anyway? So I says:

“All right; trot ahead.”

I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded
ankle-deep as much as another half-mile. We come to a little flat piece
of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines,
and he says:

“You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; Dah’s whah dey is.
I’s seed ’m befo’; I don’t k’yer to see ’em no mo’.”

Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid
him. I poked into the place a ways and come to a little open patch as
big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man lying there
asleep—and, by jings, it was my old Jim!

I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to
him to see me again, but it warn’t. He nearly cried he was so glad, but
he warn’t surprised. Said he swum along behind me that night, and heard
me yell every time, but dasn’t answer, because he didn’t want nobody to
pick _him_ up and take him into slavery again. Says he:

“I got hurt a little, en couldn’t swim fas’, so I wuz a considerable
ways behine you towards de las’; when you landed I reck’ned I could
ketch up wid you on de lan’ ’dout havin’ to shout at you, but when I see
dat house I begin to go slow. I ’uz off too far to hear what dey say to
you—I wuz ’fraid o’ de dogs; but when it ’uz all quiet ag’in I knowed
you’s in de house, so I struck out for de woods to wait for day. Early
in de mawnin’ some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en dey
tuk me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can’t track me on accounts
o’ de water, end dey brings me truck to eat every night, en tells me how
you’s a-gittin’ along.”

“Why didn’t you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?”

“Well, ’twarn’t no use to ’sturb you, Huck, tell we could do sumfn—but
we’s all right, now. I ben a buyin’ pots en pans en vittles, as I got a
chanst, en a-patchin’ up de raf’, nights, when——”

“_What_ raft, Jim?”

“Our ole raf’.”

“You mean to say our old raft warn’t smashed all to flinders?”

“No, she warn’t. She was tore up a good deal—one en’ of her was; but dey
warn’t no great harm done, on’y our traps was mos’ all los’. Ef we hadn’
dive’ so deep en swum so fur under water, en de night hadn’t ben so
dark, en we warn’t so sk’yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin’
is, we’d a seed de raf’. But it’s jis’ as well we didn’t, ’kase now
she’s all fixed up ag’in mos’ as good as new, en we’s got a new lot o’
stuff, in the place o’ what ’uz los’.”

“Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim—did you catch her?”

“How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods? No; some er de niggers
foun’ her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben’, en dey hid her in a
crick ’mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin’ ’bout which un ’um
she b’long to de mos’ dat I come to heah ’bout it pooty soon, so I ups
en settles de trouble by tellin’ ’um she don’t b’long to none uv ’um,
but to you en me; en I ast ’m if dey gwyne to grab a young white
genlman’s propaty, en git a hid’n for it? Den I gin ’m ten cents apiece,
en dey ’uz mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo’ raf’s ’ud come along
en make ’m rich ag’in. Dey’s mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en
whatever I wants ’m to do fur me I doan’ have to ast ’m twice, honey.
Dat Jack’s a good nigger, en pooty smart.”

“Yes, he is. He ain’t ever told me you was here; told me to come, and
he’d show me a lot of water-moccasins. If anything happens _he_ ain’t
mixed up in it. He can say he never seen us together, and it’ll be the
truth.”

I don’t want to talk much about the next day. I reckon I’ll cut it
pretty short. I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over and go
to sleep again when I noticed how still it was—didn’t seem to be anybody
stirring. That warn’t usual. Next I noticed that Buck was up and gone.
Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down-stairs—nobody around;
everything as still as a mouse. Just the same outside. Thinks I, what
does it mean? Down by the woodpile I comes across my Jack and says:

“What’s it all about?”

Says he:

“Don’t you know, Mars Jawge?”

“No,” says I, “I don’t.”

“Well, den, Miss Sophia’s run off! ’deed she has. She run off in de
night some time—nobody don’t know jis when; run off to get married to
dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know—leastways, so dey ’spec. De
fambly foun’ it out ’bout half an hour ago—maybe a little mo’—en’ I
_tell_ you dey warn’t no time los’. Sich another hurryin’ up guns en
hosses _you_ never see! De women folks has gone for to stir up de
relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de river
road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him ’fo’ he kin git
acrost de river wid Miss Sophia. I reck’n dey’s gwyne to be mighty rough
times.”

“Buck went off ’thout waking me up.”

“Well, I reck’n he _did_! Dey warn’t gwyne to mix you up in it. Mars
Buck loaded up his gun en ’lowed he’s gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson
or bust. Well, dey’ll be plenty un ’m dah, I reck’n, en you bet you
he’ll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.”

I took up the river road as hard as I could put. By and by I begin to
hear guns a good ways off. When I came into sight of the log store and
the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees
and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the forks
of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched. There was a
wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I
was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn’t.

There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open
place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at a
couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the
steamboat-landing—but they couldn’t come it. Every time one of them
showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at. The two
boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch
both ways.

By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. They started
riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady
bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. All
the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started
to carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the
run. They got half-way to the tree I was in before the men noticed. Then
the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after them.
They gained on the boys, but it didn’t do no good, the boys had too good
a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree, and
slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again. One of
the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen
years old.

The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. As soon as they was
out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him. He didn’t know what to
make of my voice coming out of the tree at first. He was awful
surprised. He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men
come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or
other—wouldn’t be gone long. I wished I was out of that tree, but I
dasn’t come down. Buck begun to cry and rip, and ’lowed that him and his
cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this day
yet. He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two or
three of the enemy. Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush. Buck
said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations—the
Shepherdsons was too strong for them. I asked him what was become of
young Harney and Miss Sophia. He said they’d got across the river and
was safe. I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take on because he
didn’t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him—I hain’t never
heard anything like it.

All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns—the men had
slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their
horses! The boys jumped for the river—both of them hurt—and as they swum
down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing
out, “Kill them, kill them!” It made me so sick I most fell out of the
tree. I ain’t a-going to tell _all_ that happened—it would make me sick
again if I was to do that. I wished I hadn’t ever come ashore that night
to see such things. I ain’t ever going to get shut of them—lots of times
I dream about them.

I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.
Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little
gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the
trouble was still a-going on. I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my
mind I wouldn’t ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I was
to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss
Sophia was to meet Harney some-wheres at half-past two, and run off; and
I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way
she acted, and then maybe he would ’a’ locked her up, and this awful
mess wouldn’t ever happened.

When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a
piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and
tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces,
and got away as quick as I could. I cried a little when I was covering
up Buck’s face, for he was mighty good to me.

It was just dark now. I never went near the house, but struck through
the woods and made for the swamp. Jim warn’t on his island, so I tramped
off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows, red-hot
to jump aboard and get out of that awful country. The raft was gone! My
souls, but I was scared! I couldn’t get my breath for most a minute.
Then I raised a yell. A voice not twenty-five foot from me, says:

“Good lan’! is dat you, honey? Doan’ make no noise.”

It was Jim’s voice—nothing ever sounded so good before. I run along the
bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was
so glad to see me. He says:

“Laws bless you, chile, I ’uz right down sho’ you’s dead ag’in. Jack’s
been heah; he say he reck’n you’s been shot, kase you didn’t come home
no mo’; so I’s jes’ dis minute a-startin’ er raf’ down towards de mouf
er de crick, so’s to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack
comes ag’in en tells me for certain you _is_ dead. Lawdy, I’s mighty
glad to git you back ag’in, honey.”

I says:

“All right—that’s mighty good; they won’t find me, and they’ll think
I’ve been killed, and floated down the river—there’s something up there
that’ll help them think so—so don’t you lose no time, Jim, but just
shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.”

I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the
middle of the Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal lantern, and
judged that we was free and safe once more. I hadn’t had a bite to eat
since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk, and
pork and cabbage and greens—there ain’t nothing in the world so good
when it’s cooked right—and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a
good time. I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was
Jim to get away from the swamp. We said there warn’t no home like a
raft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a
raft don’t. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.




     _FROM_ “A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR’S COURT” (1886–7)


                           MEETING THE YANKEE

It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I
am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid
simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the
restfulness of his company—for he did all the talking. We fell together,
as modest people will, in the tail of the herd that was being shown
through, and he at once began to say things which interested me. As he
talked along, softly, pleasantly, flowingly, he seemed to drift away
imperceptibly out of this world and time, and into some remote era and
old forgotten country; and so he gradually wove such a spell about me
that I seemed to move among the specters and shadows and dust and mold
of a gray antiquity, holding speech with a relic of it! Exactly as I
would speak of my nearest personal friends or enemies, or my most
familiar neighbors, he spoke of Sir Bedivere, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir
Launcelot of the Lake, Sir Galahad, and all the other great names of the
Table Round—and how old, old, unspeakably old and faded and dry and
musty and ancient he came to look as he went on! Presently he turned to
me and said, just as one might speak of the weather, or any other common
matter—

“You know about transmigration of souls; do you know about transposition
of epochs—and bodies?”

I said I had not heard of it. He was so little interested—just as when
people speak of the weather—that he did not notice whether I made him
any answer or not. There was half a moment of silence, immediately
interrupted by the droning voice of the salaried cicerone:

“Ancient hauberk, date of the sixth century, time of King Arthur and the
Round Table; said to have belonged to the knight Sir Sagramor le
Desirous; observe the round hole through the chain-mail in the left
breast; can’t be accounted for; supposed to have been done with a bullet
since invention of firearms—perhaps maliciously by Cromwell’s soldiers.”

My acquaintance smiled—not a modern smile, but one that must have gone
out of general use many, many centuries ago—and muttered, apparently to
himself:

“Wit ye well, _I saw it done_.” Then, after a pause, added: “I did it
myself.”

By the time I had recovered from the electric surprise of this remark,
he was gone.

All that evening I sat by my fire at the Warwick Arms, steeped in a
dream of the olden time, while the rain beat upon the windows, and the
wind roared about the eaves and corners. From time to time I dipped into
old Sir Thomas Malory’s enchanting book, and fed at its rich feast of
prodigies and adventures, breathed in the fragrance of its obsolete
names, and dreamed again.

As I laid the book down there was a knock at the door, and my stranger
came in. I gave him a pipe and a chair, and made him welcome. I also
comforted him with a hot Scotch whisky; gave him another one; then still
another—hoping always for his story. After a fourth persuader, he
drifted into it himself, in a quite simple and natural way:


                         THE STRANGER’S HISTORY

I am an American. I was born and reared in Hartford, in the State of
Connecticut—anyway, just over the river, in the country. So I am a
Yankee of the Yankees—and practical, yes, and nearly barren of
sentiment, I suppose—or poetry, in other words. My father was a
blacksmith, my uncle was a horse doctor, and I was both, along at first.
Then I went over to the great arms factory and learned my real trade;
learned all there was to it; learned to make everything: guns,
revolvers, cannon, boilers, engines, all sorts of labor-saving
machinery. Why, I could make anything a body wanted—anything in the
world, it didn’t make any difference what; and if there wasn’t any quick
new-fangled way to make a thing, I could invent one—and do it as easy as
rolling off a log. I became head superintendent; had a couple of
thousand men under me.

Well, a man like that is a man that is full of fight—that goes without
saying. With a couple of thousand men under one, one has plenty of that
sort of amusement. I had, anyway. At last I met my match, and I got my
dose. It was during a misunderstanding conducted with crowbars with a
fellow we used to call Hercules. He laid me out with a crusher alongside
the head that made everything crack, and seemed to spring every joint in
my skull and make it overlap its neighbor. Then the world went out in
darkness, and I didn’t feel anything more, and didn’t know anything at
all—at least for a while.

When I came to again, I was sitting under an oak tree, on the grass,
with a whole beautiful and broad country landscape all to myself—nearly.
Not entirely; for there was a fellow on a horse, looking down at me—a
fellow fresh out of a picture-book. He was in old-time iron armor from
head to heel, with a helmet on his head the shape of a nail-keg with
slits in it; and he had a shield, and a sword, and a prodigious spear;
and his horse had armor on, too, and a steel horn projecting from his
forehead, and gorgeous red and green silk trappings that hung down all
around him like a bedquilt, nearly to the ground.

“Fair sir, will ye just?” said this fellow.

“Will I which?”

“Will ye try a passage of arms for land or lady or for——”

“What are you giving me?” I said. “Get along back to your circus, or
I’ll report you.”

Now what does this man do but fall back a couple of hundred yards and
then come rushing at me as hard as he could tear, with his nail-keg bent
down nearly to his horse’s neck and his long spear pointed straight
ahead. I saw he meant business, so I was up the tree when he arrived.

He allowed that I was his property, the captive of his spear. There was
argument on his side—and the bulk of the advantage—so I judged it best
to humor him. We fixed up an agreement whereby I was to go with him and
he was not to hurt me. I came down, and we started away, I walking by
the side of his horse. We marched comfortably along, through glades and
over brooks which I could not remember to have seen before—which puzzled
me and made me wonder—and yet we did not come to any circus or sign of a
circus. So I gave up the idea of a circus, and concluded he was from an
asylum. But we never came to an asylum—so I was up a stump, as you may
say. I asked him how far we were from Hartford. He said he had never
heard of the place; which I took to be a lie, but allowed it to go at
that. At the end of an hour we saw a far-away town sleeping in a valley
by a winding river; and beyond it on a hill, a vast gray fortress, with
towers and turrets, the first I had ever seen out of a picture.

“Bridgeport,” said I, pointing.

“Camelot,” said he.

My stranger had been showing signs of sleepiness. He caught himself
nodding, now, and smiled one of those pathetic, obsolete smiles of his,
and said:

“I find I can’t go on; but come with me, I’ve got it all written out,
and you can read it, if you like.”

In his chamber, he said: “First, I kept a journal; then by and by, after
years, I took the journal and turned it into a book. How long ago that
was!”

He handed me his manuscript, and pointed out the place where I should
begin:

“Begin here—I’ve already told you what goes before.” He was steeped in
drowsiness by this time. As I went out at his door I heard him murmur
sleepily: “Give you good den, fair sir.”

I sat down by my fire and examined my treasure. The first part of it—the
great bulk of it—was parchment, and yellow with age. I scanned a leaf
particularly and saw that it was a palimpsest. Under the old dim writing
of the Yankee historian appeared traces of a penmanship which was older
and dimmer still—Latin words and sentences: fragments from old monkish
legends, evidently. I turned to the place indicated by my stranger and
began to read.


                           THE ROUND TABLE[7]

In the middle of this groined and vaulted public square was an oaken
table which was called the Table Round. It was as large as a circus
ring; and around it sat a great company of men dressed in such various
and splendid colors that it hurt one’s eyes to look at them. They wore
their plumed hats, right along, except that whenever one addressed
himself directly to the king, he lifted his hat a trifle just as he was
beginning his remark.

Mainly they were drinking—from entire ox horns; but a few were still
munching bread or gnawing beef bones. There was about an average of two
dogs to one man; and these sat in expectant attitudes till a spent bone
was flung to them, and then they went for it by brigades and divisions,
with a rush, and there ensued a fight which filled the prospect with a
tumultuous chaos of plunging heads and bodies and flashing tails, and
the storm of howlings and barkings deafened all speech for the time; but
that was no matter, for the dog-fight was always a bigger interest
anyway; the men rose, sometimes, to observe it the better and bet on it,
and the ladies and the musicians stretched themselves out over their
balusters with the same object; and all broke into delighted
ejaculation, from time to time. In the end, the winning dog stretched
himself out comfortably with his bone between his paws, and proceeded to
growl over it, and gnaw it, and grease the floor with it, just as fifty
others were already doing; and the rest of the court resumed their
previous industries and entertainments.

As a rule, the speech and behavior of these people were gracious and
courtly; and I noticed that they were good and serious listeners when
anybody was telling anything—I mean in a dog-fightless interval. And
plainly, too, they were a childlike and innocent lot; telling lies of
the stateliest pattern with a most gentle and winning naiveté, and ready
and willing to listen to anybody else’s lie, and believe it, too. It was
hard to associate them with anything cruel or dreadful; and yet they
dealt in tales of blood and suffering with a guileless relish that made
me almost forget to shudder.

Mainly the Round Table talk was monologues—narrative accounts of the
adventures in which these prisoners were captured and their friends and
backers killed and stripped of their steeds and armor. As a general
thing—as far as I could make out—these murderous adventures were not
forays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor to settle old disputes or
sudden fallings out; no, as a rule they were simple duels between
strangers—duels between people who had never even been introduced to
each other, and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever. Many
a time I had seen a couple of boys, strangers, meet by chance, and say
simultaneously, “I can lick you,” and go at it on the spot; but I had
always imagined until now that that sort of thing belonged to children
only, and was a sign and mark of childhood; but here were these big
boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age,
and beyond. Yet there was something very engaging about these great
simple-hearted creatures, something attractive and lovable. There did
not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to bait
a fish-hook with; but you didn’t seem to mind that; after a little, you
soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that, and indeed
would have marred it, spoiled its symmetry—perhaps rendered its
existence impossible.


                          THE YANKEE REFLECTS

Why, dear me, _any_ kind of royalty, howsoever modified, _any_ kind of
aristocracy, howsoever pruned, is rightly an insult; but if you are born
and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably never find it
out for yourself, and don’t believe it when somebody else tells you. It
is enough to make a body ashamed of his race to think of the sort of
froth that has always occupied its thrones without shadow of right or
reason, and the seventh-rate people that have always figured as its
aristocracies—a company of monarchs and nobles who, as a rule, would
have achieved only poverty and obscurity if left, like their betters, to
their own exertions.


                           PERFECT GOVERNMENT

The despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect government. An
earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect earthly government, if
the conditions were the same, namely, the despot the perfectest
individual of the human race, and his lease of life perpetual. But as a
perishable perfect man must die, and leave his despotism in the hands of
an imperfect successor, an earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of
government, it is the worst form that is possible.


                           MAIDS IN DISTRESS

There never was such a country for wandering liars; and they were of
both sexes. Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving;
and generally loaded with a tale about some princess or other wanting
help to get her out of some far-away castle where she was held in
captivity by a lawless scoundrel, usually a giant. Now you would think
that the first thing the king would do after listening to such a
novelette from an entire stranger, would be to ask for credentials—yes,
and a pointer or two as to locality of castle, best route to it, and so
on. But nobody ever thought of so simple and common-sense a thing as
that. No, everybody swallowed these people’s lies whole, and never asked
a question of any sort or about anything. Well, one day when I was not
around, one of these people came along—it was a she one, this time—and
told a tale of the usual pattern. Her mistress was a captive in a vast
and gloomy castle, along with forty-four other young and beautiful
girls, pretty much all of them princesses; they had been languishing in
that cruel captivity for twenty-six years; the masters of the castle
were three stupendous brothers, each with four arms and one eye—the eye
in the center of the forehead, and as big as a fruit. Sort of fruit not
mentioned; their usual slovenliness in statistics.

Would you believe it? The king and the whole Round Table were in
raptures over this preposterous opportunity for adventure. Every knight
of the Table jumped for the chance, and begged for it; but to their
vexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me, who had not asked
for it at all.


                           A KNIGHT’S AVERAGE

If knights errant were to be believed, not all castles were desirable
places to seek hospitality in. As a matter of fact, knights errant were
_not_ persons to be believed—that is, measured by modern standards of
veracity; yet, measured by the standards of their own time, and scaled
accordingly, you got the truth. It was very simple: you discounted a
statement ninety-seven per cent.; the rest was fact.


                         SIXTH CENTURY KINGDOMS

“Kings” and “Kingdoms” were as thick in Britain as they had been in
little Palestine in Joshua’s time, when people had to sleep with their
knees pulled up because they couldn’t stretch out without a passport.


                                 NATURE

Training—training is everything; training is all there is _to_ a person.
We speak of nature; what we call by that misleading name is heredity and
training. We have no thoughts of our own, no opinions of our own; they
are transmitted to us, trained into us. All that is original in us, and
therefore fairly creditable or discreditable to us, can be covered up
and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the rest being atoms
contributed by, and inherited from, a procession of ancestors that
stretches back a billion years to the Adam-clam or grasshopper or monkey
from whom our race has been so tediously and ostentatiously and
unprofitably developed.


                               CONSCIENCE

If I had the remaking of man, he wouldn’t have any conscience. It is one
of the most disagreeable things connected with a person; and although it
certainly does a great deal of good, it cannot be said to pay, in the
long run; it would be much better to have less good and more comfort.
Still, this is only my opinion, and I am only one man; others, with less
experience, may think differently. They have a right to their views. I
only stand to this; I have noticed my conscience for many years, and I
know it is more trouble and bother to me than anything else I started
with. I suppose that in the beginning I prized it, because we prize
anything that is ours; and yet how foolish it was to think so. If we
look at it in another way we see how absurd it is: if I had an anvil in
me would I prize it? Of course not. And yet when you come to think,
there is no real difference between a conscience and an anvil—I mean for
comfort. I have noticed it a thousand times. And you could dissolve an
anvil with acids, when you couldn’t stand it any longer; but there isn’t
any way that you can work off a conscience—at least, so it will stay
worked off; not that I know of, anyway.


                          THE GERMAN TONGUE[8]

I was gradually coming to have a mysterious and shuddery reverence for
this girl; nowadays whenever she pulled out from the station and got her
train fairly started on one of those horizonless transcontinental
sentences of hers, it was borne in upon me that I was standing in the
awful presence of the Mother of the German Language. I was so impressed
with this, that sometimes when she began to empty one of these sentences
on me I unconsciously took the very attitude of reverence, and stood
uncovered; and if words had been water, I had been drowned, sure. She
had exactly the German way; whatever was in her mind to be delivered,
whether a mere remark, or a sermon, or a cyclopædia, or the history of a
war, she would get it into a single sentence or die. Whenever the
literary German dives into a sentence, that is the last you are going to
see of him till he emerges on the other side of his Atlantic with his
verb in his mouth.


                        GOVERNMENT BY THE PEOPLE

There is a phrase which has grown so common in the world’s mouth that it
has come to seem to have sense and meaning—the sense and meaning implied
when it is used; that is the phrase which refers to this or that or the
other nation as possibly being “capable of self-government”; and the
implied sense of it is, that there has been a nation somewhere, some
time or other which _wasn’t_ capable of it—wasn’t as able to govern
itself as some self-appointed specialists were, or would be, to govern
it. The master minds of all nations, in all ages, have sprung in
affluent multitude from the mass of the nation, and from the mass of the
nation only—not from its privileged classes; and so, no matter what the
nation’s intellectual grade was, whether high or low, the bulk of its
ability was in the long ranks of its nameless and its poor, and so it
never saw the day that it had not the material in abundance whereby to
govern itself. Which is to assert an always self-proven fact; that even
the best governed and most free and most enlightened monarchy is still
behind the best condition attainable by its people; and that the same is
true of kindred governments of lower grades, all the way down to the
lowest.


                                PROPHECY

A prophet doesn’t have to have any brains. They are good to have, of
course, for the ordinary exigencies of life, but they are of no use in
professional work. It is the restfullest vocation there is. When the
spirit of prophecy comes upon you, you merely take your intellect and
lay it off in a cool place for a rest, and unship your jaw and leave it
alone; it will work itself: the result is prophecy.


                               HARD WORK

Words realize nothing, vivify nothing to you, unless you have suffered
in your own person the thing which the words try to describe. There are
wise people who talk ever so knowingly and complacently about “the
working classes,” and satisfy themselves that a day’s hard intellectual
work is very much harder than a day’s hard manual toil, and is
righteously entitled to much bigger pay. Why, they really think that,
you know, because they know all about the one, but haven’t tried the
other. But I know all about both; and so far as I am concerned, there
isn’t money enough in the universe to hire me to swing a pick-axe thirty
days, but I will do the hardest kind of intellectual work for just as
near nothing as you can cipher it down—and I will be satisfied, too.


                               STILL HOPE

Yes, there is plenty good enough material for a republic in the most
degraded people that ever existed—even the Russians; plenty of manhood
in them—even in the Germans—if one could but force it out of its timid
and suspicious privacy, to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne
that ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it.


                             THE HUMAN RACE

Toward the shaven monk who trudged along with his cowl tilted back and
the sweat washing down his fat jowls, the coal-burner was deeply
reverent; to the gentleman he was abject; with the small farmer and the
free mechanic he was cordial and gossipy; and when a slave passed by
with a countenance respectfully lowered, this chap’s nose was in the
air—he couldn’t even see him. Well, there are times when one would like
to hang the whole human race and finish the farce.


                         THE KING IN SLAVERY[9]

We had a rough time for a month, tramping to and fro in the earth, and
suffering. And what Englishman was the most interested in the slavery
question by that time? His grace, the king! Yes; from being the most
indifferent, he was become the most interested. He was become the
bitterest hater of the institution I had ever heard talk....

Now and then we had an adventure. One night we were overtaken by a
snow-storm while still a mile from the village we were making for.
Almost instantly we were shut up as in a fog, the driving snow was so
thick. You couldn’t see a thing, and we were soon lost. The slave-driver
lashed us desperately, for he saw ruin before him, but his lashings only
made matters worse, for they drove us further from the road and from
likelihood of succor. So we had to stop at last and slump down in the
snow where we were. The storm continued until toward midnight, then
ceased. By this time two of our feebler men and three of our women were
dead, and others past moving and threatened with death. Our master was
nearly beside himself. He stirred up the living and made us stand, jump,
slap ourselves, to restore our circulation, and he helped as well as he
could with his whip.

Now came a diversion. We heard shrieks and yells, and soon a woman came
running and crying; and seeing our group, she flung herself into our
midst and begged for protection. A mob of people came tearing after her,
some with torches, and they said she was a witch who had caused several
cows to die by a strange disease, and practiced her arts by help of a
devil in the form of a black cat. This poor woman had been stoned until
she hardly looked human, she was so battered and bloody. The mob wanted
to burn her.

Well, now, what do you suppose our master did? When we closed around
this poor creature to shelter her, he saw his chance. He said, burn her
here, or they shouldn’t have her at all. Imagine that! They were
willing. They fastened her to a post; they brought wood and piled it
about her; they applied the torch, while she shrieked and pleaded and
strained her two young daughters to her breast; and our brute, with a
heart solely for business, lashed us into position about the stake and
warmed us into life and commercial value by the same fire which took
away the innocent life of that poor harmless mother. That was the sort
of master we had. I took _his_ number. That snow-storm cost him nine of
his flock; and he was more brutal to us than ever, after that, for many
days together, he was so enraged over his loss.




          _FROM_ “RAMBLING NOTES OF AN IDLE EXCURSION” (1877)


                         WHAT WE SAW IN BERMUDA

We saw no bugs or reptiles to speak of, and so I was thinking of saying
in print in a general way, that there were none at all; but one night
after I had gone to bed, the Reverend came into my room carrying
something, and asked, “Is this your boot?” I said it was, and he said he
had met a spider going off with it. Next morning he stated that just at
dawn the same spider raised his window and was coming in to get his
shirt, but saw him and fled.

I inquired, “Did he get the shirt?”

“No.”

“How did you know it was a shirt he was after?”

“I could see it in his eyes.”

We inquired around, but could hear of no Bermudian spider capable of
doing these things. Citizens said that their largest spiders could not
more than spread their legs over an ordinary saucer, and that they had
always been considered honest. Here was testimony of a clergyman against
the testimony of mere worldlings—interested ones, too. On the whole, I
judged it best to lock up my things.

Here and there on the country roads we found lemon, papaw, orange, lime,
and fig-trees; also several sorts of palms, among them the cocoa, the
date, and the palmetto. We saw some bamboos forty feet high, with stems
as thick as a man’s arm. Jungles of the mangrove-tree stood up out of
swamps, propped on their interlacing roots, as upon a tangle of stilts.
In dryer places the noble tamarind sent down its grateful cloud of
shade. Here and there the blossomy tamarisk adorned the roadside. There
was a curious gnarled and twisted black tree, without a single leaf on
it. It might have passed itself off for a dead apple tree but for the
fact that it had a star-like, red-hot flower sprinkled sparsely over its
person. It had the scattery red glow that a constellation might have
when glimpsed through smoked glass....

We saw a tree that bears grapes, and just as calmly and unostentatiously
as a vine would do it. We saw an india-rubber-tree, but out of season,
possibly, so there were no shoes on it, nor suspenders, nor anything
that a person would properly expect to find there. This gave it an
impressively fraudulent look. There was exactly one mahogany tree on the
island. I know this to be reliable, because I saw a man who said he had
counted it many a time and could not be mistaken. He was a man with a
harelip and a pure heart, and everybody said he was as true as steel.
Such men are all too few.




             _FROM_ “PUDD’NHEAD WILSON’S CALENDAR” (1892–3)


Tell the truth or trump—but get the trick.


Adam was but human—this explains it all. He did not want the apple for
the apple’s sake, he wanted it only because it was forbidden. The
mistake was in not forbidding the serpent. Then he would have eaten the
serpent.


Whosoever has lived long enough to find out what life is, knows how deep
a debt of gratitude we owe to Adam, the first great benefactor of our
race. He brought death into the world.


Adam and Eve had many advantages, but the principal one was, that they
escaped teething.


There is this trouble about special providences—namely, there is so
often a doubt as to which party was intended to be the beneficiary. In
the case of the children, the bears, and the prophet, the bears got more
real satisfaction out of the episode than the prophet did, because they
got the children.


Training is everything. The peach was once a bitter almond; cauliflower
is nothing but cabbage with a college education.


Remarks of Dr. Baldwin’s, concerning upstarts: We don’t care to eat
toadstools that think they are truffles.


Let us endeavor so to live that when we come to die even the undertaker
will be sorry.


Habit is habit, and not to be flung out of the window by any man, but
coaxed down-stairs a step at a time.


One of the most striking differences between a cat and a lie is that a
cat has only nine lives.


The holy passion of Friendship is of so sweet and steady and loyal and
enduring a nature that it will last through a whole lifetime, if not
asked to lend money.


Consider well the proportions of things. It is better to be a young
junebug than an old bird of paradise.


Why is it that we rejoice at birth and grieve at a funeral? It is
because we are not the person involved.


It is easy to find fault, if one has that disposition. There was once a
man who, not being able to find any other fault with his coal,
complained that there were too many prehistoric toads in it.


All say, “How hard it is that we have to die”—a strange complaint to
come from the mouths of people who have had to live.


When angry, count four; when very angry, swear.


There are three infallible ways of pleasing an author, and the three
form a rising scale of compliment: 1, to tell him you have read one of
his books; 2, to tell him you have read all of his books; 3, to ask him
to let you read the manuscript of his forthcoming book. No. 1 admits you
to his respect; No. 2 admits you to his admiration; No. 3 carries you
clear into his heart.


As to the Adjective: when in doubt, strike it out.


Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear—not absence of fear.
Except a creature be part coward it is not a compliment to say it is
brave; it is merely a loose misapplication of the word. Consider the
flea!—incomparably the bravest of all the creatures of God, if ignorance
of fear were courage. Whether you are asleep or awake he will attack
you, caring nothing for the fact that in bulk and strength you are to
him as are the massed armies of the earth to a sucking child; he lives
both day and night and all days and nights in the very lap of peril and
the immediate presence of death, and yet is no more afraid than is the
man who walks the streets of a city that was threatened by an earthquake
ten centuries before. When we speak of Clive, Nelson and Putman as men
who “didn’t know what fear was,” we ought always to add the flea—and put
him at the head of the procession.


When I reflect upon the number of disagreeable people who I know have
gone to a better world, I am moved to lead a different life.


October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in
stocks in. The others are July, January, September, April, November,
May, March, June, December, August, and February.


The true Southern watermelon is a boon apart, and not to be mentioned
with commoner things. It is chief of this world’s luxuries, king by the
grace of God over all the fruits of the earth. When one has tasted it,
he knows what the angels eat. It was not a southern watermelon that Eve
took: we know it because she repented.


Nothing so needs reforming as other people’s habits.


Behold, the fool saith, “Put not all thine eggs in the one basket”—which
is but a manner of saying, “Scatter your money and your attention”; but
the wise man saith, “Put all your eggs in the one basket and—_watch that
basket_.”


If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite
you. This is the principal difference between a dog and a man.


We know all about the habits of the ant, we know all about the habits of
the bee, but we know nothing at all about the habits of the oyster. It
seems almost certain that we have been choosing the wrong time for
studying the oyster.


Even popularity can be overdone. In Rome, along at first, you are full
of regrets that Michelangelo died; but by and by you only regret that
you didn’t see him do it.


_July 4._ Statistics show that we lose more fools on this day than on
all the other days of the year put together. This proves, by the number
left in stock, that one Fourth of July per year is now inadequate, the
country has grown so.


Thanksgiving Day. Let all give humble, hearty, and sincere thanks, now,
but the turkeys. In the island of Fiji they do not use turkeys; they use
plumbers. It does not become you and me to sneer at Fiji.


Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good
example.


It were not best that we should all think alike; it is difference of
opinion that makes horse races.


Even the clearest and most perfect circumstantial evidence is likely to
be at fault, after all, and therefore ought to be received with great
caution. Take the case of any pencil, sharpened by any woman: if you
have witnesses, you will find she did it with a knife; but if you take
simply the aspect of the pencil, you will say she did it with her teeth.


_April 1._ This the day upon which we are reminded of what we are on the
other three hundred and sixty-four.


It is often the case that the man who can’t tell a lie thinks he is the
best judge of one.


October 12, the _Discovery_. It was wonderful to find America, but it
would have been more wonderful to miss it.




     _FROM_ “THE PRIVATE HISTORY OF A CAMPAIGN THAT FAILED” (1885)


                           THE MARION RANGERS

You have heard from a great many people who did something in the war; is
it not fair and right that you listen a little moment to one who started
out to do something in it, but didn’t? Thousands entered the war, got
just a taste of it, and then stepped out again permanently....

In that summer—of 1861—the first wash of the wave of war broke upon the
shores of Missouri. Our state was invaded by the Union forces. They took
possession of St. Louis, Jefferson Barracks, and some other points. The
Governor, Calib Jackson, issued his proclamation calling out fifty
thousand militia to repel the invader.

I was visiting in the small town where my boyhood had been
spent—Hannibal, Marion County. Several of us got together in a secret
place by night and formed ourselves into a military company. One Tom
Lyman, a young fellow of a good deal of spirit but of no military
experience, was made captain; I was made second lieutenant. We had no
first lieutenant; I do not know why; it was long ago. There were fifteen
of us. By the advice of an innocent connected with the organization we
called ourselves the Marion Rangers. I do not remember that any one
found fault with the name. I did not; I thought it sounded quite well.
The young fellow who proposed this title was perhaps a fair sample of
the kind of stuff we were made of. He was young, ignorant, good-natured,
well-meaning, trivial, full of romance, and given to reading chivalric
novels and singing forlorn love ditties. He had some pathetic little
nickel-plated aristocratic instincts, and detested his name, which was
Dunlap; detested it partly because it was nearly as common in that
region as Smith, but mainly because it had a plebeian sound to his ear.
So he tried to ennoble it by writing it in this way: _d’Unlap_. That
contented his eye, but left his ear unsatisfied, for people gave the new
name the same old pronunciation—emphasis on the front end of it. He then
did the bravest thing that can be imagined—a thing to make one shiver
when one remembers how the world is given to resenting shams and
affectations; he began to write his name so: _d’Un Lap_. And he waited
patiently through the long storm of mud that was flung at this work of
art, and he had his reward at last; for he lived to see that name
accepted, and the emphasis put where he wanted it by people who had
known him all his life, and to whom the tribe of Dunlaps had been as
familiar as the rain and sunshine for forty years. So sure of victory at
last is the courage that can wait. He said he had found, by consulting
some ancient French chronicles, that the name was rightly and originally
written d’Un Lap; and said that if it were translated into English it
would mean Peterson: _Lap_, Latin or Greek, he said, for stone or rock,
same as the French _pierre_, that is to say Peter; _d’_ of or from;
_un_, a or one; hence, d’Un Lap, of or from a stone or a Peter; that is
to say, one who is the son of a stone, the son of a Peter—Peterson. Our
militia company were not learned, and the explanation confused them; so
they called him Peterson Dunlap. He proved useful to us in his way; he
named our camps for us, and he generally struck a name that was “no
slouch,” as the boys said.

That is one sample of us. Another was Ed Stevens, son of the town
jeweler—trim built, handsome, graceful, neat as a cat; bright, educated,
but given over entirely to fun. There was nothing serious in life to
him. As far as he was concerned, this military expedition of ours was
simply a holiday. I should say that about half of us looked upon it in
the same way; not consciously perhaps, but unconsciously. We did not
think; we were not capable of it. As for myself, I was full of
unreasoning joy to be done with turning out of bed at midnight and four
in the morning for a while; grateful to have a change, new scenes, new
occupations, a new interest. In my thoughts that was as far as I went; I
did not go into the details; as a rule, one doesn’t at twenty-four.

Another sample was Smith, the blacksmith’s apprentice. This vast donkey
had some pluck, of a slow and sluggish nature, but a soft heart; at one
time he would knock a horse down for some impropriety, and at another he
would get homesick and cry. However, he had one ultimate credit to his
account which some of us hadn’t; he stuck to the war, and was killed in
battle at last.

Jo Bowers, another sample, was a huge, good-natured, flax-headed lubber;
lazy, sentimental, full of harmless brag, a grumbler by nature; an
experienced, industrious, ambitious, and often quite picturesque liar,
and yet not a successful one, for he had had no intelligent training,
but was allowed to come up just anyway. This life was serious enough to
him, and seldom satisfactory. But he was a good fellow, anyway, and the
boys all liked him. He was made orderly sergeant; Stevens was made
corporal.

These samples will answer—and they are quite fair ones. Well, this herd
of cattle started for the war. What could you expect of them? They did
as well as they knew how; but really what was justly to be expected of
them? Nothing, I should say. That is what they did....

For a time life was idly delicious, it was perfect; there was nothing to
mar it. Then came some farmers with an alarm one day. They said it was
rumored that the enemy were advancing in our direction from over Hyde’s
Prairie. The result was a sharp stir among us and general consternation.
It was a rude awakening from our pleasant trance. The rumor was but a
rumor—nothing definite about it; so, in the confusion, we did not know
which way to retreat. Lyman was for not retreating at all, in these
uncertain circumstances; but he found that if he tried to maintain that
attitude he would fare badly, for the command were in no humor to put up
with insubordination. So he yielded the point and called a council of
war—to consist of himself and the three other officers; but the privates
made such a fuss about being left out that we had to allow them to
remain, for they were already present, and doing the most of the
talking, too. The question was, which way to retreat; but all were so
flurried that nobody seemed to have even a guess to offer. Except Lyman.
He explained in a few calm words that, inasmuch as the enemy was
approaching from over Hyde’s Prairie, our course was simple; all we had
to do was not to retreat _towards_ him; any other direction would answer
our needs perfectly. Everybody saw in a moment how true this was, and
how wise; so Lyman got a great many compliments. It was now decided that
we should fall back on Mason’s farm.

It was after dark by this time, and as we could not know how soon the
enemy might arrive, it did not seem best to try to take the horses and
things with us; so we only took the guns and ammunition, and started at
once.

We heard a sound, and held our breath and listened, and it seemed to be
the enemy coming, though it could have been a cow, for it had a cough
like a cow; but we did not wait, but left a couple of guns behind and
struck out for Mason’s again, as briskly as we could scramble along in
the dark. But we got lost presently among the rugged little ravines, and
wasted a deal of time finding the way again, so it was after nine
o’clock when we reached Mason’s stile at last; and then before we could
open our mouths to give the countersign several dogs came bounding over
the fence, with great riot and noise, and each of them took a soldier by
the slack of his trousers and began to back away with him. We could not
shoot the dogs without endangering the persons they were attached to; so
we had to look on helplessly, at what was perhaps the most mortifying
spectacle of the Civil War. There was light enough, and to spare, for
the Masons had now run out on the porch with candles in their hands. The
old man and his son came and undid the dogs without difficulty, all but
Bowers’s; but they couldn’t undo his dog, they didn’t know his
combination; he was of the bull kind, and seemed to be set with a Yale
time-lock; but they got him loose at last with some scalding water, of
which Bowers got his share and returned thanks.




           _FROM_ “THE PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS OF JOAN OF ARC”


                                  JOAN

To arrive at a just estimate of a renowned man’s character one must
judge it by the standards of his time, not ours. Judged by the standards
of one century, the noblest characters of an earlier one lose much of
their luster; judged by the standards of to-day, there is probably no
illustrious man of four or five centuries ago whose character could meet
the test at all points. But the character of Joan of Arc is unique. It
can be measured by the standards of all times without misgiving or
apprehension as to the result. Judged by any of them, judged by all of
them, it is still flawless, it is still ideally perfect; it still
occupies the loftiest place possible to human attainment, a loftier one
than has been reached by any other mere mortal.

When we reflect that her century was the brutalest, the wickedest, the
rottenest in history since the darkest ages, we are lost in wonder at
the miracle of such a product from such a soil. The contrast between her
and her century is the contrast between day and night. She was truthful
when lying was the common speech of men; she was honest when honesty was
become a lost virtue; she was a keeper of promises when the keeping of a
promise was expected of no one; she gave her great mind to great
thoughts and great purposes when other great minds wasted themselves
upon pretty fancies or upon poor ambitions; she was modest, and fine,
and delicate, when to be loud and coarse might be said to be universal;
she was full of pity when a merciless cruelty was the rule; she was
steadfast when stability was unknown, and honorable in an age which had
forgotten what honor was; she was a rock of convictions in a time when
men believed in nothing and scoffed at all things; she was unfailingly
true in an age that was false to the core; she maintained her personal
dignity unimpaired in an age of fawnings and servilities; she was of a
dauntless courage when hope and courage had perished in the hearts of
her nation; she was spotlessly pure in mind and body when society in the
highest places was foul in both—she was all these things in an age when
crime was the common business of lords and princes, and when the highest
personages in Christendom were able to astonish even that infamous era
and make it stand aghast at the spectacle of their atrocious lives black
with unimaginable treacheries, butcheries, and bestialities.

She was perhaps the only entirely unselfish person whose name has a
place in profane history. No vestige or suggestion of self-seeking can
be found in any word or deed of hers. When she had rescued her king from
his vagabondage, and set his crown upon his head she was offered rewards
and honors, but she refused them all, and would take nothing. All she
would take for herself—if the king would grant it—was leave to go back
to her village home, and tend her sheep again, and feel her mother’s
arms about her, and be her housemaid and helper. The selfishness of this
unspoiled general of victorious army, companion of princes, an idol of
an applauding and grateful nation, reached but that far and no farther.


                             THE FAIRY TREE

In a noble open space carpeted with grass on the high ground toward
Vaucouleur stood a most majestic beech tree with wide-reaching arms and
a grand spread of shade, and by it a limpid spring of cold water; and on
summer days the children went there—oh, every summer for more than five
hundred years—went there and sang and danced around the tree for hours
together, refreshing themselves at the spring from time to time, and it
was most lovely and enjoyable. Also they made wreaths of flowers and
hung them upon the tree and about the spring to please the fairies that
lived there; for they liked that, being idle innocent little creatures,
as all fairies are and fond of anything delicate and pretty like wild
flowers put together in that way. And in return for this attention the
fairies did any friendly thing they could for the children, such as
keeping the spring always full and clear and cold, and driving away
serpents and insects that sting; and so there was never any unkindness
between the fairies and the children during more than five hundred
years—tradition said a thousand—but only the warmest affection and the
most perfect trust and confidence; and whenever a child died the fairies
mourned just as that child’s playmates did, and the sign of it was there
to see; for before the dawn on the day of the funeral they hung a little
immortelle over the place where the child was used to sit under the
tree. I know this to be true by my own eyes; it is not hearsay. And the
reason it was known that the fairies did it was this—that it was made
all of black flowers of a sort not known in France anywhere.

Now from time immemorial all children reared in Domremy were called the
Children of the Tree; and they loved that name, for it carried with it a
mystic privilege not granted to any other of the children of this world.
Which was this: whenever one of these came to die, then beyond the vague
and formless images drifting through his darkening mind rose soft and
rich and fair a vision of the tree—if all was well with his soul. That
was what some said. Others said the vision came in two ways: once as a
warning, one or two years in advance of death, when the soul was the
captive of sin, and then the tree appeared in its desolate winter
aspect—then that soul was smitten with an awful fear. If repentance
came, and purity of life the vision came again, this time summer-clad
and beautiful; but if it were otherwise with that soul the vision was
withheld, and it passed from life knowing its doom. Still others said
that the vision came but once and then only to the sinless dying forlorn
in distant lands and pitifully longing for some last dear reminder of
their home. And what reminder of it could go to their hearts like the
picture of the tree that was the darling of their love and the comrade
of their joys and comforter of their small griefs all through the divine
days of their vanished youth?

Now the several traditions were as I have said, some believing one and
some another. One of them I know to be the truth, and that was the last
one. I do not say anything against the others; I think they were true,
but I only _know_ that the last one was; and it is my thought that if
one keep to the things he knows, and not trouble about the things which
he cannot be sure about, he will have the steadier mind for it—and there
is profit in that. I know that when the children of the tree die in a
far land, then—if they be at peace with God—they turn their longing eyes
toward home, and there, far-shining, as through a rift in a cloud that
curtains heaven, they see the soft picture of the fairy tree, clothed in
a dream of golden light; and they see the blooming meads sloping away to
the river, and to their perishing nostrils is blown faint and sweet the
fragrance of the flowers of home. And then the vision fades and
passes—but _they_ know, _they_ know! and by their transfigured faces you
know also, you stand looking on; yes, you know the message that has
come, and that it has come from heaven.

Joan and I believed alike about this matter. But Pierre Morel, and
Jacques d’Arc and many others believed that the vision appeared twice—to
a sinner. In fact, they and many others said they _knew_ it. Probably
because their fathers had known it and had told them; for one gets most
things at second hand in this world....

Always, from the remotest times, when the children joined hands and
danced around the fairy tree they sang the song which was the tree’s
song, the song of _L’Arbre Fée de Bourlemont_. They sang it to a quaint
sweet air—a solacing sweet air which has gone murmuring through my
dreaming spirit all my life when I was weary and troubled, resting me
and carrying me through night and distance home again. No stranger can
know or feel what that song has been through the drifting centuries to
exiled Children of the Tree, homeless and heavy of heart in countries
foreign to their speech and ways. You will think it a simple thing, that
song, and poor, perchance; but if you will remember what it was to us,
and what it brought before our eyes when it floated through our
memories, then you will respect it. And you will understand how the
water wells up in our eyes and makes all things dim, and our voices
break and we cannot sing the last lines:

               “And when, in exile wand’ring, we
               Shall fainting yearn for glimpse of thee,
                 Oh, rise upon our sight!”

and you will remember that Joan of Arc sang this song with us around the
tree when she was a little child, and always loved it. And _that_
hallows it, yes, you will grant that:


                      _L’Arbre Fée de Bourlemont._

                         Song of the children
             Now what has kept your leaves so green,
               Arbre Fée de Bourlemont?
             The children’s tears! they brought each grief,
               And you did comfort them and cheer
               Their bruised hearts, and steal a tear
             That, healèd, rose, a leaf.

             And what has built you up so strong,
               Arbre Fée de Bourlemont?
             The children’s love! they’ve loved you long:
               Ten hundred years, in sooth,
             They’ve nourished you with praise and song,
             And warmed your heart and kept it young—
               A thousand years of youth!

             Bide always green in our young hearts,
               Arbre Fée de Bourlemont!
             And we shall always youthful be,
               Not heeding Time his flight;
             And when, in exile wand’ring, we
             Shall fainting yearn for glimpse of thee,
               Oh, rise upon our sight!


                           JOAN BEFORE RHEIMS

We marched, marched, kept on marching; and at last, on the 16th of July,
we came in sight of our goal and saw the great cathedral towers of
Rheims rise out of the distance! Huzza after huzza swept the army from
van to rear; and as for Joan of Arc, there where she sat her horse,
gazing, clothed all in white armor, dreamy, beautiful, and in her face a
deep, deep joy, a joy not of earth, oh, she was not flesh, she was a
spirit! Her sublime mission was closing—closing in flawless triumph.
To-morrow she could say, “It is finished—let me go free.”


                             JOAN’S REWARD

The fantastic dream, the incredible dream, the impossible dream of the
peasant child stood fulfilled; the English power was broken, the heir of
France was crowned.

She was like one transfigured, so divine was the joy that shone in her
face as she sank to her knees at the king’s feet and looked up at him
through her tears. Her lips were quivering, and her words came soft and
low and broken:

“Now, O gentle king, is the pleasure of God accomplished according to
his command that you should come to Rheims and receive the crown that
belongeth of right to you, and unto none other. My work which was given
me to do is finished; give me your peace, and let me go back to my
mother, who is poor and old, and has need of me.”

The king raised her up, and there before all that host he praised her
great deeds in most noble terms; and there he confirmed her nobility and
titles, making her the equal of a count in rank, and also appointed a
household and officers for her according to her dignity; and then he
said:

“You have saved the crown. Speak—require—demand; and whatsoever grace
you ask it shall be granted, though it make the kingdom poor to meet
it.”

Now that was fine, that was loyal. Joan was on her knees again
straightway, and said:

“Then, O gentle king, if out of your compassion you will speak the word,
I pray you give commandment that my village, poor and hard-pressed by
reason of the war, may have its taxes remitted.”

“It is so commanded. Say on.”

“That is all.”

“All? Nothing but that?”

“It is all. I have no other desire.”

“But that is nothing—less than nothing. Ask—do not be afraid.”

“Indeed, I cannot, gentle king. Do not press me. I will not have aught
else, but only this alone.”

The king seemed nonplussed, and stood still a moment, as if trying to
comprehend and realize the full stature of this strange unselfishness.
Then he raised his head and said:

“She has won a kingdom and crowned its king; and all she asks and all
she will take is this poor grace—and even this is for others, not for
herself. And it is well; her act being proportioned to the dignity of
one who carries in her head and heart riches which outvalue any that any
king could add, though he gave his all. She shall have her way. Now,
therefore, it is decreed that from this day forth Domremy, natal village
of Joan of Arc, Deliverer of France, called the Maid of Orleans, is
freed from all taxation _forever_.”




                   _FROM_ “SAINT JOAN OF ARC” (1899)


There is no one to compare her with, none to measure her by; for all
others among the illustrious _grew_ towards their high place in an
atmosphere and surroundings which discovered their gift to them and
nourished it and promoted it, intentionally or unconsciously. There have
been other young generals, but they were not girls; young generals, but
they have been soldiers before they were generals: she _began_ as a
general. She commanded the first army she ever saw; she led it from
victory to victory, and never lost a battle with it; there have been
young commanders-in-chief, but none so young as she: she is the only
soldier in history who has held the supreme command of a nation’s armies
at the age of seventeen.

A man may have no bad habits and have worse.


When in doubt, tell the truth.

He was as shy as a newspaper is when referring to its own merits.


Truth is the most valuable thing we have. Let us economize it.


It could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no
distinctly native American criminal class except Congress.


It is your human environment that makes climate.


Everything human is pathetic. The secret source of Humor itself is not
joy but sorrow. There is no humor in heaven.


We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is
in it—and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot
stove-lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again—and that is
well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one any more.


There are those who scoff at the schoolboy, calling him frivolous and
shallow. Yet it was the schoolboy who said, “Faith is believing what you
know ain’t so.”


We can secure other people’s approval, if we do right and try hard; but
our own is worth a hundred of it, and no way has been found out of
securing that.


Truth is stranger than fiction—to some people, but I am measurably
familiar with it. Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because
Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn’t.


There is a Moral Sense, and there is an Immoral Sense. History shows us
that the Moral Sense enables us to perceive morality and how to avoid
it, and that the Immoral Sense enables us to perceive immorality and how
to enjoy it.


The English are mentioned in the Bible: Blessed are the meek, for they
shall inherit the earth.


It is easier to stay out than to get out.


Pity is for the living, envy is for the dead.


It is by the goodness of God that in our country we have those three
unspeakably precious things: Freedom of speech, freedom of conscience,
and the prudence never to practice either of them.


Man will do many things to get himself loved, he will do all things to
get himself envied.


Nothing is so ignorant as a man’s left hand, except a lady’s watch.


Be careless in your dress if you must, but keep a tidy soul.


There is no such thing as “the Queen’s English.” The property has gone

shares.


“_Classic._” A book which people praise and don’t read.


There are people who can do all fine and heroic things but one: keep
from telling their happiness to the unhappy.


Man is the Only Animal that Blushes. Or needs to.


The universal brotherhood of man is our most precious possession, what
there is of it.


Let us be thankful for the fools. But for them the rest of us could not
succeed.


When people do not respect us we are sharply offended; yet deep down in
his private heart no man much respects himself.


Nature makes the locust with an appetite for crops: man would have made
him with an appetite for sand.


The spirit of wrath—not the words—is the sin; and the spirit of wrath is
cursing. We begin to swear before we can talk.


The man with a new idea is a Crank till the idea succeeds.


Let us be grateful to Adam our benefactor. He cut us out of the
“blessing” of idleness and won for us the “curse” of labor.


Let us not be too particular. It is better to have old second-hand
diamonds than none at all.


The Autocrat of Russia possesses more power than any other man in the
earth; but he cannot stop a sneeze.


There are several good protections against temptations, but the surest
is cowardice.


Names are not always what they seem. The common Welsh name Bzjxxllwcp is
pronounced Jackson.


To succeed in the other trades, capacity must be shown; in the law,
concealment of it will do.


Prosperity is the best protector of principle.


By trying we can easily learn to endure adversity. Another man’s, I
mean.


Few of us can stand prosperity. Another man’s, I mean.


There is an old time toast which is golden for its beauty. “When you
ascend the hill of prosperity may you not meet a friend.”


Each person is born to one possession which outvalues all his others—his
last breath.


Hunger is the handmaid of genius.


The old saw says, “Let a sleeping dog lie.” Right. Still, when there is
much at stake it is better to get a newspaper to do it.


It takes your enemy and your friend, working together, to hurt you to
the heart; the one to slander you and the other to get the news to you.


If the desire to kill and the opportunity to kill came always together,
who would escape hanging?


Simple rules for saving money: To save half, when you are fired by an
eager impulse to contribute to a charity, wait, and count forty. To save
three-quarters, count sixty. To save it all, count sixty-five.


Grief can take care of itself; but to get the full value of a joy you
must have somebody to divide it with.


He had had much experience of physicians, and said “the only way to keep
your health is to eat what you don’t want, drink what you don’t like,

Let me make the superstitions of a nation and I care not who makes its

Wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have been.


Do not undervalue the headache. While it is at its sharpest it seems a
bad investment; but when relief begins the unexpired remainder is worth

True irreverence is disrespect to another man’s god.


There are two times in a man’s life when he should not speculate: when

Make it a point to do something every day that you don’t want to do.
This is the golden rule for acquiring the habit of doing your duty

the most numerous.


In the first place God made idiots. This was for practice. Then He made
School Boards.


There are no people who are quite so vulgar as the over-refined ones.


In statesmanship get the formalities right, never mind about the
moralities.


Everyone is a moon, and has a dark side which he never shows to anybody.


The very ink with which all history is written is merely fluid
prejudice.


There isn’t a Parallel of Latitude but thinks it would have been the
Equator if it had had its rights.


I have traveled more than any one else, and I have noticed that even the
angels speak English with an accent.


                                  ART

Whenever I enjoy anything in Art it means that it is mighty poor. The
private knowledge of this fact has saved me from going to pieces with
enthusiasm in front of many and many a chromo.


                             ITALIAN CIGARS

In Italy, as in France, the Government is the only cigar-peddler. Italy
has three or four domestic brands: the Minghetti, the Trabuco, the
Virginia, and a very coarse one which is a modification of the Virginia.
The Minghettis are large and comely, and cost three dollars and sixty
cents a hundred; I can smoke a hundred in seven days and enjoy every one
of them. The Trabucos suit me, too; I don’t remember the price. But one
has to learn to like the Virginia, nobody is born friendly to it. It
looks like a rat-tail file, but smokes better, some think. It has a
straw through it; you pull this out, and it leaves a flue, otherwise
there would be no draught, not even as much as there is to a nail. Some
prefer a nail at first.




                  _FROM_ “CONCERNING THE JEWS” (1898)


                            THE HUMAN BEING

I’m quite sure that (bar one) I have no race prejudices, and I think I
have no color prejudices nor caste prejudices nor creed prejudices.
Indeed, I know it. I can stand any society. All that I care to know is
that a man is a human being—that is enough for me; he can’t be any
worse.


                           THE IMMORTAL RACE

If the statistics are right the Jews constitute but _one per cent._ of
the human race. It suggests a nebulous dim puff of star dust lost in the
blaze of the Milky Way. Properly the Jew ought hardly to be heard of;
but he is heard of, has always been heard of. He is as prominent on the
planet as any other people, and his commercial importance is
extravagantly out of proportion to the smallness of his bulk. His
contributions to the world’s list of great names in literature, science,
art, music, finance, medicine, and abstruse learning are always away out
of proportion to the weakness of his numbers. He has made a marvelous
fight in this world, in all the ages; and has done it with his hands
tied behind him. He could be vain of himself, and be excused for it. The
Egyptian, the Babylonian, and the Persian rose, filled the planet with
sound and splendor then faded to dream-stuff and passed away; the Greek
and the Roman followed, and made a vast noise, and were gone; other
people have sprung up and held their torch high for a time, but it
burned out, and they sit in twilight now, or have vanished. The Jew saw
them all, beat them all, and is now what he always was, exhibiting no
decadence, no infirmities of age, no weakening of his parts, no slowing
of his energies, no dulling of his alert and aggressive mind. All things
are mortal but the Jew; all other forces pass, but he remains. What is
the secret of his immortality?




                   _FROM_ “CHRISTIAN SCIENCE” (1898)


                            THE C. S. HEALER

She was middle-aged, and large and bony, and erect, and had an austere
face and a resolute jaw and a Roman beak and was a widow in the third
degree, and her name was Fuller. I was eager to get to business and find
relief, but she was distressingly deliberate. She unpinned and unhooked
and uncoupled her upholsteries one by one, abolished the wrinkles with a
flirt of her hand, and hung the articles up; peeled off her gloves and
disposed of them, got a book out of her hand-bag, then drew a chair to
the bedside, descended into it without hurry and I hung out my tongue.
She said, with pity but without passion:

“Return it to its receptacle. We deal with the mind only, not with its
dumb servants.”

I could not offer my pulse, because the connection was broken; but she
detected the apology before I could word it, and indicated by a negative
tilt of her head that the pulse was another dumb servant that she had no
use for. Then I thought I would tell her my symptoms and how I felt, so
that she would understand the case; but that was another inconsequence,
she did not need to know those things; moreover, my remark about how I
felt was an abuse of language, a misapplication of terms.

“One does not _feel_” she explained; “there is no such thing as feeling:
therefore, to speak of a non-existent thing as existent is a
contradiction. Matter has no existence; nothing exists but mind; the
mind cannot feel pain, it can only imagine it.”

“But if it hurts, just the same——”

“It doesn’t. A thing which is unreal cannot exercise the functions of
reality. Pain is unreal; hence, pain cannot hurt.”

In making a sweeping gesture to indicate the act of shooing the illusion
of pain out of the mind, she raked her hand on a pin in her dress, said
“Ouch!” and went tranquilly on with her talk. “You should never allow
yourself to speak of how you feel, nor permit others to ask you how you
are feeling; you should never concede that you are ill, nor permit
others to talk about disease or pain or death or similar non-existences
in your presence. Such talk only encourages the mind to continue its
empty imaginings.”

Just at that point the _Stubenmädchen_ trod on the cat’s tail, and the
cat let fly a frenzy of cat profanity. I asked, with caution:

“Is a cat’s opinion about pain valuable?”

“A cat has no opinion; opinions proceed from mind only; the lower
animals being eternally perishable, have not been granted mind; without
mind, opinion is impossible.”

“She merely _imagined_ she felt a pain—the cat?”

“She cannot imagine a pain, for imagining is an effect of mind; without
mind there is no imagination. A cat has no imagination.”

“Then she had a _real_ pain?”

“I have already told you there is no such _thing_ as real pain.”

“It is strange and interesting. I do wonder what was the matter with the
cat.”




                _FROM_ “ITALIAN WITHOUT A MASTER” (1903)


                            THE HOME PRODUCT

Necessarily we are all fond of murders, scandals, swindles, robberies,
explosions, collisions, and all such things, when we know the people,
and when they are neighbors and friends, but when they are strangers we
do not get any great pleasure out of them, as a rule. Now the trouble
with an American paper is that it has no discrimination; it rakes the
whole earth for blood and garbage and the result is that you are daily
overfed and suffer a surfeit. By habit you stow this muck every day, but
you come by and by to take no vital interest in it—indeed, you almost
get tired of it. As a rule, forty-nine-fiftieths of it concerns
strangers only—people away off yonder, a thousand miles, two thousand
miles, ten thousand miles from where you are. Why, when you come to
think of it, who cares what becomes of those people? I would not give
the assassination of one personal friend for a whole massacre of those
others. And, to my mind, one relative or neighbor mixed up in a scandal
is more interesting than a whole Sodom and Gomorrah of outlanders gone
rotten. Give me the home product every time.


                        THE CHARM OF UNCERTAINTY

There is a great, a peculiar charm about reading news scraps in a
language which you are not acquainted with—the charm that always goes
with the mysterious and the uncertain. You can never be absolutely sure
of the meaning of anything you read in such circumstances; you are
chasing an alert and gamy riddle all the time, and the baffling turns
and dodges of the prey make the life of the hunt. A dictionary would
soil it. Sometimes a single word of doubtful purport will cast a vale of
dreamy and golden uncertainty over a whole paragraph of cold and
practical certainties, and leave steeped in a haunting and adorable
mystery an incident which had been vulgar and commonplace but for the
benefaction. Would you be wise to draw a dictionary on that gracious
word? Would you be properly grateful?




                      _FROM_ “EVE’S DIARY” (1905)


                            HER CHIEF DESIRE

It is my prayer, it is my longing, that we may pass from this life
together—a longing which shall never perish from the earth, but shall
have place in the heart of every wife that loves, until the end of time;
and it shall be called by my name.

But if one of us must go first, it is my prayer that it shall be I; for
he is strong, I am weak, I am not so necessary to him as he is to
me—life without him would not be life; how could I endure it? This
prayer is also immortal, and will not cease from being offered while my
race continues. I am the first wife; and in the last wife I shall be
repeated.


                             AT EVE’S GRAVE

Adam: Wheresoever she was, _there_ was Eden.


                      WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS (1905)

For forty years his English has been to me a continual delight and
astonishment. In the sustained exhibition of certain great
qualities—clearness, compression, verbal exactness, and enforced and
seemingly unconscious felicity of phrasing—he is, in my belief, without
his peer in the English-writing world. _Sustained._ I intrench myself
behind that protecting word. There are others who exhibit those great
qualities as greatly as he does, but only by intervaled distributions of
rich moonlight, with stretches of veiled and dimmer landscape between;
whereas Howell’s moon sails cloudless skies all night and all the
nights.




                         MISCELLANEOUS (1905–9)


                           MAKING THE OYSTER

You can’t make an oyster out of nothing, nor you can’t do it in a day.
You’ve got to start with a vast variety of invertebrates, the
belemnites, trilobites, jubusites, amalekites, and that sort of fry, and
put them in to soak in a primary sea and observe and wait what will
happen. Some of them will turn out a disappointment; the belemnites and
the amalekites and such will be failures, and they will die out and
become extinct in the course of the nineteen million years covered by
the experiment; but all is not lost, for the jubusites will develop
gradually into encrinites and stalactites and blatherskites, and one
thing and another, as the mighty ages creep on and the periods pile
their lofty crags in the primordial seas, and at last the first grand
stages in the preparation of the world for man stands completed, the
oyster is done. Now an oyster has hardly any more reasoning power than a
man has, so it is probable that this one jumped to the conclusion that
the nineteen million years was a preparation for _him_. That would be
just like an oyster, and, anyway, this one could not know at that early
date that he was only an incident in the scheme, and that there was some
more to the scheme yet. (Mark Twain—A Biography).


                        THE FATALITY OF SEQUENCE

When the first living atom found itself afloat on the great Laurentian
sea the first act of that first atom led to the _second_ act of that
first atom, and so on down through the succeeding ages of all life,
until, if the steps could be traced, it would be shown that the first
act of that first atom has led inevitably to the act of my standing in
my dressing gown at this instant, talking to you. (Mark Twain—A
Biography).


                          LIFE’S TURNING POINT

Necessarily the scene of the real turning-point of my life (and of
yours) was the Garden of Eden. It was there that the first link was
forged of the chain that was ultimately to lead to the emptying of me
into the literary guild. Adam’s _temperament_ was the first command the
Deity ever issued to a human being on this planet. And it was the only
command Adam would _never_ be able to disobey. It said, “Be weak, be
water, be characterless, be cheaply persuadable.” The later command, to
let the fruit alone was certain to be disobeyed. Not by Adam himself,
but by his _temperament_—which he did not create and had no authority
over. For the _temperament_ is the man; the thing tricked out with
clothes and named Man is merely its shadow, nothing more. The law of the
tiger’s temperament is, Thou shalt kill; the law of the sheep’s
temperament is, Thou shalt not kill. To issue later commands requiring
the tiger to let the fat stranger alone, and requiring the sheep to
imbue its hands in the blood of the lion is not worth while, for those
commands _can’t_ be obeyed. They would invite to violations of the law
of _temperament_, which is supreme, and takes precedence of all other
authorities. I cannot help feeling disappointed in Adam and Eve. That
is, in their temperaments. Not in _them_, poor helpless young
creatures—afflicted with temperaments made out of butter; which butter
was commanded to get into contact with fire and _be melted_. What I
cannot help wishing is, that Adam and Eve had been postponed, and Martin
Luther and Joan of Arc put in their place. That splendid pair equipped
with temperaments not made of butter, but of asbestos. By neither sugary
persuasions nor by hell fire could Satan have beguiled _them_ to eat the
apple.


                  CLOSE OF SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY SPEECH

Threescore years and ten!

It is the scriptural statute of limitations. After that you owe no
active duties; for you the strenuous life is over. You are a
time-expired man, to use Kipling’s military phrase; you have served your
term, well or less well, and you are mustered out. You are become an
honorary member of the republic, you are emancipated, compulsions are
not for you, nor any bugle call but “lights out.” You pay the time-worn
duty bills if you choose, or decline if you prefer—and without
prejudice—for they are not legally collectible.

The previous-engagement plea, which in forty years has cost you so many
twinges, you can lay aside forever; on this side of the grave you will
never need it again. If you shrink at thought of night, and winter, and
the late homecomings from the banquet and the lights and laughter
through the deserted street—a desolation which would not remind you now,
as for a generation it did, that your friends are sleeping and you must
creep in a-tiptoe and not disturb them, but would only remind you that
you need not tiptoe, you can never disturb them more—if you shrink at
the thought of these things you need only reply, “Your invitation honors
me and pleases me because you still keep me in your remembrance, but I
am seventy; seventy, and would nestle in the chimney corner and smoke my
pipe, and read my book, and take my rest, wishing you well in all
affection, and that when you in your turn shall arrive at Pier 70 you
may step aboard your waiting ship with a reconciled spirit, and lay your
course toward the sinking sun with a contented heart.”


                            THE FUTURE LIFE

(Mark Twain often allowed his fancy to play with the idea of the
orthodox heaven, its curiosities of architecture and its employments of
continuous prayer, psalm-singing, and harpistry).

“What a childish notion it was,” he said, “and how curious that only a
little while ago human beings were so willing to accept such fragile
evidences about a place of so much importance. If we should find
somewhere to-day an ancient book containing an account of a beautiful
and blooming tropical paradise secreted in the center of eternal
icebergs—an account written by men who did not even claim to have seen
it themselves—no geographical society on earth would take any stock in
that book, yet that account would be quite as authentic as any we have
of heaven. If God has such a place prepared for us, and really wanted us
to know it, He could have found some better way than a book, so liable
to alterations and misinterpretations. God has had no trouble to prove
to man the laws of the constellations and the construction of the world,
and such things as that, none of which agree with His so-called book. As
to a hereafter, we have not the slightest evidence that there is
any—_no_ evidence that appeals to logic and reason. I have never seen
what to me seemed an atom of proof that there is a future life.”

Then, after a long pause, he added:

“And yet—I am strongly inclined to expect one.” (Mark Twain—A
Biography).


                                RELIGION

I would not interfere with any one’s religion, either to strengthen it
or to weaken it. I am not able to believe one’s religion can affect his
hereafter one way or the other, no matter what that religion may be. But
it may easily be a great comfort to him in this life—hence it is a
valuable possession to him.

It is the time appointed. The funeral has begun. Four hundred miles

stood thirteen years ago; where her mother’s stood five years and a half
ago; and where mine will stand, after a little time.

I will set down a tale as it was told to me by one who had it of his

preserving it.  It may be history, it may be only a legend, a tradition.
It may have happened, it may not have happened:  but it COULD have

credited it.

Chapter I. The birth of the Prince and the Pauper.

In the ancient city of London, on a certain autumn day in the second
quarter of the sixteenth century, a boy was born to a poor family of the
name of Canty, who did not want him.  On the same day another English
child was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him.
All England wanted him too.  England had so longed for him, and hoped for
him, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the
people went nearly mad for joy.  Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed
each other and cried. Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich
and poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they kept
this up for days and nights together.  By day, London was a sight to see,
with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and splendid
pageants marching along.  By night, it was again a sight to see, with its
great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of revellers making merry
around them.  There was no talk in all England but of the new baby,
Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in silks and satins,
unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that great lords and ladies
were tending him and watching over him--and not caring, either.  But
there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty, lapped in his poor
rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had just come to trouble
with his presence.



Chapter II. Tom's early life.

Let us skip a number of years.

London was fifteen hundred years old, and was a great town--for that day.
It had a hundred thousand inhabitants--some think double as many.  The
streets were very narrow, and crooked, and dirty, especially in the part
where Tom Canty lived, which was not far from London Bridge.  The houses
were of wood, with the second story projecting over the first, and the
third sticking its elbows out beyond the second.  The higher the houses
grew, the broader they grew.  They were skeletons of strong criss-cross
beams, with solid material between, coated with plaster.  The beams were
painted red or blue or black, according to the owner's taste, and this
gave the houses a very picturesque look.  The windows were small, glazed
with little diamond-shaped panes, and they opened outward, on hinges,
like doors.

The house which Tom's father lived in was up a foul little pocket called
Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane.  It was small, decayed, and rickety,
but it was packed full of wretchedly poor families. Canty's tribe
occupied a room on the third floor.  The mother and father had a sort of
bedstead in the corner; but Tom, his grandmother, and his two sisters,
Bet and Nan, were not restricted--they had all the floor to themselves,
and might sleep where they chose.  There were the remains of a blanket or
two, and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw, but these could not
rightly be called beds, for they were not organised; they were kicked
into a general pile, mornings, and selections made from the mass at
night, for service.

Bet and Nan were fifteen years old--twins.  They were good-hearted girls,
unclean, clothed in rags, and profoundly ignorant.  Their mother was like
them.  But the father and the grandmother were a couple of fiends.  They
got drunk whenever they could; then they fought each other or anybody
else who came in the way; they cursed and swore always, drunk or sober;
John Canty was a thief, and his mother a beggar.  They made beggars of
the children, but failed to make thieves of them.  Among, but not of, the
dreadful rabble that inhabited the house, was a good old priest whom the
King had turned out of house and home with a pension of a few farthings,
and he used to get the children aside and teach them right ways secretly.
Father Andrew also taught Tom a little Latin, and how to read and write;
and would have done the same with the girls, but they were afraid of the
jeers of their friends, who could not have endured such a queer
accomplishment in them.

All Offal Court was just such another hive as Canty's house. Drunkenness,
riot and brawling were the order, there, every night and nearly all night
long.  Broken heads were as common as hunger in that place.  Yet little
Tom was not unhappy.  He had a hard time of it, but did not know it.  It
was the sort of time that all the Offal Court boys had, therefore he
supposed it was the correct and comfortable thing.  When he came home
empty-handed at night, he knew his father would curse him and thrash him
first, and that when he was done the awful grandmother would do it all
over again and improve on it; and that away in the night his starving
mother would slip to him stealthily with any miserable scrap or crust she
had been able to save for him by going hungry herself, notwithstanding
she was often caught in that sort of treason and soundly beaten for it by
her husband.

No, Tom's life went along well enough, especially in summer.  He only
begged just enough to save himself, for the laws against mendicancy were
stringent, and the penalties heavy; so he put in a good deal of his time
listening to good Father Andrew's charming old tales and legends about
giants and fairies, dwarfs and genii, and enchanted castles, and gorgeous
kings and princes.  His head grew to be full of these wonderful things,
and many a night as he lay in the dark on his scant and offensive straw,
tired, hungry, and smarting from a thrashing, he unleashed his
imagination and soon forgot his aches and pains in delicious picturings
to himself of the charmed life of a petted prince in a regal palace.  One
desire came in time to haunt him day and night:  it was to see a real
prince, with his own eyes.  He spoke of it once to some of his Offal
Court comrades; but they jeered him and scoffed him so unmercifully that
he was glad to keep his dream to himself after that.

He often read the priest's old books and got him to explain and enlarge
upon them.  His dreamings and readings worked certain changes in him,
by-and-by.  His dream-people were so fine that he grew to lament his shabby
clothing and his dirt, and to wish to be clean and better clad.  He went
on playing in the mud just the same, and enjoying it, too; but, instead
of splashing around in the Thames solely for the fun of it, he began to
find an added value in it because of the washings and cleansings it
afforded.

Tom could always find something going on around the Maypole in Cheapside,
and at the fairs; and now and then he and the rest of London had a chance
to see a military parade when some famous unfortunate was carried
prisoner to the Tower, by land or boat. One summer's day he saw poor Anne
Askew and three men burned at the stake in Smithfield, and heard an
ex-Bishop preach a sermon to them which did not interest him.  Yes, Tom's
life was varied and pleasant enough, on the whole.

By-and-by Tom's reading and dreaming about princely life wrought such a
strong effect upon him that he began to ACT the prince, unconsciously.
His speech and manners became curiously ceremonious and courtly, to the
vast admiration and amusement of his intimates.  But Tom's influence
among these young people began to grow now, day by day; and in time he
came to be looked up to, by them, with a sort of wondering awe, as a
superior being.  He seemed to know so much! and he could do and say such
marvellous things! and withal, he was so deep and wise!  Tom's remarks,
and Tom's performances, were reported by the boys to their elders; and
these, also, presently began to discuss Tom Canty, and to regard him as a
most gifted and extraordinary creature.  Full-grown people brought their
perplexities to Tom for solution, and were often astonished at the wit
and wisdom of his decisions.  In fact he was become a hero to all who
knew him except his own family--these, only, saw nothing in him.

Privately, after a while, Tom organised a royal court!  He was the
prince; his special comrades were guards, chamberlains, equerries, lords
and ladies in waiting, and the royal family.  Daily the mock prince was
received with elaborate ceremonials borrowed by Tom from his romantic
readings; daily the great affairs of the mimic kingdom were discussed in
the royal council, and daily his mimic highness issued decrees to his
imaginary armies, navies, and viceroyalties.

After which, he would go forth in his rags and beg a few farthings, eat
his poor crust, take his customary cuffs and abuse, and then stretch
himself upon his handful of foul straw, and resume his empty grandeurs in
his dreams.

And still his desire to look just once upon a real prince, in the flesh,
grew upon him, day by day, and week by week, until at last it absorbed
all other desires, and became the one passion of his life.

One January day, on his usual begging tour, he tramped despondently up
and down the region round about Mincing Lane and Little East Cheap, hour
after hour, bare-footed and cold, looking in at cook-shop windows and
longing for the dreadful pork-pies and other deadly inventions displayed
there--for to him these were dainties fit for the angels; that is,
judging by the smell, they were--for it had never been his good luck to
own and eat one. There was a cold drizzle of rain; the atmosphere was
murky; it was a melancholy day.  At night Tom reached home so wet and
tired and hungry that it was not possible for his father and grandmother
to observe his forlorn condition and not be moved--after their fashion;
wherefore they gave him a brisk cuffing at once and sent him to bed.  For
a long time his pain and hunger, and the swearing and fighting going on
in the building, kept him awake; but at last his thoughts drifted away to
far, romantic lands, and he fell asleep in the company of jewelled and
gilded princelings who live in vast palaces, and had servants salaaming
before them or flying to execute their orders.  And then, as usual, he
dreamed that HE was a princeling himself.

All night long the glories of his royal estate shone upon him; he moved
among great lords and ladies, in a blaze of light, breathing perfumes,
drinking in delicious music, and answering the reverent obeisances of the
glittering throng as it parted to make way for him, with here a smile,
and there a nod of his princely head.

And when he awoke in the morning and looked upon the wretchedness about
him, his dream had had its usual effect--it had intensified the
sordidness of his surroundings a thousandfold.  Then came bitterness, and
heart-break, and tears.



Chapter III. Tom's meeting with the Prince.

Tom got up hungry, and sauntered hungry away, but with his thoughts busy
with the shadowy splendours of his night's dreams. He wandered here and
there in the city, hardly noticing where he was going, or what was
happening around him.  People jostled him, and some gave him rough
speech; but it was all lost on the musing boy.  By-and-by he found
himself at Temple Bar, the farthest from home he had ever travelled in
that direction.  He stopped and considered a moment, then fell into his
imaginings again, and passed on outside the walls of London.  The Strand
had ceased to be a country-road then, and regarded itself as a street,
but by a strained construction; for, though there was a tolerably compact
row of houses on one side of it, there were only some scattered great
buildings on the other, these being palaces of rich nobles, with ample
and beautiful grounds stretching to the river--grounds that are now
closely packed with grim acres of brick and stone.

Tom discovered Charing Village presently, and rested himself at the
beautiful cross built there by a bereaved king of earlier days; then
idled down a quiet, lovely road, past the great cardinal's stately
palace, toward a far more mighty and majestic palace beyond--Westminster.
Tom stared in glad wonder at the vast pile of masonry, the wide-spreading
wings, the frowning bastions and turrets, the huge stone gateway, with
its gilded bars and its magnificent array of colossal granite lions, and
other the signs and symbols of English royalty.  Was the desire of his
soul to be satisfied at last?  Here, indeed, was a king's palace.  Might
he not hope to see a prince now--a prince of flesh and blood, if Heaven
were willing?

At each side of the gilded gate stood a living statue--that is to say, an
erect and stately and motionless man-at-arms, clad from head to heel in
shining steel armour.  At a respectful distance were many country folk,
and people from the city, waiting for any chance glimpse of royalty that
might offer.  Splendid carriages, with splendid people in them and
splendid servants outside, were arriving and departing by several other
noble gateways that pierced the royal enclosure.

Poor little Tom, in his rags, approached, and was moving slowly and
timidly past the sentinels, with a beating heart and a rising hope, when
all at once he caught sight through the golden bars of a spectacle that
almost made him shout for joy.  Within was a comely boy, tanned and brown
with sturdy outdoor sports and exercises, whose clothing was all of
lovely silks and satins, shining with jewels; at his hip a little
jewelled sword and dagger; dainty buskins on his feet, with red heels;
and on his head a jaunty crimson cap, with drooping plumes fastened with
a great sparkling gem.  Several gorgeous gentlemen stood near--his
servants, without a doubt.  Oh! he was a prince--a prince, a living
prince, a real prince--without the shadow of a question; and the prayer
of the pauper-boy's heart was answered at last.

Tom's breath came quick and short with excitement, and his eyes grew big
with wonder and delight.  Everything gave way in his mind instantly to
one desire:  that was to get close to the prince, and have a good,
devouring look at him.  Before he knew what he was about, he had his face
against the gate-bars.  The next instant one of the soldiers snatched him
rudely away, and sent him spinning among the gaping crowd of country
gawks and London idlers.  The soldier said,--

"Mind thy manners, thou young beggar!"

The crowd jeered and laughed; but the young prince sprang to the gate
with his face flushed, and his eyes flashing with indignation, and cried
out,--

"How dar'st thou use a poor lad like that?  How dar'st thou use the King
my father's meanest subject so?  Open the gates, and let him in!"

You should have seen that fickle crowd snatch off their hats then. You
should have heard them cheer, and shout, "Long live the Prince of Wales!"

The soldiers presented arms with their halberds, opened the gates, and
presented again as the little Prince of Poverty passed in, in his
fluttering rags, to join hands with the Prince of Limitless Plenty.

Edward Tudor said--

"Thou lookest tired and hungry:  thou'st been treated ill.  Come with
me."

Half a dozen attendants sprang forward to--I don't know what; interfere,
no doubt.  But they were waved aside with a right royal gesture, and they
stopped stock still where they were, like so many statues.  Edward took
Tom to a rich apartment in the palace, which he called his cabinet.  By
his command a repast was brought such as Tom had never encountered before
except in books.  The prince, with princely delicacy and breeding, sent
away the servants, so that his humble guest might not be embarrassed by
their critical presence; then he sat near by, and asked questions while
Tom ate.

"What is thy name, lad?"

"Tom Canty, an' it please thee, sir."

"'Tis an odd one.  Where dost live?"

"In the city, please thee, sir.  Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane."

"Offal Court!  Truly 'tis another odd one.  Hast parents?"

"Parents have I, sir, and a grand-dam likewise that is but indifferently
precious to me, God forgive me if it be offence to say it--also twin
sisters, Nan and Bet."

"Then is thy grand-dam not over kind to thee, I take it?"

"Neither to any other is she, so please your worship.  She hath a wicked
heart, and worketh evil all her days."

"Doth she mistreat thee?"

"There be times that she stayeth her hand, being asleep or overcome with
drink; but when she hath her judgment clear again, she maketh it up to me
with goodly beatings."

A fierce look came into the little prince's eyes, and he cried out--

"What!  Beatings?"

"Oh, indeed, yes, please you, sir."

"BEATINGS!--and thou so frail and little.  Hark ye:  before the night
come, she shall hie her to the Tower.  The King my father"--

"In sooth, you forget, sir, her low degree.  The Tower is for the great
alone."

"True, indeed.  I had not thought of that.  I will consider of her
punishment.  Is thy father kind to thee?"

"Not more than Gammer Canty, sir."

"Fathers be alike, mayhap.  Mine hath not a doll's temper.  He smiteth
with a heavy hand, yet spareth me:  he spareth me not always with his
tongue, though, sooth to say.  How doth thy mother use thee?"

"She is good, sir, and giveth me neither sorrow nor pain of any sort.
And Nan and Bet are like to her in this."

"How old be these?"

"Fifteen, an' it please you, sir."

"The Lady Elizabeth, my sister, is fourteen, and the Lady Jane Grey, my
cousin, is of mine own age, and comely and gracious withal; but my sister
the Lady Mary, with her gloomy mien and--Look you:  do thy sisters forbid
their servants to smile, lest the sin destroy their souls?"

"They?  Oh, dost think, sir, that THEY have servants?"

The little prince contemplated the little pauper gravely a moment, then
said--

"And prithee, why not?  Who helpeth them undress at night?  Who attireth
them when they rise?"

"None, sir.  Would'st have them take off their garment, and sleep
without--like the beasts?"

"Their garment!  Have they but one?"

"Ah, good your worship, what would they do with more?  Truly they have
not two bodies each."

"It is a quaint and marvellous thought!  Thy pardon, I had not meant to
laugh.  But thy good Nan and thy Bet shall have raiment and lackeys enow,
and that soon, too:  my cofferer shall look to it.  No, thank me not;
'tis nothing.  Thou speakest well; thou hast an easy grace in it.  Art
learned?"

"I know not if I am or not, sir.  The good priest that is called Father
Andrew taught me, of his kindness, from his books."

"Know'st thou the Latin?"

"But scantly, sir, I doubt."

"Learn it, lad:  'tis hard only at first.  The Greek is harder; but
neither these nor any tongues else, I think, are hard to the Lady
Elizabeth and my cousin.  Thou should'st hear those damsels at it!  But
tell me of thy Offal Court.  Hast thou a pleasant life there?"

"In truth, yes, so please you, sir, save when one is hungry. There be
Punch-and-Judy shows, and monkeys--oh such antic creatures! and so
bravely dressed!--and there be plays wherein they that play do shout and
fight till all are slain, and 'tis so fine to see, and costeth but a
farthing--albeit 'tis main hard to get the farthing, please your
worship."

"Tell me more."

"We lads of Offal Court do strive against each other with the cudgel,
like to the fashion of the 'prentices, sometimes."

The prince's eyes flashed.  Said he--

"Marry, that would not I mislike.  Tell me more."

"We strive in races, sir, to see who of us shall be fleetest."

"That would I like also.  Speak on."

"In summer, sir, we wade and swim in the canals and in the river, and
each doth duck his neighbour, and splatter him with water, and dive and
shout and tumble and--"

"'Twould be worth my father's kingdom but to enjoy it once! Prithee go
on."

"We dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside; we play in the sand,
each covering his neighbour up; and times we make mud pastry--oh the
lovely mud, it hath not its like for delightfulness in all the world!--we
do fairly wallow in the mud, sir, saving your worship's presence."

"Oh, prithee, say no more, 'tis glorious!  If that I could but clothe me
in raiment like to thine, and strip my feet, and revel in the mud once,
just once, with none to rebuke me or forbid, meseemeth I could forego the
crown!"

"And if that I could clothe me once, sweet sir, as thou art clad--just
once--"

"Oho, would'st like it?  Then so shall it be.  Doff thy rags, and don
these splendours, lad!  It is a brief happiness, but will be not less
keen for that.  We will have it while we may, and change again before any
come to molest."

A few minutes later the little Prince of Wales was garlanded with Tom's
fluttering odds and ends, and the little Prince of Pauperdom was tricked
out in the gaudy plumage of royalty.  The two went and stood side by side
before a great mirror, and lo, a miracle: there did not seem to have been
any change made!  They stared at each other, then at the glass, then at
each other again.  At last the puzzled princeling said--

"What dost thou make of this?"

"Ah, good your worship, require me not to answer.  It is not meet that
one of my degree should utter the thing."

"Then will _I_ utter it.  Thou hast the same hair, the same eyes, the
same voice and manner, the same form and stature, the same face and
countenance that I bear.  Fared we forth naked, there is none could say
which was you, and which the Prince of Wales.  And, now that I am clothed
as thou wert clothed, it seemeth I should be able the more nearly to feel
as thou didst when the brute soldier--Hark ye, is not this a bruise upon
your hand?"

"Yes; but it is a slight thing, and your worship knoweth that the poor
man-at-arms--"

"Peace!  It was a shameful thing and a cruel!" cried the little prince,
stamping his bare foot.  "If the King--Stir not a step till I come again!
It is a command!"

In a moment he had snatched up and put away an article of national
importance that lay upon a table, and was out at the door and flying
through the palace grounds in his bannered rags, with a hot face and
glowing eyes.  As soon as he reached the great gate, he seized the bars,
and tried to shake them, shouting--

"Open!  Unbar the gates!"

The soldier that had maltreated Tom obeyed promptly; and as the prince
burst through the portal, half-smothered with royal wrath, the soldier
fetched him a sounding box on the ear that sent him whirling to the
roadway, and said--

"Take that, thou beggar's spawn, for what thou got'st me from his
Highness!"

The crowd roared with laughter.  The prince picked himself out of the
mud, and made fiercely at the sentry, shouting--

"I am the Prince of Wales, my person is sacred; and thou shalt hang for
laying thy hand upon me!"

The soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and said mockingly--

"I salute your gracious Highness."  Then angrily--"Be off, thou crazy
rubbish!"

Here the jeering crowd closed round the poor little prince, and hustled
him far down the road, hooting him, and shouting--

"Way for his Royal Highness!  Way for the Prince of Wales!"



Chapter IV. The Prince's troubles begin.

After hours of persistent pursuit and persecution, the little prince was
at last deserted by the rabble and left to himself.  As long as he had
been able to rage against the mob, and threaten it royally, and royally
utter commands that were good stuff to laugh at, he was very
entertaining; but when weariness finally forced him to be silent, he was
no longer of use to his tormentors, and they sought amusement elsewhere.
He looked about him, now, but could not recognise the locality.  He was
within the city of London--that was all he knew.  He moved on, aimlessly,
and in a little while the houses thinned, and the passers-by were
infrequent.  He bathed his bleeding feet in the brook which flowed then
where Farringdon Street now is; rested a few moments, then passed on, and
presently came upon a great space with only a few scattered houses in it,
and a prodigious church.  He recognised this church.  Scaffoldings were
about, everywhere, and swarms of workmen; for it was undergoing elaborate
repairs.  The prince took heart at once--he felt that his troubles were
at an end, now.  He said to himself, "It is the ancient Grey Friars'
Church, which the king my father hath taken from the monks and given for
a home for ever for poor and forsaken children, and new-named it Christ's
Church.  Right gladly will they serve the son of him who hath done so
generously by them--and the more that that son is himself as poor and as
forlorn as any that be sheltered here this day, or ever shall be."

He was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running, jumping,
playing at ball and leap-frog, and otherwise disporting themselves, and
right noisily, too.  They were all dressed alike, and in the fashion
which in that day prevailed among serving-men and 'prentices{1}--that is
to say, each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the size
of a saucer, which was not useful as a covering, it being of such scanty
dimensions, neither was it ornamental; from beneath it the hair fell,
unparted, to the middle of the forehead, and was cropped straight around;
a clerical band at the neck; a blue gown that fitted closely and hung as
low as the knees or lower; full sleeves; a broad red belt; bright yellow
stockings, gartered above the knees; low shoes with large metal buckles.
It was a sufficiently ugly costume.

The boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince, who said with
native dignity--

"Good lads, say to your master that Edward Prince of Wales desireth
speech with him."

A great shout went up at this, and one rude fellow said--

"Marry, art thou his grace's messenger, beggar?"

The prince's face flushed with anger, and his ready hand flew to his hip,
but there was nothing there.  There was a storm of laughter, and one boy
said--

"Didst mark that?  He fancied he had a sword--belike he is the prince
himself."

This sally brought more laughter.  Poor Edward drew himself up proudly
and said--

"I am the prince; and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the king my
father's bounty to use me so."

This was vastly enjoyed, as the laughter testified.  The youth who had
first spoken, shouted to his comrades--

"Ho, swine, slaves, pensioners of his grace's princely father, where be
your manners?  Down on your marrow bones, all of ye, and do reverence to
his kingly port and royal rags!"

With boisterous mirth they dropped upon their knees in a body and did
mock homage to their prey.  The prince spurned the nearest boy with his
foot, and said fiercely--

"Take thou that, till the morrow come and I build thee a gibbet!"

Ah, but this was not a joke--this was going beyond fun.  The laughter
ceased on the instant, and fury took its place.  A dozen shouted--

"Hale him forth!  To the horse-pond, to the horse-pond!  Where be the
dogs?  Ho, there, Lion! ho, Fangs!"

Then followed such a thing as England had never seen before--the sacred
person of the heir to the throne rudely buffeted by plebeian hands, and
set upon and torn by dogs.

As night drew to a close that day, the prince found himself far down in
the close-built portion of the city.  His body was bruised, his hands
were bleeding, and his rags were all besmirched with mud.  He wandered on
and on, and grew more and more bewildered, and so tired and faint he
could hardly drag one foot after the other.  He had ceased to ask
questions of anyone, since they brought him only insult instead of
information.  He kept muttering to himself, "Offal Court--that is the
name; if I can but find it before my strength is wholly spent and I drop,
then am I saved--for his people will take me to the palace and prove that
I am none of theirs, but the true prince, and I shall have mine own
again."  And now and then his mind reverted to his treatment by those
rude Christ's Hospital boys, and he said, "When I am king, they shall not
have bread and shelter only, but also teachings out of books; for a full
belly is little worth where the mind is starved, and the heart.  I will
keep this diligently in my remembrance, that this day's lesson be not
lost upon me, and my people suffer thereby; for learning softeneth the
heart and breedeth gentleness and charity." {1}

The lights began to twinkle, it came on to rain, the wind rose, and a raw
and gusty night set in.  The houseless prince, the homeless heir to the
throne of England, still moved on, drifting deeper into the maze of
squalid alleys where the swarming hives of poverty and misery were massed
together.

Suddenly a great drunken ruffian collared him and said--

"Out to this time of night again, and hast not brought a farthing home, I
warrant me!  If it be so, an' I do not break all the bones in thy lean
body, then am I not John Canty, but some other."

The prince twisted himself loose, unconsciously brushed his profaned
shoulder, and eagerly said--

"Oh, art HIS father, truly?  Sweet heaven grant it be so--then wilt thou
fetch him away and restore me!"

"HIS father?  I know not what thou mean'st; I but know I am THY father,
as thou shalt soon have cause to--"

"Oh, jest not, palter not, delay not!--I am worn, I am wounded, I can
bear no more.  Take me to the king my father, and he will make thee rich
beyond thy wildest dreams.  Believe me, man, believe me!--I speak no lie,
but only the truth!--put forth thy hand and save me!  I am indeed the
Prince of Wales!"

The man stared down, stupefied, upon the lad, then shook his head and
muttered--

"Gone stark mad as any Tom o' Bedlam!"--then collared him once more, and
said with a coarse laugh and an oath, "But mad or no mad, I and thy
Gammer Canty will soon find where the soft places in thy bones lie, or
I'm no true man!"

With this he dragged the frantic and struggling prince away, and
disappeared up a front court followed by a delighted and noisy swarm of
human vermin.

CHAPTER VII

MERLIN'S TOWER

Inasmuch as I was now the second personage in the Kingdom, as far
as political power and authority were concerned, much was made
of me.  My raiment was of silks and velvets and cloth of gold,
and by consequence was very showy, also uncomfortable.  But habit
would soon reconcile me to my clothes; I was aware of that.  I was
given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle, after
the king's.  They were aglow with loud-colored silken hangings,
but the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet,
and they were misfit rushes at that, being not all of one breed.
As for conveniences, properly speaking, there weren't any.  I mean
_little_ conveniences; it is the little conveniences that make
the real comfort of life.  The big oaken chairs, graced with rude
carvings, were well enough, but that was the stopping place.
There was no soap, no matches, no looking-glass--except a metal
one, about as powerful as a pail of water.  And not a chromo.
I had been used to chromos for years, and I saw now that without
my suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the fabric
of my being, and was become a part of me.  It made me homesick
to look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness
and remember that in our house in East Hartford, all unpretending
as it was, you couldn't go into a room but you would find an
insurance-chromo, or at least a three-color God-Bless-Our-Home
over the door; and in the parlor we had nine.  But here, even in
my grand room of state, there wasn't anything in the nature of
a picture except a thing the size of a bedquilt, which was either
woven or knitted (it had darned places in it), and nothing in it
was the right color or the right shape; and as for proportions,
even Raphael himself couldn't have botched them more formidably,
after all his practice on those nightmares they call his "celebrated
Hampton Court cartoons."  Raphael was a bird.  We had several
of his chromos; one was his "Miraculous Draught of Fishes," where
he puts in a miracle of his own--puts three men into a canoe which
wouldn't have held a dog without upsetting.  I always admired
to study R.'s art, it was so fresh and unconventional.

There wasn't even a bell or a speaking-tube in the castle.  I had
a great many servants, and those that were on duty lolled in the
anteroom; and when I wanted one of them I had to go and call for him.
There was no gas, there were no candles; a bronze dish half full
of boarding-house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was
the thing that produced what was regarded as light.  A lot of
these hung along the walls and modified the dark, just toned it
down enough to make it dismal.  If you went out at night, your
servants carried torches.  There were no books, pens, paper or
ink, and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows.
It is a little thing--glass is--until it is absent, then it becomes
a big thing.  But perhaps the worst of all was, that there wasn't
any sugar, coffee, tea, or tobacco.  I saw that I was just another
Robinson Crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island, with no society
but some more or less tame animals, and if I wanted to make life
bearable I must do as he did--invent, contrive, create, reorganize
things; set brain and hand to work, and keep them busy.  Well,
that was in my line.

One thing troubled me along at first--the immense interest which
people took in me.  Apparently the whole nation wanted a look
at me.  It soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the British
world almost to death; that while it lasted the whole country,
from one end to the other, was in a pitiable state of panic, and
the churches, hermitages, and monkeries overflowed with praying
and weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world was
come.  Then had followed the news that the producer of this awful
event was a stranger, a mighty magician at Arthur's court; that he
could have blown out the sun like a candle, and was just going
to do it when his mercy was purchased, and he then dissolved
his enchantments, and was now recognized and honored as the man
who had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction and
its peoples from extinction.  Now if you consider that everybody
believed that, and not only believed it, but never even dreamed
of doubting it, you will easily understand that there was not
a person in all Britain that would not have walked fifty miles
to get a sight of me.  Of course I was all the talk--all other
subjects were dropped; even the king became suddenly a person of
minor interest and notoriety.  Within twenty-four hours the
delegations began to arrive, and from that time onward for a fortnight
they kept coming.  The village was crowded, and all the countryside.
I had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these
reverent and awe-stricken multitudes.  It came to be a great burden,
as to time and trouble, but of course it was at the same time
compensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center
of homage.  It turned Brer Merlin green with envy and spite, which
was a great satisfaction to me.  But there was one thing I couldn't
understand--nobody had asked for an autograph.  I spoke to Clarence
about it.  By George!  I had to explain to him what it was.  Then
he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen
priests.  Land! think of that.

There was another thing that troubled me a little.  Those multitudes
presently began to agitate for another miracle.  That was natural.
To be able to carry back to their far homes the boast that they
had seen the man who could command the sun, riding in the heavens,
and be obeyed, would make them great in the eyes of their neighbors,
and envied by them all; but to be able to also say they had seen
him work a miracle themselves--why, people would come a distance
to see _them_.  The pressure got to be pretty strong.  There was
going to be an eclipse of the moon, and I knew the date and hour,
but it was too far away.  Two years.  I would have given a good
deal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was
a big market for it.  It seemed a great pity to have it wasted so,
and come lagging along at a time when a body wouldn't have any
use for it, as like as not.  If it had been booked for only a month
away, I could have sold it short; but, as matters stood, I couldn't
seem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good, so I gave up
trying.  Next, Clarence found that old Merlin was making himself
busy on the sly among those people.  He was spreading a report that
I was a humbug, and that the reason I didn't accommodate the people
with a miracle was because I couldn't.  I saw that I must do
something.  I presently thought out a plan.

By my authority as executive I threw Merlin into prison--the same
cell I had occupied myself.  Then I gave public notice by herald
and trumpet that I should be busy with affairs of state for
a fortnight, but about the end of that time I would take a moment's
leisure and blow up Merlin's stone tower by fires from heaven;
in the meantime, whoso listened to evil reports about me, let him
beware.  Furthermore, I would perform but this one miracle at
this time, and no more; if it failed to satisfy and any murmured,
I would turn the murmurers into horses, and make them useful.
Quiet ensued.

I took Clarence into my confidence, to a certain degree, and we
went to work privately.  I told him that this was a sort of miracle
that required a trifle of preparation, and that it would be sudden
death to ever talk about these preparations to anybody.  That made
his mouth safe enough.  Clandestinely we made a few bushels of
first-rate blasting powder, and I superintended my armorers while
they constructed a lightning-rod and some wires.  This old stone
tower was very massive--and rather ruinous, too, for it was Roman,
and four hundred years old.  Yes, and handsome, after a rude
fashion, and clothed with ivy from base to summit, as with a shirt
of scale mail.  It stood on a lonely eminence, in good view from
the castle, and about half a mile away.

Working by night, we stowed the powder in the tower--dug stones
out, on the inside, and buried the powder in the walls themselves,
which were fifteen feet thick at the base.  We put in a peck
at a time, in a dozen places.  We could have blown up the Tower
of London with these charges.  When the thirteenth night was come
we put up our lightning-rod, bedded it in one of the batches of
powder, and ran wires from it to the other batches.  Everybody
had shunned that locality from the day of my proclamation, but
on the morning of the fourteenth I thought best to warn the people,
through the heralds, to keep clear away--a quarter of a mile away.
Then added, by command, that at some time during the twenty-four
hours I would consummate the miracle, but would first give a brief
notice; by flags on the castle towers if in the daytime, by
torch-baskets in the same places if at night.

Thunder-showers had been tolerably frequent of late, and I was
not much afraid of a failure; still, I shouldn't have cared for
a delay of a day or two; I should have explained that I was busy
with affairs of state yet, and the people must wait.

Of course, we had a blazing sunny day--almost the first one without
a cloud for three weeks; things always happen so.  I kept secluded,
and watched the weather.  Clarence dropped in from time to time
and said the public excitement was growing and growing all the
time, and the whole country filling up with human masses as far
as one could see from the battlements.  At last the wind sprang up
and a cloud appeared--in the right quarter, too, and just at
nightfall.  For a little while I watched that distant cloud spread
and blacken, then I judged it was time for me to appear.  I ordered
the torch-baskets to be lit, and Merlin liberated and sent to me.
A quarter of an hour later I ascended the parapet and there found
the king and the court assembled and gazing off in the darkness
toward Merlin's Tower.  Already the darkness was so heavy that
one could not see far; these people and the old turrets, being
partly in deep shadow and partly in the red glow from the great
torch-baskets overhead, made a good deal of a picture.

Merlin arrived in a gloomy mood.  I said:

"You wanted to burn me alive when I had not done you any harm,
and latterly you have been trying to injure my professional
reputation.  Therefore I am going to call down fire and blow up
your tower, but it is only fair to give you a chance; now if you
think you can break my enchantments and ward off the fires, step
to the bat, it's your innings."

"I can, fair sir, and I will. Doubt it not."

He drew an imaginary circle on the stones of the roof, and burnt
a pinch of powder in it, which sent up a small cloud of aromatic
smoke, whereat everybody fell back and began to cross themselves
and get uncomfortable.  Then he began to mutter and make passes
in the air with his hands.  He worked himself up slowly and
gradually into a sort of frenzy, and got to thrashing around with
his arms like the sails of a windmill.  By this time the storm had
about reached us; the gusts of wind were flaring the torches and
making the shadows swash about, the first heavy drops of rain
were falling, the world abroad was black as pitch, the lightning
began to wink fitfully.  Of course, my rod would be loading itself
now.  In fact, things were imminent. So I said:

"You have had time enough.  I have given you every advantage,
and not interfered.  It is plain your magic is weak. It is only
fair that I begin now."

I made about three passes in the air, and then there was an awful
crash and that old tower leaped into the sky in chunks, along
with a vast volcanic fountain of fire that turned night to noonday,
and showed a thousand acres of human beings groveling on the ground
in a general collapse of consternation.  Well, it rained mortar and
masonry the rest of the week.  This was the report; but probably
the facts would have modified it.

It was an effective miracle.  The great bothersome temporary
population vanished.  There were a good many thousand tracks
in the mud the next morning, but they were all outward bound.
If I had advertised another miracle I couldn't have raised an
audience with a sheriff.

Merlin's stock was flat.  The king wanted to stop his wages; he
even wanted to banish him, but I interfered.  I said he would be
useful to work the weather, and attend to small matters like that,
and I would give him a lift now and then when his poor little
parlor-magic soured on him.  There wasn't a rag of his tower left,
but I had the government rebuild it for him, and advised him
to take boarders; but he was too high-toned for that.  And as for
being grateful, he never even said thank you.  He was a rather
hard lot, take him how you might; but then you couldn't fairly
expect a man to be sweet that had been set back so.



CHAPTER VIII

THE BOSS

To be vested with enormous authority is a fine thing; but to have
the on-looking world consent to it is a finer.  The tower episode
solidified my power, and made it impregnable.  If any were perchance
disposed to be jealous and critical before that, they experienced
a change of heart, now.  There was not any one in the kingdom
who would have considered it good judgment to meddle with my matters.

I was fast getting adjusted to my situation and circumstances.
For a time, I used to wake up, mornings, and smile at my "dream,"
and listen for the Colt's factory whistle; but that sort of thing
played itself out, gradually, and at last I was fully able to realize
that I was actually living in the sixth century, and in Arthur's
court, not a lunatic asylum.  After that, I was just as much
at home in that century as I could have been in any other; and
as for preference, I wouldn't have traded it for the twentieth.
Look at the opportunities here for a man of knowledge, brains,
pluck, and enterprise to sail in and grow up with the country.
The grandest field that ever was; and all my own; not a competitor;
not a man who wasn't a baby to me in acquirements and capacities;
whereas, what would I amount to in the twentieth century?  I should
be foreman of a factory, that is about all; and could drag a seine
down street any day and catch a hundred better men than myself.

What a jump I had made!  I couldn't keep from thinking about it,
and contemplating it, just as one does who has struck oil.  There
was nothing back of me that could approach it, unless it might be
Joseph's case; and Joseph's only approached it, it didn't equal
it, quite.  For it stands to reason that as Joseph's splendid
financial ingenuities advantaged nobody but the king, the general
public must have regarded him with a good deal of disfavor, whereas
I had done my entire public a kindness in sparing the sun, and was
popular by reason of it.

I was no shadow of a king; I was the substance; the king himself
was the shadow.  My power was colossal; and it was not a mere
name, as such things have generally been, it was the genuine
article.  I stood here, at the very spring and source of the second
great period of the world's history; and could see the trickling
stream of that history gather and deepen and broaden, and roll
its mighty tides down the far centuries; and I could note the
upspringing of adventurers like myself in the shelter of its long
array of thrones: De Montforts, Gavestons, Mortimers, Villierses;
the war-making, campaign-directing wantons of France, and Charles
the Second's scepter-wielding drabs; but nowhere in the procession
was my full-sized fellow visible.  I was a Unique; and glad to know
that that fact could not be dislodged or challenged for thirteen
centuries and a half, for sure.  Yes, in power I was equal to
the king.  At the same time there was another power that was
a trifle stronger than both of us put together.  That was the Church.
I do not wish to disguise that fact.  I couldn't, if I wanted to.
But never mind about that, now; it will show up, in its proper
place, later on.  It didn't cause me any trouble in the beginning
--at least any of consequence.

Well, it was a curious country, and full of interest.  And the
people!  They were the quaintest and simplest and trustingest race;
why, they were nothing but rabbits.  It was pitiful for a person
born in a wholesome free atmosphere to listen to their humble
and hearty outpourings of loyalty toward their king and Church
and nobility; as if they had any more occasion to love and honor
king and Church and noble than a slave has to love and honor
the lash, or a dog has to love and honor the stranger that kicks him!
Why, dear me, _any_ kind of royalty, howsoever modified, _any_ kind
of aristocracy, howsoever pruned, is rightly an insult; but if you
are born and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably
never find it out for yourself, and don't believe it when somebody
else tells you.  It is enough to make a body ashamed of his race
to think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones
without shadow of right or reason, and the seventh-rate people
that have always figured as its aristocracies--a company of monarchs
and nobles who, as a rule, would have achieved only poverty and
obscurity if left, like their betters, to their own exertions.

The most of King Arthur's British nation were slaves, pure and
simple, and bore that name, and wore the iron collar on their
necks; and the rest were slaves in fact, but without the name;
they imagined themselves men and freemen, and called themselves
so.  The truth was, the nation as a body was in the world for one
object, and one only: to grovel before king and Church and noble;
to slave for them, sweat blood for them, starve that they might
be fed, work that they might play, drink misery to the dregs that
they might be happy, go naked that they might wear silks and
jewels, pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them,
be familiar all their lives with the degrading language and postures
of adulation that they might walk in pride and think themselves
the gods of this world.  And for all this, the thanks they got were
cuffs and contempt; and so poor-spirited were they that they took
even this sort of attention as an honor.

Inherited ideas are a curious thing, and interesting to observe
and examine.  I had mine, the king and his people had theirs.
In both cases they flowed in ruts worn deep by time and habit,
and the man who should have proposed to divert them by reason
and argument would have had a long contract on his hands.  For
instance, those people had inherited the idea that all men without
title and a long pedigree, whether they had great natural gifts
and acquirements or hadn't, were creatures of no more consideration
than so many animals, bugs, insects; whereas I had inherited the idea
that human daws who can consent to masquerade in the peacock-shams
of inherited dignities and unearned titles, are of no good but
to be laughed at.  The way I was looked upon was odd, but it was
natural.  You know how the keeper and the public regard the elephant
in the menagerie: well, that is the idea.  They are full of
admiration of his vast bulk and his prodigious strength; they
speak with pride of the fact that he can do a hundred marvels
which are far and away beyond their own powers; and they speak
with the same pride of the fact that in his wrath he is able
to drive a thousand men before him.  But does that make him one
of _them_?  No; the raggedest tramp in the pit would smile at
the idea.  He couldn't comprehend it; couldn't take it in; couldn't
in any remote way conceive of it.  Well, to the king, the nobles,
and all the nation, down to the very slaves and tramps, I was
just that kind of an elephant, and nothing more.  I was admired,
also feared; but it was as an animal is admired and feared.
The animal is not reverenced, neither was I; I was not even
respected.  I had no pedigree, no inherited title; so in the king's
and nobles' eyes I was mere dirt; the people regarded me with
wonder and awe, but there was no reverence mixed with it; through
the force of inherited ideas they were not able to conceive of
anything being entitled to that except pedigree and lordship.
There you see the hand of that awful power, the Roman Catholic
Church.  In two or three little centuries it had converted a nation
of men to a nation of worms.  Before the day of the Church's
supremacy in the world, men were men, and held their heads up,
and had a man's pride and spirit and independence; and what
of greatness and position a person got, he got mainly by achievement,
not by birth.  But then the Church came to the front, with an axe
to grind; and she was wise, subtle, and knew more than one way
to skin a cat--or a nation; she invented "divine right of kings,"
and propped it all around, brick by brick, with the Beatitudes
--wrenching them from their good purpose to make them fortify
an evil one; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience
to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice; she preached (to the
commoner) meekness under insult; preached (still to the commoner,
always to the commoner) patience, meanness of spirit, non-resistance
under oppression; and she introduced heritable ranks and
aristocracies, and taught all the Christian populations of the earth
to bow down to them and worship them.  Even down to my birth-century
that poison was still in the blood of Christendom, and the best
of English commoners was still content to see his inferiors
impudently continuing to hold a number of positions, such as
lordships and the throne, to which the grotesque laws of his country
did not allow him to aspire; in fact, he was not merely contented
with this strange condition of things, he was even able to persuade
himself that he was proud of it.  It seems to show that there isn't
anything you can't stand, if you are only born and bred to it.
Of course that taint, that reverence for rank and title, had been
in our American blood, too--I know that; but when I left America
it had disappeared--at least to all intents and purposes.  The
remnant of it was restricted to the dudes and dudesses.  When
a disease has worked its way down to that level, it may fairly
be said to be out of the system.

But to return to my anomalous position in King Arthur's kingdom.
Here I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master
intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement
the one and only actually great man in that whole British world;
and yet there and then, just as in the remote England of my
birth-time, the sheep-witted earl who could claim long descent
from a king's leman, acquired at second-hand from the slums of
London, was a better man than I was.  Such a personage was fawned
upon in Arthur's realm and reverently looked up to by everybody,
even though his dispositions were as mean as his intelligence,
and his morals as base as his lineage.  There were times when
_he_ could sit down in the king's presence, but I couldn't.  I could
have got a title easily enough, and that would have raised me
a large step in everybody's eyes; even in the king's, the giver
of it.  But I didn't ask for it; and I declined it when it was
offered.  I couldn't have enjoyed such a thing with my notions;
and it wouldn't have been fair, anyway, because as far back as
I could go, our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister.
I couldn't have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proud
and set-up over any title except one that should come from the nation
itself, the only legitimate source; and such an one I hoped to win;
and in the course of years of honest and honorable endeavor, I did
win it and did wear it with a high and clean pride.  This title
fell casually from the lips of a blacksmith, one day, in a village,
was caught up as a happy thought and tossed from mouth to mouth
with a laugh and an affirmative vote; in ten days it had swept
the kingdom, and was become as familiar as the king's name.  I was
never known by any other designation afterward, whether in the
nation's talk or in grave debate upon matters of state at the
council-board of the sovereign.  This title, translated into modern
speech, would be THE BOSS.  Elected by the nation.  That suited me.
And it was a pretty high title.  There were very few THE'S, and
I was one of them.  If you spoke of the duke, or the earl, or
the bishop, how could anybody tell which one you meant?  But if
you spoke of The King or The Queen or The Boss, it was different.

Well, I liked the king, and as king I respected him--respected
the office; at least respected it as much as I was capable of
respecting any unearned supremacy; but as MEN I looked down upon
him and his nobles--privately.  And he and they liked me, and
respected my office; but as an animal, without birth or sham title,
they looked down upon me--and were not particularly private about it,
either.  I didn't charge for my opinion about them, and they didn't
charge for their opinion about me: the account was square, the
books balanced, everybody was satisfied.



CHAPTER IX

THE TOURNAMENT

They were always having grand tournaments there at Camelot; and
very stirring and picturesque and ridiculous human bull-fights
they were, too, but just a little wearisome to the practical mind.
However, I was generally on hand--for two reasons: a man must
not hold himself aloof from the things which his friends and his
community have at heart if he would be liked--especially as
a statesman; and both as business man and statesman I wanted
to study the tournament and see if I couldn't invent an improvement
on it.  That reminds me to remark, in passing, that the very first
official thing I did, in my administration--and it was on the very
first day of it, too--was to start a patent office; for I knew
that a country without a patent office and good patent laws was
just a crab, and couldn't travel any way but sideways or backways.

Things ran along, a tournament nearly every week; and now and then
the boys used to want me to take a hand--I mean Sir Launcelot and
the rest--but I said I would by and by; no hurry yet, and too much
government machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a-going.

We had one tournament which was continued from day to day during
more than a week, and as many as five hundred knights took part
in it, from first to last.  They were weeks gathering.  They came
on horseback from everywhere; from the very ends of the country,
and even from beyond the sea; and many brought ladies, and all
brought squires and troops of servants.  It was a most gaudy and
gorgeous crowd, as to costumery, and very characteristic of the
country and the time, in the way of high animal spirits, innocent
indecencies of language, and happy-hearted indifference to morals.
It was fight or look on, all day and every day; and sing, gamble,
dance, carouse half the night every night.  They had a most noble
good time.  You never saw such people.  Those banks of beautiful
ladies, shining in their barbaric splendors, would see a knight
sprawl from his horse in the lists with a lanceshaft the thickness
of your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting, and instead
of fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each other for a
better view; only sometimes one would dive into her handkerchief,
and look ostentatiously broken-hearted, and then you could lay
two to one that there was a scandal there somewhere and she was
afraid the public hadn't found it out.

The noise at night would have been annoying to me ordinarily, but
I didn't mind it in the present circumstances, because it kept me
from hearing the quacks detaching legs and arms from the day's
cripples.  They ruined an uncommon good old cross-cut saw for me,
and broke the saw-buck, too, but I let it pass.  And as for my
axe--well, I made up my mind that the next time I lent an axe
to a surgeon I would pick my century.

I not only watched this tournament from day to day, but detailed
an intelligent priest from my Department of Public Morals and
Agriculture, and ordered him to report it; for it was my purpose
by and by, when I should have gotten the people along far enough,
to start a newspaper.  The first thing you want in a new country,
is a patent office; then work up your school system; and after that,
out with your paper.  A newspaper has its faults, and plenty of them,
but no matter, it's hark from the tomb for a dead nation, and don't
you forget it.  You can't resurrect a dead nation without it; there
isn't any way.  So I wanted to sample things, and be finding out
what sort of reporter-material I might be able to rake together out
of the sixth century when I should come to need it.

Well, the priest did very well, considering.  He got in all
the details, and that is a good thing in a local item: you see,
he had kept books for the undertaker-department of his church
when he was younger, and there, you know, the money's in the details;
the more details, the more swag: bearers, mutes, candles, prayers
--everything counts; and if the bereaved don't buy prayers enough
you mark up your candles with a forked pencil, and your bill
shows up all right.  And he had a good knack at getting in the
complimentary thing here and there about a knight that was likely
to advertise--no, I mean a knight that had influence; and he also
had a neat gift of exaggeration, for in his time he had kept door
for a pious hermit who lived in a sty and worked miracles.

Of course this novice's report lacked whoop and crash and lurid
description, and therefore wanted the true ring; but its antique
wording was quaint and sweet and simple, and full of the fragrances
and flavors of the time, and these little merits made up in a measure
for its more important lacks.  Here is an extract from it:

  Then Sir Brian de les Isles and Grummore Grummorsum,
  knights of the castle, encountered with Sir Aglovale and
  Sir Tor, and Sir Tor smote down Sir Grummore Grummorsum
  to the earth.  Then came Sir Carados of the dolorous
  tower, and Sir Turquine, knights of the castle, and
  there encountered with them Sir Percivale de Galis
  and Sir Lamorak de Galis, that were two brethren, and
  there encountered Sir Percivale with Sir Carados, and
  either brake their spears unto their hands, and then
  Sir Turquine with Sir Lamorak, and either of them smote
  down other, horse and all, to the earth, and either
  parties rescued other and horsed them again.  And Sir
  Arnold, and Sir Gauter, knights of the castle,
  encountered with Sir Brandiles and Sir Kay, and these
  four knights encountered mightily, and brake their
  spears to their hands.  Then came Sir Pertolope from
  the castle, and there encountered with him Sir Lionel,
  and there Sir Pertolope the green knight smote down Sir
  Lionel, brother to Sir Launcelot.  All this was marked
  by noble heralds, who bare him best, and their names.
  Then Sir Bleobaris brake his spear upon Sir Gareth,
  but of that stroke Sir Bleobaris fell to the earth.
  When Sir Galihodin saw that, he bad Sir Gareth keep him,
  and Sir Gareth smote him to the earth.  Then Sir Galihud
  gat a spear to avenge his brother, and in the same wise
  Sir Gareth served him, and Sir Dinadan and his brother
  La Cote Male Taile, and Sir Sagramore le Disirous, and
  Sir Dodinas le Savage; all these he bare down with one
  spear.  When King Aswisance of Ireland saw Sir Gareth
  fare so he marvelled what he might be, that one time
  seemed green, and another time, at his again coming,
  he seemed blue.  And thus at every course that he rode
  to and fro he changed his color, so that there might
  neither king nor knight have ready cognizance of him.
  Then Sir Agwisance the King of Ireland encountered
  with Sir Gareth, and there Sir Gareth smote him from
  his horse, saddle and all.  And then came King Carados
  of Scotland, and Sir Gareth smote him down horse and
  man.  And in the same wise he served King Uriens of the
  land of Gore.  And then there came in Sir Bagdemagus,
  and Sir Gareth smote him down horse and man to the
  earth.  And Bagdemagus's son Meliganus brake a spear
  upon Sir Gareth mightily and knightly.  And then Sir
  Galahault the noble prince cried on high, Knight with
  the many colors, well hast thou justed; now make thee
  ready that I may just with thee.  Sir Gareth heard him,
  and he gat a great spear, and so they encountered
  together, and there the prince brake his spear; but Sir
  Gareth smote him upon the left side of the helm, that
  he reeled here and there, and he had fallen down had not
  his men recovered him.  Truly, said King Arthur, that
  knight with the many colors is a good knight.  Wherefore
  the king called unto him Sir Launcelot, and prayed him
  to encounter with that knight.  Sir, said Launcelot, I
  may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at
  this time, for he hath had travail enough this day, and
  when a good knight doth so well upon some day, it is
  no good knight's part to let him of his worship, and,
  namely, when he seeth a knight hath done so great
  labour; for peradventure, said Sir Launcelot, his
  quarrel is here this day, and peradventure he is best
  beloved with this lady of all that be here, for I see
  well he paineth himself and enforceth him to do great
  deeds, and therefore, said Sir Launcelot, as for me,
  this day he shall have the honour; though it lay in my
  power to put him from it, I would not.

There was an unpleasant little episode that day, which for reasons
of state I struck out of my priest's report.  You will have noticed
that Garry was doing some great fighting in the engagement.  When
I say Garry I mean Sir Gareth.  Garry was my private pet name
for him; it suggests that I had a deep affection for him, and that
was the case.  But it was a private pet name only, and never spoken
aloud to any one, much less to him; being a noble, he would not
have endured a familiarity like that from me.  Well, to proceed:
I sat in the private box set apart for me as the king's minister.
While Sir Dinadan was waiting for his turn to enter the lists,
he came in there and sat down and began to talk; for he was always
making up to me, because I was a stranger and he liked to have
a fresh market for his jokes, the most of them having reached that
stage of wear where the teller has to do the laughing himself while
the other person looks sick.  I had always responded to his efforts
as well as I could, and felt a very deep and real kindness for him,
too, for the reason that if by malice of fate he knew the one
particular anecdote which I had heard oftenest and had most hated
and most loathed all my life, he had at least spared it me.  It was
one which I had heard attributed to every humorous person who
had ever stood on American soil, from Columbus down to Artemus Ward.
It was about a humorous lecturer who flooded an ignorant audience
with the killingest jokes for an hour and never got a laugh; and
then when he was leaving, some gray simpletons wrung him gratefully
by the hand and said it had been the funniest thing they had ever
heard, and "it was all they could do to keep from laughin' right
out in meetin'."  That anecdote never saw the day that it was
worth the telling; and yet I had sat under the telling of it
hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of times, and
cried and cursed all the way through.  Then who can hope to know
what my feelings were, to hear this armor-plated ass start in on
it again, in the murky twilight of tradition, before the dawn of
history, while even Lactantius might be referred to as "the late
Lactantius," and the Crusades wouldn't be born for five hundred
years yet?  Just as he finished, the call-boy came; so, haw-hawing
like a demon, he went rattling and clanking out like a crate of
loose castings, and I knew nothing more.  It was some minutes
before I came to, and then I opened my eyes just in time to see
Sir Gareth fetch him an awful welt, and I unconsciously out with
the prayer, "I hope to gracious he's killed!"  But by ill-luck,
before I had got half through with the words, Sir Gareth crashed
into Sir Sagramor le Desirous and sent him thundering over his
horse's crupper, and Sir Sagramor caught my remark and thought
I meant it for _him_.

Well, whenever one of those people got a thing into his head,
there was no getting it out again.  I knew that, so I saved my
breath, and offered no explanations.  As soon as Sir Sagramor
got well, he notified me that there was a little account to settle
between us, and he named a day three or four years in the future;
place of settlement, the lists where the offense had been given.
I said I would be ready when he got back.  You see, he was going
for the Holy Grail.  The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail
now and then.  It was a several years' cruise.  They always put in
the long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way,
though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was,
and I don't think any of them actually expected to find it, or
would have known what to do with it if he _had_ run across it.
You see, it was just the Northwest Passage of that day, as you may
say; that was all.  Every year expeditions went out holy grailing,
and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for _them_.  There
was worlds of reputation in it, but no money.  Why, they actually
wanted _me_ to put in!  Well, I should smile.



CHAPTER X

BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION

The Round Table soon heard of the challenge, and of course it was
a good deal discussed, for such things interested the boys.
The king thought I ought now to set forth in quest of adventures,
so that I might gain renown and be the more worthy to meet
Sir Sagramor when the several years should have rolled away.
I excused myself for the present; I said it would take me three
or four years yet to get things well fixed up and going smoothly;
then I should be ready; all the chances were that at the end of
that time Sir Sagramor would still be out grailing, so no valuable
time would be lost by the postponement; I should then have been
in office six or seven years, and I believed my system and machinery
would be so well developed that I could take a holiday without
its working any harm.

I was pretty well satisfied with what I had already accomplished.
In various quiet nooks and corners I had the beginnings of all
sorts of industries under way--nuclei of future vast factories,
the iron and steel missionaries of my future civilization.  In these
were gathered together the brightest young minds I could find,
and I kept agents out raking the country for more, all the time.
I was training a crowd of ignorant folk into experts--experts
in every sort of handiwork and scientific calling.  These nurseries
of mine went smoothly and privately along undisturbed in their
obscure country retreats, for nobody was allowed to come into their
precincts without a special permit--for I was afraid of the Church.

I had started a teacher-factory and a lot of Sunday-schools the
first thing; as a result, I now had an admirable system of graded
schools in full blast in those places, and also a complete variety
of Protestant congregations all in a prosperous and growing
condition.  Everybody could be any kind of a Christian he wanted
to; there was perfect freedom in that matter.  But I confined public
religious teaching to the churches and the Sunday-schools, permitting
nothing of it in my other educational buildings.  I could have
given my own sect the preference and made everybody a Presbyterian
without any trouble, but that would have been to affront a law
of human nature: spiritual wants and instincts are as various in
the human family as are physical appetites, complexions, and
features, and a man is only at his best, morally, when he is
equipped with the religious garment whose color and shape and
size most nicely accommodate themselves to the spiritual complexion,
angularities, and stature of the individual who wears it; and,
besides, I was afraid of a united Church; it makes a mighty power,
the mightiest conceivable, and then when it by and by gets into
selfish hands, as it is always bound to do, it means death to
human liberty and paralysis to human thought.

All mines were royal property, and there were a good many of them.
They had formerly been worked as savages always work mines--holes
grubbed in the earth and the mineral brought up in sacks of hide by
hand, at the rate of a ton a day; but I had begun to put the mining
on a scientific basis as early as I could.

Yes, I had made pretty handsome progress when Sir Sagramor's
challenge struck me.

Four years rolled by--and then!  Well, you would never imagine
it in the world.  Unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in
safe hands.  The despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect
government.  An earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect
earthly government, if the conditions were the same, namely, the
despot the perfectest individual of the human race, and his lease
of life perpetual.  But as a perishable perfect man must die, and
leave his despotism in the hands of an imperfect successor, an
earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of government, it is
the worst form that is possible.

My works showed what a despot could do with the resources of
a kingdom at his command.  Unsuspected by this dark land, I had
the civilization of the nineteenth century booming under its very
nose!  It was fenced away from the public view, but there it was,
a gigantic and unassailable fact--and to be heard from, yet, if
I lived and had luck.  There it was, as sure a fact and as substantial
a fact as any serene volcano, standing innocent with its smokeless
summit in the blue sky and giving no sign of the rising hell in its
bowels.  My schools and churches were children four years before;
they were grown-up now; my shops of that day were vast factories
now; where I had a dozen trained men then, I had a thousand now;
where I had one brilliant expert then, I had fifty now.  I stood
with my hand on the cock, so to speak, ready to turn it on and
flood the midnight world with light at any moment.  But I was not
going to do the thing in that sudden way.  It was not my policy.
The people could not have stood it; and, moreover, I should have
had the Established Roman Catholic Church on my back in a minute.

No, I had been going cautiously all the while.  I had had confidential
agents trickling through the country some time, whose office was
to undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees, and to gnaw
a little at this and that and the other superstition, and so prepare
the way gradually for a better order of things.  I was turning on
my light one-candle-power at a time, and meant to continue to do so.

I had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom,
and they were doing very well.  I meant to work this racket more
and more, as time wore on, if nothing occurred to frighten me.
One of my deepest secrets was my West Point--my military academy.
I kept that most jealously out of sight; and I did the same with my
naval academy which I had established at a remote seaport.  Both
were prospering to my satisfaction.

Clarence was twenty-two now, and was my head executive, my right
hand.  He was a darling; he was equal to anything; there wasn't
anything he couldn't turn his hand to.  Of late I had been training
him for journalism, for the time seemed about right for a start
in the newspaper line; nothing big, but just a small weekly for
experimental circulation in my civilization-nurseries.  He took
to it like a duck; there was an editor concealed in him, sure.
Already he had doubled himself in one way; he talked sixth century
and wrote nineteenth.  His journalistic style was climbing,
steadily; it was already up to the back settlement Alabama mark,
and couldn't be told from the editorial output of that region
either by matter or flavor.

We had another large departure on hand, too.  This was a telegraph
and a telephone; our first venture in this line.  These wires were
for private service only, as yet, and must be kept private until
a riper day should come.  We had a gang of men on the road, working
mainly by night.  They were stringing ground wires; we were afraid
to put up poles, for they would attract too much inquiry.  Ground
wires were good enough, in both instances, for my wires were
protected by an insulation of my own invention which was perfect.
My men had orders to strike across country, avoiding roads, and
establishing connection with any considerable towns whose lights
betrayed their presence, and leaving experts in charge. Nobody
could tell you how to find any place in the kingdom, for nobody
ever went intentionally to any place, but only struck it by
accident in his wanderings, and then generally left it without
thinking to inquire what its name was.  At one time and another
we had sent out topographical expeditions to survey and map the
kingdom, but the priests had always interfered and raised trouble.
So we had given the thing up, for the present; it would be poor
wisdom to antagonize the Church.

As for the general condition of the country, it was as it had been
when I arrived in it, to all intents and purposes.  I had made
changes, but they were necessarily slight, and they were not
noticeable.  Thus far, I had not even meddled with taxation,
outside of the taxes which provided the royal revenues.  I had
systematized those, and put the service on an effective and
righteous basis.  As a result, these revenues were already quadrupled,
and yet the burden was so much more equably distributed than
before, that all the kingdom felt a sense of relief, and the praises
of my administration were hearty and general.

Personally, I struck an interruption, now, but I did not mind it,
it could not have happened at a better time.  Earlier it could
have annoyed me, but now everything was in good hands and swimming
right along.  The king had reminded me several times, of late, that
the postponement I had asked for, four years before, had about
run out now.  It was a hint that I ought to be starting out to seek
adventures and get up a reputation of a size to make me worthy
of the honor of breaking a lance with Sir Sagramor, who was still
out grailing, but was being hunted for by various relief expeditions,
and might be found any year, now.  So you see I was expecting
this interruption; it did not take me by surprise.



CHAPTER XI

THE YANKEE IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURES

There never was such a country for wandering liars; and they were
of both sexes.  Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps
arriving; and generally loaded with a tale about some princess or
other wanting help to get her out of some far-away castle where
she was held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel, usually a giant.
Now you would think that the first thing the king would do after
listening to such a novelette from an entire stranger, would be
to ask for credentials--yes, and a pointer or two as to locality
of castle, best route to it, and so on.  But nobody ever thought
of so simple and common-sense a thing at that.  No, everybody
swallowed these people's lies whole, and never asked a question
of any sort or about anything.  Well, one day when I was not
around, one of these people came along--it was a she one, this
time--and told a tale of the usual pattern.  Her mistress was
a captive in a vast and gloomy castle, along with forty-four other
young and beautiful girls, pretty much all of them princesses;
they had been languishing in that cruel captivity for twenty-six
years; the masters of the castle were three stupendous brothers,
each with four arms and one eye--the eye in the center of the
forehead, and as big as a fruit.  Sort of fruit not mentioned;
their usual slovenliness in statistics.

Would you believe it?  The king and the whole Round Table were
in raptures over this preposterous opportunity for adventure.
Every knight of the Table jumped for the chance, and begged for it;
but to their vexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me,
who had not asked for it at all.

By an effort, I contained my joy when Clarence brought me the news.
But he--he could not contain his.  His mouth gushed delight and
gratitude in a steady discharge--delight in my good fortune,
gratitude to the king for this splendid mark of his favor for me.
He could keep neither his legs nor his body still, but pirouetted
about the place in an airy ecstasy of happiness.

On my side, I could have cursed the kindness that conferred upon
me this benefaction, but I kept my vexation under the surface
for policy's sake, and did what I could to let on to be glad.
Indeed, I _said_ I was glad.  And in a way it was true; I was as
glad as a person is when he is scalped.

Well, one must make the best of things, and not waste time with
useless fretting, but get down to business and see what can be
done.  In all lies there is wheat among the chaff; I must get at
the wheat in this case: so I sent for the girl and she came.  She
was a comely enough creature, and soft and modest, but, if signs
went for anything, she didn't know as much as a lady's watch.  I said:

"My dear, have you been questioned as to particulars?"

She said she hadn't.

"Well, I didn't expect you had, but I thought I would ask, to make
sure; it's the way I've been raised.  Now you mustn't take it
unkindly if I remind you that as we don't know you, we must go
a little slow.  You may be all right, of course, and we'll hope
that you are; but to take it for granted isn't business.  _You_
understand that.  I'm obliged to ask you a few questions; just
answer up fair and square, and don't be afraid.  Where do you
live, when you are at home?"

"In the land of Moder, fair sir."

"Land of Moder.  I don't remember hearing of it before.
Parents living?"

"As to that, I know not if they be yet on live, sith it is many
years that I have lain shut up in the castle."

"Your name, please?"

"I hight the Demoiselle Alisande la Carteloise, an it please you."

"Do you know anybody here who can identify you?"

"That were not likely, fair lord, I being come hither now for
the first time."

"Have you brought any letters--any documents--any proofs that
you are trustworthy and truthful?"

"Of a surety, no; and wherefore should I?  Have I not a tongue,
and cannot I say all that myself?"

"But _your_ saying it, you know, and somebody else's saying it,
is different."

"Different?  How might that be?  I fear me I do not understand."

"Don't _understand_?  Land of--why, you see--you see--why, great Scott,
can't you understand a little thing like that?  Can't you understand
the difference between your--_why_ do you look so innocent and idiotic!"

"I?  In truth I know not, but an it were the will of God."

"Yes, yes, I reckon that's about the size of it.  Don't mind my
seeming excited; I'm not.  Let us change the subject.  Now as
to this castle, with forty-five princesses in it, and three ogres
at the head of it, tell me--where is this harem?"

"Harem?"

"The _castle_, you understand; where is the castle?"

"Oh, as to that, it is great, and strong, and well beseen, and
lieth in a far country.  Yes, it is many leagues."

"_How_ many?"

"Ah, fair sir, it were woundily hard to tell, they are so many,
and do so lap the one upon the other, and being made all in the
same image and tincted with the same color, one may not know
the one league from its fellow, nor how to count them except
they be taken apart, and ye wit well it were God's work to do
that, being not within man's capacity; for ye will note--"

"Hold on, hold on, never mind about the distance; _whereabouts_
does the castle lie?  What's the direction from here?"

"Ah, please you sir, it hath no direction from here; by reason
that the road lieth not straight, but turneth evermore; wherefore
the direction of its place abideth not, but is some time under
the one sky and anon under another, whereso if ye be minded that
it is in the east, and wend thitherward, ye shall observe that
the way of the road doth yet again turn upon itself by the space
of half a circle, and this marvel happing again and yet again and
still again, it will grieve you that you had thought by vanities
of the mind to thwart and bring to naught the will of Him that
giveth not a castle a direction from a place except it pleaseth
Him, and if it please Him not, will the rather that even all castles
and all directions thereunto vanish out of the earth, leaving the
places wherein they tarried desolate and vacant, so warning His
creatures that where He will He will, and where He will not He--"

"Oh, that's all right, that's all right, give us a rest; never mind
about the direction, _hang_ the direction--I beg pardon, I beg
a thousand pardons, I am not well to-day; pay no attention when
I soliloquize, it is an old habit, an old, bad habit, and hard
to get rid of when one's digestion is all disordered with eating
food that was raised forever and ever before he was born; good
land! a man can't keep his functions regular on spring chickens
thirteen hundred years old.  But come--never mind about that;
let's--have you got such a thing as a map of that region about
you?  Now a good map--"

"Is it peradventure that manner of thing which of late the unbelievers
have brought from over the great seas, which, being boiled in oil,
and an onion and salt added thereto, doth--"

"What, a map?  What are you talking about?  Don't you know what
a map is?  There, there, never mind, don't explain, I hate
explanations; they fog a thing up so that you can't tell anything
about it.  Run along, dear; good-day; show her the way, Clarence."

Oh, well, it was reasonably plain, now, why these donkeys didn't
prospect these liars for details.  It may be that this girl had
a fact in her somewhere, but I don't believe you could have sluiced
it out with a hydraulic; nor got it with the earlier forms of
blasting, even; it was a case for dynamite.  Why, she was a perfect
ass; and yet the king and his knights had listened to her as if
she had been a leaf out of the gospel.  It kind of sizes up the
whole party.  And think of the simple ways of this court: this
wandering wench hadn't any more trouble to get access to the king
in his palace than she would have had to get into the poorhouse
in my day and country.  In fact, he was glad to see her, glad
to hear her tale; with that adventure of hers to offer, she was
as welcome as a corpse is to a coroner.

Just as I was ending-up these reflections, Clarence came back.
I remarked upon the barren result of my efforts with the girl;
hadn't got hold of a single point that could help me to find
the castle.  The youth looked a little surprised, or puzzled,
or something, and intimated that he had been wondering to himself
what I had wanted to ask the girl all those questions for.

"Why, great guns," I said, "don't I want to find the castle?  And
how else would I go about it?"

"La, sweet your worship, one may lightly answer that, I ween.
She will go with thee.  They always do.  She will ride with thee."

"Ride with me?  Nonsense!"

"But of a truth she will.  She will ride with thee.  Thou shalt see."

"What?  She browse around the hills and scour the woods with me
--alone--and I as good as engaged to be married?  Why, it's scandalous.
Think how it would look."

My, the dear face that rose before me!  The boy was eager to know
all about this tender matter.  I swore him to secrecy and then
whispered her name--"Puss Flanagan."  He looked disappointed,
and said he didn't remember the countess.  How natural it was for
the little courtier to give her a rank.  He asked me where she lived.

"In East Har--" I came to myself and stopped, a little confused;
then I said, "Never mind, now; I'll tell you some time."

And might he see her?  Would I let him see her some day?

It was but a little thing to promise--thirteen hundred years
or so--and he so eager; so I said Yes.  But I sighed; I couldn't
help it.  And yet there was no sense in sighing, for she wasn't
born yet.  But that is the way we are made: we don't reason,
where we feel; we just feel.

My expedition was all the talk that day and that night, and the
boys were very good to me, and made much of me, and seemed to have
forgotten their vexation and disappointment, and come to be as
anxious for me to hive those ogres and set those ripe old virgins
loose as if it were themselves that had the contract.  Well, they
_were_ good children--but just children, that is all.  And they
gave me no end of points about how to scout for giants, and how
to scoop them in; and they told me all sorts of charms against
enchantments, and gave me salves and other rubbish to put on my
wounds.  But it never occurred to one of them to reflect that if
I was such a wonderful necromancer as I was pretending to be,
I ought not to need salves or instructions, or charms against
enchantments, and, least of all, arms and armor, on a foray of any
kind--even against fire-spouting dragons, and devils hot from
perdition, let alone such poor adversaries as these I was after,
these commonplace ogres of the back settlements.

I was to have an early breakfast, and start at dawn, for that was
the usual way; but I had the demon's own time with my armor,
and this delayed me a little.  It is troublesome to get into, and
there is so much detail.  First you wrap a layer or two of blanket
around your body, for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold
iron; then you put on your sleeves and shirt of chain mail--these
are made of small steel links woven together, and they form a fabric
so flexible that if you toss your shirt onto the floor, it slumps
into a pile like a peck of wet fish-net; it is very heavy and
is nearly the uncomfortablest material in the world for a night
shirt, yet plenty used it for that--tax collectors, and reformers,
and one-horse kings with a defective title, and those sorts of
people; then you put on your shoes--flat-boats roofed over with
interleaving bands of steel--and screw your clumsy spurs into
the heels.  Next you buckle your greaves on your legs, and your
cuisses on your thighs; then come your backplate and your breastplate,
and you begin to feel crowded; then you hitch onto the breastplate
the half-petticoat of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs
down in front but is scolloped out behind so you can sit down,
and isn't any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle, either
for looks or for wear, or to wipe your hands on; next you belt
on your sword; then you put your stove-pipe joints onto your arms,
your iron gauntlets onto your hands, your iron rat-trap onto your
head, with a rag of steel web hitched onto it to hang over the back
of your neck--and there you are, snug as a candle in a candle-mould.
This is no time to dance.  Well, a man that is packed away like
that is a nut that isn't worth the cracking, there is so little of
the meat, when you get down to it, by comparison with the shell.

The boys helped me, or I never could have got in.  Just as we
finished, Sir Bedivere happened in, and I saw that as like as not
I hadn't chosen the most convenient outfit for a long trip.  How
stately he looked; and tall and broad and grand.  He had on his
head a conical steel casque that only came down to his ears, and
for visor had only a narrow steel bar that extended down to his
upper lip and protected his nose; and all the rest of him, from
neck to heel, was flexible chain mail, trousers and all.  But
pretty much all of him was hidden under his outside garment, which
of course was of chain mail, as I said, and hung straight from his
shoulders to his ankles; and from his middle to the bottom, both
before and behind, was divided, so that he could ride and let the
skirts hang down on each side.  He was going grailing, and it was
just the outfit for it, too.  I would have given a good deal for
that ulster, but it was too late now to be fooling around.  The sun
was just up, the king and the court were all on hand to see me off
and wish me luck; so it wouldn't be etiquette for me to tarry.
You don't get on your horse yourself; no, if you tried it you
would get disappointed.  They carry you out, just as they carry
a sun-struck man to the drug store, and put you on, and help get
you to rights, and fix your feet in the stirrups; and all the while
you do feel so strange and stuffy and like somebody else--like
somebody that has been married on a sudden, or struck by lightning,
or something like that, and hasn't quite fetched around yet, and
is sort of numb, and can't just get his bearings.  Then they
stood up the mast they called a spear, in its socket by my left
foot, and I gripped it with my hand; lastly they hung my shield
around my neck, and I was all complete and ready to up anchor
and get to sea.  Everybody was as good to me as they could be,
and a maid of honor gave me the stirrup-cup her own self.  There was
nothing more to do now, but for that damsel to get up behind me on
a pillion, which she did, and put an arm or so around me to hold on.

And so we started, and everybody gave us a goodbye and waved their
handkerchiefs or helmets.  And everybody we met, going down the hill
and through the village was respectful to us, except some shabby
little boys on the outskirts.  They said:

"Oh, what a guy!"  And hove clods at us.

In my experience boys are the same in all ages.  They don't respect
anything, they don't care for anything or anybody.  They say
"Go up, baldhead" to the prophet going his unoffending way in
the gray of antiquity; they sass me in the holy gloom of the
Middle Ages; and I had seen them act the same way in Buchanan's
administration; I remember, because I was there and helped.  The
prophet had his bears and settled with his boys; and I wanted
to get down and settle with mine, but it wouldn't answer, because
I couldn't have got up again.  I hate a country without a derrick.
